But there\u2019s no need to be scared of spuds or ban bananas. We\u2019re setting the record straight-dig in guilt-free!\n\nCorn\n\nCorn gets a bad rap because it\u2019s frequently found in packaged, processed food that can be void of nutrients. But real, straight-up corn is a healthy whole grain, points out Jessica Levinson, RD, a New York City-based nutritionist. \u201cIt\u2019s a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which promote healthy vision,\u201d she says. Grill corn on the cob, heat up popcorn or top a salad with fresh kernels.\n\nHealth.com: 11 Reasons Why You\u2019re Not Losing Belly Fat\n\nBananas\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

And when slightly unripe, bananas are also a good source of slimming resistant starch. Snack on them whole, pop them into smoothies, or even use them as a substitution for fats in baking.\n\nBreakfast cereal\n\nThere\u2019s no need to shun a bowlful of flakes. Many cereals are made with whole grains these days, so they can be a healthy way to start your day. Just check the label: Look for a short ingredients list with whole grains at the top and at least 3 grams of fiber and no more than 10 grams of sugar per serving.\n\nHealth.com: Best Superfoods for Weight Loss\n\nWhite potatoes\n\nWe know we\u2019re supposed to limit white bread, white rice and white pasta. Somehow potatoes got swept up in that ban, too. \u201cWhite potatoes are actually very good for you,\u201d says Christian Henderson, RD, a New York City-based nutritionist. \u201cThey\u2019re a great source of potassium and vitamin C, and they have almost 4 grams of fiber with the skin on-15 percent of your recommended daily allowance.\u201d As an alternative to the classic sour cream-slathered baked potato, try cutting potatoes into cubes, tossing them with olive oil and rosemary, and roasting until crisp.\n\nHealth.com: Fat-Burning Recipe: Chicken Pita Sandwich\n\nSourdough Bread\n\nYou don\u2019t always have to pick whole wheat. Traditional sourdough is made through a process of fermentation, so it contains beneficial bacteria known as probiotics. \u201cWhen these good bacteria are present in the bread-making process they help break down some of the gluten, so sourdough may actually be easier on gluten intolerant people than other gluten-containing breads,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cThey also lower your insulin response and make some nutrients more readily available for digestion.\u201d\n\nHealth.com: The Best Snacks for Weight Loss\n\nGreen peas\n\nSure, they\u2019re higher in carbs and sugar than non-starchy vegetables-they\u2019re even on some low carb diets\u2019 \u201cfoods to avoid\u201d lists. \u201cBut peas are a great source of phytonutrients with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity,\u201d Henderson says. One in the spotlight is coumestrol, which has been shown to potentially protect against stomach cancer, Henderson adds. A cup of cooked green peas also boasts more than 7 grams of filling fiber. Eat them straight up or in soups or salads, or add dried peas to a trail mix.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Health.com.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Thanks to popular low-carb diets, these carb-heavy healthy foods have been unfairly blacklisted.
