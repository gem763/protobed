At the time, Harry said the way newspapers were treating his American-born wife was reminiscent of their approach to his mother, Princess Diana.\n\nThe couple, who have a five-month-old baby, spoke of the pressure of intense media attention in a recent documentary.\n\nMarkle, a former actress, said British friends had warned her about tabloid newspapers when she had first met Harry.\n\n\"I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, and that is the part that is really hard to reconcile,\" she said.\n\nLawmaker Holly Lynch organised and published the letter, which was signed by 71 of her Member of Parliament (MP) colleagues.\n\n\"As women MPs of all political persuasions, we wanted to express our solidarity with you in taking a stand against the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories printed in a number of our national newspapers concerning you, your character and your family,\" the letter said.\n\n\"On occasions, stories and headlines have represented an invasion of your privacy and have sought to cast aspersions about your character without any good reason as far as we can see,\" they said.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/HollyLynch5/status/1189175248035483648?s=20\n\nSome of the coverage had \"what could only be described as outdated, colonial undertones\", which could not be allowed to go unchallenged, the lawmakers added.\n\nThey said that although they had a very different role, they shared an understanding of the \"abuse and intimidation\" that were often used to disparage women in public office.\n\nMarkle has launched proceedings against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over the publication of a private letter that her lawyers said was unlawful and part of a \"campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has denied the accusation.", "description": "\"We wanted to express our solidarity with you in taking a stand against the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories,\" the letter said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4269438/1000x563_nbc-191030-meghan-markle-mc-953_13e7fb24abbfe075addf5cc817495870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
