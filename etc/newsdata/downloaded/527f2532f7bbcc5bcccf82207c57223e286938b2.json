(Whether or not they get there is another question.) While a self-contained \"serve\" of fruit is pretty easy to work out, what about veggies?\n\nA recent national survey reported 45% of Australian women and 56% of Australian men didn\u2019t eat enough fruit. And 90% of women and 96% of men didn\u2019t eat enough vegetables. This figure is worse than for the preceding ten years.\n\nMen had on average 1.6 serves of fruit and 2.3 serves of vegetables per day, and women had 1.8 serves of fruit and 2.5 serves of vegetables. A serve of fresh fruit is a medium piece (about 150 grams) and a serve of vegetables is half a cup of cooked vegetables or about a cup of salad.\n\nThe Conversation/Australian Dietary Guidelines, 2013, CC BY-ND\n\nWhy do we need so many veggies?\n\nA high intake of fruit and vegetables lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and some cancers. These chronic diseases are unfortunately common \u2013 it\u2019s been estimated A$269 million could have been saved in 2008 if everyone in Australia met fruit and vegetable recommendations.\n\nThe recommendation to include plenty of vegetables and fruit in our diet is based on a large body of evidence showing the risk of a range of health conditions is reduced as we eat more fruit and vegetables. The specific targets of two serves for fruit and five to six serves for vegetables are largely based on nutrient requirements for healthy people and what diets usually look like for the average Australian.\n\nSo to set these guidelines, certain assumptions are made about dietary practices, such as breakfast being based around cereal/grain and dairy foods, and main meals being comprised of meat and vegetables, usually with a side of something starchy like rice, pasta or the humble potato \u2013 an Australian staple.\n\nDoes this mean it\u2019s the only pattern to meet all the nutrient requirements? No. Could an adult be equally healthy if they ate three serves of fruit and four serves of vegetables? Yes, probably.\n\nSome recent research even suggests our current targets don\u2019t go far enough. It estimates an optimal intake for reducing our risk of heart disease and early death to be around ten serves of fruit and vegetables a day. Whether we are aiming for two and five, or ten serves, is somewhat academic \u2013 the clear message is most of us need to increase our fruit and vegetable intake.", "description": "Most Australian adults would know they\u2019re meant to eat two or more serves of fruit and five or more serves of vegetables every day.
