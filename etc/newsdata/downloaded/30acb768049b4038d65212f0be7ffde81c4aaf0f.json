The right answer on such occasions is to opt for the local currency \u2013 always.\n\nThis avoids you facing double exchange charges. But the wording used by the banks abroad does not make it easy.\n\nIf you are in Spain, for example, the screen will present two options: \u2018yes for British pounds\u2019 and \u2018no for euros\u2019.\n\nSince \u2018no\u2019 feels negative \u2013 and you are more familiar with your home currency \u2013 the natural response is to press \u2018yes\u2019. But this is the wrong decision and can end with a customer typically paying 6 per cent (sometimes 12 per cent) more in conversion charges, according to research by TransferWise.\n\nIndustry body UK Finance calculates that this so-called \u2018dynamic currency conversion\u2019 costs British tourists abroad more than \u00a31million a day.\n\nBut there are plenty of other confusing phrases to beware of. If you see \u2018continue with conversion\u2019 and \u2018continue without conversion\u2019 \u2013 choose the latter. Presented with \u2018debit in your home currency, or debit in the local currency\u2019 \u2013 choose \u2018local currency\u2019.\n\nAnd if you are offered \u2018let us convert the money for you \u2013 yes or no\u2019 \u2013 just say \u2018no\u2019.\n\nTransferWise chief executive Kristo Kaarmann developed the new feature which flashes up a message \u2018Remember to pay in the local currency\u2019 \u2013 and includes a calculation on how much you would have saved had you made the correct choice.\n\nHe says: \u2018There\u2019s no regulation currently banning this, so I developed the feature to help prevent customers getting ripped off.\u2019", "description": "Many families travelling abroad this half term will have fallen into a common currency trap that costs British holidaymakers a fortune every day.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
