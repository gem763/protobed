In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.42% in early trade while the Topix gained 0.65%. Shares of airliner ANA, however, fell more than 1% following a Nikkei report that the firm is expected to report a more than 20% drop in profit. South Korea's Kospi also added 0.31%. Meanwhile, the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose about 0.2%, with the sectors trading mixed. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index traded 0.12% higher.\n\nInvestors will continue to watch for developments in U.S.-China trade. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Monday that Washington will consider extending certain tariff exclusions on $34 billion worth of imports from China. The USTR said last week that China and the U.S. are close to finalizing a phase one deal. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump said the deal with China is expected to be signed \"ahead of schedule,\" but did not elaborate on the timing. \"The two sides have seemingly reached consensus in areas including standards used by agricultural regulators, but is probably worth noting that so far neither party has officially said anything about the contentious issue surrounding China's demand for a pullback on US Tariffs,\" Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 scaled a record high as investors stateside cheered strong earnings and optimism on U.S.-China trade. The S&P 500 added 0.6% to close at 3,039.42 \u2014 above its previous record set on July 26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 132.66 points to end its trading day at 27,090.72 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1% to close at 8,325.99.
