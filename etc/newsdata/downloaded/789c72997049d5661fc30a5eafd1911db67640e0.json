The decision will be taken later,\" she told reporters at her residence in New Delhi on Sunday, adding that there was no plan to cut spending currently.\n\nSitharaman also said the government would decide on additional market borrowings for the second half of 2019/20 later.\n\nRatings firm S&P Global said on Friday India's move to cut corporate tax rates was a \"credit negative development\" despite potentially boosting the economy as it will widen its fiscal deficit.\n\nGovernment sources told Reuters this month that India is likely to miss its fiscal deficit target for the current financial year and, toward the end of 2019, be forced to raise it to 3.5% of GDP from 3.3% after economic growth fell to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter.", "description": "India says no plans to revise fiscal deficit target or cut spending now", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8L0DE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
