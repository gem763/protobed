But even in Hollywood, the story of The Irishman set new standards for a slow-burner. Robert De Niro first read Charles Brandt\u2019s book soon after it was published in 2004. He was convinced this tale of what really happened to Jimmy Hoffa, the notorious trade union leader who disappeared without trace in 1975, was ripe for the big screen.\n\n\u2018I read it and thought this story is great,\u2019 said De Niro, quickly alerting his long-time collaborator Martin Scorsese, the director with whom he made Goodfellas and Casino. Scorsese agreed this was something they both had to do. Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel were soon brought on board. Yet even with the prospect of such a cast, with Scorsese at the helm, for a decade and a half nothing has appeared on our screens. As scripts were written and then rejected, as finance was promised then withdrawn, as other projects intervened, it took a full 15 years to come to fruition.\n\nRobert De Niro as The Irishman. The film tells the story of Frank Sheeran (played by De Niro), an underworld enforcer of brutal repute known as The Irishman, and his connection to the notorious Hoffa (played by Al Pacino)\n\nAl Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa with Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran. Hoffa\u2019s corruption came to the attention of the law but, with help from The Irishman, he managed to evade prison for years\n\nFinally, after a marathon process involving 108 shooting days in 117 locations, after consuming a budget north of \u00a3115 million that uses state-of-the-art technology to make the ageing stars look decades younger, The Irishman is to be released next month. This is a movie that gets under the skin of its main protagonist, thanks largely to a performance as good as any De Niro has delivered in 25 years.\n\nIt tells the story of Frank Sheeran (played by De Niro), an underworld enforcer of brutal repute known as The Irishman, and his connection to the notorious Hoffa (played by Al Pacino). Towards the end of his life, Sheeran decided to confess all to Brandt. He spoke on one proviso: none of it was to be published before his death.\n\nThe story begins when Sheeran, a muscular young New Yorker, whose father would routinely coerce him into street brawls in order to win bets, joined up to fight in World War II. He saw a staggering 411 days of action, leaving a trail of destruction across Europe, killing, womanising and looting as he went. He returned to civilian life seriously damaged, his moral compass skewed beyond recovery. Soon his lack of qualms about employing maximum violence brought him to the attention of the Mob. He may not have been Italian, but Mafia bosses had uses for men like The Irishman.\n\nSo Sheeran began to do business with a collection of wise guys with magnificent names like Joey \u2018The Clown\u2019 Lombardo and Harry \u2018The Hunchback\u2019 Riccobene. His biggest contact, however, was Russell Bufalino (played by Joe Pesci in the movie). Bufalino came to rely on Sheeran\u2019s quick, clean and above all untraceable way of dealing with problems. In the euphemisms of the Mob, The Irishman was the best there was at \u2018delivering a message\u2019. So much so that when a highly placed political connection of Bufalino\u2019s needed some assistance, there was only one man for the job.\n\nThe first thing Hoffa, president of the union the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said to Sheeran was: \u2018I heard you paint houses.\u2019 In gangster terminology, this referred to redecorating the homes of enemies in their own blood. \u2018Yes,\u2019 replied Sheeran. \u2018And I do a bit of carpentry.\u2019 Meaning he cleared up too.\n\nJoe Pesci as Russell Bufalino. For the scenes in which they played younger men, the actors performed with electrodes attached to their faces and were \u2018de-aged\u2019 using CGI\n\nA funeral scene from the film. There were several moments in the process of turning the book into a movie that made De Niro despair it would ever come about\n\nSo it was that Hoffa began to rely on Sheeran too, ordering him to bump off anyone who threatened his position. Hoffa\u2019s corruption came to the attention of the law but, with help from The Irishman, he managed to evade prison for years. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy became obsessed with convicting him, even establishing a section of the FBI dubbed \u2018The Get Hoffa Squad\u2019. And when John F Kennedy was assassinated, Bobby suspected Hoffa was involved in his brother\u2019s killing (a theory that is substantiated by Sheeran\u2019s confession to Brandt).\n\nThe FBI did, eventually, manage to bring down Hoffa, finding him guilty of jury tampering and fraud. In 1967 he began a 13-year sentence but he was pardoned by incoming President Richard Nixon in 1971 and released on the condition that he would stand down from his union post. Being Hoffa, he soon announced his intention to run again for his old job, on a policy of taking back control from criminal elements. This didn\u2019t sit well with the Mafia, and The Irishman was called in.\n\nThough Hoffa\u2019s body was never found, nine Mob members on a suspect shortlist were imprisoned for various misdemeanors, Sheeran being one of them. His confession to Brandt, which he witheld throughout his incarceration, was made public after his death in 2003.\n\nThere were several moments in the process of turning the book into a movie that made De Niro despair it would ever come about. In 2013, for instance, the full cast assembled for a read-through that, according to someone who was there, \u2018sent shivers down the spine\u2019. But even that did not switch on the green light. \u2018Afterwards,\u2019 De Niro recalled of the read-through, \u2018I was worried the tape was all we would ever have of this project.\u2019\n\nBut the most significant obstacle was adapting the book\u2019s lengthy timespan. We first encounter Sheeran when he is just 24; De Niro and Pesci are 76, and Pacino is 79. Initially, Scorsese decided to recruit age-appropriate lookalike actors. But since most of the action takes place when the characters are in their 40s, that approach would have robbed the stars of their meaty roles. Then, in 2015, Scorsese learned of a new technology that he dubbed \u2018youthification.\u2019 The actors perform scenes with electrodes attached to their face, which, after a CGI tinker, enables the years to fall away in the editing process. The effect is miraculous.\n\nBut the faces can\u2019t tell the whole story and the actors were also obliged to move as if they were young again. As Pacino admitted, this was not always easy. \u2018I had to be taken to hospital afterwards,\u2019 he said of a scene in which his character runs up a flight of stairs.\n\nBut whatever the temporary pain, the result is extraordinary. The Irishman is a tapestry of politics, crime and corruption that can only be described as epic.\n\n\u2018The Irishman\u2019 is released in cinemas on November 1 and on Netflix on November 27. The film tie-in edition of Charles Brandt\u2019s \u2018I Heard You Paint Houses\u2019, \u2018The Irishman\u2019, is published by Hodder & Stoughton on October 31, priced \u00a39.99", "description": "For much of its existence, the movie industry has moved with the speed of an Alpine glacier.
