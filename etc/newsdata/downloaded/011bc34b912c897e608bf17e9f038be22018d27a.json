But Trump and his defenders in the GOP, FoxWorld, and conservative circles are trying to repeat the move he staged in the Russia scandal and claim this is no biggie because the memo does not depict Trump explicitly engaged in criminal activity. Don\u2019t buy this baloney.\n\nThroughout the Trump-Russia scandal, the president and his cultists have insisted that he did no wrong because there was no direct collusion between him and the Russian operatives who hacked his Democratic opponents and used WikiLeaks to disseminate the purloined documents. That was the standard that Trump set via his tweets and tantrums: no collusion, nothing to see. And he mostly succeeded with this tactic. When special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s final report concluded that Trump had not been part of the criminal conspiracy waged by Russia against the 2016 election (to help Trump), he declared vindication. And with that braying, Trump managed to sidestep being publicly branded as a scoundrel for having betrayed his nation by aiding and abetting the Russian attack. (During the campaign, Trump encouraged the Russian assault but publicly denied it was happening even as he sought to benefit from it, providing cover to a foreign adversary seeking to subvert an American election.) Trump made collusion the core issue\u2014because he obviously did not directly plot with Moscow\u2014and, consequently, his actual treachery, which was profound but not necessarily criminal, drew less attention.\n\nThat success is shaping how Trump is now confronting his latest scandal: the allegation that he leaned on Zelensky to produce dirt on Biden in exchange for US military aid. With this controversy pushing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch an impeachment inquiry, Trump and his gang have had to devise a strategy for containing this fire\u2014which has been fueled by the revelations that a whistleblower filed a report with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general expressing concern about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine and that the acting director of national intelligence was ordered (probably by the White House) to violate the law and not share this report with Congress. The game plan for Trump and his gang, once again, is to distract from Trump\u2019s clear-and-present wrongdoing by asserting he didn\u2019t actually do something worse, such as break the law.\n\nThe memo the White House issued depicts Trump abusing his power, as he pressures Zelensky to investigate Biden, one of Trump\u2019s key political rivals. It does not provide evidence of a quid pro quo. Trump does not outright say, \u201cHey, pal, if you want your $400 million in military aid, you will get me good shit on Biden and also stuff that clears Paul Manafort.\u201d But this memo notes on the first page that it is not a \u201cverbal transcript\u201d\u2014though it is structured as a transcript\u2014and merely \u201crecords the notes and recollections\u201d of officials who listened to the call. So there is no telling if a more damning phrase or sentence was uttered by Trump during the conversation. (And this one memo does not cover Trump\u2019s other conversations about Ukraine, such as his chats with number-one henchman, Rudy Giuliani, who has been searching for oppo research in Ukraine.) But even without such a let\u2019s-make-a-deal line, the memo is extraordinarily damning.\n\nIn this account, Trump congratulates Zelensky, a former television comedian, on his election victory and points out that the United States has been \u201cvery very good to Ukraine.\u201d And when Zelensky tells Trump that Ukraine wants to purchase more Javelin antitank missiles from the United States, Trump responds in a quid-pro-quo-ish manner by saying, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d He goes on to suggest to Zelensky that the server of the Democratic Party that was hacked by the Russians somehow ended up in Ukraine, perhaps with a Ukrainian oligarch. And he asks Zelensky \u201cto find out what happened.\u201d (There is no basis for believing the DNC server wound up in Ukraine\u2014and it never disappeared in the first place.) Trump notes that Mueller\u2019s investigation recently ended but that \u201ca lot of it started with Ukraine.\u201d And he requests that Zelensky \u201cget to the bottom of it.\u201d Trump adds, \u201cIt\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d This appears to be an attempt to push Zelensky to produce information that will somehow discredit the Mueller probe and counter the Trump-Russia scandal. And it could be an effort on Trump\u2019s part to obtain information\u2014or disinformation\u2014that could be used to undermine the prosecution and conviction of Paul Manafort, his campaign chair, who ended up in prison on charges related to his lucrative dealings in Ukraine.\n\nTrump then presents another ask to Zelensky. He cites the fact-free conspiracy theory that Biden, when vice president, urged the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor (who was widely seen as corrupt) to protect a Ukrainian company on whose board Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat. (Biden did press for this prosecutor\u2019s dismissal, representing the desire of many Western nations, and there is no evidence it had anything to do with his son\u2019s connection to the Ukrainian firm.) Trump says, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that.\u201d He requests that Zelensky talk to Attorney General Bill Barr about this matter (which has no merit). And he also tells Zelensky to be in contact with Giuliani, his personal lawyer, in this regard: \u201cRudy very much knows what\u2019s happening.\u201d And while discussing all this, Trump predicts that Ukraine\u2019s economy will \u201cget better and better.\u201d Several times, Trump reiterates his desire that Zelensky talk to Barr and, especially, to Giuliani, who had previously acknowledged in public that he aimed to uncover dirt on Biden in Ukraine. (The Justice Department claims Barr never spoke to Zelensky.)\n\nWhether this memo reveals all or not, one picture is clear: Trump used his office in an attempt to obtain disparaging information on a political foe and seek material to undercut an official US government investigation. The tenor of the conversation is undeniable: If Zelensky wants a decent relationship with the Trump administration and more Javelin missiles, he should do this \u201cfavor\u201d for Trump. And at the time of the call, the Trump administration was withholding that previously authorized $400 million in military assistance\u2014and providing no explanation for this move. Trump was not asking Zelensky to assist an authorized Justice Department investigation that was underway. This was what political pros call ratfucking. Trump was exploiting his presidential power to gain assistance from a foreign government for his reelection. It was collusion.\n\nTrump, though, in his black-is-white fashion, is claiming this memo as absolution, proclaiming it contains no indication of a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see a direct quid pro quo in this.\u201d @BretBaier \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s lead, on Capitol Hill, Republicans are squawking like parrots: \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sniffed in a tweet: \u201cWow. Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.\u201d And talking points sent out by the White House insist the Trump-Zelensky conversation was \u201centirely proper,\u201d that Trump was only asking Zelensky to investigate Ukraine\u2019s possible interference in the 2016 election, and that Trump was making a legitimate suggestion that Zelensky speak to Giuliani about the Biden. The talking points purport to shoot down the \u201cmyths\u201d that Trump explicitly made a \u201cmysterious\u201d promise to Zelensky and offered him a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d\u2014as if that is the only possible misconduct. The White House messaging does not address the incriminating remark: Trump, in response to Zelensky\u2019s request for more missiles, asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d and noting this was \u201cimportant.\u201d And, as to be expected, the talking points claim this new scandal is yet another \u201cDeep State\u201d attack on Trump, a conspiracy assisted by the media and congressional Democrats.\n\nAll this noise from Trump and his minions is gaslighting. Trump is denying the reality of the memo. His handmaids within the GOP and the conservative media are marching in lockstep. They\u2019re all on the same page: no direct quid pro quo in the conversation means no wrongdoing. It\u2019s the same line as no collusion with Russia\u2019s plot means no wrongdoing. Democrats and many reporters and media commentators got rolled by that spin during the Russia scandal. They and the citizenry of the United States should not fall for it again. Just as with the Russia affair, Trump has been caught red-handed. There is more to learn about the Ukraine scandal; it extends beyond this one phone call. But Trump himself has put his brazen misconduct on full public display. Now he is resorting to his familiar playbook: con the public. It has worked before. And as the House Democrats move ahead with impeachment, a critical question for the nation will be whether Trump and the Republicans can once again pull off this trickery.\n\nThis is a developing story.
