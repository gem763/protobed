But today, in a surprise, it was announced on the Kik blog that Kik Messenger will apparently live on, as it has been purchased by MediaLab, a holding company that owns companies like anonymous-messaging app Whisper and mixtape-sharing service DatPiff.\n\nIn the blog post, MediaLab committed to continuing to develop Kik Messenger, saying that it will spend \u201cthe next few months\u201d on making the app \u201cfaster, more reliable, [and] less buggy.\u201d However, MediaLab also said that, to help pay for the expenses of maintaining the messaging service, it will be introducing ads \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d in a \u201cnon-intrusive\u201d way.\n\nThe Kin cryptocurrency will also still be part of the app in some way, as MediaLab said that it will \u201cfurther partner\u201d with the remaining Kik team on \u201cexpanding\u201d Kin integration into the service.\n\nIt may be too little, too late\n\nIn Kik\u2019s original announcement about shutting down Kik Messenger, the company said it would be firing more than 100 employees. We don\u2019t know if those firings happened yet, and today\u2019s blog doesn\u2019t mention if any of the potentially impacted employees will be moving over to MediaLab, so it\u2019s unclear who is actually on the new Messenger team.\n\nWhile it\u2019s good to see that Kik Messenger will live on, I have to wonder if it\u2019s too little, too late for the app. It seems difficult to come back from an announcement of being shut down, and I don\u2019t feel like integration with an unproven cryptocurrency will bring the app back into popularity. When there already are so many other messaging options out there, I just can\u2019t see Kik getting hugely popular again.", "description": "It was announced on the Kik blog that Kik Messenger will apparently live on, as it has been purchased by MediaLab, a holding company that owns companies like anonymous-messaging app Whisper and mixtape-sharing service Datpiff.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9h9hLKUK9JJKs7VnGWWI5uNyC04=/0x291:720x668/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19300275/Kik_desk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
