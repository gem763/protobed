REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Spirits maker Diageo Plc (DGE.L) said on Thursday it was \u201cnot immune\u201d to changes in global trade policies, but based on the current environment expects to meet its full-year organic sales targets.\n\nThe Johnnie Walker whisky and Tanqueray gin maker said it continues to expect organic net sales growth to be towards the mid-point of a 4% to 6% range and organic operating profit to grow roughly one percentage point ahead of organic net sales.\n\nThe company also said it expects first-half organic operating profit growth to be in-line with or slightly behind organic net sales growth, due to stronger prior year comparables.\n\n\u201cWe would not be immune from significant changes to global trade policy and continue to monitor this closely,\u201d Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said in a statement.\n\nThe forecast comes ahead of the drinks maker\u2019s annual general meeting today in London.\n\nIt also comes just weeks ahead of UK\u2019s departure from the European Union, which in the chance of a no-deal exit would bring trade tariffs and customs checks with the continent for the first time in decades.\n\nLondon-based Diageo said the forecasts were consistent with its targets for the medium term or next three years, which calls for organic net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and profit ahead of net sales by 5% to 7%.\n\nShares of the company were down 0.8% in early trading on Thursday.", "description": "Spirits maker Diageo Plc said on Thursday it was \"not immune\" to changes in global trade policies, but based on the current environment expects to meet its full-year organic sales targets.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431506767&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0E6", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
