The U.S. State Department said it had accepted Sweden\u2019s invitation to return for more discussions with Pyongyang in two weeks.\n\nNorth Korea said the ball was now in Washington\u2019s court, and warned Washington that it would wait only until the end of the year for the United States to change course.\n\n\u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as \u2026 happened this time (in Sweden) before the U.S. takes a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK,\u201d KCNA state news agency cited a spokesperson for North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry as saying, referring to the official name of North Korea.\n\nIt is unclear whether North Korea will return to the talks but Pyongyang could be using its strategy of negotiating on the edge to gain concessions as side benefits of participating in negotiations, experts say.\n\n\u201cThey want to create the impression that the cause of the impasse is the inflexibility of the U.S. side \u2013 and they likely want to force the United States to either come back with a more favorable negotiating position or eventually force President Trump to engage at the summit level to keep diplomacy alive,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. State Department official specializing in the Koreas.\n\nVipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added that North Korea is also buying time to continue to expand and improve its missile and nuclear force, and negotiate the terms by which it is accepted as a nuclear weapons power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, their best strategy is to dangle the hope of a fictional future deal but stall on actual negotiations let alone crafting or implementing any such deal,\u201d Narang said.\n\nUnder sanctions banning much of its trade because of its weapons program, North Korea recently test-fired a new ballistic missile designed for submarine launch, a provocative gesture that also underscored the need for Washington to move quickly to negotiate limits on Pyongyang\u2019s growing arsenal.\n\nDEADLINE COMING CLOSE\n\nNorth Korea reiterated the year-end deadline that leader Kim Jong Un set for the United States to show more flexibility in the talks, which fell apart in February during his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn June, the two leaders then met again in Panmunjom, the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, and agreed to restart working-level talks.\n\nAt the working-level talks, the United States has said it brought \u201ccreative ideas\u201d and had good discussions with North Korea, without giving further details.\n\nBut the North Korean foreign ministry said Washington had made no preparations for the talks in Sweden but sought only to serve its own political aims.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s delegation led by chief nuclear negotiator Kim Myong Gil left the embassy in Stockholm, Yonhap News Agency said. Asked whether they would return to Sweden, Kim suggested asking the U.S. side.\n\nThe North Korean delegation flew to Moscow on Sunday, apparently going back home via Beijing, according to Yonhap.\n\nA motorcade believed to carry U.S. counterparts also left a Stockholm hotel, Yonhap said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is spreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet after two weeks \u2026 it is not likely at all that it can produce a proposal commensurate to the expectations of the DPRK and to the concerns of the world in just fortnight,\u201d the foreign ministry spokesperson said.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "North Korea said on Sunday there was no way the United States would bring alternative plans for their stalled nuclear talks to a meeting proposed by Stockholm in two weeks after weekend negotiations in Sweden broke down", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-korea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
