Chief among those is replacing the current rumble technology that Sony has been using since the original PlayStation for new haptic feedback technology that it promises will offer a \u201cbroader range of feedback.\u201d\n\nThe other big change that Sony is talking about today is a technology it\u2019s calling \u201cadaptive triggers,\u201d which will go in the primary R2/L2 triggers on the PS5\u2019s controller. According to Sony, developers will be able to \u201cprogram the resistance of the triggers,\u201d giving the example that you\u2019ll be able to \u201cfeel\u201d the increased tension as you draw back a bow or force you to push down with extra pressure if you\u2019re driving through rough terrain. It sounds pretty similar to a Microsoft patent from earlier this year, which detailed a similar trigger system for a future Xbox controller (although it\u2019s unclear if Microsoft is planning to incorporate it in its next-gen Project Scarlett hardware).\n\nWired got a hands-on preview with a prototype PS5 controller, which it notes looked \u201can awful lot like the PS4\u2019s DualShock 4,\u201d although Sony isn\u2019t confirming if it\u2019ll call it the DualShock 5 just yet. Wired also confirmed that the PS5\u2019s controller will finally be making the jump to USB-C, as well as other refinements like a larger battery and improved speakers.\n\nIn an interview with Wired, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan and PS5 system architect Mark Cerny gave some additional details about the upcoming hardware. \u201cThere is ray-tracing acceleration in the GPU hardware,\u201d Cerny said, clarifying the company\u2019s original announcement of ray-tracing support and allaying concerns that Sony might resort to software tricks to manage it.\n\nThe Wired interview also confirms that the PS5 will use standard 100GB Blu-ray discs \u2014 Sony had previously confirmed that the console will offer a disc drive \u2014 but all games will have to be installed to the internal SSD this time around.\n\nThat super-fast SSD is still the biggest update that Sony is showing off, and it says that the installation requirement is due to the speed difference between the optical drive and the internal solid-state one. Sony does promise that the SSD\u2019s improvements to how it reads data means that games will be able to take up less space, though, which should help soften the blow for the mandatory installation requirements. Sony will also let developers break up the installation of their games \u2014 say, by installing just the multiplayer components or just the single player campaign \u2014 on the PS5.\n\nAlso new on the PS5 is a \u201ccompletely revamped user interface,\u201d that will show off far more detailed social features on the home screen. Sony promises that you\u2019ll be able to see (and launch directly into) specific features of a game, like a single-player level or multiplayer match, directly from the home screen, instead of first having to launch the game and then navigate in.\n\nAll this information joins the existing details that Sony has already revealed earlier this year, like the eight-core CPU (which will be based on AMD\u2019s third-gen Ryzen line) and custom GPU based on AMD\u2019s Radeon Navi hardware, \u201c3D audio\u201d, the support for 8K gaming (as well as for 4K gaming at 120Hz), a much lower power consumption option, PS4 backwards compatibility, and that ultra-fast SSD.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know, of course, like how much storage Sony will be offering (a question that becomes far more important with mandatory game installation), what kind of VR options there\u2019ll be, or even what the actual hardware will look like or cost. But with the new holiday 2020 release date, it likely won\u2019t be too long before Sony starts giving some answers to those questions, too.", "description": "Sony has confirmed that its next-generation console will be called the PlayStation 5, and it\u2019ll be out next year, launching in time for \"Holiday 2020.\" The company also detailed new changes for the controller on the PS5, with the addition of haptic feedback to replace rumble and \"adaptive\" triggers.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/quV6zCwsGwbytUI3P15jYsDHkuo=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11515157/acastro_180604_1777_playstation_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
