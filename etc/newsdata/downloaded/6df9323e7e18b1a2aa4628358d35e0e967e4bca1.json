Or at least he would have been in years past. But with the start of a new PGA Tour season comes a tweak to the competitive formula. The tour\u2019s Policy Board in July voted to lower the 36-hole cutline to 65 and ties. It also eliminated the third-round cut, which was instituted when more than 78 players qualified for the weekend.\n\nAs changes go, this is hardly a seismic event. The cut at the Masters is 50 and ties, plus any player within 10 shots of the lead. At the U.S. Open, the low 60 and ties advance to the final two rounds.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhat the change is likely to achieve is a streamlining of the weekend field. It also gets rid of the secondary cut on Saturday, which was implemented in 2008 and not particularly popular. One tour veteran called it \u201cthe dumbest thing we\u2019ve ever done on the PGA Tour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it. It makes sense,\u201d said two-time major winner Zach Johnson of the new threshold to play all four rounds. \u201cThis makes things much better on the weekends. And there is continuity between tours. It\u2019s just easier to manage. And it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. It might mean a guy misses one or two cuts more. But, again, it makes sense from an operational standpoint. It makes the product better. It makes sense for the purse.\u201d\n\nAt The Greenbrier, the new policy came into play immediately. A total of 68 players ended up making the \u201cnew\u201d cut at four-under 136. Meanwhile, 16 players who would have teed it up today under the old system were sent home instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot everybody was completely on board with the change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they did it. \u2026 If it\u2019s about speeding up play, we\u2019re not worried about speeding up play on the weekend. We\u2019re worried about speeding up play the first two days,\u201d said Watson, who finished the opening 36 holes just on the number at four under. \u201cIt\u2019s not affecting me positively or negatively. It\u2019s one of those things that the weekend is not broke. It\u2019s the weekdays that are broke.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kevin Chappell shoots 59 in first PGA Tour start since back injury 10 months ago\n\nRyan Armour, a member of the Player Advisory Council that advises the Policy Board, said he voted for the cut to 65. But he supported it only if the secondary cut was, well, cut.\n\n\u201cYou look at the competitiveness of the tour, how close the race to 125 and then down to 70 and 30 for the Tour Championship, and it just didn\u2019t make sense to have the MDF,\u201d said Armour, referring to the abbreviated designation for players who were cut after Saturday (Made Cut, Did Not Finish), which would have been in play at The Greenbrier if not for the change. \u201cA player makes the cut, he should have a chance to improve his position in the final two rounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might not affect you for the whole year. You know what I mean? You might not be in that bubble [between 66 and 70],\u201d said Kevin Na, defending champion at The Greenbrier. \u201cIt\u2019s all about timing. I don\u2019t mind it. There are times where you do make a cut on the number and guys do go on to win a tournament. You know before the week starts that the cut is 65 and ties. Everybody knows, and that\u2019s the way you got to play to.\u201d\n\nJason Dufner, the former PGA Championship winner, said the move to a lower cut was overdue. If it makes it more difficult for fringe players to hang onto their cards, so be it. \u201cWe have the best tour in the world, so it should be hard. The harder the better,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that makes things more competitive, then I\u2019m in favor of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a really good way to look at it,\u201d Johnson said of Dufner\u2019s remark. \u201cI see it being easier to manage, which helps, but, yeah, from the competition side, it\u2019s the clich\u00e9 you always hear, which is, 'Play better.' And this just amplifies that idea.\u201d\n\nWATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS\n\nOriginally Appeared on Golf Digest\n\n", "description": "Sixteen players who would have made the cut at The Greenbrier under the old rules were sent home early as the new top-65-and-ties cut policy comes into play", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QGGTVvU5.NMcFsmKnjlTlA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W6Tp6K1QaOzV79ZdUTging--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/golf_digest_7/2d075503a6cc843165ab72a6833c73ec", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
