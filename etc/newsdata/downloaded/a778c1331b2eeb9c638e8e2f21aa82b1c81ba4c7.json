Like other motels that came of age during America\u2019s budding romance with the highway, the Drifter had faded, fallen out of favor, and found itself off the beaten path of the typical tourist.\n\nBut Cota and the developers felt this property, an affordable adaptive reuse, could be reimagined to \u201cfeel uniquely New Orleans\u201d without falling back on local architectural cliches\u2014ferns, wrought iron, and gas lanterns.\n\n\u201cThe motel, by nature of its privacy, cost, and roadside location, makes it the democracy of hospitality, claimed in equal measure by the lone traveler, the family, the trysters, explorers, adventurers, and weary travelers, all wanting to escape in the sweaty tropical scenery of New Orleans,\u201d says Cota. \u201cThis was about creating a property that felt playful and extravagant in subtle ways.\u201d\n\nThe reimagined, 20-room motel\u2014with terrazzo floors in the lobby, a restored neon sign, and a lush tropical garden where the parking lot once stood\u2014exemplifies the current trend of turning old mom-and-pop motor-court motels into hip boutique accommodations. Call it motel revivalism: cashing in on inexpensive property, employing adaptive reuse, and playing to the country\u2019s obsession with updated midcentury design.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect time for motel revivalism\n\nThese kind of renovations and re-openings have been happening for at least the last decade, if not more, from poolside haunts in Palm Springs to the Austin Motel in the Texas capital city, but recently seem to have picked up speed.\n\n\u201cHoteliers ... are purchasing America\u2019s dilapidated 20th-century motels in droves,\u201d wrote GQ in January, and last year Vogue found that \u201cnew owners are sprucing up the joints with a nod to indie craftspeople and artisans.\u201d\n\nThe Bunkhouse Group, led by Liz Lambert, who runs the Austin Motel and a number of other properties, has been a pioneer in this movement, and is now partially owned by the Standard Group. The Drifter is looking to expand and open locations in Detroit, Nashville, and Houston, while the parent company of the national Red Lion chain, RLH, plans to open the first locations of its relaunched Signature Inn brand of motels in San Francisco this July and Bend, Oregon, later this fall.\n\nAHEAD Americas, a hotel industry group that presents an annual design award, said the Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa in Napa Valley, this year\u2019s best design, shows how \u201cmotels are making a comeback.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s stock of motels has dramatically decreased, from an estimated 61,000 in 1964 to roughly 16,000 in 2012, according to Mark Okrent, author of No Vacancy: The Rise, Demise and Reprise of America\u2019s Motels. Not every location\u2014particularly smaller, out-of-the-way properties\u2014can be reborn by today\u2019s hipster hoteliers into more fashionable and expensive lodging. But like a parent on a family vacation pushing that station wagon to the next rest stop, many see plenty of gas in the tank for this trend to continue.\n\n\u201cThere is a love affair with midcentury modern that is sort of taking over design, and often these properties are so neglected that they offer a great value to investors and developers,\u201d says Cota. \u201cThe success of the current projects seems to be sending a clear incentive to developers and hoteliers that these are properties that have a lot of life still.\u201d\n\nTaking advantage of a changing hospitality landscape\n\nThis retro, boutique motel aesthetic, and the repositioning of roadside motels as hipster hangouts, taps into numerous established design trends. But it also arrives at an ideal moment in the changing hospitality industry.\n\n\u201cWe definitely think the \u2018high-low\u2019 approach to hospitality is something that\u2019s very prevalent right now and something that hospitality enthusiasts are demanding in most markets,\u201d says William Harris, a principal at AvroKO, which designed the Calistoga. \u201cBeing approachable and experience-driven is vital, and we\u2019re seeing this not just with hospitality design, but in many other industries as well, including retail, beauty and wellness, health care, and more.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jou-Yie Chou and William Brian Smith, partners at Brooklyn-based Studio Tack, a firm that has designed these types of properties, such as the Sound View in Long Island, New York, a confluence of two factors is making motels so popular. The hospitality industry continues to look for alternatives to the cookie-cutter flagship brands and even the proliferation of formulaic boutique hotels. From a business standpoint, a generation of independent motel owners\u2014many motels are family businesses that have been passed down for a generation or two\u2014is sitting on properties it\u2019s ready to sell.\n\n\u201cDevelopers and first-time hotel owners are jumping on these properties because they can be affordable and scalable, and very approachable in terms of a first-time project,\u201d says Chou.\n\nScalability and appeal is one reason that RLH began concepting, designing, and building out the reborn Signature Inn brand last fall. According to Amanda Marcello, the senior vice president of brand strategy for RLH, retrofitting these motels can offer a unique, playful, and affordable option for travelers, a sort of boutique-economy option.\n\n\u201cMany motels and hotels are looking for a new beginning, and instead of demoing or ripping out the personality of what\u2019s there, we saw an opportunity to embrace it,\u201d she says.\n\nThe origin of the motor hotel\n\nWhile the explosion of motels as we know it happened in the \u201950s and \u201960s, the first example of the form opened in San Luis Obispo, California, in 1925. The word \u201cmotel\u201d was supposedly a bit of a signage error. \u201cMotor hotel\u201d was mashed together, and the Motel Inn, offering rooms for $2.50 a night, was born.\n\nThe motel was born out of necessity right as travel radically shifted after World War II. Before the war, in the early days of motoring, Americans would pitch tents on the roadside or stay in shabby tourist cabins, looked down upon as being \u201chideouts for criminals and gangsters, or one-hour rentals for the \u2018hot pillow\u2019 trade,\u201d according to design historian Rebecca Gross.\n\nBut after the war, as the middle class boomed, bought cars, and had more leisure time to explore, a small network of mom-and-pop motels grew to cater to the curious, car-driving public. Strips of motels clustered together in offbeat places like Tucumcari, New Mexico, and many utilized the design styles and visual language of the day, blending neon signage, midcentury style, and, occasionally, Polynesian and Native American themes. Plastic flowers, neon cacti, and concrete teepees proliferated at these quirky rest stops. Boasting family-friendly rooms, pools, and locations near a highway off-ramp, they offered a promise, according to Gross, that lodging was \u201ceconomical, informal, and hospitable.\u201d\n\nBut in many ways, the growth of the highway system and the rapid changes in the travel industry that helped hotels proliferate also led to their downfall. Larger and more efficient interstates allowed travelers to bypass smaller roadways and the motels that flocked around them. The hotel business became standardized, most notably Holiday Inn, a chain started in Memphis, Tennessee, that created the blueprint for reliable, indistinct lodging. In 1963, a company executive said that \u201cwhat we\u2019re trying to do here is finish the job that Henry Ford began. Ford put a set of assembly-line wheels under the average American. It\u2019s up to us to supply the assembly-line lodgings.\u201d By 1972, Holiday Inn had 1,400 locations.\n\nThe recent motel comeback\n\nBy the \u201980s, according to Lonely Planet, motels were in retreat, bypassed by freeways and in many cases unable to compete with budget, no-frills chains. Overlooked areas such as Wildwood, New Jersey, became neon-fringed tourist destinations seemingly locked in amber. While many older motels have since been upgraded to compete for the modern traveler, they still struggle against massive chains with better locations and substantial advertising budgets.\n\nBut as Studio Tack\u2019s Chou and Smith pointed out, there\u2019s always demand for something off the beaten path. Developers and designers see potential in properties with a history and unique layout, and tried to meet the challenge of creating \u201cgentrified motels\u201d that tap into nostalgia without becoming cliches.\n\nIn the case of Studio Tack and its Sound View project, it involved exploring the midcentury aesthetic while taking cues from regional architecture. A quarter-mile-long building located on top of the ocean in the North Fork, the Sound View could have easily sank into nautical platitudes. Chou and Smith\u2019s design aimed to capture vernacular touches\u2014the rooms are covered in cedar shiplap and filled with custom-designed furniture and lighting\u2014while referencing more organic and local midcentury and modernist designs, such as nearby Cape Cod modernist homes or the work of Horace Gifford on Fire Island.\n\nThere\u2019s also value in preserving the original courtyard-style layout, a unique indoor-outdoor experience many of these new motel designers attempt to capture.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to fight against the location or do something unnatural to the existing architecture,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThe typology of having the exterior corridor to walk around creates an amazing experience of guests interacting with each other. We\u2019re not going to create some kind of hermetic seal around everything and make the motel more hotel-like.\u201d\n\nCota\u2019s work for the Drifter in New Orleans tried to capture the same balance between respecting history and location without being too cliched. During an initial dig into the motel and its past, the design team found little to work with, such as an old postcard bearing a photo of the building, originally called the Crescent City Inn. Instead of a history lesson, Cota focused on something eclectic, diverse, and playful, grounded in references, including some to Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n and Italian architect Gio Ponti.\n\nAccording to Greg Bradshaw, a principal at AvroKO, the firm behind the Calistoga, \u201crestraint is one of the most difficult aspects to achieve in design, but we see it as crucial.\u201d While the firm referenced a mashup of influences for the Napa Valley motel and spa project\u2014playful apothecary references and Wes Anderson motifs for the spa, nods to Napa\u2019s hot springs and agricultural vibe, as well as midcentury family trips\u2014it tried not to overwhelm the setting and structure.\n\nIt\u2019s the original character of these places, even after they\u2019ve been updated with bold patterns and new paint jobs, that shines through, according to RLH\u2019s Marcello. Signature Inn, which aims to hit 20 total properties within the next 24 months, looks to go cross-country, but it\u2019s not focused exclusively on top tier cities. Looking for places with the right profile, the company literally going where the road takes it.\n\n\u201cSome of these motels are really beautiful boxes,\u201d Marcello says, \u201cand they\u2019re only in very unique places.\u201d", "description": "The renovation and re-opening of classic motels is picking up steam.", "authors": ["Patrick Sisson", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3rH9NRVXVL_VPF5chqBKEbweZY=/0x144:2000x1191/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11583385/THE_DRIFTER_Exterior_01_Nicole_Franzen_for_Design_Hotels_.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-22"}
