Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency touched $7,363, the lowest since May 18.\n\nFriday\u2019s price jump-started right around 10:15 UTC, right after Xi\u2019s favorable blockchain comments were published in Chinese media.\n\nThe Chinese president\u2019s statements on blockchain are believed to be his first in-depth remarks on the technology. Chinese officials are developing a digital version of the country\u2019s own currency, but have forbidden other coins from being traded.\n\nPresident Xi said on Thursday:\n\n\u201cWe must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.\u201d\n\neToro\u2019s Greenspan said that the price jump appeared to be directly correlated with the Chinese leader\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cIt seems like this is what investors were reacting to,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much amount of good news that can be ignored. Xi is one of the most important people in the world.\u201d\n\nBitcoin remains well off its 2019 high of $12,920 reached in June, though prices are still more than double where they started the year.\n\nChina lion image via Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin prices surged Friday after the Chinese President said his countrymen should \"seize the opportunity\" afforded by blockchain technology.", "authors": ["Brad Keoun"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A6ADaUKcMeV4zvkIwR2lpA--~B/aD01MTg7dz03ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/a63f0b45ad3bf51b228f45cfd4cc65e6", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
