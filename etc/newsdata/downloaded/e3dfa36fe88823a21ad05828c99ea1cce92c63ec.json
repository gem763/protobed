REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) wants Iqbal Khan, co-head of its wealth management business, to drop his criminal complaint over a spying scandal that emerged after he left cross-town rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), the SonntagsZeitung newspaper reported on Sunday.\n\nUBS\u2019s board would welcome it if Khan abandoned his complaint against the three private detectives who followed him during his last weeks as a Credit Suisse employee, the paper said, citing sources close to the UBS board.\n\nThe board at Switzerland\u2019s biggest lender thinks a trial cold pose dangers for Khan and the bank, especially if new details emerged that could incriminate Khan, the paper said.\n\nIt could also be embarrassing for Khan if prosecutors dropped the proceedings without a result, it added.\n\nKhan, who left Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest bank in July and began working at UBS in October, was under surveillance by private detectives hired by Credit Suisse from Sept. 4 to Sept. 17, when he spotted them.\n\nThe affair saw suicide and espionage invade the secretive world of Swiss private banking, and exposed a feud between Khan and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam.\n\nCredit Suisse has cleared Thiam of involvement in the affair, which was blamed on Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee, Thiam\u2019s right-hand man. Bouee resigned following the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are not commenting on the ongoing criminal proceedings,\u201d UBS said on Sunday. \u201cWe are very happy to have Iqbal Khan in our team. He is concentrating fully on his role at UBS and is in close contact with employees and clients.\u201d", "description": "UBS wants Iqbal Khan, co-head of its wealth management business, to drop his criminal complaint over a spying scandal that emerged after he left cross-town rival Credit Suisse , the SonntagsZeitung newspaper reported on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445495999&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0EU", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
