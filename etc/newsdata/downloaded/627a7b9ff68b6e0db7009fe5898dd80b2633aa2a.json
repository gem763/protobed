Apparently, Trixie and Clementine\u2019s glands have been removed surgically to make the skunks more acceptable residents of the city, the zoo and the Small Mammal House.\n\nIt is not clear where or whether other members of their species live elsewhere under less controlled conditions in the woods and wilds of the Washington area, or how numerous they may be.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Trixie and Clementine are \u201cmini marvels\u201d who live in the Small Mammal House.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
