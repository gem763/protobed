But that\u2019s not what happened here. All of the available evidence indicates that Trump sought to manipulate a foreign power into smearing Biden and other Democrats for his personal interest, not the national interest.\n\nWith the merits defense in tatters, Trump is left with attacks on the process itself. His foremost target for criticism is House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, the Democrats\u2019 point man on the inquiry. Trump and his allies have sharply attacked the California lawmaker for giving a misleading statement on whether he\u2019d been in contact with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed, and for exaggerating what Trump had said in the July 25 phone call during a hearing. House Republicans introduced a motion to censure Schiff, but Democrats tabled it on Tuesday. Their grievances are good fodder for Trump\u2019s Twitter feed and Fox News broadcasts, but they don\u2019t change the evidence and testimony gathered so far about the Ukraine scheme.\n\nMany Republicans have also taken umbrage with Democrats\u2019 procedural maneuvers, such as Pelosi\u2019s decision to not hold a formal vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry. While the Nixon and Clinton impeachment process began with similar vote, the Constitution does not require it. They have also criticized Schiff\u2019s decision to hold the depositions of key witnesses behind closed doors in a classified setting. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt compared it to the Star Chamber, a secret English court used by Tudor and Stuart monarchs to try their political enemies without due process.\n\nIt\u2019s not a very good comparison, to say the least. The Star Chamber didn\u2019t let potential witnesses defy its subpoenas without consequences. House Republicans who sit on the relevant committees are free to watch the depositions and ask questions of their own. Nor is there anything sinister about Democrats\u2019 decision to depose witnesses in a non-public setting. Trey Gowdy, the GOP ex-lawmaker who ran one of the House Benghazi investigations, also used closed-door hearings when questioning witnesses to avoid a circus-like atmosphere. \u201cIf you want to get on the news, go rob a bank,\u201d he once told his frustrated Republican colleagues.\n\nVirtually every major poll shows that a majority or plurality of Americans support the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSo what else do Senate Republicans have to fall back on? Impeachment isn\u2019t a process to be undertaken lightly. Public opposition can make it more difficult to justify a president\u2019s removal from office, as shown by the Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment by the House in 1998 and acquittal by the Senate in 1999. This time, all the signs are pointing in the opposite direction. Virtually every major poll shows that a majority or plurality of Americans support the impeachment inquiry, with many showing a plurality of support for Trump\u2019s conviction and removal from office. Those numbers have only grown since the inquiry began.\n\nWhat about the well-being of the nation? Trump\u2019s caustic response to the inquiry undercuts the idea that keeping him in power is good for the nation\u2019s civic health. He often describes the House\u2019s lawful, constitutional process as a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d and a \u201clynching,\u201d and he\u2019s echoed supporters\u2019 claims that it could lead to \u201ccivil war.\u201d These implicit threats of violence only bolster the need to remove him from office. His erratic decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria this month also makes it impossible for Republicans to cogently claim that acquittal is justified for the sake of international stability or national security.\n\nThe most persistent counter-arguments involve the upcoming presidential election. Trump\u2019s allies often warn that Democrats are trying to reverse the 2016 election and interfere in the next one. Naturally, this argument would hold more water if Trump\u2019s misconduct wasn\u2019t directly related to the 2020 race. More importantly, the choice between impeachment and the election is a false dilemma. The Constitution allows the Senate to hand down two punishments when it convicts an impeached federal official: removal from office and disqualification from holding \u201cany office of honor, trust or profit under the United States\u201d in the future. In the president and vice president\u2019s cases, a conviction results in automatic removal from office.\n\nPermanent disqualification, on the other hand, is discretionary. The Senate\u2019s Republican majority could theoretically vote in favor of convicting and removing Trump from office, then vote against the motion to permanently disqualify him from holding it in the future. This issue didn\u2019t arise in the Nixon or Clinton sagas; the Twenty-Second Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice and both men were already serving their second terms. Adopting this Solomonic approach for Trump would allow the Senate to punish him for his transgressions and still give the American people the opportunity to render a final judgment next fall.", "description": "It's still unlikely he'll be removed from office but the president has not provided allies with anything resembling a cogent defense.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0a1633ad3fb37d2e02544c48aaa71c2fb766bf2d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
