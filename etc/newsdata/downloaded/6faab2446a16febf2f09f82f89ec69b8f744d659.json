If at the start of 2019 investors were hanging their hats on higher rates to bolster portfolio yield, they have been sorely disappointed.\n\nRather than rise\u2014as many had expected at the start of the year\u2014interest rates have fallen sharply, leaving investors with few options in the fixed income space to generate income.\n\nRetirees in particular often rely on the fixed coupon payments of bonds to generate income. But with the 10-year Treasury yield last yielding only 1.75%\u2014not far from record lows\u2014they\u2019ve had to look elsewhere for that income.\n\nOne place they can still find it is in the equity market; namely, dividend ETFs. Yields on these funds can be double that of the 10-year Treasury. For example, the Vanguard High Yield Dividend Yield ETF (VYM), the second-largest dividend ETF on the market, has a 30-day SEC yield of around 3.3%.\n\nViable, But Not Perfect\n\nMake no mistake, dividend ETFs are not a perfect replacement for bonds. The risk and reward characteristics of the investment vehicles are quite different, and perhaps most importantly, dividend ETFs expose investors to equity market risk\u2014for better or for worse.\n\nStill, for investors who can look past the volatility of equities, dividend ETFs are a viable alternative to fixed income for generating yield. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at some of the top dividend ETFs ranked by various factors\u2014assets under management, performance and flows.\n\n2 Main Strategies\n\nLike many segments of the ETF market, the dividend space is top-heavy. Of the $196 billion invested in U.S.-listed dividend ETFs, the top 10 funds account for 73.5% of those assets.\n\nThe biggest of them all is the $38.8 billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG). Many dividend ETFs focus on one of two strategies\u2014high yield or dividend growth.\n\nVIG targets dividend growth, holding stocks of U.S. companies that have grown their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years. The focus on dividend growth as opposed to high yields is an important distinction. VIG\u2019s 30-day SEC yield of 1.83% is actually less than the S&P 500\u2019s equivalent yield of 1.97%.\n\nBut VIG\u2019s underlying holdings have managed to increase their dividend much more consistently than the broader S&P 500, which results in higher yields over time.\n\nTaking the other dividend approach is the $26.2 billion Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM). VYM\u2019s sole focus is yield, not growth. It simply holds the half of the market with the highest dividend yields and then market-cap-weights them. The result is a juicier 3.33% yield, at the expense of the long-term growth of that yield.\n\nThe Largest Funds\n\nThe eight largest dividend ETFs after VIG and VYM all offer some form of high yield or dividend growth, and use various selection criteria.\n\nSome of the more unique funds in the list include:\n\nSimilar Returns\n\nWhile strategies may differ, performance among the various dividend-focused ETFs this year has been similar. The top 10 best-performing dividend ETFs, for instance, have year-to-date returns ranging from 22% to 28.4%\u2014not a huge spread.\n\nThe First Trust Dorsey Wright Momentum & Dividend ETF (DDIV) leads the pack. The fund bolstered its returns by picking dividend stocks with the best price momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, the VictoryShares Dividend Accelerator ETF (VSDA) is another one on the list. It\u2019s a fund that looks for dividend-growth stocks, but rather than look at history, it uses 15 fundamental and technical metrics to gauge which stocks will increase their payouts.\n\nThe aforementioned VIG, the largest dividend ETF of all, rounds out the top three on the best-performing dividend ETF list.\n\n\n\nBest-Performing Dividend ETFs\n\n\n\nStrong Inflows\n\nDividend ETFs have seen solid inflows this year. The 10 most popular funds based on inflows have gathered a combined $14.9 billion on a year-to-date basis.\n\nUnsurprisingly, VIG headlines the inflows list, with $3.4 billion of fresh cash from investors. The fund\u2019s time-tested dividend growth strategy has resulted in solid gains, and that\u2019s resonating with investors.\n\nAnother Vanguard fund, the aforementioned VYM\u2014which tracks high-yield stocks\u2014also makes the top inflows list, with creations of $1.8 billion. VYM is a favorite for those seeking solid yield that is almost double what you can get in the 10-year Treasury.\n\nThe iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO), the First Trust Value Line Dividend Index Fund (FVD) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) round out the top five dividend flow recipients for 2019.\n\nDividend ETFs With The Largest Inflows\n\nEmail Sumit Roy at sroy@etf.com or follow him on Twitter @sumitroy2\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2019 ETF.com.
