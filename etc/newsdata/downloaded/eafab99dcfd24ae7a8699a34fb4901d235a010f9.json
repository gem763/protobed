Uber (UBER) is down 30% since its debut; Lyft (LYFT) is down 55%; Slack (WORK) is down 40%; Peloton (PTON) is down 17%. (These declines are based on Oct. 2 closing prices.)\n\nWeWork made governance changes after huge backlash to its S-1 filing, then delayed its IPO, then finally called off its IPO. Palantir, widely thought to be planning a 2020 offering, is delaying an IPO and raising more private money instead. Endeavor, the talent house formerly called WME-IMG, called off its IPO.\n\nWant even more examples of the polluted air in unicorn land? The gig economy platform Fiverr is down 28% since its IPO; security software company CrowdStrike (CRWD) is down 11% since its IPO; both unicorns went public in June.\n\nThe Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) \u2014 a fund that tracks the performance of newly public companies \u2014 is down 7% in the past six months. In 2015, tech investor Bill Gurley famously predicted we\u2019d see \u201cdead unicorns\u201d soon. His call may have just been four years early.\n\nThe outlook for once-hyped IPOs has clearly soured. But what really prompted the unicorn funeral?\n\nSoftBank\u2019s money\n\nOne common thread between two of the biggest ailing unicorns this year: SoftBank.\n\nThe Japanese multinational, through its gargantuan $100 billion Vision Fund, pumped nearly $10 billion in venture money into Uber, and more than $10 billion into WeWork.\n\nSoftBank is spreading its bets all across Silicon Valley (some of its other investments yet to pay off include Fanatics, SoFi, and DoorDash) in an almost comically excessive display of what the VC strategy has become: throw huge amounts of money at a huge list of hot companies in the hopes a few will hit.\n\nSoftBank deserves some of the blame for the unicorn funeral\u2014 its fat investments prompt the ballooning valuations that in turn build hype and media attention for these rarely-profitable companies, hype that stokes inflated IPO expectations.\n\nWeWork is the ultimate example: it filed to go public with a $47 billion valuation and $12 billion in SoftBank investment\u2014 then it repeatedly lowered its own offering valuation, to $20 billion and then to $10 billion\u2014 then it yanked the IPO.\n\nSoftBank is in the red on its Uber stake, by the way, even after cashing out nearly $250 million worth of shares at the IPO.\n\nSoftBank, the technology and investment conglomerate owned by Masayoshi Son, is one of the largest investors in troubled American real estate company WeWork. (Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images) More\n\nCrunchBase reports that SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund is responsible for more than 10% of all venture capital dollar volume worldwide so far in 2019. That\u2019s too much influence.\n\nDiminishing appetite for risk\n\nOf course, the entire point of venture capital is risk: firms take the risk of giving money to a business that hasn\u2019t yet really proven itself, in an effort to help the business grow successful and, of course, to get a payoff when the business exits by selling or going public.\n\nBut the unicorns that have debuted in the past six months, and those that aim to debut in the next year, are doing so under the cloud of a trade war between the U.S. and China, the uncertainty of the 2020 presidential election, and slowing growth for a slew of foreign economies.\n\nEven without that macro uncertainty, the recent IPO run is telling us that retail investors (you, a regular person) and institutional investors (hedge funds) are becoming less interested in taking on that risk. If it was once appealing to buy shares in a hot tech name that isn\u2019t yet making money and won\u2019t necessarily make money for a long time, it isn\u2019t very appealing anymore.", "description": "The most-hyped IPOs of the year are struggling now, and other unicorns like WeWork have halted their IPO plans.
