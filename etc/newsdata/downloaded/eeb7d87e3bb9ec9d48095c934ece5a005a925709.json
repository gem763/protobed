Picture taken September 14, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nBut the 37-year-old Honduran made a pact with himself: not to leave the enclave of tents at the end of a bridge between Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas - not even to buy a bottle of water or to collect money transfers from his family back home.\n\nThe cramped camp, in a partly fenced-in plaza abutting administrative buildings just feet from the Rio Grande, is home to approximately 1,000 migrants, many of them sent back to Mexico to await U.S. immigration hearings under a policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) begun this year.\n\nAfter what is commonly known as an \u201cexpress kidnapping\u201d last month by men waiting in a van for him outside a convenience store where he was collecting a $100 transfer from relatives, Osorto promised himself he would only leave the camp to cross the bridge to Texas for his December court date with U.S. immigration authorities.\n\n\u201cI just wait here and trust someone else ... to get me 70 pesos ($3.50) or so when I need it,\u201d he said.\n\nMPP, sometimes called Remain in Mexico, is among various overlapping U.S. policies aimed at severely reducing asylum claims.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration was a mainstay of his 2016 campaign, has said lax U.S. asylum laws encourage people to show up at the border with their children.\n\nBefore MPP, it was common practice to release arriving families into the United States to wait out their U.S. court hearings \u2013 something Trump and others said allowed many migrants to disappear into the country to live illegally. Studies by legal aid groups, such as the Urban Justice Center, have shown that most asylum seekers show up for their hearings, however.\n\nMore than 51,000 people, mainly from Central America, have been sent to Mexico since the MPP program started in January, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBut reports of kidnapping and extortion have increased since the program was expanded to Matamoros and nearby Nuevo Laredo in crime-wracked Tamaulipas state.\n\nHuman Rights First, a U.S.-based rights group, in August documented 110 publicly reported cases of rape, kidnapping, sexual exploitation and other violence against MPP returnees.\n\nIn Matamoros, violence and abuse targeting migrants means many in the MPP program refuse to move to a shelter in the city during their long waits for a U.S. court hearing.\n\nSince July, Matamoros has received more than 12,000 asylum seekers under MPP, said Enrique Maciel, of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency.\n\nMatamoros Mayor Mario Lopez described the city as calmer than neighboring towns, because of a truce between two rival drug cartels. Elsewhere in the state, gangs regularly fight pitched battles for turf.\n\nReuters spoke to six asylum seekers at Osorto\u2019s camp who said they had been kidnapped or extorted, and several more who had brushes with suspected criminals near the border or elsewhere within Mexico.\n\nOscar Ramirez, a 30-year-old Honduran waiting for a U.S. court date on Dec. 2, said three Mexican men surrounded him around midnight last month, and began interrogating him on his plans and his paperwork, he said.\n\n\u201cI was terrified,\u201d said Ramirez, who said he ran away from the men when a crowd of people arrived. \u201cThe rumors circulating are that at any moment unknown people will kidnap you.\u201d\n\nReuters was unable to independently corroborate the migrants\u2019 stories. Osorto said he did not report the attack on him to police.\n\nKristin Clarens, a U.S. attorney who advises asylum-seekers at the border, said she had come across five cases of migrants in Matamoros awaiting MPP hearings who were kidnapped briefly. They were taken to an ATM to clear out their accounts or forced to phone relatives to send cash transfers to a nearby convenience store.\n\nA spokesman for Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Migration said it had no data on such complaints. Mexico\u2019s national rights ombudsman said it was checking for data.\n\nThe Tamaulipas state Attorney General\u2019s Office and the federal Attorney General\u2019s Office declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about the dangers in Tamaulipas.\n\nTOO AFRAID TO GO TO SHELTER\n\nIn Osorto\u2019s camp, asylum seekers use water from the Rio Grande to wash, despite outbreaks of rashes. Women pay a small fee to use a nearby toilet. For food, tents, and the occasional yoga mat to lie on they depend on volunteers from across the border.\n\nAt night, couples take turns keeping watch over their children, fearful criminals will snatch them if they both sleep.\n\nEarly last month, a Honduran mother and daughter seeking asylum drowned in the river near the camp, in what the Honduran foreign ministry said was an act of desperation after three month\u2019s wait in Mexico.\n\nGlady Canas, director of Matamoros-based migrant-aid nonprofit Helping Them to Triumph, said she has tried in vain to convince families to move into the city\u2019s lone migrant shelter and its neat dormitories.\n\n\u201cATTACKING OUR MINDS\u201d\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court decision last month allowed the Trump administration to reject asylum for anyone who passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and did not apply for asylum there.\n\nTrump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico unless it stopped more migrants, and the U.S. neighbor has since used its military police to contain migration northward.\n\nClarens, the U.S. attorney, said Trump\u2019s policies were effectively blocking most routes to asylum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a complicated chess game and this is like checkmate,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the Matamoros camp, asylum-seekers fret on a shared What\u2019s App group, or aloud, while trying to discern U.S. policy means for them.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cThey are attacking our minds,\u201d 27-year-old Oscar Borjas, said of shifting U.S. policy, shuffling a deck of cards late one night in an alleyway between tents.\n\nOsorto, who fled violence in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, said fear and a feeling of being powerless were inescapable.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go downtown because they say it\u2019s more dangerous,\u201d he said. But wincing as he glanced out over the tents, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do here.\u201d", "description": "Even after he was kidnapped and robbed outside the makeshift migrant camp where he had slept for two weeks, Luis Osorto decided his only chance for eventual asylum in the United States was to stay put along the border just inside Mexico.", "authors": ["Delphine Schrank", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441471873&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F11A", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
