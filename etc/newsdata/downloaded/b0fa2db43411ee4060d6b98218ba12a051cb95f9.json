She could do it by going for walks with her family, walking on the treadmill watching TV, just moving her body in a non-intense way.\"\n\n2. 7 hours of sleep per night: \"Sleep is such an important thing, especially for a mom with three little kids at home and a big business. [Simpson] got at least 7 hours of quality, continuous sleep every night.\"\n\n3. 1 hour away from technology daily: \"No cellphone, laptop or tablet ... That\u2019s really important to control the hormones in our brain that are overwhelmed by the blue light on our phone, by the vibrations and alerts of our technology and the cortisol that\u2019s released.\"\n\n4. 3 meals, 2 snacks per day: \"Meals had protein, fiber and healthy fat. Snacks had protein and fat or protein and fiber. We did not diet in a tasteless, extreme, radical way. [Simpson] loves Tex-Mex flavors so she had a lot of healthy versions of Tex-Mex foods.\"\n\n5. Circuit workouts for exercise: \"We had her doing three to four days a week of resistance exercise, a circuit of a few different body parts per day. We\u2019d pick different body parts each of the three or four workouts a week.\"\n\nPasternak points out that the course of Simpson's dramatic weight loss included her giving birth to her 10 lbs., 13 oz daughter, Birdie Mae Johnson, and her body letting go of fluid and weight from her pregnancy.\n\nHe credits Simpson for her \"fantastic attitude\" and hard work and said that just like the singer's open-book weight journey is relatable, so too is the way she accomplished her most recent weight loss.\n\n\"There is no magic diet that is the end all and be all,\" said Pasternak, who recently launched Sweetkick, a tool to help sugar cravings. \"If you take enough steps per day, you don\u2019t need to starve yourself food wise, and if you eat properly, you don\u2019t need to run a marathon.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s by doing moderate amounts of aerobic activity per day, and in this case we count them as steps, and eating a balanced, moderate diet with a low-sugar lifestyle, that\u2019s essential,\" he said.", "description": "Celebrity trainer Harley Pasternak had Simpson email him daily for accountability.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jessica-simpson-ht-jef-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
