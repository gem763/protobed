Reeves said that capital will go towards cementing partnerships, both in the cryptocurrency and retail space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be rolling out subscription options for merchants and consumers soon that will provide premium services and highest rewards,\u201d Reeves said, adding:\n\n\u201cWhen people spend fiat at retailers they will receive BTC rewards. They can spend those rewards or withdraw them to an on-chain address. In the future, we are releasing an update that allows people to withdraw rewards directly to lightning, which will lower fees and make it more usable.\u201d\n\nIn short, the app can be connected to a debit card for bitcoin-back on regular purchases through the app, or users can send bitcoin to the Fold App from their independent wallets. A mobile Fold App with the full features currently available via desktop, Reeves added, is slated for launch in October. Until then, the mobile app is also available to users that sign up through Fold\u2019s website for early access.\n\nCoinShares co-founder Meltem Demirors told CoinDesk Fold App is unique, compared to other retail-focused bitcoin apps, because it encourages users to use non-custodial wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to work not only with Fold, but also with our community of portfolio companies, corporate partners, and other service providers to build an integrated user experience around bitcoin payments,\u201d she said.\n\nLightning ecosystem\n\nWhile there are several other retail-focused crypto apps gaining traction, like Lolli and Flexa, Fold is the most focused on lightning payments. Fold App is already integrated with two lightning-friendly wallets, BlueWallet and Breez. This is what attracted Fulgur Ventures partner Oleg Mikhalsky to the investment.\n\n\u201cWe believe the lightning network has the ability to become an interesting payments rail for various applications due to features like instant final settlement, cost-efficient micro-transactions, the ability to \u2018stream\u2019 payments and the support of other assets over Lightning in the future,\u201d Mikhalsky told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n\u201cWe, as investors, are in a learning mode as well. We\u2019re placing our bets on different types of applications and models and learning from them. Supporting startups that experiment with how to drive adoption is one of our priorities.\u201d\n\nLolli told CoinDesk in July that it, too, was planning to eventually add lightning options. So it remains to be seen how the retail app race will play out.\n\nIn the meantime, Fold is offering a type of crypto training wheels to retailers like Macy\u2019s, Target and Amazon. On the merchant side, they only see a payment processed by Fold, not the users\u2019 credit card or bitcoin wallet address. This offers more privacy than directly shopping via the merchant\u2019s website. Fold then cashes out the payment for merchants, which typically choose to receive the value in fiat.\n\n\u201cWe can settle in fiat or bitcoin, yet all major merchants choose to settle in fiat now so they don\u2019t take volatility risk or accounting overhead,\u201d Reeves said, adding:\n\n\u201cFold can seamlessly transition them when they are ready because we are already directly integrated into their point-of-sale systems.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s image via Shutterstock", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1469735225.jpg"}
