His only bogey came on the par-4 second hole.\n\nOrganizers of the PGA Tour's first tournament in Japan took the unusual step of closing the Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club course to spectators for Saturday's second round over safety concerns.\n\nTorrential rain caused flooding and mudslides Friday in towns east of Tokyo, leaving at least nine people dead and expanding damage in areas still recovering from recent typhoons.\n\nWoodland, who shared the lead with Woods after the first round, had five birdies including three straight from the par-3 16th.\n\nTiger Woods of the United States watches his shot on the 4th hole during the second round of the Zozo Championship PGA Tour at the Accordia Golf Narashino country club in Inzai, east of Tokyo, Japan, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019.
