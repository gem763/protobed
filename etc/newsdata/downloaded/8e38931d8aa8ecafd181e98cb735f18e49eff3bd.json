REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nWith just three weeks to go before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc, it is still unclear on what terms it will leave or indeed whether it will at all.\n\nIreland holds the key to any deal. It will have to consent to any solution to the hardest Brexit riddle of all: how to prevent the British province of Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s markets without having border controls.\n\nThe EU fears controls on the 500-km (300 mile) Irish border with Northern Ireland would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended three decades of sectarian and political conflict that killed over 3,600 people.\n\nAs both sides position for another delay followed by a British election, or an acrimonious divorce on Oct. 31, Johnson met Varadkar at Thornton Manor in Cheshire on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal,\u201d Johnson and Varadkar said in a joint statement. \u201cBoth continue to believe that a deal is in everybody\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cThey agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them,\u201d they said.\n\nSterling rose as high as $1.2275 on their words.\n\nEU diplomats, though, are sceptical about the chances of a deal. Most expect Johnson to be forced to accept a delay to Brexit - a step that could ultimately lead to either a disorderly exit or the reversal of the entire Brexit endeavour.\n\nAlthough Johnson has insisted Britain that will leave the EU on Oct. 31 even if no agreement is reached, the British parliament has passed a law saying it cannot do so.\n\nIRELAND\n\nBrexit descended into a public row between London and Brussels this week after a Downing Street source said a Brexit deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.\n\nIreland is the biggest issue of disagreement.\n\nThe Irish border has been largely invisible since army checkpoints were taken down after the 1998 peace deal largely ended the violence between the region\u2019s pro-British majority and an Irish nationalist minority.\n\nPoliticians have warned that the re-imposition of physical infrastructure on the border when it becomes the EU\u2019s external frontier would anger Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland who aspire to unification with the Republic of Ireland, and help militants opposed to the peace deal to recruit new members.\n\nTo get around the problem, the EU agreed an insurance policy - known as the backstop - last November with Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement that May struck says the United Kingdom will remain in a customs union \u201cunless and until\u201d alternative arrangements are found to avoid a hard border.\n\nBut Johnson said that was undemocratic, undermined the unity of the United Kingdom and would keep it trapped in the EU\u2019s orbit for years to come.\n\nHe proposed an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods. Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs area along with the rest of the United Kingdom and the province\u2019s institutions would be able to opt to exit the regulatory zone - a step too far for Ireland and the EU.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar said they had discussed consent and customs.\n\nThough Ireland is only about an eighth of the size of the United Kingdom\u2019s $2.8 trillion economy, Dublin is backed by the rest of the EU whose economy - minus the United Kingdom - is worth $15.9 trillion.\n\nWhile Ireland would be very badly affected by a no-deal Brexit, the relative importance of Ireland in the negotiations up-ends centuries of history in which it has had a much weaker hand than London, both before and after winning independence from Britain.\n\nThe EU\u2019s two most powerful leaders, Germany\u2019s Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, will meet at the Elysee Palace on Sunday ahead of next week\u2019s summit.\n\n\u201cWe want to reduce the negative effects, even if there is a disorderly Brexit, in both countries,\u201d Merkel said.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nMacron said on Thursday that Britain would have to pay the price should it decide to proceed with a position over Brexit that is unacceptable for the other 27 EU countries.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t want to make any move or make something which is not accepted, they will have to take the responsibility,\u201d he said.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar said they saw a pathway to a possible Brexit deal after a last-ditch meeting aimed at paving a way for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly way.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439153433&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990DJ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
