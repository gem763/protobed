A third makes some of the most popular online games on the planet.\n\nThe global businesses \u2014 Starbucks, Yoshinoya and Activision Blizzard \u2014 would seem far removed from the political discontent in Hong Kong. But to some of the pro-democracy protesters there, and a growing number of their global allies, the companies are seen, rightly or wrongly, as sympathizers with the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, and as legitimate targets for boycotts or even vandalism.\n\nProtesters are documenting what they see as the companies\u2019 ties to China, then circulating the information on mobile apps and websites \u2014 sometimes based on mere rumor, or on comments made by executives or their family members. Starbucks and Yoshinoya have been repeatedly targeted because of the owner of their Hong Kong franchises, while Activision Blizzard, the maker of World of Warcraft, has been subject to boycotts for attempting to censor a pro-democracy p layer in Hong Kong.\n\nThe monthslong protests and their fraught politics are rippling overseas, ensnaring an ever wider range of corporations and executives, no matter their nationality. All have spent years cultivating their brands, but now find their reputations in jeopardy over any suggestion that they don\u2019t support the protesters.", "description": "Pro-democracy demonstrators have begun singling out companies that they consider enemies of their movement.
