Both China and the U.S. put in place new tariffs on imports Sunday, marking the latest escalation in the ongoing trade war. Investor sentiment also was weakened by the news that U.S. manufacturing contracted for the first time in three years.\n\nBut Woodard's call for investors to buy riskier assets emanates from BofAML's Bull & Bear Indicator reaching its lowest levels since January. The sentiment indicator dropped from 2.4 to 1.3 last week, flashing a contrarian buy signal.\n\nThe indicator is based on a 10-point scale and takes into account 18 different inputs, such as fund flows, price action and asset allocation from large and small investors, Woodard said.\n\nThe bank said in a research note Friday that the drop was caused by outflows in emerging market debt and equities, in addition to a quick uptick in Treasury markets.", "description": "Federal Reserve policy and bearish positions from investors make stocks and commodities attractive in the short term, according to BofAML.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102608687-456908418.jpg?v=1532564317"}
