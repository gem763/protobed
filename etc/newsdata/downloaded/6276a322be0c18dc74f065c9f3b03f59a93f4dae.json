Zuckerberg launched the probe in March of last year amid revelations that Trump-linked political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly obtained information on as many 87 million Facebook users. The FTC in July unveiled a $5 billion privacy settlement with Facebook that resolved an investigation into Cambridge Analytica and other issues.\n\nIn May of last year, Facebook had only suspended some 200 apps as part of its internal probe. The company said it has banned some apps, citing one called myPersonality. The company also noted recent instances where it\u2019s sued app developers.\n\nFacebook suggested many of the affected apps were taken down because developers didn't respond to inquiries.\n\n\u201cThis is not necessarily an indication that these apps were posing a threat to people,\u201d Archibong said. \u201cMany were not live but were still in their testing phase when we suspended them.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Facebook\n\nTechnology", "description": "About 400 developers are involved, the social media giant reported.", "authors": ["John Hendel"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7f/1c/9a3db9024bcda9eec9c056d3d54d/190913-facebook-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
