It\u2019s worrying all the left-handers to be honest.\n\n\u201cDavey, again, was lured into playing trying to leave. That\u2019s the second time in the series it\u2019s happened and I think it\u2019s a real mindset thing for him.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s looking to hit the ball and not leave the ball like he is I think he\u2019d be fine.\u201d\n\nBarring his first innings 61 at Headingley, Warner has looked a shell of his normal self, failing to surpass eight runs in his other six innings in the series.\n\nHis second consecutive duck was viewed dimly by Australian cricket media on Thursday, who branded him \u2018Broad\u2019s bunny\u2019 and questioned whether selectors had dumped the wrong man in number three Usman Khawaja.\n\nWarner has had precious little support from his opening partners, with Marcus Harris scoring 13 following his eight and 19 at Headingley.\n\nHarris replaced Cameron Bancroft after the second test, with the Western Australian dumped for a similarly meagre output.\n\nThe opening failures have repeatedly thwarted Australia\u2019s hopes of stealing a march on England and put pressure on Steve Smith, who will resume on 60 not out on day two, to continue to rescue the touring side.\n\nPonting said he had spoken to Warner about ways to combat Broad, who has been honing in on the opener\u2019s stumps rather than seeking to find an edge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said a few things to him about how I thought he could line up and try and play but it\u2019s a different thing to work on that at training and have the courage to go out and try and do that in a test match,\u201d Ponting said.\n\n\u201cWhen you see Davey at his best he\u2019s not really even thinking about leaving those (deliveries), he\u2019s trying to stand up on top of the bounce and hit that through the covers.\u201d", "description": "Stuart Broad has got David Warner's number at the Ashes but the embattled opening batsman can turn it around if he ramps up the aggression against the England paceman, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426429997&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840F6", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
