Prior to his appointment, share prices hit the $20 mark, but now shares are worth $15.", "description": "Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is preparing a third bid to take ownership of Manchester United, as the future of the Glazer family's ownership remains uncertain.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/23/19939212-0-image-a-36_1571523656448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
