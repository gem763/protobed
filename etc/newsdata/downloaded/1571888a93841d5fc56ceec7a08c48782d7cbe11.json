He allegedly assaulted the mother of his then three-year-old son. The charge was eventually withdrawn in exchange for a peace bond, but Major League Baseball still suspended Osuna for 75 games without pay.\n\nDue to the off-the-field ugliness, the Astros were able to acquire Osuna on the relative cheap, sending Ken Giles, David Paulino, and Hector Perez to the Blue Jays. Osuna has been mostly great for the Astros since the trade, finishing the 2018 season with 12 saves, a 1.99 ERA, and a 19/3 K/BB ratio in 22 2/3 innings in his new uniform. This year, Osuna racked up an American League-high 38 saves with a 2.63 ERA and a 73/12 K/BB ratio in 65 innings.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith the Astros holding a 4-2 lead in the top of the ninth in ALCS Game 6 against the Yankees, manager A.J. Hinch called on Osuna to get the final three outs to send his team to the World Series. He ended up allowing a leadoff single to Gio Urshela, then a game-tying two-run home run to DJ LeMahieu. Nevertheless, the Astros won it in the bottom of the ninth thanks to Jos\u00e9 Altuve\u2019s walk-off two-run homer off of Aroldis Chapman.\n\nIn the postgame celebration, Stephanie Apstein of Sports Illustrated reports that Astros assistant general manager Brandon Taubman yelled towards a group of three female reporters, \u201cThank god we got Osuna! I\u2019m so \u2026 glad we got Osuna!\u201d Taubman repeated the phrase half a dozen times. One of the reporters was wearing a purple domestic violence awareness bracelet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Astros declined to comment on the issue and did not make Taubman available for an interview. That shouldn\u2019t come as a shock because the Astros have organizationally failed repeatedly to meaningfully address Osuna\u2019s behavior. GM Jeff Luhnow released a poorly thought out statement last July about Osuna, claiming that the Astros\u2019 due diligence was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d and citing that Osuna is \u201cremorseful\u201d and \u201cwillingly complied with all consequences,\u201d despite pleading not guilty and not having had his day in court yet, thus no consequences. The Astros released another statement in August defending their belief that \u201cRoberto deserved a second chance.\u201d\n\nLater that month, Osuna went after his critics, saying, \u201cEverybody is judging me for things they don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d In the postseason, teammate Ryan Pressly defended Osuna from a heckler, telling the fan, \u201cYou can talk all the sh\u2013 you want. Just don\u2019t bring that stuff up.\u201d\n\nThe Astros also kicked out a fan who protested Osuna\u2019s presence by holding up a sign displaying a domestic violence hotline number. After receiving plenty of criticism for that, the Astros decided to display flyers, featuring the National Domestic Violence Hotline number, in women\u2019s restrooms at Minute Maid Park.\n\nTaubman\u2019s behavior is not the first strike for the Astros on this issue. Acquiring Osuna was strike one. Luhnow\u2019s statement and the club\u2019s subsequent statement were strikes two and three. Osuna\u2019s backlash was strike four, Pressly\u2019s defense of him was strike five, and the whole issue over the DV hotline sign was strike six. The Astros are in danger of having the side strike out on this issue.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that Luhnow worked for McKinsey and Company, a management consulting firm, before getting into baseball. McKinsey has been consulting for the Astros since 2017, The Athletic\u2019s Evan Drellich reported in July. McKinsey has, ahem, a checkered past.\n\nThe Astros have clearly and intentionally thrown ethics to the side in order to run a baseball-related business. That they have repeatedly mishandled a very serious domestic violence issue within the sport shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, and it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the Astros are hoping the issue goes away with the World Series set to begin on Tuesday.\n\nUpdate: The Astros released a statement. Via Chandler Rome of the Houston Chronicle:\n\nThe story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible. An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed towards any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\n\nThe Astros had an initial chance to respond to the story before publication and didn\u2019t take Sports Illustrated up on it. They also didn\u2019t deny that Taubman said what was reported. They\u2019re disputing the context and the intended audience, but that doesn\u2019t really make them look that much better. Perhaps an organization with a less spotty history would get the benefit of the doubt, the Astros certainly haven\u2019t earned it.\n\nFurthemore, Hunter Atkins of the Houston Chronicle and Hannah Keyser of Yahoo Sports both confirmed Apstein\u2019s report. Atkins tweeted, \u201cThe Astros called this @stephapstein report misleading. It is not. I was there. Saw it. And I should\u2019ve said something sooner.\u201d", "description": "Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman reportedly yelled, \"Thank God we got Osuna!\" at a group of female reporters after the club advanced to the World Series.", "authors": ["Bill Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u1g1O5nDDu67je.HpdW9Ew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EDLB.CV7y67oxtoMb5C.8g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/33fe77c6f26792f0c6999d678ee90fcd", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
