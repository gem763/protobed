It was the longest-range weapon Kims regime has tested since his last intercontinental ballistic missile test in November 2017 -- a move that may be designed to increase its bargaining leverage ahead of Saturdays working-level negotiations.\n\nThe first launch of a submarine-based missile in roughly three years also demonstrates Kims progress toward a two-pronged nuclear deterrent capable of quick strikes on the U.S. and its allies from mobile launchers on land and hard-to-track submarines. North Koreas antiquated, meager air force isnt regarded as a threat in a region that contains the technologically-advanced warplanes of the U.S., Japan and South Korea.\n\nIt creates new complications, and while allied anti-submarine warfare capabilities are robust, the prospect of nuclear weapons flushed out to sea during a crisis could raise the stakes considerably, said Ankit Panda, a weapons expert at the Federation of American Scientists. Kims sitting out this test suggests a degree of concern about his image or perhaps an attempt to calibrate how provocative this looks to the United States, he said.\n\nNorth Korea Tests Trumps Limits With Submarine Missile Launch\n\nPentagon officials on Thursday cast doubt on whether the missile really was launched from a submarine, saying the U.S. analysis suggests it was fired from a sea-based platform.\n\nNorth Korea has lauded what it says is a special chemistry between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who have met three times since June 2018. Despite their historic meetings that have included smiles and handshakes, there has been almost nothing to show in terms of North Koreas denuclearization.\n\nKim has typically been on hand as North Korea has fired off at least 20 missiles in 11 different military tests since breaking a testing freeze in May. Up until Wednesday, all of the missiles have been short range -- tests Trump has brushed off as routine and said dont violate the promise Kim made to him to halt tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear devices.\n\nBut the Pukguksong-3 is estimated to have a range of about 1,900 kilometers, making it an intermediate-range ballistic missile that raises the threat of an attack from a submarine on U.S. military assets in Japan and perhaps even the U.S. territory of Guam, which lies about 3,300 kilometers from Wonsan.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jon Herskovitz in Tokyo at jherskovitz@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Jon Herskovitz, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n2019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- North Korea called the first test of its new submarine-launched ballistic missile a major boost for its national security, saying it strengthens its hand to defend itself against adversaries.The Thursday report from the official Korean Central News Agency also said that leader Kim Jong", "authors": ["Jon Herskovitz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fy55HkKyh2re1.9qbU.qiw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f56a7a10d11a45aaec110172a234f54e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
