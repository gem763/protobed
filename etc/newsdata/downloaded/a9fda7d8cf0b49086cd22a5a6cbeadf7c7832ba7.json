And we should be,\u201d Seitz said.\n\nThe cruise company is about halfway through a five-year probation sentence for a 2016 criminal pollution conviction.\n\nChairman Micky Arison, who also owns the Miami Heat, and CEO Arnold Donald both insisted the company is doing a lot, but that it takes time to implement real changes at a company with 120,000 employees, more than 100 cruise ships and nine different brands.\n\nCarnival Corp.

It was hit with a $20 million penalty, on top of a $40 million fine imposed in the original case.\n\nCarnival pleads guilty to pollution, probation violations: Cruise line fined $20M\n\nThe environmental problems included allowing plastic to be discharged along with food into water; dumping \u201cgray water\u201d in prohibited places such as Alaska\u2019s Glacier Bay National Park; and permitting a corporate culture to persist that does not value compliance with environmental laws.\n\nRichard Udell, a Justice Department lawyer specializing in environmental enforcement, cited the recent inability of Carnival to detail what happens to the estimated 50 million plastic bottles used on its ships each year. Carnival, he said, simply told the government they don\u2019t keep track of that because they are all supposedly recycled at some of its 700 destinations.\n\nProsecutors want to know if that is really the case, or if often the bottles simply get dumped in the ocean or in landfills by other entities where Carnival ships dock.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t look, we won\u2019t know, and if we don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t care,\u201d Udell said. \u201cWe hope that we can get past this.\u201d\n\nCarnival outlined many steps it is taking to phase out use of plastics on its ships, including the bottles, and that it would look deeper into the recycling issue. And Donald, the CEO, said the company\u2019s leadership is making every effort to value environmental compliance just as much as ship safety and guest hospitality.\n\n\u201cCompliance, environmental protection, safety \u2013 it\u2019s the first thing,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWithout it, we don\u2019t have a business.\u201d\n\nAnother status hearing is set for December.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2019/10/03/carnival-cruise-line-not-doing-enough-to-clean-up-pollution/3850107002/", "description": "A judge says Carnival, now halfway through a five-year probation period for a criminal pollution conviction, isn't doing enough to clean up its act.", "authors": ["Curt Anderson", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
