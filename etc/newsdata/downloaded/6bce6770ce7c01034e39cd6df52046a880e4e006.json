We know this time while they\u2019re little is fleeting. We know one day we\u2019ll look back and wish we\u2019d gotten down on the floor to play with the trains more, had read to them more or had lingered longer over their endless questions. But the thing is, there\u2019s still dinner to make, baths to dole out, and work and errands and laundry and everything else.\n\nWhen I asked earlier this week what type of pieces you wanted to see more of on Lifehacker, reader \u201cBekahcubed\u201d came in with a specific request: How can I find time to connect with each child when life is already so busy?\n\nAs a parent of many young children (including foster kids) ... I can\u2019t necessarily spend a half hour alone with each kid every day to make sure they know that they\u2019re special, but what are some questions I can be asking myself to help me identify those little, less time-intensive things that are going to pack a big punch in letting each child know how special he or she is?\n\nSo I went on a mission to find some ideas, and I gave myself a limit of five minutes per connection. We might not have a half hour, but we probably do have five minutes to connect \u2014 and we might even be able to incorporate that connection into the routines we already have in place.\n\nSing while you brush\n\nBekahcubed herself started me off with this sweet suggestion: While you\u2019re brushing your kid\u2019s teeth, sing to them.\n\n\u201cOne thing I really enjoy \u2014 and that I\u2019ve found to be more useful than I could have imagined \u2014 is singing to each child as I brush their teeth,\u201d she says. \u201cI sing \u2018You are My Sunshine,\u2019 except that I ask the (verbal) kids what they want me to sing in place of \u2018sunshine.\u2019 It gives me a lot of insight into what the kids are thinking and feeling. My four-year-old wants me to sing \u2018You are my baby\u2019? She\u2019s feeling a bit needy and needs some extra snuggles.\u201d\n\nHave a meeting\n\nEvery night before bedtime, Lifehacker reader Laura hosts a family meeting. \u201cWe call it to order and everyone states their new business,\u201d Laura says. \u201cMy husband and I use it as the time to tell our 4-year-old (or each other) something that made us happy or that we\u2019re grateful for or looking forward to. The 4-year-old\u2019s new business is usually to do a summersault.\u201d\n\nThere are lots of variations on this. You can do \u201chighs and lows\u201d or \u201crose and thorn\u201d during dinner or at bedtime, where everyone shares both the best part of their day and the hardest. But I especially like the official feel of Laura\u2019s meeting being \u201ccalled to order.\u201d\n\nJump in, jump out\n\nYou might not be able to sit down for 45 minutes for some elaborate one-on-one playtime with your kids. But it doesn\u2019t always have to be a big commitment. Reader Anderson looks for little moments to join in on the action.\n\n\u201cI jump into the middle of whatever the kids are doing for 5 minutes, knowing that I\u2019m short on time,\u201d he says. \u201cBe it playing tag at the park, watching TV, or playing games. Sometime, 5 minutes is enough for us to stay connected.\u201d\n\nMake it fancy\n\nReader Clovis says her husband is Jewish and she\u2019s enjoyed the tradition of Shabbos. Whether you\u2019re religious or not, her suggestions are a great way to make a meal feel a bit more special with little effort.\n\n\u201cFancy place-settings, candles, special prayers and blessings, kids\u2019 favourites for dinner alongside juice \u2014 which we don\u2019t have in the house otherwise \u2014 in stemware, etc.,\u201d Clovis says. \u201cAnd we always use it as a time to talk about general things that don\u2019t always make the daily rundown. How are their friendships going? Did they have a frustration that week? Are there any longer-term goals they hope to try for? That sort of thing. It doesn\u2019t really take that long, but it feels special and like a good opportunity for everyone to hear each other a little better.\u201d\n\nSneak them a note\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love to find a note from someone they love tucked inside a lunch bag, a suitcase or a back pack? It only takes a minute to do and it creates a moment of connection between you and your child when you\u2019re not even together.\n\n\u201cI slip Post-it Notes in random places for both my kiddo and my partner \u2014 messages of thanks for things they\u2019ve done, praise for something they worked hard on, random \u2018I love yous,\u2019\u201d reader Jamie says. \u201cThey both LOVE finding them and when I haven\u2019t left one in a while, I get complaints.\u201d\n\nIf your child can\u2019t read yet, you could draw a picture instead.\n\nSet the timer\n\nYou might wish you could snuggle your kids all morning, but how often do we have all morning? Not very often. How often do we have a few minutes? Eh, once in a while; but when we do, we could take advantage of it like Jackie does.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a 5- and 7-year-old and a double papasan,\u201d Jackie says. \u201cWe had three whole extra minutes this morning before we had to leave the house to catch the bus. Told Alexa to set a three-minute timer and snuggled.\u201d\n\nCreate a secret handshake\n\nThis is something my husband does with our son (and also with one of our former foster sons) \u2014 create a special handshake with your kid. This is great with an only child, but it\u2019s extra great with more than one child because each handshake will be unique and something you came up with together. Every few months, my husband and son switch it up and adapt the handshake or come up with something new entirely.\n\nDo you have time for all of these ideas? Doubtful. But you probably have five minutes to give one of them a try today. (And if you have other ideas, please leave them in the comments; I like variety.)", "description": "It would be great if we had all the time in the world to connect with our kids.
