It is also a very expensive phone and thus spending $39.95 for a UAG Plasma case is a smart investment. It is currently available in the Ash color.\n\nThe LG G8 ThinQ is another new phone, see our full review, and while it is an affordable flagship at $620, it is also worth protecting for $29.95 with the Scout series case. The LG G8 slides off of everything so the Scout case helps prevent that situation.", "description": "Urban Armor Gear (UAG) is known for making lightweight, attractive cases for the latest smartphones and has models available for the latest from LG and Huawei.
