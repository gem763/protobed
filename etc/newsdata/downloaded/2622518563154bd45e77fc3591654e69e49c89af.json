The drugs had come from Morocco and were due to be offloaded on the Costa del Sol for distribution in Spain and possibly other parts of Europe.\n\nSpain's proximity to Morocco has helped make it the gateway into Europe for cannabis.\n\nThe drugs had come from Morocco and were due to be offloaded on the Costa del Sol\n\nLast month footage emerged of a group of smugglers taking over a beach near the Costa del Sol resort of Estepona in broad daylight to transport cannabis resin from a speedboat to a 4x4 parked by the shoreline.\n\nThe gang of men, who threatened to kill witnesses if they alerted police, took less than three minutes to make the transfer and their getaway from the beach.\n\nOne sun-seeker in black swimming trunks and a white cap could be seen looking on from a few feet away as the incredible scene unfolded before his eyes.\n\nThe men filmed running from the boat to the 4x4 and dumping the drugs into the back almost stumbled over two groups of sunbathers lying on towels on the sand as they sprinted between them with the bags of cannabis resin on their shoulders to reach the car.", "description": "The men saved the Civil Guard crew in the Mediterranean following a collision off the Costa del Sol holiday resort of Mijas near Malaga.
