Multiple states that have rejected the proposed settlement have accused the family of improperly stripping billions of dollars out of the company\u2019s coffers in the past decade to protect the cash from expected court judgments.\n\n\u201cThe controversial piece is going to be about how much the Sacklers need to kick in for the deal to work,\u2019\u2019 said Adam J. Levitin, a professor specializing in bankruptcy at Georgetown Law.\n\nUnder the settlement announced last week, more than 2,000 small government plaintiffs and 24 states have agreed to the dissolution of the company and a contribution from the Sacklers, valued at $10 billion to $12 billion. But the settlement valuation is in dispute, and a number of states have balked at those terms.\n\nThe settlement, which does not include any admission of wrongdoing, would reorganize Purdue during the bankruptcy into a trust that would continue to produce OxyContin, as well as overdose \u201crescue\u2019\u2019 drugs that would be distributed at no cost to communities across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful of and expectant that a growing number of states will see this is a much better outcome for them than for us to go into the swamp of litigation that would basically eat up all the resources of the company,\u2019\u2019 Purdue Chairman Steve Miller said in a conference call with reporters Sunday night.\n\nA person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss non-public company matters, said Purdue has spent $250 million on litigation costs this year.\n\nThe proposed minimum contribution from the Sackler family of $3 billion, which could be derived from the sale of a related, family-owned international drug company called Mundipharma, has been called insufficient by state attorneys general who have rejected the plan.\n\nNew York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and other states argue that the Sackler family has far more money stashed in a number of trusts and investment firms, including in offshore tax havens such as the Channel Islands, that should be made available to plaintiffs. Forbes has estimated the Sackler family\u2019s total worth at $13 billion.\n\nThe family is expected to argue that billions of dollars moved out of Purdue Pharma were legitimate dividends. Levitin said there will be restrictions on what can be \u201cclawed back\u2019\u2019 from the family\u2019s far-flung financial empire, partly because state statutes of limitations prevent plaintiffs from examining transactions going back more than a few years.\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers are going to be left with plenty of money after this,\u2019\u2019 Levitin said. \u201cThere is a desire that the Sacklers pay some blood money, but it\u2019s never going to be enough to make everyone happy.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Sackler family Sunday night issued a statement calling the settlement and bankruptcy a \u201chistoric step\u2019\u2019 to address a \u201ctragic public health situation.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is our hope the bankruptcy reorganization process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit,\u2019\u2019 the family said.\n\nDrug companies seek removal of judge in opioid case\n\nUnder terms of the tentative settlement, bankruptcy will spell the end, at least in its current form, of a company that three immigrant Sackler brothers bought in 1952. By the late 1990s, the Sacklers had turned Purdue into a highly profitable enterprise by selling oxycodone tablets under the brand name OxyContin. The company marketed OxyContin as a safer form of narcotic painkiller when it was introduced in 1996, because of its time-release properties, but the drug was blamed for a sharp rise in addiction, prescription drug abuse and fatal overdoses.\n\nWidespread sale of the drug, as well as generic versions and other oxycodone and hydrocodone tablets that were widely sold by a handful of big companies, also set the stage for subsequent waves of heroin and fentanyl abuse in communities throughout the country, especially Appalachia, according to authorities.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have died of prescription opioid overdoses since 1999. Another 200,000 have died from overdoses attributed to heroin and illegally obtained fentanyl.\n\nBy 2007, the company and three top executives \u2014 none of them Sackler family members \u2014 pleaded guilty to federal charges of misleading regulators, doctors and patients about the highly addictive nature of the drug. The company paid more than $600 million in fines and other payments.\n\nYet, Purdue Pharma, under the family\u2019s tight control, continued to aggressively market OxyContin and kept fueling the growing epidemic of narcotic addiction, according to a raft of litigation filed against the company. Lawsuits also are pending against generic oxycodone manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacy chains.\n\nAs sales continued into the billions of dollars, the family board members who controlled the company began transferring big chunks of money out of the firm beginning in 2008, according to multiple state lawsuits.\n\n\u201cBetween 2008 and 2018, they directed Purdue to make nearly $11 billion in total distributions (including tax distributions) to partnered companies, foreign entities, and ultimately to trusts established for the benefit of the Sackler families,\u2019\u2019 said recently unsealed portions of a lawsuit filed this year by Oregon\u2019s attorney general.\n\nSuch transfers were cited last week by some of the 26 states that rejected the tentative settlement agreement. Those states also said the $10 billion to $12 billion price tag put on the settlement appears inflated.\n\nBut Paul Hanly, co-lead counsel for plaintiffs suing Purdue, said the local governments accepted the tentative settlement because it\u2019s a better bet than the alternative, which he called \u201cprobably a decade or more in the bankruptcy court, at the end of which will probably be a ham sandwich left over for our clients, the communities that are suffering.\u201d\n\nJoel Achenbach and Lenny Bernstein contributed to this report.", "description": "The move by the OxyContin producer, part of a tentative legal settlement, sets the stage for battles over the Sackler family fortune.", "authors": ["Christopher Rowland", "Business Reporter Focused On The Health-Care Economy'S Effects On Patient Health", "Costs"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P32HYMGX7YI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
