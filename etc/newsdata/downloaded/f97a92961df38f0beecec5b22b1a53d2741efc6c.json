I looked at all of the transactions and I couldn\u2019t get my head around why it didn\u2019t ring alarm bells that he wanted her to send the money to Nigeria and not the US.\n\n\u201cI Googled his picture and realised he was an American soldier who\u2019d died in 2012.\n\nHis picture had been used by scammers all over the world. The trust between us was gone and we broke up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been together more than 20 years and I thought I knew everything about her. I was wrong.\u201d\n\nResearch by UK Finance, the voice of the banking and finance industry, shows romance fraud rose by nearly a third in the first half of this year.

I was mortified. When it finally hit me, I had suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cFinancially, I\u2019ve been ruined. I\u2019ll be paying people back a long time. I hope others can learn from my mistakes.\u201d\n\nThis week, a great-grandmother told how she gave \u00a38,000 to fraudsters after her partner died.\n\nSally Jones, 74, joined a dating site as she was \u201clooking for someone to play cards with\u201d.\n\nShe was matched with a man called Harry, who sent her flowers and champagne but begged her to make huge money transfers via Western Union.\n\nShe said: \u201cEveryone wants to be loved. But if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d\n\nShe came to her senses after the scammer refused to meet in person.\n\nSally, of Littlehampton, West Sussex, lied to her daughters about where the money was going.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt could have torn my family apart.\u201d\n\nSusan Perry, 73, was contacted online by a man who said his name was Gideon and soon afterwards she sent him \u00a340,000.

If you are chatting to 20 different women, you\u2019re more likely to get someone to send you money. And the issue with any type of fraud is that, with the way police funding has gone, it\u2019s not necessarily a priority.\n\n\u201cAction Fraud have a huge backlog of cases but there are few convictions for romance fraud.\n\n\"Cases can be hard to prove when the offender is not in the country. Also the CPS looks at a case based on the financial loss to the individual.\n\n\"A scam could have a considerable emotional impact on an individual, but if the victim sent the scammer \u00a3650 for a plane ticket and that was the end of it, it\u2019s going to go to the bottom of the pile.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Thousands of lives - and marriages - are being ruined every year by online fraudsters, including Steve Roberts, whose wife sent \u00a320,000 to an evil scammer", "authors": ["Geraldine Mckelvie", "Image", "Peter Powell", "Internet Grab"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728743.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-Steve-Roberts.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
