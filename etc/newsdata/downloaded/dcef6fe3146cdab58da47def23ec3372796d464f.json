I felt forced into using Linden\u2019s own solicitor by a time limited offer made to me, which Linden stated no other solicitor could possibly match.\n\n\"At no time during all my visits to this property did anyone mention that the boundary was in the wrong place or that 17 square metres would be removed from my home over the next five years.\n\n\u201cI was rushed to sign the legal information from the solicitor. With the benefit of hindsight, the letter does say amended plans that the red edging correctly shows the extent of the but the scale given makes it almost impossible for the average person to detect any discrepancies.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"I was rushed into signing the legal documents from the solicitor. With the benefit of hindsight, the letter received on the planned completion date does say amended plans and that the Land Registry red edging correctly shows the extent of the land you believe you are purchasing.\n\n\"However, the scale of 500 to one makes it almost impossible for the average person to detect any discrepancies.\n\n\"Even if I has spotted that two millimetre difference, the land registry document I signed in December 2014 clearly states 'no dimensions to be scaled off this drawing'.\n\n\"The property was bought as seen and not off any plans.\"\n\nThe father says the compensation of \u00a31,500 being offered by Linden Homes is an \u2018insult\u2019.\n\nHe said: \"Their customers would probably pay well in excess of \u00a315,000 for that same piece of land.\n\n(Image: DevonLive/WS)\n\n\"I agreed to the first boundary issue in return for curing a serious water problem and the now much smaller front area being paved properly.\n\n\"Now they want more land to gift to my neighbour, but I feel I should be offered a more realistic compensation figure.\"\n\nA spokesman for Linden Homes said: \u201cWith regard to the plans, we\u2019re sorry to hear Mr Hooper is unhappy. We continually strive to deliver the highest levels of customer service, throughout the sales process.\n\n\u201cAs part of our procedures, we ask all of our purchasers to check all relevant plans prior to exchange. Mr Hooper went through this process and signed to confirm that he had done so.\n\n\u201cRegarding the rear boundary issue, unfortunately a fence was put in the wrong place to the rear of two properties at Orestone View.\n\n\"We are trying to correct the issue and move the fence to ensure it is located in accordance with the Land Registry Plans. This requires cooperation from both parties and we hope to resolve this matter as soon as possible.\"", "description": "Linden Homes angered Paul Hooper with the blunder in Paignton, Devon, and now he feels \"deceived\"", "authors": ["Anita Merritt", "Image", "Devonlive Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532456.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-Hooper-has-lost-around-eight-per-cent-of-his-land-in-the-boundary-dispute.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
