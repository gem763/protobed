We would like it to show today the same spirit towards us,\" the Chinese embassy said.\n\nFrance's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "China's embassy in Paris criticises French and European reaction to protests in Hong Kong calling it 'hypocritical'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/a57cf8a00a3f418a871c8d9068d80fc0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
