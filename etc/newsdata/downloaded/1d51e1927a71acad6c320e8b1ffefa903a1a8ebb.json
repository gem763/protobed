And it\u2019s why even a liberal western leader, in a progressive country like Canada, not that long ago thought it was cool to black up his face,\u201d the MP for Tottenham said.\n\nHow will Justin Trudeau's blackface photos affect Canada's election? Read more\n\nTrudeau has apologised for wearing what he now sees as a \u201cracist and hurtful\u201d costume that was unacceptable because of the history of blackface.\n\nIn a passionate address to a Show Racism the Red Card event organised by the union Unite, Lammy told the audience \u201cI\u2019m going to be a bit provocative\u201d, before saying there needed to be more open discussion about white supremacy to try to \u201cunpick\u201d it as a structural problem, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a subject we don\u2019t like to talk about.\n\n\u201cWhite supremacy is not confined to strange men in the Deep South who put on white cloaks, it is not confined to strange gatherings of the English Defence League.\n\nPlay Video Justin Trudeau apologises for blackface incidents \u2013 watch live\n\n\u201cThat is what some would like you to believe it is ... it is a system, it is a structure, it is a structure that began when fake scientists and great people - even Charles Darwin - determined that there were one group of people who more important, more learned, clever, a whole set of attributes that were better than other people of colour.\n\n\u201cIt set up the basis in which most of the western world was built, and it\u2019s very hard to unpick and get underneath that.\n\n\u201cBut unless we are really honest and want to talk about white supremacy, not to guilt people out but to have the conversation, I am afraid you kick out individual racists, but you don\u2019t change the system.\u201d\n\nLammy also renewed his attack on the television presenter Stacey Dooley for displaying \u201cwhite privilege\u201d when she shared a photograph on social media of her holding a black child on a charity visit in Uganda in February, alongside the caption \u201cobsessed\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is not about you Stacey Dooley, it\u2019s about the child. It\u2019s about the village. It\u2019s about why they are poor. They are here because of a history, and a history of white supremacy. So please Stacey Dooley use your platform to talk about that.\u201d\n\nDooley said in February that Lammy could travel to Uganda himself if he wanted to help and questioned whether he had picked her up on her image purely because she was white.\n\nAt the time, the charity Comic Relief thanked her for her work to raise awareness of its project in Uganda.", "description": "Labour MP says Canadian PM\u2019s scandal reveals \u2018even liberal leaders\u2019 succumb to racism", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101c4fdb2a73ecf248cd6419eccab066b3fa26d3/0_3_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e9014a0d6bfdf62a15ec2019d129173", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
