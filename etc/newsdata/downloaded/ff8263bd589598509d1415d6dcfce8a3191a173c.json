That represented 40 percent of civilian casualties from aerial attacks, the report said.\n\nGuterres said armed groups were responsible for 43 percent of child casualties - 3,450 killed and 9,149 wounded.\n\nWhile Taliban fighters were responsible for the majority, the number attributed to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, ISIS) increased overall during the four-year period, he said.\n\nGovernment and pro-government forces were responsible for 30 percent of child casualties, he said.\n\nGuterres said the UN also verified the recruitment and use of 274 children by armed groups and government forces, sexual violence against 13 boys and four girls, and 467 attacks on schools and education personnel.\n\nThe secretary-general said the actual number of children recruited and used in the Afghan conflict \"is estimated to be much higher\", citing as an example allegations in 2016 that more than 3,000 children were recruited, mainly by armed groups.\n\n'Bacha bazi'\n\nGuterres said rape and other forms of sexual violence against children \"is known to be underreported as a result of prevailing social norms, fear of retaliation and impunity\".\n\nIn a study by the UN political mission in Afghanistan between October 2016 and December 2017, he said, people in communities across Afghanistan \"shared their perceptions that the use of boys for the purposes of sexual abuse and exploitation, including bacha bazi, by parties to conflict was common and widespread\".\n\nBacha bazi is a practice in which wealthy or powerful men exploit boys for entertainment, especially dancing and sexual activities.\n\n190906075046290\n\nGuterres cited the case of a boy in Takhar province who was held for about a year by several armed commanders, including national police officials, \"and used for bacha bazi\".\n\nIn an overview of political and security developments in 2015-2018, the secretary-general said the situation deteriorated compared to the previous four years, \"notably following the transfer of responsibility for security from international forces to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in 2014\".\n\nThe following year, he said, the Taliban made \"significant territorial inroads\".\n\nGuterres said in recent months, 45,000 to 65,000 Taliban fighters were reportedly active in Afghanistan \"although estimates vary considerably\".\n\nHe added \"the Haqqani network has assumed an increasingly influential role in the Taliban\u2019s military operations\".\n\nThe secretary-general said al-Qaeda \"is believed to maintain a limited presence in eastern Afghanistan\", while ISIL is also present there \"with 2,500 to 4,000 elements believed to be currently active\".\n\nOperations by Afghan and international forces have constrained ISIL's expansion, Guterres said, and as a result the group has \"increasingly relied on suicide and complex attacks deliberately targeting civilians in large cities\".", "description": "Worsening security in Afghanistan in past four years has led to more than 14,000 violations against children, UN says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/4d44107196e1455481b20e9fe64751aa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
