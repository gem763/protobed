There\u2019s only one reason it hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 we can\u2019t trust you.\"\n\nThe Labour leader slammed Monday's upcoming Queen's Speech as a \"cynical election stunt\".\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"Johnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative Party,\" he added.\n\nThe speech in Northampton summarised Labour's policy offer to the UK in any future election in what he called \"an alternative Queen's speech\".\n\nHe said the party's top priority in government will be to \"finally get Brexit sorted\" after \"three years of Tory failure\".\n\nHe reinterated that the party would legislate for a referendum where the choice \"will be between leaving with a sensible deal or remaining in the European Union.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Corby added that the speech was a \"transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate\".\n\nHe added: \"This is Labour\u2019s plan to change our country, it\u2019s the real thing not the pale imitation offered by Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party.\n\n\"It\u2019s a path to a future where the economy is run for the people, not the privileged, and the government works for you not the vested interests.\n\n\"A future where we tackle the climate emergency and Britain is a force for peace and international justice in the world.\"\n\nRead Jeremy Corbyn's speech in full\n\nThank you for that introduction. It\u2019s great to be here in Northampton.\n\nOn Monday, we will be treated to the farce of Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative government, amid full pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to parliament that it has no intention and no means of delivering.\n\nBecause this government isn\u2019t going to put any legislation before parliament.\n\nIt has a majority of minus 45, a 100 per cent record of defeat in the Commons and is seeking a general election which will rapidly end the parliamentary session the Queen is about to open.\n\nHolding a Queen\u2019s Speech before an election is a cynical stunt.\n\nJohnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative Party.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Johnson was pretending not to want an election. Now he\u2019s pretending that it\u2019s Labour that doesn\u2019t want one.\n\nSo let me address this directly:\n\nPrime minister, we can\u2019t trust you not to break the law because you\u2019ve got form.\n\nWe can\u2019t trust you not to use the period of an election campaign to drive our country off a No Deal cliff edge that will crash our economy, destroy jobs and industries, cause shortages of medicine and food and endanger peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nSo it\u2019s simple: obey the law, take No Deal off the table and then let\u2019s have the election.\n\nWe\u2019re ready and champing at the bit. There\u2019s only one reason it hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 we can\u2019t trust you.\n\nWe might be just weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s Speech of a Labour government.\n\nAnd in that Queen\u2019s Speech, Labour will put forward the most radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times: a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.\n\nIt will:\n\nLet the people decide on Brexit\n\n\n\nBuild an economy that works for all\n\n\n\nChange government so that it works for you\n\n\n\nTackle the climate emergency \u2026\n\n\n\nReset our global role to one based on peace and human rights.\n\nSo today I want to give you a preview of Labour\u2019s plan for real change.\n\nThe first task of a Labour government will be to finally get Brexit sorted.\n\nAfter three years of Tory failure, it\u2019s time to take the decision out of the hands of politicians and let the people have the final say.\n\nSo a Labour government will immediately legislate for a referendum.\n\nThat referendum won\u2019t be a re-run of 2016. No one knew what a deal with the EU would look like back then and the prospect of No Deal was dismissed out-of-hand by leading Leave campaigners, including Boris Johnson.\n\nThis time the choice will be between leaving with a sensible deal or remaining in the European Union.\n\nTwo clear options, both agreed with the EU \u2013 no false promises, no bluster.\n\nSo within three months of coming to power, a Labour government will secure a sensible deal, based on the terms we have long advocated and discussed with the EU, trade unions and businesses, including a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of rights and protections.\n\nWithin six months of being elected we will put that deal to a public vote alongside remain.\n\nAnd as prime minister I will carry out whatever the people decide.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing complicated about that position. It\u2019s really very simple: Labour trusts the people to decide.\n\nLabour is the only party that can and will deliver a public vote.\n\nThe Tories and the Lib Dems have taken increasingly extreme, and frankly undemocratic positions, sowing further division.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives are pushing the country towards No Deal for which they have no mandate, which is opposed by most of the public and which would open the way to a race-to-the-bottom in our rights and protections, to get a one-sided trade deal with Donald Trump .\n\nBut Labour will get Brexit sorted and bring our country together because years of bickering over Brexit has become a barrier to delivering the real change this country needs.\n\nTo do that we need an economy that works for the many not just the few at the top.\n\nToday\u2019s GDP figures show our economy is contracting. We\u2019re on the brink of recession, productivity is down and people's living standards are lower today than 10 years ago.\n\nThat\u2019s the Tory record.\n\nA Labour government will rebuild communities across Britain with investment on a scale our country has never known bringing new jobs and fresh growth to every town, city, region and nation.\n\nWe\u2019ll upgrade our creaking infrastructure with \u00a3250 billion of public investment into energy, housing and transport through a National Transformation Fund and establish a National Investment Bank to make a further \u00a3250 billion available through loans to businesses and co-ops to get our economy moving.\n\nGrotesque inequality isn\u2019t inevitable. It\u2019s the result of a deliberate effort to tip the balance of power away from workers towards the privileged elite that Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives represent.\n\nFor too many people work now means longer hours, more stress and greater insecurity.\n\nPay is still lower than it was a decade ago.\n\nThe Chancellor Sajid Javid has said the minimum wage will not rise above \u00a310 an hour until 2024, and only for those aged 21 and over.\n\nSo a Labour government will immediately raise the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour for all workers from the age of 16.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll deliver the biggest extension of rights for workers our country has ever seen.\n\nWe\u2019ll create a new Ministry of Employment Rights to give workers a seat at the Cabinet table and strengthen the democratic voice of the workforce through collective bargaining.\n\nEvery worker will have full rights on day one of a new job; entitling them to sick pay, holiday pay, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. A new Workers\u2019 Protection Agency will ensure all these rights are properly enforced. And we\u2019ll create a Working Time Commission \u2026 to reduce the average full time working hours to 32 a week within ten years.\n\nBut to truly rebalance power in people\u2019s daily lives we need to go further. So Labour will give workers a say and a stake in their workplace \u2026 by ensuring a third of the seats on company boards are reserved for worker directors ... elected by the workforce.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll require all large companies to create Inclusive Ownership Funds \u2026 giving workers a share of the fruits of their labour \u2026 by paying a dividend of up to \u00a3500 a year.\n\nToo much talent in our country is squandered \u2013 not through any fault of the individual but because austerity has closed down opportunities for people.\n\nI believe the point of government is to do the opposite, to open up opportunities and allow everyone to reach their full potential. That begins with education.\n\nThe Tories have starved our schools of cash and, along with the Liberal Democrats , saddled a generation of young people with a lifelong debt burden.\n\nA Labour government will create a National Education Service providing free education for everyone throughout life, as a right not a privilege. We\u2019ll scrap university tuition fees, give our schools the funding they need, end the academies and free schools programmes and bring all schools into a democratically accountable system.\n\nWe\u2019ll free young children from the unnecessary stress of over-testing by scrapping SATs for 7 and 11 year olds. And because we know early years are the most important, we\u2019ll rebuild Sure Start and introduce universal free childcare for all 2, 3 and 4 year olds.\n\nFor a decade our NHS has been run down, carved up, and prepared for privatisation. A Labour government will reverse this. We\u2019ll repeal the Tory-Lib Dem privatisation Act of 2012. We\u2019ll give our NHS the resources, equipment and staff it needs. That means more GPs and nurses and reduced waiting times. And under Labour prescriptions in England will be free.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll make life-saving medicines available to all by ensuring Big Pharma can no longer hold our NHS to ransom. The prices pharmaceutical companies demand don\u2019t reflect the costs of the drugs they make. They simply charge as much as they can get away with.\n\nWe\u2019ll use compulsory licensing to secure generic versions of patented medicines and create a publicly-owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS, saving our health service money and saving lives.\n\nOnly Labour can be trusted with the future of our NHS.\n\nNearly \u00a38 billion has been taken from councils\u2019 social care budgets since 2010. 87 people die every day while waiting for the care they need. It\u2019s a disgrace, frankly, that we treat our older people in this way.\n\nA Labour government will introduce free personal care providing help with daily tasks like bathing, washing, and preparing meals. This will be the first step to creating a National Care Service, easing the fear of getting older.\n\nIf I told you that our social security system has been \u201cdeliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos\u201d you might think, \u2018Well, he would say that.\u2019\n\nBut if I told you those aren\u2019t my words but the damning verdict of the United Nations, no less, you get a sense of the damage wrought by nine years of Tory austerity.\n\nTheir policy of Universal Credit pushes people into the jaws of loan sharks forces proud men and women to depend on food banks and turfs families out of their homes.\n\nThe Tories promised it would make work pay. But more and more people who are falling into poverty have jobs.\n\nA Labour goverment will change the whole culture of the DWP. It will become the Department for Social Security to give people dignity and respect.\n\nSocial security shouldn\u2019t be about forcing women into the indignity of having to fill out a four-page form to prove their child was born as a result of rape as 500 women had to do last year.\n\nLabour will scrap Universal Credit and introduce an emergency package to immediately end its worst aspects. Ending the benefit cap and the two child limit, which alone will stop up to 300,000 children being pushed into poverty.\n\nAnd, yes, that means the end of the disgusting rape clause.\n\nWe\u2019ll end the five week wait for the first payment, end the Tories' vicious sanctions regime, end the bedroom tax and - because we\u2019re committed to reducing poverty - we\u2019ll end the benefit freeze.\n\nWe\u2019ll control welfare spending by tackling low pay and insecure work ... and rip-off rents. Social security shouldn\u2019t be subsidising bad employers and greedy landlords.\n\nLabour sees a decent home as a right owed to all, not a privilege for the few.\n\nSo we\u2019ll build a million genuinely affordable homes over ten years, the majority for social rent, with the biggest council house-building programme in a generation.\n\nAnd let me say this on World Homeless Day: in the fifth richest country in the world no one should be sleeping rough. We all know it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s Labour that will end rough sleeping.\n\nAfter the horror of Grenfell it\u2019s astonishing that the Tories are still failing to make tower blocks safe. Nine out of ten private blocks with Grenfell-style cladding haven\u2019t had it replaced.\n\nLabour will ensure people aren\u2019t living in death traps. And we will deliver justice for Grenfell.\n\nUnder the Tories, our communities have become less safe. Violent crime has doubled. Think about that next time you see the Prime Minister using police recruits as a backdrop for his latest election gimmick.\n\nA Labour government will increase the number of uniformed officers, PCSOs and police staff. But we know that Tory police cuts are not the only reason violent crime doubled.\n\nIt\u2019s also the wider impact of austerity \u2013 including the closure of youth services. 750 youth centres have closed their doors since 2012. Too many young people today are growing up with nowhere to go and no one to speak to about their lives.\n\nThis is not just about crime. The experiences of our youth can shape our entire lives. It should be a time to discover arts, enjoy sport and develop friendships. So a Labour government will guarantee every young person access to youth services in their community.\n\nWomen have borne the brunt of Tory austerity, turning back the clock on gender equality.\n\nLabour will put women right the heart of our programme for government, creating a standalone department for Women and Equalities, to ensure gender equality is prioritised.\n\nLabour is the Party of equality. We\u2019ll bear down on sexism, racism, homophobia and all forms of discrimination wherever they exist in our economy and society.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll deliver justice for the victims of the Windrush scandal.\n\nThe sickening antisemitic attack on a synagogue in Germany yesterday is a terrifying reminder of where hatred and racism leads.\n\nMany of the measures I\u2019m outlining today will be delivered at the local level by local councils. But local councils and local services have been gutted by the Tories. The ultimate symbol of that is right here in Northamptonshire where the Conservative-run council collapsed. A Labour government will properly fund councils and local services and restore that sense of place and pride that comes from having good local facilities and a thriving, lively high street.\n\nThe same goes for vital basic services we all rely on, which have been carved up and fleeced by their private owners. The privatisation of our utilities, which are natural monopolies, has been a failure. People are sick of paying through the nose for a poor service while billions are handed over to shareholders. So Labour will bring rail, mail, water and the energy grid into public ownership, run by and for the public, not for profit.\n\nAnd a Labour government will take the railways back into public ownership too. We\u2019ll invest in public transport including Crossrail for the North, from Liverpool to Hull and up to Newcastle. We\u2019ll reinstate bus routes and establish municipal companies making free bus travel available to the under-25s while maintaining the pensioner bus pass. Our public transport network is falling apart just when the climate emergency means we need it most.\n\nTo have any hope of keeping global temperature rises to a manageable level we need immediate and radical action. I\u2019d like to thank groups like the Climate Strikers and Extinction Rebellion for educating us and pushing the issue to the top of the agenda.\n\nThe government\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is too late and the Tories are doing little to meet it \u2013 in fact investment in clean energy has fallen for three years running. A Labour government is fully signed up to a Green New Deal. We are already working closely with trade unions and the scientific community to develop the most radical climate targets in the world.\n\nIn government, we will entrench this into law by updating the Climate Change Act with the most ambitious feasible net zero deadline consistent with a just transition for workers. The urgent need to reduce our emissions is the starting point for the Green Industrial Revolution that we will unleash in every part of the country, creating hundreds of thousands of good, skilled jobs across Britain and building the cleaner, healthier, more rewarding economy of the future.\n\nYesterday I visited a state-of-the-art wind turbine facility near Southampton to discuss our plan for a five-fold increase in the UK\u2019s offshore wind capacity creating nearly 70,000 jobs. That\u2019s the kind of ambition we need. Under our plan the public will take a 51 per cent stake in new offshore windfarms and we\u2019ll reinvest the profits in coastal communities and other green measures.\n\nAnd Labour will ban fracking, roll out a street-by-street insulation programme and fit solar panels on 1.75 million roofs, double large-scale solar, remove barriers to onshore wind and ensure every single new house built is a zero carbon home.\n\nThe climate emergency is an issue of global security. And like other global issues it demands cooperation and diplomacy. The invasion of Northern Syria by Turkey is completely unacceptable. More violence is never the solution. To end war you have to make peace, which is what all sides should do now.\n\nThe Syrian peace process must mean peace and security for the Kurdish people too, whose voice must be included and heard. Reckless military interventions have made Britain and the world a more dangerous place. The wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya were disastrous failures that devastated those countries and fuelled terrorism and insecurity, rather than fighting it.\n\nCurrently the prime minister has the power under the royal prerogative to launch military action without recourse to parliament. Boris Johnson \u2013 a prime minister without a majority \u2013 has talked about sending troops to Saudi Arabia to confront Iran: another disaster in the making. I will be a very different kind of prime minister, one who is prepared to limit my own power in the public interest. So that\u2019s why a Labour government will introduce a War Powers Bill to ensure no prime minister can bypass parliament to take the country to war.\n\nThe alternative Queen\u2019s Speech I\u2019ve set out today is the most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate. This is Labour\u2019s plan to change our country, it\u2019s the real thing not the pale imitation offered by Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party.\n\nIt\u2019s a path to a future where the economy is run for the people, not the privileged, and the government works for you not the vested interests. A future where we tackle the climate emergency and Britain is a force for peace and international justice in the world.\n\nThat future is within our grasp. Together we can build a country fit for the next generation. The future is ours to make It\u2019s time for real change.\n\nThank you.", "description": "Outlining a radical vision for Britain in an 'alternative Queen's speech', the Labour leader said his party want an election but only when Mr Johnson can't break the law to force a no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551496.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jeremy-Corbyn-speech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
