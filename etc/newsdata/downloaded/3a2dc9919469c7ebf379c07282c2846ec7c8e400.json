Three sex offenders argued it was a violation of their rights to free speech and privacy.\n\nSheriff Gary Long said he took the action to keep children safe on Halloween. \u201cI WILL do everything within the letter of the Law to protect the children of this Community,\u201d Long posted to Facebook.\n\nCALIFORNIA MAN ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING VEHICLES IN DONALD TRUMP MASK\n\nHowever, Judge Marc Treadwell found the sheriff's move went beyond the letter of the law, according to Fox 5. \"The sheriff\u2019s decision is not based on any determination that the plaintiffs are dangerous. Nor is the sheriff\u2019s sign-posting founded on Georgia law. Rather, the sheriff\u2019s decision is based solely on the fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 names remain on Georgia\u2019s registry of sex offenders,\" the judge wrote in his ruling. He declined to award the plaintiffs any damages.\n\nFLORIDA MAN DRESSED AS TRUMP AT HALLOWEEN FAIR ALLEGEDLY PUNCHED IN FACE BY 14-YEAR-OLD\n\nLong said on Facebook that he \u201crespectfully and strongly\u201d disagreed with the judge\u2019s ruling, but would abide by it. He cited a portion of Georgia law which stated, \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Office in each county shall: Inform the public of the presence of sexual offenders in each community.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor this Halloween, our deputies will keep a very strong presence in the neighborhoods where we know sex offenders are likely to be. Deputies will have candy in their patrol vehicles and will interact with the children until the neighborhood is clear of trick-or-treaters to ensure the safety of our children on Halloween night,\u201d Long said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLong began the initiative in 2018 without any legal challenges from those it targeted.
