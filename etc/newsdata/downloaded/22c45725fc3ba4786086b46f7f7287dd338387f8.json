This is an important announcement because of racist behaviour that is interfering with the game.\n\n\"The referee has indicated that the players will suspend the match. Racism will not be tolerated and the game will be abandoned if the racism continues.\n\n\"Help everyone enjoy the game and say no to racism.\u201d\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: Sportimage)\n\nThat message was met by boos from sections of the home support - but applause from 3,800 travelling England fans.\n\nAs Sterling bagged his second and England's fifth on the night, away fans chanted: \"Who put the ball in the racists' net? Raheem f*****g Sterling.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFormer Manchester United captain Keane, working for ITV in the stadium, declared at half-time, \u201cthat was horrible\u201d.\n\nThe Irishman also pointed out how the scenes made him feel \"sick to his stomach.\u201d\n\nIan Wright, sitting alongside him, declared however how it was a \"great day\" for tackling racism - as it highlighted how players are now able to take a stand.\n\nHe said: \"What you've got to understand now is you can feel physically sick. You've been on a football pitch, you know what it's like and you have to continue to play through that.\n\n'But you don't now, and that's what's good. It's a great day, whatever anyone says.\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\n\"It's a terrible day for Bulgarian people and how they've been represented, but it's a great day with respect of trying to tackle racism.\n\n\"You can see from that stand. What we're seeing is a set of fans that do not care and they need educating.\n\n\"As a black player, we've heard it for many years about walking off. It's something you do not want to do.\n\n\"You need the white players to do that for you, so you can go off together because you are a team together.\n\n\"When that can happen, and you see how powerful that is, you can do something.\"\n\nEx-England left-back Steven Warnock declared on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cThey [Bulgaria] should be banned straight away. They shouldn\u2019t be able to make the Euros or World Cups for many years.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hit them hard.\"", "description": "The Three Lions victory over Bulgaria in their Euro 2020 qualifier was marred by racist abuse and Nazi salutes", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Sportimage", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580577.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
