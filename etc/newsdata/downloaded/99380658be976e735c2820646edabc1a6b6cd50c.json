'But until then, I can't.'\n\nComey has pledged to spend the next 13 months fighting to drive Trump from power.\n\n'I feel stuck,' he said. 'Like I can't do something else. And I couldn't look myself in the mirror if I went and did something easy.'\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey (above) has said that he has a 'fantasy' of deleting his Twitter account after President Donald Trump leaves office\n\nComey has pledged to spend the next 13 months fighting to drive Trump from power\n\nComey admitted that he may have been responsible for Trump's election, after publicly announcing the FBI was examining a trove of Hillary Clinton's emails just 11 days before the election.\n\nThe emails were recovered from the laptop of Anthony Weiner, which was seized in an unrelated FBI investigation sparked by DailyMail.com's report that Weiner had sent sexually explicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl.\n\nTrump fired Comey in 2017, citing his handling of the Clinton email investigation.\n\nComey's new remarks come after he initially said that he hoped Trump would be removed from office through the ballot box rather than impeached.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry unfolded into Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden, Comey revised his position in a pronouncement on his Twitter account.\n\nComey has devoted himself to pronouncements about democracy on his Twitter account\n\n'Some media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not Impeachment,' Comey wrote.\n\n'But we may now be at the point where members of the House and Senate can't uphold their own oaths to support and defend the Constitution without acting,' he continued.\n\nSince leaving the FBI, Comey has published a memoir and done paid speaking gigs, but has eschewed full-time work in the private sector, devoting his energy to his fustian Twitter feed and self-improvement goals.\n\n'One of my goals has been to get to 10 consecutive pull-ups,' Comey told the Times. 'I'm at nine now. So, I've been doing a lot of pull-ups.'", "description": "Former FBI director James Comey has vowed to fight for President Donald Trump's removal from office.
