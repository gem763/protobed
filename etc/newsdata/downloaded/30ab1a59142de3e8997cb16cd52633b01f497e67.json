This means you can hopefully kick back, sleep, eat and watch a few films without the worry of disturbing your little one.\n\n\"Window seats if possible are always a good idea, as they provide a nice distraction and can also offer soothing views for when trying to get toddlers to sleep.\n\n\"It is always worth sitting near to toilets too, as children tend to have a habit of going more frequently when flying so saves having to make any mad dashes!\"\n\n(Image: E+)\n\nIf you know your child is prone to get restless and unlikely to happily stay in their seat, Rebecca also advises aiming for a flight during the daytime, so parents don't need to worry about sleeping passengers if children get noisy.\n\nShe adds: \"Parents should not be scared of letting your little one walk up and down the aisles and even down to the back galleys (once we have completed main services and heavy carts have been put away of course!)\n\n\"A change of scenery can quite often make a toddler a little bit happier if they\u2019re getting restless in their seat.\"\n\nLooking for more advice on flying with kids?\n\nYou may also want to check out our guide to flying with babies filled with top tips from other mums and dads, as well as our top tips for flying with older children .", "description": "A cabin crew member has revealed the best place to sit if you're looking for an easy flight with a toddler", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "E"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12413299.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Little-boy-sitting-on-an-airplane-with-his-soft-toy-looking-through-window.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
