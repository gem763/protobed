Tennessee punter Brett Kern took the snap and dashed to the left sideline but was met by Buccaneers linebacker Devin White, who stripped him of the ball.\n\nBuccaneers safety Andrew Adams recovered the fumble and started to run down the field for what would have been an easy touchdown. Instead, on-field officials blew the play dead and ruled it a turnover on downs.\n\n\u201cIt was more than just one play. Everybody except for one guy saw the ball out. [He] blew a quick whistle,\u201d Arians told reporters Monday. \u201cMy biggest thing is, referees aren\u2019t held accountable. Coaches get fired. General managers get fired. Players get cut. Referees aren\u2019t accountable, and it\u2019s a shame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been that way for 40 years, and now that we\u2019ve got a new agreement, it\u2019ll be that way for 40 more years.\u201d\n\nArians expressed his frustration with the lack of consistency from NFL officials across the league, citing the Los Angeles Rams-New Orleans Saints game in Week 2 when Cameron Jordan returned a fumble 87 yards for a score that was called back due to an early whistle.\n\n\u201cWhy is it continuing? Since the Rams-Saints game in the second week, when the Saints got a touchdown that they didn\u2019t get, there\u2019s been an emphasis on letting the plays go [before blowing them dead]. You can answer why it\u2019s not happening. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Buccaneers (2-5) will play the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians had sharp words for NFL officials after an early whistle cost his team a go-ahead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
