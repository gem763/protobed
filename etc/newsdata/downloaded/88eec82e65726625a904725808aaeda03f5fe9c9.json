Time\n\nThe creators of \"South Park\" sarcastically acknowledged Monday the Chinese government's decision to ban clips, episodes and online discussions of the animated show after an episode critical of the country.\n\nThe episode \"Band in China,\" which originally aired last Wednesday, satirizes the entertainment and sports industries' willingness to abide by Chinese censors in order to corner its business market.\n\nAt one point in the episode, an entertainment executive notes characters can't include Winnie the Pooh in a biopic, because the animated character is \"illegal in China because some Chinese students said he looked like the Chinese president.\" At another, Randy (Trey Parker) is stuck in prison for attempting to bring marijuana into the country to sell. There, he meets Winnie the Pooh, also stuck behind bars.\n\nCreators and stars Parker and Matt Stone issued an \"official apology\" Monday night, sarcastically slamming the Chinese government's decision to ban not only their episode, but two NBA preseason games set to be played in the country.\n\n\"Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\" the \"official apology\" read. \"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV indicated the decision not to air the NBA games was prompted by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s remarks in Japan after a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last week that supported anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe broadcaster also is reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, said the statement posted to CCTV Sports\u2019 official social media account.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/08/south-park-issues-sarcastic-apology-critical-china-episode/3905916002/", "description": "The creators of \"South Park\" offered a tongue-in-cheek apology after an episode critical of the Chinese government.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
