(Meg Kinnard/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe foot soldiers of the civil rights movement are leaving us. After organizing and marching, sitting in and getting arrested \u2014 all in the noble effort to make this nation live up to its ideals \u2014 they are going to their eternal home. This month, Juanita Abernathy and Emily England Clyburn were the latest to pass away. On Monday, Abernathy\u2019s life will be celebrated in Atlanta, and Clyburn will be laid to rest in Charleston, S.C.\n\nClyburn was the wife of 58 years of Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the House majority whip. The two were students at South Carolina State University and met after he was arrested during a civil rights demonstration on campus. In a 2007 interview with MSNBC, the congressman recounted what happened at the courthouse hearing. \u201cWe had been in jail all night, and they hadn\u2019t fed us all day. I was standing there and I said to nobody in particular, 'Boy, am I hungry,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere was this little 95-pound person standing nearby. Next thing, she is back with a hamburger. She offered it to me, then pulled it back. She tore it in half, gave me one half, and kept the other half for herself. We were married a year later.\u201d\n\n[\u201cThe movement never would have happened had it not been for these heroic women.\u201d]\n\n\u201cMs. Emily,\u201d as Clyburn was called, spent 29 years as a medical librarian at the Charleston Naval Base and Dorn VA Medical Center in Columbia, S.C. She was a philanthropist who raised money for students to attend her and her husband\u2019s alma mater. Just last month, Rep. Clyburn announced that he and his wife established the Dr. Emily England Clyburn Honors College Scholarship Endowment by rededicating the $1.7 million they raised and donated over decades. And, as everyone in South Carolina knows, Ms. Emily was a force in her husband\u2019s career in public service and a truth-teller. \u201cI just wonder when you are going to stop talking about South Carolina\u2019s problems and start doing something about them,\u201d the congressman in his memoir recalled Ms. Emily telling him after a well-received speech at a conference in 1971. Today, Clyburn is the highest-ranking African American in Congress.\n\nJuanita Abernathy was a hidden figure in the civil rights movement. She is credited with writing the business plan for the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott that lasted 381 days and turned the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. into a national leader in the fight for equality for African Americans. She and her husband Ralph Abernathy were best friends with King and his wife, Coretta Scott King. Ralph Abernathy was King\u2019s confidant, mentor and right-hand man. And he was by King\u2019s side on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis on April 4, 1968, when a shot rang out.\n\n[The day Martin Luther King Jr. died]\n\n\n\nCoretta Scott King, left, the Rev.

(AP/AP)\n\nAt the Faith and Politics Institute\u2019s civil rights pilgrimage to Alabama in 2015, I asked Juanita Abernathy to confirm a story that I had heard about what she did that fateful day. The audience at Alabama State University sat silently riveted as she recounted what happened when she got a call from Coretta Scott King, then gasped at what she ultimately revealed. For it showed a human moment by people most forget were regular people doing extraordinary things.\n\nWhen she called me, she said, \u201cI got a call that Martin had been shot. Can you go to Memphis with me?\u201d I said, \u201cGive me 15 minutes and I\u2019ll meet you at the airport.\u201d As we circled going into the airport, and our little children were in the backseat, the announcement came over, \u201cMartin Luther King just died.\u201d And my little children ... started screaming and hollering, \u201cOh God, Uncle Martin is dead!\u201d I went on into the airport and Coretta was surrounded by the chief of police and a few other people and I said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to Memphis. I\u2019ll meet you at your house.\u201d And I went on to her house while they comforted her. And I arrived there and I stayed that night with Coretta and I slept on Martin\u2019s side of the bed. His sister Christine left about 11:30 and went home and it was just the two of us. I\u2019ve heard that somebody said she stayed there all night, but there was only two of us in that house. We talked a little bit, but not long, about what had happened. And, finally we went to sleep. But it was a sorrowful day and the less you talk about something like that, that you feel, because you actually have time to get your thoughts together and think to yourself, and say your own prayers. You don\u2019t need too much conversation when you were going through a tragic moment like that. So that was my experience that night. ... I stayed there for two or three days because my housekeeper was with my children and I knew they were in good hands.\n\n[Walking with giants of the civil rights movement.]\n\nWhat a privilege it was to have spent time with Juanita Abernathy and Emily England Clyburn. They were women of their time. Strong, opinionated, savvy and proud. They saw, sacrificed and endured a lot as they worked to make this nation more just, fair and free. Each was the foundation of her husband\u2019s strength. They are owed our gratitude.\n\nThank you, Juanita Abernathy and Emily England Clyburn.
