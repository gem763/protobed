I visited Kansas City in August\u2014and everyone I met was warm, generous, and welcoming. My heart is with all who are impacted by this tragedy. Together, communities like ours, which have been victims of gun violence, will lead the way in ending this epidemic.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s tweet linked to a headline from the Kansas City Star. That headline read, \u201cNine shot, four dead in shooting at Kansas City, Kansas, bar: police.\u201d\n\nThose who read the Star\u2019s story, and/or coverage from the Associated Press, saw that shooting was reportedly the result of a bar fight, after which two individuals allegedly retrieved guns, re-entered the bar, and killed four people.\n\nBreitbart News reported the shooting occurred Sunday around 1:30 a.m. local time. The alleged gunmen had not be identified, much less arrested, by the time O\u2019Rourke was tweeting about stopping gun violence.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s go-to gun control has been AR-15 and AK-47 confiscation via a government enforced buyback program. That gun control would have done nothing to prevent the Kansas City shooting, inasmuch as the attackers used handguns.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
