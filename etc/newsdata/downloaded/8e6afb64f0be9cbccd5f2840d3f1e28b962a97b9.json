And where does that end?\n\n\"Does that mean we should keep monthly spreadsheets and document when we give sexual favors and how much we give emotionally to ensure we\u2019re even every month?\"\n\nShe explains she had never given much thought to 'going Dutch' until a promising first date quickly took a nosedive when it came time to pay and she got the expectant look.\n\nEvery date which followed ended the same way, with the man expecting Peta to pay her way 'despite the large pay gap due to his generous salary'.\n\nShe says she has no aversion to funding her own expenses but wasn't happy that he insisted on a 50/50 split despite her being the one who had travelled due to living out of town.\n\nHer suggestions of alternating payment instead was brushed off and the final straw came when he asked her to cough up \u00a32.40 for coffee after she had driven 40 minutes to see him.\n\nShe argues: \"People always misread me on this topic; call me a gold digger or a princess, but it\u2019s not actually even about the money, it\u2019s about what the money signifies.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\" And as it turned out with my demanding date, perhaps unsurprisingly, his money wasn\u2019t the only thing he was stingy with.\n\n\"It was this relationship that made me value generosity and really see that some men use the excuse of splitting the bill to hide their stinginess.\"\n\nThe conversation was sparked in Peta's friendship group when a girlfriend of hers went on a date with a man who took her to one of the 'priciest venues in town'.\n\nShe says the man was bragging about his pay packet and insisted on picking from the menu for his date, choosing expensive dishes and pricey wine - before asking to split the painfully large bill at the end.\n\nThe group debated whether it's still possible to call yourself a feminist while accepting a free meal from a date.\n\n\"After all, if we want equal rights, we should be prepared to split the bill equally, right?\" wrote Peta.\n\n\"I believe you can still consider yourself a feminist and accept a nice meal from someone. And conversely, you can also be a feminist and buy someone else a meal, too.\n\n\"It\u2019s when someone uses that term as an excuse to be stingy with their funds that isn\u2019t cool with me, as I feel it says a lot about that person\u2019s character.\n\n\"Let me be clear on this: if I ask a guy out and go to the effort of arranging the date, then I expect to foot the bill for the whole date.\"\n\nShe finishes by saying that she believes everyone needs to have standards in dating and relationships, and one of her rules is now not to date a 'stingy' man who wants to split the bill.", "description": "Peta says people often call her a gold digger or a princess but she insists it's 'not about the money'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Caiaimage", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11968455.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Waiter-returning-bill-and-credit-card-to-woman-dining-at-restaurant-table.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
