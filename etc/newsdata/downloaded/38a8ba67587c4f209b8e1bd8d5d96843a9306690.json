Plank will become executive chairman and brand chief.\n\nPatrick Frisk, Under Armour\u2019s president and chief operating officer, has been named the replacement CEO effective January 1.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider last month, Plank and Frisk talk about how their leadership styles differ. Plank says he wants to run down the hill as fast as he can, while Frisk is there to make sure they have a plan and don\u2019t run straight into a tree.\n\nA few weeks before Kevin Plank stepped down as Under Armour\u2019s CEO, he stopped by Business Insider with his soon-would-be replacement Patrik Frisk to discuss the future of the company. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nSara Silverstein: And you\u2019re looking longterm now. What\u2019s the hardest thing about thinking longterm as a publicly traded company?\n\nKevin Plank: This is where our partnership comes from. You\u2019d ask and say, \u201cDo we have a big idea of the vision of what the company would look like or not?\u201d I wanted to sell a shirt today and I wanted to sell as many as I could at the time. So that ability to actually have a partner come in who helps us think better about what is not only the three but what\u2019s the five, frankly, what\u2019s the 10-year plan for this brand, too.\n\nI wanna run down the hill as fast as I can and that\u2019s sort of been the defining of the company and that\u2019s where now having a partner that helps us think about, \u201cAll right, which way are we gonna go? Are we going to the left or the right of that tree? We\u2019re not going through it so we have to be thoughtful.\u201d We\u2019ve never been afraid to go through that tree when we had to in the past.\n\nSilverstein: Is there anything that investors or analysts say that you feel like they really misunderstand? Is there one thing that really gets to you?\n\nPlank: I think this is a company, it\u2019s all on the come. I think that\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand, is when you look to the transformation we\u2019ve been through. This is strong entrepreneurial upstart company built and driven by a lot of momentum and then it was, \u201cAll right, how are you shifting into actually being a large-scale format company?\u201d So what comes with that, the last few years, a lot of people have had opinions about what does it mean to make that transformation.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nStill, if I look back at this chapter, \u201917, \u201918, \u201919, we\u2019ll have grown this company more than half a billion dollars over that time, implemented a new go-to-market strategy, implemented a new global operating model, get away from a North American company that\u2019s selling product other places, upgraded our systems, really retooled our entire management team and said, \u201cWho\u2019s here and who\u2019s ready,\u201d brought in our president and chief operating officer, just watching all that synergy come together.\n\nFor me it\u2019s been great but it is human. So those are the things that come out and say, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know if it will always look smooth on the top,\u201d but it means that we\u2019re moving forward.\n\nPatrik Frisk: And I think from my perspective, being still the new boy on the block or not a rookie anymore, I\u2019m past that stage, I think, but thinking about the fact that this is now the third largest athletic brand in the world, having done that, having grown that fast underneath of two really large brands, that\u2019s incredible. They were never able to do that. We\u2019ve been able to do that. So now that we\u2019ve got our stuff together, now that our innovation pipeline is stacked, now that we\u2019re going from defence to offence, now that we\u2019re gonna become a louder brand, I\u2019d bet on us.\n\nSilverstein: And tell me about your partnership. What\u2019s the strongest and hardest part about working together?\n\nFrisk: The strongest and hardest part\u2026\n\nPlank: It\u2019s human.\n\nFrisk: Having been here for two years now I think we know each other really well. I have incredible respect for what Kevin has created here and the fact that he\u2019s entrusting me to help him get to the next level with this amazing brand that we both want to be eternal. It is a partnership. It\u2019s like a marriage in some ways. You gotta respect each other. You gotta understand what drives each other, what both the strengths are from both sides and I think what\u2019s really unique about our brand, our company, our future, is the fact that you\u2019ve got the yin and yang here to some extent in terms of Kevin\u2019s enormous entrepreneurial drive, understanding of brand, understanding of the merchandising capability of a great brand, with some of the stuff that I\u2019ve done in my past, which is also driving big brands, understanding brand, but also having the operational experience to be able to really help us get to the next stage.\n\nPlank: That yin and yang has been critical but we work at it. We make sure we sit down and we\u2019ll see each other throughout the day but we\u2019ll have sit-downs at least twice a week. We\u2019ll do a blowout session of two, three, four hours once a month and just make sure that communication, over communication \u2013 because it is, it\u2019s meeting where you find the strength and diversity that comes together. We like a lot of things but we can mix it up, too. This is, it\u2019s strength.\n\nFrisk: You\u2019ve gotta be able to do that and then walk out of it and be a lion at the end of the day.\n\nPlank: Never go to bed angry.\n\nFrisk: Nope, never go to bed angry.\n\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE: Under Armour\u2019s plan to get back on the front foot after a bumpy 3 years\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
