Drawing down American forces in Afghanistan was a key demand of Taliban negotiators, and President Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring U.S. troops home from \u201cendless wars\u201d abroad.\n\nAD\n\nIn a draft of a peace deal reached between U.S. and Taliban negotiators, the Trump administration said it was prepared to reduce the number of American troops to 8,600. Slightly more than 12,000 American troops are now deployed in Afghanistan.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs we work in Afghanistan with our partners, we\u2019re always looking to optimize the force,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we have the right capabilities to one reach our objectives as well as to continue train, advise and assist throughout the country.\u201d\n\nArmy Col. Sonny Leggett, a U.S. military spokesman in Kabul, said the reduction was \u201can aggregate drop since General Miller took command\u201d and not part of the drawdown to 8,600 American troops.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGeneral Miller is doing exactly what I asked all our commanders to do when I entered office,\u201d Esper said at the news conference. \u201cI\u2019m asking them to look where they can free up time, money and manpower,\u201d Esper said, so the Pentagon can focus on countering China and Russia in line with the country\u2019s national defense strategy. He said countering terrorism and extremism \u201cis also part of that priority list.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeace talks between the United States and the Taliban have not formally restarted, but the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan met with Taliban leaders in Pakistan earlier this month. The negotiators worked for more than a year to reach a deal before it was scuttled, but many officials in Kabul and Washington caution that the efforts are merely on hold.\n\nNearly 2,400 American troops have died in the Afghanistan since the United States intervened in 2001, and more than 20,000 have been wounded, according to the Pentagon.\n\nAD", "description": "The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan said the number of American troops in the country has been reduced by 2,000 over the past year.", "authors": ["Susannah George", "Foreign Reporter Covering Afghanistan"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6L6PAaE09heEHgRdtOGQ6qSChs4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZACZSBXT7EI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
