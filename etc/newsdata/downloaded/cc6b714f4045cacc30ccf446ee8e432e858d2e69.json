He, of course, has loved nothing more than watching the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle struggle as they have been taunted on social media and beyond. Piers used to be friends with Meghan once, he says, but she moved on. Shame.\n\nWhile delivering his speech as patron of the children\u2019s charity, Harry revealed that the preceding year he and Meghan had clasped each other\u2019s hands tightly in anxious anticipation as they kept the secret of their early pregnancy.\n\nHe had to pause, mid-speech, to stop himself from crying as he spoke about how fatherhood had shifted his view of the world and made the work of the charity resonate on a deep and personal level. \u201cAs parents, being here and speaking to all of you pulls at my heartstrings in a way I could have never understood until I had a child of my own,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

REUTERS\n\nThat moment is seared into the memory: the brutal unfairness that the two young boys whose mother had been torn from them, in such a public manner, should face the long walk behind her casket in front of millions was recently described by Elton John as \u201cinhuman\u201d. It appeared as though they had been instructed to contain their grief and be strong, to \u201cbe men\u201d.\n\nThe dangers of what is known as \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d have become a popular talking point. Our sexist society not only sidelines women, it demands that men conform to old ideas of masculinity: that they retain a stiff upper lip, take blows on the chin and live by a \u201cboys don\u2019t cry\u201d mentality. That repression of male sadness and anger has been connected to the harrowing statistics around male suicide \u2013 the biggest killer for under-45s, with men three times as likely to die by suicide than women.\n\nBut saying that it\u2019s \u201cOK to cry\u201d and that talking about feelings helps, is one thing \u2013 seeing a prince of the realm do so in front of an international audience is quite another.\n\nPop culture would have us believe that disenfranchised men who lack support become killers \u2013 as in the recent Joker film where a problematic pivot around mental illness was used to explain away male violence.\n\nPrince Harry is ostensibly the picture of the macho model of masculinity. He served in the armed forces, waltzed about carelessly as a teenager in a Nazi uniform and has been papped, bum out, fag in hand. He\u2019s been portrayed as a boy\u2019s boy, a Jack the Lad just out for a good time; privileged and with no apparent responsibility.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what made it so powerful to watch him fight back tears. We\u2019ve watched him U-turn from someone who, at one point, appeared as though he might become just another Bullingdon Club-type bore, to instead become a champion of mental health, compassion and openness.\n\nThe speech came at the end of Baby Loss Awareness Week during which the focus has largely \u2013 and understandably \u2013 been on women. But the state\u2019s lack of support for fathers going through these things has been highlighted and must be addressed: parents of stillborn babies are offered counselling together, or the mother is alone, but fathers rarely are.\n\nIf we continue to paint women as the only significant parents, can we really be surprised that parental leave remains unequal, that childrearing is seen as a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d and when popular culture portrays fathers as bumbling idiots?\n\nHarry and Meghan have behaved like no other royals before them, responding with unprecedented rage at the racist and misogynistic treatment of Meghan in many factions of the media, demanding their privacy whether that aligns with royal protocol or not \u2013 and hitting back at newspapers that expect them to turn a blind eye.\n\nThey are the antithesis of the emotionless heads of state we\u2019ve seen historically and who have offered the British people a diet of philandering, racist slurs, the sidelining of \u201cproblematic\u201d women and the squandering of taxpayer\u2019s money. Harry and Meghan display far more down-to-earth \u201crealness\u201d than William and Kate who are limited by their position and the disincentives it lays in the path of any boundary-breaking behaviour.\n\nStudies have shown men are more likely to listen to other men than they are women; perhaps this time that sad fact will actually do them some good. Hopefully it won\u2019t be headline-worthy news one day when a man shows emotion \u2013 but at the moment, while it still is, it\u2019s worth celebrating.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of distress and isolation, or are struggling to cope, The Samaritans offers support; you can speak to someone for free over the phone, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch\n\nFor services local to you, the national mental health database \u2013 hubofhope.co.uk \u2013 allows you to enter your postcode to search for organisations and charities who offer mental health advice and support in your area", "description": "When Prince Harry fought back tears at the WellChild awards on Tuesday night, it must have been a cynically joyful moment for serial contrarian Piers Morgan.
