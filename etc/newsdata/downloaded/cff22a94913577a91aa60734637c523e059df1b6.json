Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nIf Kalemegdan is Belgrade's heart, then Knez Mihailova is a major artery.\n\nThis broad pedestrianized thoroughfare constantly hums with life, whether it's people chatting on caf\u00e9 terraces, music from buskers or the salty aroma of popcorn from food stalls.\n\nStately 19th-century neoclassical buildings frame the boulevard. For art lovers, there's the Zepter Museum , which has a fascinating collection of modern and contemporary art.\n\nRelated content Which European city is the most affordable to visit?\n\nDor\u0107ol\n\nDorcol's Strahinji\u0107a Bana is crammed with bars and restaurants. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nOne of Belgrade's oldest and most attractive districts, Dor\u0107ol is teeming with bars and restaurants.\n\nThe bars along Strahinji\u0107a Bana have always drawn crowds, but there are plenty of others to check out.\n\nThe funky garden bar at Blaznavac on Kneginje Ljubice and the Middle Eastern-tinged menu at Smokvica in Gospodar Jovanova are both worth dropping into.\n\nTwo of the drinks close to a Serb's heart -- beer and rakija (brandy) -- are brewed under one large roof at Belgrade Urban Distillery , along with a wide selection of food stalls to soak up the booze.\n\nSkadarlija\n\nSkadarlija is probably the best-known area of Belgrade. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nSkadarlija is the nearest thing Belgrade has to a touristy area.\n\nLocated just next door to Dor\u0107ol, it was a hangout for artists and intellectuals in the 19th century.\n\nNowadays, Skadarlija's cobblestoned streets are filled with restaurants serving traditional Serbian food.\n\nThere's a permanent party atmosphere thanks to folk musicians serenading diners, particularly in and around Dva Jelena and Tri Se\u0161iri restaurants.\n\nFor something a bit grittier, there's Cetinjska, a disused brewery that's been transformed into a ramshackle collection of bars and restaurants.\n\nZemun\n\nZemun didn't become an official part of Belgrade until 1934. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nAcross the Sava, in the New Belgrade area, lies the picturesque Zemun.\n\nIt's one of Belgrade's prettiest suburbs, with cobblestoned streets, a lively waterside section and an excellent morning food market in Masarikov Trg.\n\nZemun's baroque architecture serves as a reminder of Belgrade's Austro-Hungarian past.\n\nIf you follow the streets uphill, you eventually reach Gardo\u0161 Tower, which the Hungarians built in 1896.\n\nThe relatively short climb is worth it for the panoramic views of Zemun's terracotta rooftops, the sweep of the Danube and a fair chunk of Belgrade's cityscape.\n\nFrom late June to September, a temporary pontoon bridge is set up to provide access to Great War Island (Veliko Ratno Ostrovo). The sandy beach at the northwestern tip of this vast nature reserve is a great place to relax in summer.\n\nAlong the riverside Kej Oslobo\u0111enja, popular restaurant \u0160aran serves up beautifully cooked seafood. Visitors can also sample Spanish delicacies at Milagro or Mediterranean-style cuisine at Supermarket Talas\n\nJust around the corner on Njego\u0161eva, is Cafeteria Gardo\u0161 , which boasts a terrace that's a great spot for people-watching.\n\nTucked away up a staircase off the quayside is Galerija , with a lovely shaded terrace and fabulously fresh fish to go with it.\n\nRelated content Lonely Planet's top 10 cities to visit in 2019\n\nNational Museum of Serbia\n\nThe National Museum reopened in 2018, 15 years after it was closed for restoration work. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nIt only took 15 years, but the National Museum of Serbia finally reopened in 2018 after an absurdly lengthy renovation.\n\nLuckily, it was worth the wait. Set in an imposing former bank dating from 1903, the country's major art and cultural collection is an impressive one.\n\nStarting with ancient Roman and Neolithic artifacts, it carries on into the Byzantine era with icons and frescoes, and meanders into the 19th century with works by Gauguin, Picasso and Matisse along with its compelling paintings by lesser-known Serbian artists.\n\nThe riverside nightlife\n\nThere's a special name for Belgrade's floating bars and restaurants -- splavovi. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nWith several hundred floating bars, restaurants and nightclubs lining the riverbanks of both the Danube and Sava, it's not surprising that Belgrade has a reputation for possessing the most raucous nightlife in Eastern Europe.\n\nThese places known as splavovi are a motley collection -- anything from cozy little restaurants to multi-level nightclubs with swimming pools.\n\nThere's even a splav, aptly named Monza , with a racing track on its roof. You'll find even more clinging to the Sava further south all the way to Ada Ciganlija.\n\nOverlooking the Sava's eastern bank is an old warehouse, Beton Hala , packed with restaurants, bars and a constant parade of people strolling past.\n\nIt's at the tail end of the Savamala district -- another formerly down-at-heel neighborhood whose old buildings have been turned into bars and clubs. They all add to the soundtrack of a Belgrade summer.\n\nRelated content 20 beautiful European cities with hardly any tourists\n\nAda Ciganlija\n\nRiver island Ada Ciganlija has been artificially transformed into a peninsula. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nWith all that river water swirling around Belgrade, it would be a shame not to put it to good use. Belgrade has landlocked Serbia's only Blue Flag beach, set on its own island that's been turned into a little peninsula in the Sava River.\n\nAlthough Ada Ciganlija is the city's playground all year round, it really comes into its own during the summer.\n\nNot only is it filled with caf\u00e9s and restaurants, there's also a golf course, tennis courts, miles of cycle lanes, a tiny zoo and even a snowboarding simulator.\n\nThose who arrive on its western edge from New Belgrade can hop on a little boat that shuttles across the river.\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art\n\nBelgrade's Museum of Contemporary Art holds the biggest collection of Yugoslav art in the world. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nSet in a white futuristic 1960s building and surrounded by forests of U\u0161\u0107e Park, the Museum of Contemporary Art romps through the 20th century works of regional artists in cleverly laid out galleries.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you know nothing about Yugoslav art -- you'll enjoy the ride.\n\nLike the National Museum of Serbia, the contemporary art gallery endured a painfully long period of renovations, but the result is captivating.\n\nSveti Sava\n\nThis enormous Eastern Orthodox temple has been under construction for more than 80 years. Courtesy Adam Batterbee\n\nThis enormous Eastern Orthodox temple -- one of the largest in the world -- vies with Barcelona's Sagrada Familia for the dubious distinction of being famously unfinished for far too many decades.\n\nIt's been under construction since the 1930s, with interruptions brought about by wars and other shattering events.\n\nBut while the interior's frescoes are still being painted, a visit down to the crypt offers a glimpse of what's still to come.", "description": "Called the White Phoenix because it's been destroyed and rebuilt so many times, Belgrade is always evolving.
