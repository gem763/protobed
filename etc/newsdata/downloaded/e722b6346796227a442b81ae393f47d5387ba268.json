The first MG flagship showroom was opened in Gurugram earlier this year. The latest outlet spans across an area of 4,000sqft and has a British touch to it with elements like the Big Ben, the Union Jack, telephone booths and street lamps present on the inside.\n\nThe showroom also houses a host of tech, just like the company\u2019s successful mid-size connected SUV, the MG Hector. The company is also looking to step into the electric vehicle (EV) market with the launch of the eZS EV in the coming months.\n\nThe main technology piece in the new outlet is the Live Vehicle Configurator. It\u2019s a 65-inch screen where you can select the variant, colour, drivetrain and add your favourite accessories for the MG Hector. Thanks to this, you can now have a glimpse of your personalised Hector before the actual car arrives.\n\nThen there is the Engineering Wall, where certain parts of the Hector are kept on display. This includes the door cut section, shock absorber and insulating mat. In addition, an LED Video Wall, which consists of 16 connected TVs, plays videos about the brand and its history to engage you.\n\nWith the introduction of the latest outlet, MG has a total of 120 touch points across India. The carmaker aims to add 130 more by the end of 2019. Meanwhile, MG Motor is also hard at work to introduce more cars to its portfolio.

A host of curated MG memorabilia is also strategically placed around the entrance, informing visitors of the brand\u2019s past glories. The MG Caf\u00e9, on the other hand,reminds visitors of the significance of coffee as an initiator of the greatest conversations.\n\nLED VIDEO WALL\n\nThe sleek and futuristic interior design provides a sharp contrast to this tribute to the past and underlines MG\u2019s proposition as a new-age carmaker. A large video wall of 16 connected TVs plays artfully-created brand videos to further engage visitors with immersive content about the brand\u2019s history and future vision. This coming together of the past and the present accurately represents the amalgamation of MG\u2019s rich British heritage with its future-ready outlook.\n\nENGINEERING WALL\n\nMG\u2019s flagship store also boasts off an \u201cEngineering Wall\u201d, with various vehicle components of MG HECTOR on display such as door cut section, shock absorber and insulating mat.\n\nLIVE VEHICLE CONFIGURATOR\n\nProspective customers can approach the configurator wall to define their own MG experience.
