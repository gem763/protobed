I played a lot last season, especially in important matches, for Juventus, and I also played well.\n\n'I haven't had a chance this season but now I think that, when I return to the club, I'll have a shot at playing again.\n\n'I'm definitely grateful to Joachim Low because I hadn't played much and he still called me up.\n\n'That's why I was simply happy to have played again.'\n\nDaniele Rugani could depart Juventus in January, which would be of great benefit to Can\n\nSarri plans to copy Allegri's idea and bring Can back into defence, which is likely to lead to him being included in Juventus' updated Champions League squad in February, if, as expected, they make it through to the knockout stages.\n\nEMRE CAN'S JUVENTUS RECORD 2019-20: Serie A - Three appearances 2018-19: Serie A - 29 appearances, four goals, one assist Champions League - Six appearances Coppa Italia - One appearance Supercoppa Italiana - One appearance\n\nAnother factor that could work in Can's favour is the fact that defender Daniele Rugani, who hasn't played at all this season, is tired of sitting on the bench and may ask to leave in January.\n\nIf Rugani does depart midway through the campaign then it is likely that Can will replace him. Several Premier League clubs expressed interest in signing Rugani in the summer, but he turned down a move to Wolves.\n\nArsenal were also linked but did not have enough money to buy Rugani, instead electing to sign David Luiz from Chelsea.\n\nWith Merih Demiral as the first choice alternative to Matthijs de Ligt and Leonardo Bonucci, it is understandable that Rugani is frustrated and it seems certain that he will leave Juventus either in January or next summer.\n\nJuventus are determined not to sell Can unless they receive an offer that is too good to refuse. Sarri wants to convince the player to take advantage of the opportunities in the club without asking to be transferred.\n\nAn impressive display in defence for Germany has certainly convinced Fabio Paratici, Juventus' sporting director, that Can's departure is no longer inevitable.", "description": "ALVISE CAGANAZZO: Emre Can is set to be used as a centre-back by Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri after impressing in the position for Germany .", "authors": ["Alvise Cagnazzo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19592156-0-image-a-89_1570802871851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
