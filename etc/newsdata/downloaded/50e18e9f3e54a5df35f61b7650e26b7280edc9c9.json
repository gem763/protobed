I\u2019m leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me. The only way they can try is through impeachment. This has never happened to a president before.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 campaign arm blasted out a statement predicting Democrats would be ensuring the end of their House majority if they followed through.\n\nThe shift in outlook among Democratic lawmakers has been rapid, and could yet still turn away from impeachment if exculpatory evidence comes to light. The developments that have turned the tide began less that two weeks ago, when Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman, first revealed the existence of a secretive whistle-blower complaint that the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog had deemed \u201curgent\u201d and credible but the Trump administration had refused to share with Congress.\n\nThat complaint remains secret, and lawmakers are fighting to see it, but news reports have established that the complaint was related, at least in part, to a July call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressed the foreign leader to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, for corruption.\n\nJust days earlier, Mr. Trump had ordered his staff to freeze more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine. While Mr. Trump denies having explicitly linked the two issues, lawmakers believe they are connected and have demanded documentation that could clarify the situation.\n\nThe campaign of Mr. Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, announced he would make a midafternoon statement on the matter from Wilmington, Del.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has been conducting what it has called an impeachment investigation focused on the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as well as allegations that Mr. Trump may be illegally profiting from spending by state and foreign governments, and other matters. But that inquiry never got the imprimatur of a full House vote or the full rhetorical backing of the speaker, as Democrats remained divided about the wisdom and political implications of impeaching a president without broader public support", "description": "With a cascading rush of Democrats declaring their support for an impeachment push, House leaders are changing course.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/us/politics/24dc-impeach/24dc-impeach-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
