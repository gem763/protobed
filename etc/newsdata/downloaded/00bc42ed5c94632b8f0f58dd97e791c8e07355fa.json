The Wills family derived their wealth from shipping tobacco from the New World into Bristol.\n\nThe university announced in 2017 that it would not rename the building, saying: \"We cannot alter the past but we can enable reflection upon it and add to knowledge about slavery past and present.\"\n\nBristol is the latest institution to investigate its past links with colonialism. Earlier this year, Glasgow University became the first in Britain to announce a package of reparations for its benefit from the slave trade.\n\nIt pledged to raise \u00a320 million over the next 20 years to fund a new research centre which will be a joint venture with the University of the West Indies.\n\nCambridge University has also launched an inquiry into how the 800-year-old institution benefited from the slave trade.\n\nResearchers have been commissioned to pour over the university\u2019s archives to how much it gained from the \u201cAtlantic slave trade and other forms of coerced labour during the colonial era\u201d.\n\nThe two-year inquiry will examine whether financial bequests made to departments, libraries and museums were made possible from the profits of slavery.\n\nIt will also probe how far Cambridge academics \u201creinforced and validated race-based thinking between the 18th and early 20th Century\u201d.\n\nBristol's official participation in the transatlantic slave trade started in 1698, though experts say Bristolian ships illegally traded in slaves well before then.\n\nBristol merchants financed more than 2,000 slaving voyages between 1698 and 1807, with ships carrying more than 500,000 people from Africa to slave labour in the Americas.\n\nProfessor Judith Squires, Bristol University\u2019s provost and deputy vice-Chancellor said: \u201cAs an institution founded in 1909, we are not a direct beneficiary of the slave trade, but we fully acknowledge that we financially benefited indirectly via philanthropic support from families who had made money from businesses involved in the transatlantic slave trade.\n\n\u201cThis new role provides us with a unique and important opportunity to interrogate our history, working with staff, students and local communities to explore the University\u2019s historical links to slavery and to debate how we should best respond to our past in order to shape our future as an inclusive University community.\u201d", "description": "Bristol University has hired a professor of slavery history in an attempt to discover whether it needs to apologise for its colonial past.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Philip Johnston", "Matthew Goodwin", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Michael Deacon", "Olivia Utley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2017/03/28/TELEMMGLPICT000075923178-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqbs2qhUcaH33OuW8omkTEpjDwJP2_LQ-iPcO_hctQhA4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
