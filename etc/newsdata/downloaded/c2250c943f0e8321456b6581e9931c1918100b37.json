He still looked drowsy, though.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Ross has been caught out catching 40 winks while Trump gives a speech.\n\nVideo from Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia in May 2017 showed Ross napping with headphones on, several seats away from the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nPolitico in July published a scathing article that suggested the Commerce Department was \"a disaster,\" and quoted one former department adviser who said Ross was \"not respected in the building\" in part because of his lack of stamina.\n\n\"Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they're very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,\" the former outside adviser told Politico.\n\n\"There's a small window where he's able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.\"\n\nRoss's latest cat nap came a day after another awkward video moment for Team Trump at the UN.\n\nTrump was clearly surprised Monday when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters in front of Trump that it was U.S. officials who had asked members of China's trade delegation to cancel a scheduled farm tour in the United States last week, and not the Chinese.\n\nTrump asked Mnuchin, with a strained chuckle, \"Why was that our request, just out of curiosity?\"\n\n\"We didn't want confusion around the trade issues,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nTrump replied: \"Yeah, but I want them to buy farm products.\"", "description": "The 81-year-old Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross took a nap \u2014 a very long nap \u2014 as his boss President Donald Trump addressed the General Assembly of the UN in New York City on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106146168-1569335627605preview.jpg?v=1569335743", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
