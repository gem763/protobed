The night before, vandals wreaked havoc nearby, looting, setting fires and sowing chaos amid a melee of sirens, protesters banging pots and heavy black smoke.\n\nPresident Sebastian Pinera's newly appointed spokeswoman Karla Rubilar condemned the previous night's mayhem, saying it did not reflect the wishes of the majority.\n\nMembers of security forces take cover during a protest against Chile's government in Santiago, Chile on Oct. 28, 2019.

She called on all Chileans, from soccer players to cultural icons, to reject the rioting.\n\nDays earlier, more than a million Chileans marched peacefully against inequality in Santiago, the largest protest since Chile's return to democracy in 1990.\n\nThe continuing unrest in Chile follows a week of riots, arson and protests over inequality that have resulted in at least 18 dead and 7,000 arrested, prosecutors said. Chilean businesses lost more than $1.4 billion. The city's metro suffered nearly $400 million in damages.\n\nA barricade is seen burning during an anti-government protests in Santiago, Chile on Oct. 28, 2019.

A plummeting copper price and global trade tensions, however, have dragged on the export-dependent economy and exposed entrenched inequality.\n\nPeople walk away as riot police use a water cannon during a protest against Chile's government in Valparaiso, Chile on Oct. 28, 2019.

Chileans in business attire wore makeshift masks or wet towels over their faces as they headed to and from work. Many schools and businesses remained closed, or shut early.\n\nCatalina Barrera, an 18-year-old high school student, said she felt Pinera's announcements had missed the mark. The protests would go on, she said.\n\n\"If, after that massive march on Friday, we get nothing but a cabinet change in which they continue to nominate more of the same people, then violence is our only option,\" she told Reuters.\n\nDemonstrators react as fire rages during an anti-government protest in Santiago, Chile on Oct. 28, 2019.
