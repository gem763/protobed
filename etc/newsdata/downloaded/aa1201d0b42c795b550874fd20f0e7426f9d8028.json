A comedian-turned-politician, Zelenskiy came to power earlier this year after promising to bring Ukrainian prisoners home from Russian jails.\n\nThirty-five prisoners in total are reportedly being released by either side, however neither side has confirmed the identities of the prisoners.\n\nHowever, relatives and lawyers of the prisoners confirmed the identities of some of those involved.\n\nFilmmaker Oleg Sentsov is among the 35 Ukrainians transferred from Moscow to Kyiv, his lawyer said on Twitter.\n\nNikolai Polozov, a lawyer who heads the defence team of 24 Ukrainian sailors detained by Russia during a clash near Crimea last year, told AFP that \"according to my information, they were put on a bus. All 24 of them.\" He said he expected the men to arrive in Ukraine \"in the next few hours.\"\n\nAmong those reportedly handed over to Moscow is Volodymyr Tsemakh, a former commander of separatist forces in Ukraine\u2019s east, who is suspected of involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people.\n\nHe was released by a Ukrainian court on Thursday pending trial.\n\nDutch prosecutors have urged Kyiv not to allow Tsemakh to travel to Russia, fearing this could jeopardize the investigation into the air disaster.", "description": "Swapped prisoners include Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov", "authors": ["Eline Schaart"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166458718-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
