With rugby it can improve split-second decision-making, reflexes and the ability to see the flight earlier and calculate distances.\"\n\nJapan, who beat Russia (30-10), Ireland (19-12) and Samoa (38-19) before edging Scotland, face South Africa in the quarter-finals in Tokyo next weekend.", "description": "Japan's Kenki Fukuoka has been striking all the right notes at the World Cup by helping the hosts reach the quarter-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7919/7807184c37bb484884c52fae90c7d5c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
