Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) spoke Monday to discuss bipartisan efforts to overturn President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria and sanction Turkey for its military offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nWhy it matters: Trump's decision has sparked bipartisan backlash and accusations that he is abandoning the Kurdish allies who helped the U.S. in the fight against ISIS. Trump has voiced approval for the idea of sanctioning Turkey for its invasion, but he has stood by his decision to move U.S. troops out of the way despite the overwhelming criticism he's received from even his most loyal allies.", "description": "\"[W]e must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting,\" Speaker Pelosi tweeted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/g7YS2PIMQJLTBORJjIiCdcwNn-s=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/10/14/1571070819527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
