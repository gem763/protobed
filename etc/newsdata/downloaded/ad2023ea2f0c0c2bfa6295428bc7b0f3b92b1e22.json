Masked protesters broke into the national auditor\u2019s office and set it ablaze, sending black smoke billowing across the central Quito park and cultural complex that have been the epicentre of the protests.\n\nLater, several dozen masked men swarmed the offices of the private Teleamazonas television station, set fires on the grounds and tried to break into the building where about 20 employees were trapped.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to enter the station, trying to break down the doors, we\u2019re asking for help but the police aren\u2019t coming,\u201d one employee told the Associated Press.\n\nA journalist with the newspaper El Comercio told the AP that the paper\u2019s offices were also under attack. The building\u2019s security guards were seized and tied up and attackers were trying to break into offices where journalists were hiding.\n\nMoreno appeared on national television alongside his vice-president and defence minister to announce that he was ordering people indoors and sending the army on to the streets.\n\nHe blamed the violence on drug traffickers, organised crime and followers of former president Rafael Correa, who has denied allegations that he is trying to topple Moreno\u2019s government.\n\nPlay Video 1:14 \u2018We\u2019re going to fight until he leaves\u2019: Ecuador protests call for Moreno to quit \u2013 video\n\nMoreno served as Correa\u2019s vice-president before he become president and the two men went through a bitter split as Moreno pushed to curb public debt amassed on Correa\u2019s watch.\n\nMoreno said the masked protesters had nothing to do with the thousands of indigenous Ecuadorian groups who have protested for nearly a week over a sudden rise in fuel prices as part of an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed austerity package.\n\n\u201cI have ordered the [armed forces] to immediately undertake all the necessary measures and operations,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cWe are going to restore order in all of Ecuador.\u201d\n\nThe violence, curfew and military deployment came shortly after the announcement of a possible softening of the 10-day standoff. Indigenous leaders of the fuel price protests that have paralysed Ecuador\u2019s economy for days said early on Saturday afternoon that they were willing to negotiate with Moreno over the austerity package.\n\nThe Confederation of Indigenous Nations of Ecuador said on Twitter that \u201cwe have decided to participate in direct dialogue\u201d with Moreno.\n\nCONAIE (@CONAIE_Ecuador) Luego de un proceso de consulta con las comunidades, organizaciones, pueblos, nacionalidades y organizaciones sociales hemos decidido participar en el Di\u00e1logo directo con @Lenin sobre la derogatoria o revisi\u00f3n del decreto 883.\n\n\n\nComisi\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica pic.twitter.com/J1PZFYmItn\n\nMinutes later, Leonidas Iza, a Quechua leader from mountainous Cotopaxi province, told Ecuavisa television that \u201cwe have asked for minimal conditions for dialogue,\u201d including what he called an end to government violence against protesters.\n\nPreviously, indigenous protesters had refused to negotiate until Moreno restored fuel subsidies.\n\nQuito mayor Jorge Yunda said Moreno was willing to revise the package and planned to meet Saturday with leaders of the demonstrations. Yunda said he and other mayors were mediating the standoff that has halted Ecuador\u2019s oil production, blocked highways and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in loss to industries such as flower-growing to dairy farming.\n\nAs the two sides made progress toward compromise, violence was spreading.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Across Quito, hooded men used rocks and burning tires to block streets in residential neighbourhoods.

Some drivers, pedestrians and owners of small businesses reported being threatened and robbed. Roads leading to the international airport were blocked, according to city officials.\n\nThe indigenous leaders distanced themselves from the violent gangs, calling them instigators unconnected to the native groups\u2019 cause.\n\nInterior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo said 30 people had been arrested in the attack on the auditor\u2019s office. Firefighters said they extinguished the blaze after soldiers and police retook control of the building, which houses evidence in corruption investigations.\n\nEcuador, a former OPEC member, was left deeply in debt by a decade of high-spending governance and the oil price drop. Faced with $64 billion in debt and an annual deficit of $10 billion, Moreno is raising taxes, liberalising labour laws and cutting public spending in order to secure more than $4 billion in emergency financing from the IMF.", "description": "Demonstrators in capital Quito attack television station and national government buildings", "authors": ["Associated Press In Quito"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ad3caa3bbf899f5fbcaa2319604fe5007adf57/0_75_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd5114fd5d05c23c28669b07c748a13c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
