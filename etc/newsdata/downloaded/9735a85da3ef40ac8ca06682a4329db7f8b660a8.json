They also cited a 2007 letter from the city of Peoria to an industry representative relaying the same information as the 2002 ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court said one city\u2019s ruling for one taxpayer doesn\u2019t provide clear notice to all online travel companies on behalf of all the cities.\n\nThe court said it\u2019s possible that the cities provided official notice of their intent to assess taxes against the companies on their status as brokers, but \u201csuch evidence is not in the record currently before us.\u201d\n\nJohn Crongeyer, one of the attorneys representing the cities, declined to say the amount of tax money the communities believe they are owed, but he said it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s millions of dollars.\n\nCrongeyer said the hotels have paid their sales taxes but the online travel companies have never paid their share.\n\nCrongeyer said the decision represents a victory for the cities because it establishes that the online travel companies must pay the sales taxes. \u201cThis is what has been contested by the companies for years,\u201d Crongeyer said.\n\nThomas M. Peterson, an attorney representing the travel companies, didn\u2019t immediately return a phone call Monday afternoon seeking comment on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Supreme Court has ruled Orbitz and other online travel companies must pay sales taxes to cities for their work in arranging hotel stays for customers, but it remains unclear whether the communities will be able to collect millions of dollars in back taxes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jacques Billeaud"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
