This was agreed to by way of a council resolution on July 25.\n\nHowever, Mosoloa did not sign the agreement at the last minute. Instead, appointed one of his deputies, Tredoux, to act in his place on July 31.\n\nTshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa then extended this deadline to August 31 without council approval. Mosola only resigned on August 30.\n\nThe council adopted a resolution on July 25 in terms of which Murphy was to be appointed as acting city manager when Mosola left at the end of July. A day later, however, Mokgalapa did an about-turn, after a report into his conduct was brought to attention of the mayor. The same report has been in the municipality's possession since December 2018.\n\nNews24 previously reported that the report Mokgalapa used to rescind Murphy's appointment at a special council sitting on August 20 was controversial and hotly disputed.\n\nREAD | EXCLUSIVE: Tshwane mayor used hotly contested report in botched attempt to block acting city manager appointment\n\nThe forensic report, which is contained in an auditor general report, purports to implicate Murphy in the misallocation of funds to NGOs three years ago.\n\nBut the City's internal audit department said it was flawed and rejected it, saying it cleared Murphy of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe August 20 sitting was held behind closed doors and Mokgalapa's efforts to prevent Murphy's appointment was blocked by the ANC.\n\nNo decision could be reached and the issue is expected to be discussed at the next council sitting, News24 understands.\n\nFrivolous court action\n\nMayoral spokesperson Omogolo Taunyane told News24 that the court action was not only frivolous, but illegal \"as [the] speaker communicate[a] mandatory council sitting in order to conduct its business\".\n\n\"Obviously, the ANC is desperate to discredit the mayor and gain public sympathy,\" Taunyane said.\n\n\"Council will sit as scheduled on 26 September without any disruptions.\"\n\nThe court case is expected to be heard on October 1.", "description": "The ANC has accused the Tshwane council of passing resolutions relating to the payout of former city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola and the appointment of an acting city manager, despite a majority dissenting vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5563/7ad093c372ec4b45a266730a42a3dcf8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
