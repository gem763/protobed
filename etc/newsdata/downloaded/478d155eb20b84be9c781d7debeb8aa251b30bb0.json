Over a dozen years, Turner and Johnson raised $2 billion in private equity capital that spurred nearly $6 billion in urban revitalization, Turner says.\n\nAbout 10 years later, Turner, 56, launched the Turner- Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund at Canyon, a Los Angeles private equity firm, with former tennis star Andre Agassi to develop a series of charter schools.\n\nTurner left Canyon Capital in late 2013 to start Turner Impact Capital, a private equity real estate fund focused on social impact. Earlier this year the firm marked its first five years in business by announcing it had raised funds totaling $1.25 billion, impacting 100,000 people.\n\nTurner\u2019s shift from running a for-profit real estate firm, as a \u201ctraditional gladiator of finance,\u201d to running a social impact firm full-time was deliberate.\n\n\u201cI had spent 23 years in that pilot seat as a champion of industry, but I wasn't satisfied,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted my epitaph to read that I had made the most change in the world.\u201d\n\nTurner Impact Capital\u2019s funds today focus on building \u201ccommunity-serving, community-enriching infrastructure\u201d in three areas: K-12 public education, affordable workforce housing, and outcome-based healthcare in urban communities. The Turner Multifamily Impact Fund II, for instance, made its third acquisition of housing on Monday toward the fund\u2019s goal of creating $1 billion in additional workforce housing for teachers, police officers, and health care workers.\n\nTurner spoke with Penta about his philosophy of impact investing, and the benefits of working with stars like Johnson, Agassi, actress Eva Longoria, and Oklahoma City Thunder basketball star Chris Paul.\n\nPENTA : What kind of change in the world are you aiming to make?\n\nBOBBY TURNER: What I think is the root of [society\u2019s] problems today, is not the disparity of income, but rather the disparity of hope. I grew up in the 99%, but I always believed in the feasibility of the American dream. I believed that with hard work, with a great education, with decent health care, affordable housing, and in my case, with a lot of luck, you could become that 1%.\n\nBut let\u2019s not kid ourselves. There are tens and tens of millions of families who absolutely have been foreclosed out of the American dream today. When 78% of working families are living paycheck to paycheck, when one out of four renters spend 60% of their income on rent at the expense of food security and health security and retirement security\u2014they are living in survival mode. Forty-three million families are on food stamps. That\u2019s not sustainable.\n\nSo when you pull hope out of the equation, the only word that I think fills that void is despair. And I think it\u2019s the intensive despair that leads to the divisiveness that we\u2019re seeing today in this country.\n\nWhat is Turner Impact Capital\u2019s approach to creating hope?\n\nWhat I do is what I would call direct or active social impact investing, which is primarily private-equity real estate and VC (venture-capital) funds where we\u2019re proactively seeking to drive social change by harnessing market forces to create durable solutions.\n\nThese funds are typically targeting specific issues like health care or workforce housing or education where the traditional investor has been the government or philanthropy and where our reliance has been handicapped by them. With active funds, investors are seeking both market-rate returns as well as clear and measurable impact.\n\nI have former public school superintendents and I have former primary care physicians and I have DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration) officers on my staff to help me underwrite risks. One of the challenges is there is a dearth of qualified managers that have a proven track record of delivering change, both financial and societal.\n\nWho are Turner Impact Investors?\n\nMy investors come in two categories, and I luckily am in both of those categories. No. 1 is they come in the form of evolved capitalists. Someone like the University of Michigan\u2019s endowment [fund]. They look to me not to drive social change\u2014they look to me to drive alpha [the active return on an investment] for their portfolios.\n\nErik Lundberg, who\u2019s the CIO [chief investment officer], has recognized that you can drive great diversification by investing in social justice if you do it right, and you can absolutely drive alpha. But he doesn\u2019t ask me how well my funds are doing by society. He asks me how good we\u2019re doing financially because he\u2019s looking to me to make money for him so that he can be socially responsible.\n\nThe other half of my investors, which I also am, are the enlightened philanthropists: folks like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, like the Pershing Square Foundation. These are philanthropists that have said, when and where there is a market-driven solution that addresses the same issues that are near and dear to them as philanthropists, it behooves them not to just give the 5% away [to charity, as required by law], but to take that 95% of the core portfolio, and if you\u2019re investing in real estate or private equity or stock portfolios, invest in companies that are actually consistent and have the same values you do as a mission-driven organization.\n\nWhy do you work with stars like Andre Agassi or Chris Paul?\n\nThese [celebrities] actually are investors in the fund[s] because they truly are authentic about the particular issues or the fund that they\u2019re associated with. So Andre was a 15-year philanthropist in public education, having built his own public charter school in Vegas. Eva Longoria has been an outspoken advocate for human rights issues, particularly with the Latino community. Chris Paul has been a benefactor of urban communities with housing issues for a decade.\n\nBut for me, what they do is they help me raise awareness to the issues. They also help me bridge the gap. So when I walk into a minority community, Magic Johnson helps bridge that gap. When I walk into an educational space, Andre Agassi bridges that gap.", "description": "The financier\u2019s impact investing firm leverages star power to invest in infrastructure for housing, schools, and healthcare", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-112277/social", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
