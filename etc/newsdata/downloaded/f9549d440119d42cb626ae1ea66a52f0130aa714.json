(Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nIf the St. Louis Cardinals are known for anything, it\u2019s consistently being among the better teams in the National League and consistently being upset by the unwritten rules of baseball.\n\nThe latest player to catch the ire of the Best Fans In Baseball is Cincinnati Reds infielder Freddy Galvis.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter flying out to center field against starter Miles Mikolas in the fourth inning, Galvis gallivanted across the diamond to the visiting dugout, crossing the pitcher\u2019s mound in the process. That was a big no-no for Mikolas, who barked at Galvis and caused the benches and bullpens to clear.\n\nGalvis ran across the mound and the benches cleared \ud83d\ude2cpic.twitter.com/Aa1ghL5Tgx \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) September 1, 2019\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first bench-clearing incident with the Reds this season, although it\u2019s their first since dealing Yasiel Puig to the Cleveland Indians. Fortunately the teams were more bark than bite and didn\u2019t exchange any punches.\n\nUnwritten rules are one of the most archaic and overblown parts of the game, and the sport would be better off if teams could let things go.\n\nSure, it would have been nice for Galvis not to have run over the mound. He did go across the front part of the mound, where Mikolas delivers his pitches, but he didn\u2019t kick up dirt or do anything on purpose. Mikolas didn\u2019t need to curse him out or start a kerfuffle.\n\nGalvis didn\u2019t get to face Mikolas again, since the righty was pulled after the sixth inning, but maybe this incident was all the spark he needed. He laced a double to right field in the seventh for his first hit in 22 plate appearances.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Cardinals are upset about unwritten rules again, this time where players run.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/isjcLm.3iBruTjXEWAdnQw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nFMvX0qkp4Xts6eR_o0dRQ--~B/aD0zMzI2O3c9NDk4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5d2182e0-ccf2-11e9-9fea-fd0a32f00060"}
