From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow, more than 50 cross-party MPs, including Conservative backbenchers Antoinette Sandbach and Guto Bebb, have accused Mr Johnson of presiding over an \u201cunconstitutional coup\u201d and urged all MPs to join them in setting up an alternative parliament.\n\nExtraordinary times sometimes call for extraordinary measures but what would such an act achieve?\n\nThe move would effectively be symbolic, as a new parliament would not have the power to carry out the legislative functions of the House of Commons.\n\nParliament would only be suspended under Mr Johnson\u2019s plan, rather than dissolved as it would be ahead of a general election. This means MPs still retain their seats and the government is still in command, leaving the country in a state of limbo.\n\nBut even if this alternative parliament cannot pass laws, it could still prove a thorn in Mr Johnson\u2019s side.\n\nThere is genuine public outrage over the prospect of proroguing parliament, as shown by the thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets on Saturday to express their anger.\n\nA rogue chamber could provide a focal point for that fury, diverting media coverage and public attention away from Mr Johnson\u2019s attempts to build a compelling policy agenda outside of his Brexit aims.\n\nWhile there is a risk it could look a little strange, an alternative parliament also has the advantage of gathering together all the different Brexit factions who oppose no deal.\n\nFor a long time, Labour was at odds with the pro-referendum parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens \u2013 over its Brexit strategy, while plenty of Tories want a negotiated Brexit and strongly oppose a disorderly departure.\n\nThrough his prorogation plan, Mr Johnson seems to have achieved the impossible by uniting all his warring opponents against him \u2013 at least for now.", "description": "Rebel\u00a0MPs have vowed they will convene an alternative House of Commons\u00a0to debate Brexit if Boris Johnson suspends parliament in the next two weeks.
