Their homes have been burned and their families have been torn apart.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Utah Republican and 2012 presidential nominee added that \u201cthe decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt strikes at American honor,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nRomney did not mention Trump by name. But the speech marked his strongest criticism of the president\u2019s actions to date.\n\nEarlier this month, Romney tweeted that it was \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d of Trump to call on China and Ukraine to launch investigations into one of his political opponents, former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.\n\nTrump responded by calling Romney a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019 \u201d and calling for his impeachment, even though U.S. senators cannot be impeached.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats and a number of other Republicans also have denounced Trump\u2019s move as an abandonment of U.S. allies: the Syrian Kurdish militias that partnered with the U.S. military to fight the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, the House passed a bipartisan resolution condemning Trump\u2019s action on an overwhelming 354-to-60 vote. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) attempted to force Senate passage of the measure Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cHe does not grasp the gravity of the situation. He doesn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Schumer said of Trump. \u201cThe most important thing we can do right now is send President Trump a message that Congress, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans, demand to reverse course.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut several Republican senators, led by Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), stood up to object, thus blocking passage of the resolution.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is quite clear: No authorization has ever been given for the use of force in Syria, no authorization of declaration of war, no permission to be there at all,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo if they want to insert themselves into the civil war, by all means, let\u2019s have a debate, let\u2019s have the constitutional debate, but I for one am not willing to send one young man, or one young woman, one soldier, over there without a clear mission.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlso objecting to the resolution were Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.).\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday that his preference is for legislation even stronger than the House-passed resolution, arguing that the measure had some serious weaknesses.\n\nAmong the Republicans criticizing Trump\u2019s decision on Thursday was Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.), who issued a statement in support of a bipartisan measure that would levy sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\u201cI continue to believe the dangers of withdrawing U.S. forces from northern Syria outweigh the benefits to American security interests,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cNevertheless, I hope the ceasefire announced today leads to a meaningful and durable outcome that protects the Syrian Kurds and prevents a resurgence of ISIS. This bipartisan bill will strengthen the hand of the United States as we negotiate an acceptable resolution with the Turkish government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump called Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a close ally who had been one of the president\u2019s most vociferous critics on his Syria decision, and told the senator that the agreement was \u201cbetter than I thought it would be,\u201d in Graham\u2019s retelling.\n\nGraham, who was also briefed by White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien on the deal, said he will continue to build support for sanctions legislation he formally unveiled Thursday with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), arguing that the threat of penalties against Erdogan had successfully put pressure on the Turkish government.\n\nStill, asked how confident he was that the two countries could negotiate a permanent cease-fire after the 120-hour period, Graham responded: \u201cIt\u2019s the Mideast, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRisch (R-Idaho) is also working on legislation with his counterpart, ranking Democrat Robert E. Menendez (D-N.J.), that would not only impose sanctions against Turkey but also force the administration to present its strategy for the region.\n\nAD\n\nThose bills are two of several punishing Turkey and addressing the ongoing situation that have circulated on Capitol Hill in recent days.\n\n\u201cWhether we go forward with it or not, I think over the next 48 hours we\u2019re gonna get a lot better feel about how serious the Turks are about this and what the reality of the commitments are,\u201d Risch said.\n\nRisch also said multiple senators have received \u201cvery specific commitments from the administration that although there was troop movement there, they were not moved such a distance that they would not be able to respond to an ISIS situation in Syria.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThe cease-fire does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally, adding insult to dishonor,\u201d Romney said, hours after Senate Republicans blocked a vote on a resolution condemning the military move.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/soHDOPJBonvrvlgv5JQ5bUfqQQI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y577NHHRDMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
