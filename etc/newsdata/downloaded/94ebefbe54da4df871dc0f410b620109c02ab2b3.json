Hjelmgaard received rare access as a Western journalist to go to Iran, and his reporting, which includes photos and videos taken during his trip, offers an exclusive look at life inside the country during a critical time for U.S.-Iran relations.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s Iran series will feature pieces by Hjelmgaard about the role of women in Iranian society, the impact of sanctions on the Persian rug industry, the presence of the Jewish community in the Islamic nation, and more. Hjelmgaard actively explores and examines the day-to-day life of the Iranian people, including the transition of one woman who moved from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Tehran, Iran.\n\n\u201cKim seized an opportunity to shed light on a country that appears as an enigma to so many people who live outside of it,\u201d said Nicole Carroll, editor in chief of USA TODAY. \u201cHis reporting gives a deeper understanding of the people \u2013 not just the politics \u2013 of Iran and is especially important in the context of the current tension between the U.S. and Iran.\u201d\n\n\"Having the chance to go inside Iran and share accounts of my time there has been a real privilege,\u201d said Kim Hjelmgaard, foreign correspondent for USA TODAY. \u201cI hope that my reporting on my visit to Iran helps others to think about the country beyond the daily news headlines.\u201d\n\nMore information about USA TODAY\u2019s Iran series can be found at: http://insideiran.usatoday.com\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2LKtqyc", "description": "Exclusive on-the-ground content provides a look at daily life in a country few Western journalists get to visit.", "authors": ["Usa Today Network Press Room", "Published A.M.
