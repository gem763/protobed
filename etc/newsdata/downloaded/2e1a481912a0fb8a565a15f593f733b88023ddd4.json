Gerald Baliles dies at 79", "language": "en", "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 Former Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, a Democrat known as the \u201ctransportation governor\u201d and for his work to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and increase foreign trade, died Tuesday. He was 79.\n\nGov. Ralph Northam issued a statement saying Baliles died Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family. He had been battling cancer.\n\n\u201cGovernor Baliles fought for rural Virginians, promoted civil discourse, and was the epitome of a true public servant,\u201d Northam said, adding that the state flags will fly at half-staff for the next 30 days in Baliles\u2019 honor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that democracy works better when practiced with civility, honest debate, and good-faith compromise. Jerry Baliles lived it,\u201d Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nBaliles, who served from 1986 to 1990, pushed through a 10-year, $10 billion transportation initiative during the first year of his administration that required increases in the gas and sales taxes.\n\n\u201cHe had the courage to take the political hit for raising taxes for improvements that future governors would cut the ribbons on,\u201d Del. Vivian E. Watts, D-Arlington said during a 2002 retrospective examining Baliles\u2019 administration. Watts was secretary of public safety and transportation under Baliles.\n\nBaliles continued pushing for better transportation long after he left the Executive Mansion, calling for Virginia to install tolls on interstates to raise money for transportation projects.\n\nHe once accused his successors of squandering the progress made during his administration.\n\n\u201cThe 1990s could well go down as Virginia\u2019s Decade of Delusion,\u201d he told the nonprofit Intelligent Society of Virginia. \u201cWe have convinced ourselves that somehow, someway, our commonwealth will take care of itself and that we can avoid the consequences of economic expansion.\u201d\n\nBaliles also committed Virginia to an ambitious cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay while in office and later continued his conservation efforts. His book \u201cPreserving the Chesapeake Bay\u201d was a call to arms to keep the bay cleanup going\n\n\u201cI hope it serves as a reminder to all readers that the bay is a resource that cannot be turned on and off like a faucet\u201d but needs continual care, Baliles said \u201cIt is a natural treasure that should be preserved.\u201d\n\nUnder Baliles\u2019 leadership teacher salaries increased to within $400 of the national average. He also introduced the first statewide standardized testing, which was later supplanted by the Standards of Learning. To stress the importance of thinking globally, Baliles had oversized maps of the world installed in every seventh-grade classroom in Virginia.\n\nHe also fought to expand the state prison system and appointed the first woman to the Virginia Supreme Court.\n\nBut many remember Baliles as the politician with the unusually retentive memory that allowed him to walk into a crowded room and recall the names of everyone to whom he was introduced.\n\nAfter leaving office, he emerged as one of the nation\u2019s leading authorities on aviation, serving as chairman of a national commission appointed by President Clinton in 1993 to find ways to keep airlines profitable.\n\nWhile in office, Baliles worked to get Virginia\u2019s two largest airports, Washington National and Washington Dulles International, away from federal control and into the hands of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\n\nHe grew up on a farm in rural western Virginia. Baliles\u2019 parents broke up when he was young and he and his brother, Larry, lived with their grandparents while his younger brother, Stuart, stayed nearby with an aunt and uncle.\n\nBaliles became an avid reader and student of history.\n\n\u201cFor me, books and airplanes were windows on the world,\u201d he once said.\n\nAt 15, Baliles went to Fishburne Military Academy, where he graduated second in his class. He met his first wife, Jeannie McPherson, while at Wesleyan College in Connecticut. They had two children, Laura and Jonathan.\n\nThey divorced in 1996 and Baliles married Robin Deal in 2003.\n\nHis cautious, deliberate style fueled his climb from state legislator to attorney general to governor without ever losing an election. Or it could have been his slogan: \u201cBaliles. The name rhymes with smiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not flamboyant,\u201d he said after winning the governor\u2019s seat. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know many people who have been brash who have gotten far in politics.\u201d\n\nIn 1989, during Baliles\u2019 tenure, a violent coal strike in southwest Virginia had tensions so high he was advised to stay out of the area. Then the economy collapsed his last year in office, and he left his successor a $2 billion budget deficit.\n\nHe remained active in politics long after leaving the Capitol. After retiring as a partner at the Richmond law firm of Hunton & Williams, he returned to the University of Virginia in 2006, to direct the Miller Center of Public Affairs.\n\n___\n\nFormer Associated Press writer Dena Potter wrote preparatory material for this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Virginia Gov.
