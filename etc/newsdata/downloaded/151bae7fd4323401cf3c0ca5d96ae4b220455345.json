He has been just really devastated by the hurt that\u2019s been caused to him, his beautiful daughters, his fantastic wife,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the cards.\u201d\n\nDemocrats see the new allegations as further evidence of the lack of vetting by the FBI and Senate, leading to the confirmation of a judge whose background and past treatment of women Americans do not fully understand.\n\nBut to conservatives, the new Kavanaugh allegations are an effort by Democrats to smear a sitting Supreme Court justice and place an asterisk next to his future opinions \u2014 casting a political pall over them.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The president and his aides are latching onto the uproar to energize conservatives about another hot-button emotional issue that resonates with the base, a move that can support GOP fundraising and ultimately bolster get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\n\u201cGrabbing guns and smearing Supreme Court Justices? Next the Democrats will hold up a dismembered eight-month-old fetus!\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. \u201cThey are handing the election to President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Kavanaugh allegations continue to carry such weight because they will set the tone for the next Supreme Court vacancy and nomination process regardless of the president in office.\n\n\u201cThis is a warning to anyone who will put their names out there for Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s seat when it becomes vacant. This is all about Ginsburg,\u201d said one conservative activist. \u201cThis is not going away. This ripped the scab off of what happened last summer and that is why people are so upset.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official rebutted this idea, however. \u201cThe White House is not concerned that the shameful episode involving the New York Times will impact the quality of future federal court appointees at any level.\u201d\n\nStill, conservatives warn they are prepared to mobilize if the Kavanaugh narrative continues. \u201cIt is a huge, huge threat to our whole constitutional structure,\u201d said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth and a co-founder of the Federalist Society. Such smear tactics have \u201cto be stopped. Groups like ours will absolutely develop plans to counter it.\u201d\n\nOver the last several years, Republican voters have been much more animated by Supreme Court appointments as the single most important issue in choosing a presidential candidate. In 2016, according to exit polling, 56 percent of Trump voters listed that as the key factor in backing his candidacy whereas just 41 percent of Democratic voters called it the most important issue.\n\nProgressive leaders hope this will change for the upcoming presidential election. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment \u2014 though top Democratic leaders have been killing that idea behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cAn important message from the Kavanaugh confirmation is that the sham process that the Republicans used to minimize transparency and curtail investigations and to do all they could to hide his record, that cannot become normalized,\u201d said Daniel Goldberg, the legal director of the Alliance for Justice and former chief of staff at the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs under President Barack Obama. \u201cI have not seen progressives galvanized around the issue of the courts like I have in recent years.\u201d\n\nThen-Judge Brett Kavanaugh during his tempestuous Senate confirmation. | Jim Bourg/Getty Images\n\nThe New York Times came under intense scrutiny for its Kavanaugh story, which ran as an excerpt in the book review section, because it left out a crucial detail that the woman who was allegedly harassed by Kavanaugh at a drunken Yale party has told friends she does not remember the incident, and she declined to be interviewed by the Times reporters.\n\nThe newspaper also put out an insensitive tweet, since deleted, promoting the Sunday story. Both liberal and conservative activists criticized it because they said it trivialized sexual assault, misconduct and victims with its breezy tone.\n\nSince the article\u2019s publication, Trump has kept bringing it up in public.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to call it a \u201cone-year anniversary reenactment\u201d of the Kavanaugh battle and a pattern, he said, of the media and Democrats overreacting. \u201cShoot first and correct the facts later,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) highlighted what she saw as liberals\u2019 efforts to undermine the Supreme Court. \u201cPoliticians, journalists, activists are leveraging unfounded criminal allegations against a duly confirmed Supreme Court Justice. I repeat that. They are leveraging unfounded criminal allegations against a duly confirmed Supreme Court Justice in an effort to undermine not only his work, but ultimately the entire court as an institution,\u201d she said Tuesday on the Senate floor.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s campaign team also unveiled a new red bumper sticker this week: \u201cI stand with Kavanaugh, Team Mitch.\u201d It highlights that McConnell, too, intends to lean on this as a key 2020 campaign issue.\n\nConservatives have been in overdrive trying to elevate bogeymen out of The New York Times\u2019 Kavanaugh piece. They\u2019ve used the publication\u2019s snafus as an opportunity to bash and try to weaken the integrity of the institution, which has published a raft of critical coverage of the Trump administration.\n\nJust as Trump continues to view the courts as a key campaign message and part of his legacy, liberals say their base is also becoming equally riled up about judicial picks.\n\n\u201cProgressives across the country are seeing what the stakes are now \u2014 with the assaults on our health care, assaults on women\u2019s rights, protections for clean air and water, and whether LBGT have rights under the law,\u201d said Goldberg of the Alliance for Justice. \u201cI think the American people are seeing the stakes of what the courts mean. That is how the Kavanaugh confirmation fight really hit home to many Americans.\u201d", "description": "The president and his aides are latching onto the new controversy as a hot-button emotional issue that riles up the GOP base.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/89/a8/1a0c9d1c4519bc244ffe2f4933f2/190918-trump-kavanaugh-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
