But Japan refused to grant the United States access to the TPP-wide quotas in the bilateral deal. European Union brands gained similar access in a Japan-EU trade deal launched in February.\n\nBut there are gains that bring U.S. beef, pork and wine exports in line with TPP competitors from Australia, New Zealand and Canada, putting them on the same tariff schedule.\n\n\u201cThere are some specific parts of the ag sector that really do benefit from this,\u201d said Matthew Goodman, an Asian economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cMore broadly, this is not a highly significant deal from a commercial perspective, as it doesn\u2019t touch the biggest item in bilateral trade, autos and auto parts.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S LEFT OUT\n\nThe U.S.-Japan agriculture-centered deal is notable for what it leaves out. It does not include the bulk of products that make up the bilateral trading relationship, notably autos from Japan and aircraft, liquefied propane gas and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the United States.\n\n(See graphic on top U.S. exports to Japan tmsnrt.rs/2mnCbY9)\n\nMotor vehicles and parts, by far the largest Japanese export to the United States at $56 billion in 2018, were left out for a later phase of negotiations. Abe said Trump agreed not to impose threatened \u201cSection 232\u201d tariffs on Japanese cars and parts on national security grounds.\n\nJapan has no tariffs on cars and trucks from the United States, but U.S. automakers argue that most American cars are kept out by environmental and safety regulations, and Japan\u2019s currency policies that keep the yen low against the dollar.\n\nTPP would have eased Japan\u2019s regulatory barriers, but neither agreement contained any rules to combat currency manipulation - a stated goal of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office. The United States would have eliminated its 2.5% tariff on cars made in Japan under TPP but it remains in place.\n\nLESS THAN TPP\n\nAmerica\u2019s rice growers won\u2019t benefit from the new bilateral trade deal, as tariffs and quotas on U.S. rice imported to Japan set in the early 1990s remain in place.\n\nUnder the TPP, Japan would have accepted 70,000 metric tons of American rice per year tariff-free under a U.S.-specific quota, but this was not included in the bilateral deal.\n\nTim Johnson, president and CEO of the California Rice Commission, said he hoped for a better deal in later phases of U.S.-Japan talks.\n\nBarley will see improved access to Japan, restoring U.S-specific quotas and a 45% reduction in Japan\u2019s mark-up on imports the grain widely used in beer brewing, matching TPP competitors.\n\nBut the deal does not provide the United States access to Japan\u2019s TPP-wide quota that grows to 65,000 tons annually over nine years.\n\nSIMILAR TO TPP\n\nUnlike butter and skim milk powder, cheese \u2014 the largest U.S. dairy export to Japan \u2014 will see elimination of Japan\u2019s tariffs of up to 40% over 15 years, as it would have done under TPP.\n\nU.S. beef and pork are the major winners in the U.S.-Japan deal. Beef will see Japanese tariffs falling from 38.5 percent currently to 9% by 2033, on the same schedule as TPP competitors Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Pork will see Japanese tariffs eliminated on muscle cuts over 9 years and the 20% tariff on ground seasoned pork eliminated in the deal\u2019s fifth year.\n\nJapan will eliminate its 10 percent duty on imports of certain U.S. ethanol in 10 years, affecting about $11 million worth of imports, according to a USTR fact sheet.\n\nThe deal maintains Japan\u2019s zero duty on U.S. corn for animal feed but grants a quota eliminating a 3% duty on sweet corn and other types of corn, the USTR said.\n\nWheat will see a U.S.-specific quota in Japan that will grow to 150,000 metric tonnes over six years, and a 45% reduction in Japan\u2019s markup for wheat imports, matching TPP competitors.\n\nJapan\u2019s tariffs on U.S. wine will also will fall, from 15% to 7.1% on April 1, 2020, basically the same level they would have under the TPP, the Wine Institute said.\n\nBut Japanese documents say that no concessions were granted for other types of alcohol. U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey had won some labeling protections in TPP along with tariff reductions.\n\nBETTER THAN TPP\n\nThe main improvement over TPP comes from the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement, say congressional aides and tech industry officials. They described it as \u201cTPP-Plus\u201d and in line with U.S. goals to set global internet and e-commerce rules.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIt includes stronger rules to prohibit cross-border taxation of digital downloads and data localization requirements than TPP. Cloud computing and new financial technologies were still new and being developed during the many years TPP was negotiated, so that deal included carve outs that would have allowed some countries to require local housing of financial sector data.\n\nUSTR said the deal protects against the forced disclosure of proprietary computer source code and algorithms, demands that it says China frequently makes of U.S. firms. It also said the deal promotes open access to government-generated data.\n\nOverall, the digital deal is in line with the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, regarded as an upgrade from TPP on digital economy issues. Japanese Prime Minister Abe said it reflects Japan\u2019s status as an ally of the United States in trying to set high-standard, open internet rules for the world.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday called his new trade deal with Japan \"a game changer for our farmers and our", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438188881&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961K6", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
