The child died shortly after he was born at the al-Hawl camp in northern Syria.\n\nMs Begum claims she married Dutch convert Yago Riedijk 10 days after arriving in IS territory, with all three of her schoolfriends also reportedly marrying foreign IS fighters.\n\nShe told The Times in February that she left Raqqa in January 2017 with her husband but her children, a one-year-old girl and a three-month-old boy, had both since died.\n\nThe case continues.", "description": "Shamima Begum, who was one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria to join so-called Islamic State, fears she'll face the death penalty if sent to Bangladesh", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Pa", "Birmingham Mail", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20058230.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_18464707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
