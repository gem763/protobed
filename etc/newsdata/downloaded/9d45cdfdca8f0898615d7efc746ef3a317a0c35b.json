She joins celebrities from Chinese singer G.E.M. to Japanese voice actress Kana Hanazawa in Shanghai mere months after wrapping a similar Prime Day celebration for Amazon.com Inc.\n\nAlibaba co-opted Singles' Day -- an unofficial campus holiday for the unattached -- and turned it into a national showcase for online bargains, netting more than US$30 billion of sales over a 24-hour period in 2018.\n\nSwift, who succeeds the likes of Mariah Carey and Nicole Kidman on Alibaba's stage, will be throwing her weight behind China's largest and perhaps best-known corporation at a time Washington is trying to contain the Asian nation's ascendancy.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe 29-year-old, whose \"Lover\" sold better initially in China than in the US, underscores Alibaba's effort to take its signature event global. Two of Swift's previous albums, \"1989\" and \"Reputation,\" were both certified for over 1 million copies consumed in China.

More than 200,000 brands will take part this year, offering a million new products. More than 500 million people are expected to participate -- about 100 million more than last year, according to the statement.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Consumer - [HONG KONG] Taylor Swift will headline Alibaba's Singles' Day next month in Shanghai, turning her considerable star wattage on the world's largest annual online shopping spree. .
