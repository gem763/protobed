We don\u2019t understand how this could happen, it is shocking and unacceptable.\"\n\nHungarian news website 444.hu identified the camerawoman as Petra Laszlo. Reuters was unable to reach Laszlo for comment. Hungary's right-wing government has taken a hard line on the flow of migrants across its borders en route to western Europe, portraying them as a threat to European prosperity and \"Christian values\".\n\nN1TV runs a weekly chat show with Gabor Vona, leader of the far-right, anti-immigration opposition party Jobbik, according to the channel's website. The channel says it stands for \"national issues.\"", "description": "A camerawoman for a private television channel in Hungary was fired late on Tuesday after videos of her kicking and tripping up migrants fleeing police, including a man carrying a child, spread in the media and on the internet.", "authors": ["Marko Djurica"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQwSOWuPPGXN4msg-_njU1svgDUrW3eLw-B5zHErNdGbYNWD5zt2G5gsNc6gnG15zUrXqFz2GJMiBV9h8lIl0Wq8IPrcMdnTpmCXaKdRbHwD0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
