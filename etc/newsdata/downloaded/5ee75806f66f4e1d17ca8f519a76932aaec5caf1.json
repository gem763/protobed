Macy, revealed in a letter of support sent to Judge Indira Talwani ahead of Huffman\u2019s sentencing this week.\n\n\"Rebuilding that relationship will be a long process,\u201d he wrote of Huffman's bond with daughters Sophia, 19, and Georgia, 17, noting the family has been in therapy since the scandal broke. \u201cBut I also want you to know Felicity has raised two amazing young women.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to the judge, obtained by USA TODAY, Macy attempted to explain why Huffman paid to have a proctor correct Sophia's SAT answers, inflating her test scores.\n\nMacy said Huffman's own mother was \u201csometimes violent\" and she was raised in her hometown of Woody Creek, Colorado, largely by \"either her sisters or, being the youngest, left to her own devices.\u201d\n\nWilliam H. Macy wrote a letter in defense of wife Felicity Huffman ahead of her sentencing in the college bribery scandal. But not everyone is buying what he says.

From the time she discovered she was pregnant, \u201cFelicity threw herself into parenting,\u201d Macy wrote. \u201cShe read mountains of books and sought out the best and the brightest on the subject. She sought out parents whose children impressed her and picked their brains on child-rearing.\u201d\n\nIt was Huffman, he says, who realized their then-6-year-old daughter, who had learning disabilities, would benefit from occupational therapy. \"She was the first to notice Sophia's difficulty in school and was inexhaustible in getting an accurate diagnosis in treatment.\"\n\n\"But motherhood has, from the very beginning, frightened Felicity and she has not carried being a mom easily,\" Macy continued. \"She\u2019s struggled to find the balance between what the experts say and her common sense.\u201d\n\nTheir daughter Sophia, he added, \u201cpaid the dearest price\u201d in the scandal, after the college the aspiring actress hoped to attend, which \u201cironically, doesn\u2019t require SAT scores\u201d withdrew its invitation to audition.\n\n\"From the devastation of that day, Sophia is slowly regaining her equilibrium and getting on with her life. She still doesn\u2019t like to sleep alone and has nightmares from the FBI agents waking her that morning with guns drawn.\u201d\n\nBut on \"The View\" Monday, the women took issue with Macy's defense of Huffman \u2013 particularly her maternal anxieties.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the club, OK?\u201d Joy Behar said. \u201cWho wrote that speech? It's, like, out of 'Desperate Housewives.' \u201d\n\n\u201cStruggling to be a mom doesn't mean you break the law,\" added Meghan McCain. \"Like, I had a hard time even understanding what the hell William H. Macy was even talking about.\"\n\nMcCain, who recently suffered a miscarriage, said she too has \"a lot of fears about possibly becoming a mother.\" But the host said she doesn't \"think that makes you bribe someone to break the law.\"\n\n\"They are the poster children for what everyone hates about white privilege, and she deserves to go to jail,\" said McCain. \"I'm sorry, for a long period of time. For over a month.\"\n\nOn Friday, prosecutors recommended Huffman serve a month in prison for admitting to paying $15,000 to have her oldest daughter's SAT answers correctede.\n\nHuffman's attorneys, however, asked a judge to sentence the actress to probation and \"significant community service.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Felicity Huffman: 'The View' slams William H.
