(AP)\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 You\u2019d have to see them together, Tim Mead and Eric Kay, Mead the heartbeat of the Los Angeles Angels and Kay his devoted protege, going back years, even decades, to understand.\n\nMead grew into middle age and Kay into adulthood in all the places baseball team public relations men grow old and weary \u2014 on buses, in airplanes, in press boxes, in locker rooms, on the phone, fighting the fights from above and below, drawing and redrawing the lines between huckster and gatekeeper.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe stories would come and go, as would those who told them. The Angels would be good or bad. The players would be kind and agreeable or not, but they, too, were interchangeable, today\u2019s generation becoming tomorrow\u2019s ceremonial first-pitch throwers, base coaches, special advisors and spring visitors. Victory in the public relations department looks like calm \u2014 the owner happy, the field manager unruffled, the players accountable, the press not too cranky. It often would last as long as several minutes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is the place where Tim Mead and Eric Kay lived, together, in the never-ending tumult of a baseball season, of a career\u2019s worth of baseball seasons, and what they did best together was laugh. Tim\u2019s is deep, as though it arrives straight from his soul. He loves the old stories about how crazy and fouled up life can get, because he believes goodness is just a good thought away. A good thought isn\u2019t so hard. Eric\u2019s laugh comes as more of a tenor, and the two of them would get going on a bit of silliness spurred by exhaustion or frustration or both. In those moments, away from the darker conversations of Eric\u2019s well-being or an organization\u2019s missteps, they were what they were intended to be \u2014 Tim the father figure, Eric the light-hearted, charismatic and wholly likable young man who\u2019d learned the business at Tim\u2019s knee.\n\nOpioids came for that, too.\n\nThey\u2019d killed Tyler Skaggs and if that\u2019s all you knew about opioids and addiction, that it killed a 27-year-old man with a wife and a mom and a room filled with friends and a prosperous life ahead, then that would be plenty. But, that\u2019s not all you know. It kills plenty like Skaggs, some younger, some older, some richer, some poorer, some stronger, some weaker. It smashes plenty of families, soaks tens of thousands of funerals, ends even the lives of those who keep on breathing and that\u2019s only the toehold.\n\nKay was in business with Skaggs, a \u201cYou fly, I buy\u201d relationship that kept them both in oxycodone for several years, ESPN reported this weekend. According to that report, Kay told DEA agents from Dallas and Los Angeles that he\u2019d helped supply five other Angels players with the drug. He also told those agents, according to ESPN, that Mead was aware of Skaggs\u2019 drug use as long ago as April, because he \u2014 Kay \u2014 told him.\n\nMead was named president of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in late April and left the club in June. He has denied knowing Skaggs was using opioids, that others might have been and that Kay was allegedly their mule.\n\nSo Mead sits in Cooperstown with a heart almost unbearably heavy. And Kay sits in Orange County, an outpatient and a witness with an almost unbearable burden.\n\nWhat hangs between them \u2014 maybe, after all those years, the only thing that hangs between them anymore \u2014 is a thread that says again of addiction, the dead man is not the only victim. The ugliness, the sorrow, the pain, does not die with him. We must know who knew. We must know who could have stopped it. We must know who facilitated the end. Who followed protocol, who did not, and who made the choices that led to the choices that led to the choices ...\n\nThe cleanup. The wretched, aching, tear-stained cleanup.\n\nThe details are terrible, and maybe the least of those is a relationship between a boy who lost his father years ago and the mentor he discovered in his boss, how Eric needed a friend once and came to learn Tim would be so much more. They mourned the loss of Tyler Skaggs together. And now there are lawyers and federal agents and investigators and a franchise reeling from the consequences of all that came \u2014 or might have come \u2014 on its watch. The days are sure to become more trying, even more punitive. The questions more pointed. The accusations louder. The fall-out more damning. The anxiety and dread and regret stretched further.\n\nFor Eric Kay. For Tim Mead. For them all.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the next play for addiction, right? When it comes time, everybody will be alone.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "We must know who knew. We must know who could have stopped it. We must know who facilitated the end.
