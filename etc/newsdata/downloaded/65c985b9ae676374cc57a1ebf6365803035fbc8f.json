Morrison would be the first current White House official to testify in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"If subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison plans to appear for his deposition,\" Morrison's lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder, told CBS News. \"We will not be commenting on what he will say to the committees.\"\n\nMorrison is the top adviser to the president on matters related to Russia and Europe. Earlier this week, top Democrats on the committees leading the impeachment inquiry asked Morrison to testify, although as of Friday morning, he had not received a subpoena.\n\nMorrison's agreement to testify if subpoenaed is significant, given that White House counsel has told top Democrats on Capitol Hill the administration will not have any current officials testify in the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.\n\nMorrison is believed to have knowledge of the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president that initiated Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nBill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine who testified in a closed-door deposition earlier this week, mentioned Morrison in his testimony. According to Taylor, Morrison relayed that Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the U.K., told a top Ukrainian official \"security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\"", "description": "Tim Morrison, a top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, plans to testify in the impeachment inquiry, if subpoenaed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/39f2e349-8d92-4811-8edf-852c37379cfe/thumbnail/1200x630/2f198a60e21882bdf63d1a7916d9ac9e/gettyimages-160947227.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
