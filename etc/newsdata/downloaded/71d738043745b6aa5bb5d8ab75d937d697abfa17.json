It will be either the largest or second-largest force in the lower House of Congress, depending on the opposition's coalition.\n\nBetween the lines: Fern\u00e1ndez has carved out a reputation as a pragmatic negotiator. His skills will be tested as he sets out to define his authority and divide Cabinet posts in a way that satisfies Kirchner, who remains a key power broker in the Peronist coalition and commands strong support from the party's left-wing hardliners.\n\nIn light of her polarizing legacy, Kirchner played a low-profile role on the campaign trail to avoid muddling Fern\u00e1ndez's message of change. But she now seems likely to expand her presence.\n\nAs vice president of the executive branch and president of the Senate, Kirchner will vacate her Senate seat but retain congressional immunity from any charges that emerge from the ongoing corruption investigations she faces.\n\nWhat to watch: Fern\u00e1ndez may make notable departures from Macri's foreign policy. His first foreign trip will reportedly take him to Mexico, where the Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador administration has taken a neutral, non-interventionist approach to the Venezuela crisis while working with the Trump administration on matters of bilateral strategic interest.\n\nA realignment away from an activist position on Venezuela, however, could hamper U.S.-Argentina relations as well as efforts by the regional Lima Group to apply collective pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nMichael McCarthy is a research fellow at American University\u2019s CLALS, an adjunct professor at George Washington University's Elliott School for International Affairs, and the founder and CEO of Caracas Wire.", "description": "The country's economic downturn will make for a tough road ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/awS96hbkTCTZwWl-zvDdC52aL80=/0x167:3832x2323/1920x1080/2019/10/28/1572287102957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
