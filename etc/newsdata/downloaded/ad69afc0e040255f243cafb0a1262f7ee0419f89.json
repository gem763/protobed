It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when this became the battleground for handset manufacturers, but we\u2019re currently deep in an arms race for photography supremacy.\n\nBut there\u2019s one element of this scrap we rarely talk about: video cameras. Of course these features are mentioned in phone releases and highlighted as part of a raft of upgrades, but it\u2019s uncommon they take center stage in discussions like still images do. Which, in my mind, is an odd move by phone makers.\n\nI assume it was this mentality that, to some degree, led Google to make a bizarre choice with the Pixel 4: no support for 4k 60fps video recording.\n\nThe question of why this was the case was put towards the company on Twitter, and Google gave the answer below:\n\nHi, Pixel 4 supports 4k video recording on the rear camera at 30fps. We find that the majority of users stick with 1080p, so we focus our energy on improving our quality in this mode, versus enabling a 4k 60fps mode that could use up to half a gigabyte of storage every minute. \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) October 20, 2019\n\nI can see where Google is coming from with this, but it does seem like a weird decision with a wishy-washy rationale. The iPhone 11 Pro supports 4k 60fps and uses HEVC encoding in order to reduce the file size \u2014 something one would assume Google is more than capable of emulating.\n\nThen comes the fact Google offers free use of its cloud services for photos and videos to Pixel users. Unless Google is worried about the space on its own servers (which shouldn\u2019t be the case, as to use the unlimited upload service for free the company compresses your media), the idea the non-support for 4k 60fps video due to memory space on a handset seems ridiculous.\n\nThe next weird part of the response is the comment about \u201cthe majority of users [sticking] with 1080p.\u201d While I don\u2019t doubt this to be true, it\u2019s a bizarre rationale to take for a company\u2019s flagship device.\n\nHere is the aforementioned Pixel 4 in my grubby little mitts.\n\nI can understand why Google\u2019s \u2018a\u2019 series of phones wouldn\u2019t include 4k 60fps video, as they\u2019re aimed at the entry level market. But the Pixel 4 is a premium flagship. Hell, the 64GB Pixel 4 XL costs $899, which is only $200 less than the iPhone 11 Pro Max with the same amount of storage. That effectively puts them in the same bracket.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re spending around a thousand dollars on a phone, you want the best hardware for you can get. While not everyone wants to shoot 4k 60fps video, I\u2019m certain many power users want at least the option to do so.\n\nThen comes the aspirational discussion. There\u2019s an increasing trend of artists shooting entire movies on phones \u2014 with Steven Soderbergh\u2019s High Flying Bird one such example \u2014 and I can\u2019t see this method going anywhere. And if I was planning to do the same? Well, I definitely wouldn\u2019t choose a phone like the Pixel 4 that doesn\u2019t support 4k 60fps.\n\nIs this a deal breaker for the public? No, probably not. But entire movies being shot on iPhones is a great bit of PR for Apple, positioning the company at the forefront of creative technology \u2014 an accolade Google is unlikely to get while it\u2019s stingy with providing top quality video.\n\nNow, to be frank, the Pixel 4 not supporting 4k 60fps won\u2019t impact most people. 1080p is more than fine for the majority of videos. But it\u2019s hard to argue that the iPhone 11\u2019s ability to shoot in 4k 60fps gives it a huge advantage over the Pixel 4 when it comes to video.\n\nWe\u2019ll be doing a short comparison of the Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 cameras soon, so check back on Plugged for that soon.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "While the iPhone 11 Pro and the Pixel 4 are fighting for smartphone supremacy, Apple's device has a clear advantage over Google's: 4k 60fps video recording.", "authors": ["Callum Booth", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fheader-image-google-pixel-iphone-pro-4k-60fps.png&signature=a2bec8015c984307b6a3df591432aaba", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
