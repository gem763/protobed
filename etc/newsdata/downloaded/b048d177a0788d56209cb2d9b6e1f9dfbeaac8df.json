Psaki, who worked as a campaign and White House aide to former President Barack Obama.\n\nThat so many are even trying reflects the unpredictable nature of this primary.\n\nWhile a handful of candidates have already quit, unwilling to suffer the indignity of trudging on without making the debates, Mr. Biden\u2019s penchant for self-inflicted errors has prompted most of those polling in single digits to believe his hold on the lead is tenuous and that they should stay in the race. And for the more centrist candidates, their calculation is that the half of the primary electorate that calls itself moderate or conservative will not turn to Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren if and when Mr. Biden fades.\n\nThese twin wagers have meant an unusually large number of underdogs are forging ahead against the odds, ensuring that the historically large Democratic field remains unwieldy and that the lagging candidates must go to new lengths to get attention.\n\nSenator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, for example, both failed to meet the threshold for this week\u2019s debate. But these two western moderates believe Mr. Biden will falter by Iowa \u2014 Mr. Bennet called him a \u201csoft\u2019\u2019 front-runner last weekend \u2014 and that the establishment wing of the party will be scrambling for an alternative.\n\nSo they\u2019re sticking around in expectation of that moment: Mr. Bullock is planning on a modified version of Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s strategy, spending the bulk of his time in Iowa, and has begun spicing up his language with expletives. And Mr. Bennet turned to another time-honored publicity grab on Saturday, the big-name endorsement, when he rolled out former Senator Gary Hart at the New Hampshire Democratic convention.", "description": "The shrinking calendar has those who are lagging the front-runners looking for new life in their campaigns. The rationale for staying in the race is that Joseph R. Biden Jr. will fade.", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/us/politics/08desperatedems2SUB/08desperatedems2SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
