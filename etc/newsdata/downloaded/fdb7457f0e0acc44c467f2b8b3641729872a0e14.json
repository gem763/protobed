U.S. President Donald Trump's new pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Andrew Wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist said on Wednesday 1/16/19 that he does not believe climate change is a major crisis, and would continue to undo Obama-era emission limits,and is a pro business extremist , and for that reason he is not fit to be the nation's top environmental regulator. A federal report written by 13 government agencies late last year said climate change will cost the U.S economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on climate change and has indicated his intention to withdraw from a global pact to fight it, dismissed the report after its release, saying........ \"I DON'T BELIEVE IT\". What Trump ( who is intellectually challenged,does not read,and is immune and indifferent to scientific concepts which disqualifies him to be a spokesman for planet earth) and his cultist naysayers do not understand is the ramifications of global warming such as the inability to ...\"GOVERN SOCIETY\"....the mass migration...the drought.....the food shortages ....that will destabilize societies ....\"WORLD WIDE\" ...so that we all lose control of what we now call civilization.It is the very definition of.... \"INSANITY\" ....to put politicians in charge of our fate instead of scientists.But with the clock running ...going green...maybe already be ...to little ...to late.....and then it will be up to Geo engineering to saved us all. The United Nations just announced that the world should take.... \"UNPRECEDENTED ACTION\".... to cut emissions in the next decade. \"WAKE UP WORLD\"..............this is our........... \"WORLD WAR THREE.\" This is the greatest problem mankind has ever encountered and the consequences are dire with the worst case scenario being........... \"POSSIBLE EXTINCTION.\". 97% of all scientists on planet earth agree that humans are causing global warming, and that climate change is indisputable and that we have 12 years before we reach the point of............ \"NO RETURN\" How was this 97 percentage arrived at? Over 4,000 peer reviewed scientific papers universally concluded the same results. What does peer reviewed mean? The papers were examined by other scientists in the same field for authentication. Consensus is the fraction of those who support an idea....divided by the sum of those who support.....plus those who reject the idea. Why do some folks reject the truth? Because there are a lot of people with a fossil fuel agenda spending a lot of money and effort manufacturing doubt. When we think that there is ambiguity among scientists,which there is not, then a \"hoax\".. is is perceived to exist and that is the goal of fossil fuel advocates. The Republican Party led By Donald Trump...... is the only significant group of people in the ENTIRE WORLD....... who are climate change deniers. The United States has always been at the forefront of being good stewards of planet earth and it has now ........abdicated that sacred...honored...and sacrosanct..... responsibility. This president who actually knows very little, reads almost not at all, has a short attention span,and who is indifferent to concepts and scientific evidence,and therefore is completely unqualified to establish legislative policy that now impacts the fate of this tiny blue marble we all inhabit. When I was a much younger man I loved to gamble and went on many trips to Las Vegas. I don't any more.....but while I was there I saw many huge bets being made.....of course none of those were by me. But Trump and his Republican party , are the biggest high rollers I have ever encountered. You are willing to wager......... the lives of your family..... your children.....your grandchildren... all future generations...... and the welfare of the entire planet ,on the word of our leader who has a BS in Economics from Wharton.....OVER..... the opinions of over 190 countries,who have vetted all human knowledge on the subject and who have signed the Paris Climate Agreements..... and.. OVER .the opinions of the Union of Concerned Scientists with its over 200,000 members ......many of those with PHD's. While it is true that some EPA regulations impede the cost of doing business and of course Trumps prime motivator is the economy but..... THIS HAS GONE WAY BEYOND MONEY. You know there is no free lunch and we must all pay for our transgressions .... that we have committed against the environment and our planet......and time is not on our side. We are at the\" point of no return\" ....action is required...and it is time to change our priorities ..and stand up for our very existence...rather then short sighted ....... monetary goals....initiated by short sighted", "description": "he's filling in for his friend", "authors": ["Gary Trock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CsH6qmJkPDw.Do2BG9_drQ--~B/aD04ODA7dz0xNTYxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/9afaed689479673977d764c946215151"}
