In the video, the roll of carpet appears to be flimsily attached to the black Nissan Juke with a piece of rope\n\nHe can be heard saying: 'Look at that! That's f***ing mental!\n\n'How mental is that? I hope the police pull them.\n\n'I'd put the f***** in the back of my van for them!'\n\nDarren, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, uploaded the footage online a short time later with the caption: 'How stupid. What the f*** is this guy thinking?'\n\nThe car begins to accelerate when it reaches the dual carriageway and the carpet rocks up and down, which is where the video ends\n\nHe said that he had flashed the driver to get him to pull over so that they could offer to help but instead the car sped off.\n\nSocial media users were quick to comment on the video.\n\nOne user wrote: 'Looks like a new sport - car carpet jousting.'\n\nAnother added: 'Wow I never believed in flying carpets till now.'\n\nCumbria Police said they could not find any record of the incident in their logs.", "description": "The footage was recorded by Darren Clee, who was driving behind the vehicle, on the A590  near Greenodd, Cumbria.
