Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged.\n\nRecent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250 day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the Company\u2019s current three year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October 2019. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 million.\n\nProduction at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.\n\nGold Production\n\nQ3 2019 Q3 2018 YTD 2019 Total Production (oz) 101,596 84,783 276,376 Kisladag Production (oz) 35,885 34,070 89,204 Efemcukuru Production (oz) 25,733 24,493 77,524 Olympias Production (oz) 7,941 12,790 24,793 Lamaque Production (oz) (a) 32,037 13,430 84,855 (a) Includes pre-commercial production\n\nAbout Eldorado Gold\n\n\n\nEldorado is a gold and base metals producer with mining, development and exploration operations in Turkey, Canada, Greece, Romania, Serbia, and Brazil.
