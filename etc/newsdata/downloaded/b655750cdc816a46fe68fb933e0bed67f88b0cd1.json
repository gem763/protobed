She\u2019s now two short of Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s all-time record of 23 among men or women.\n\n\u201cEvery year it feels better and better just because we\u2019re adding to the legacy,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI feel like I never think of records. I just go out there and do what I came to do, which is compete for the country.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. team scored 172.330 points to beat second-place Russia by 5.801 points and win its seventh consecutive team title at an Olympics or world championships.\n\nThe reward for winning was a battery-powered medal that lights up when it senses movement. Biles called it \u201cthe sickest medal we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nBiles posted the best individual scores on the vault, balance beam and floor.\n\n\u201cI think if I do the routine that I did tonight I\u2019ll be more than happy\u201d in Thursday\u2019s individual all-around final, she said.\n\nA fall for Sunisa Lee on balance beam in her world championship debut and a fumbled routine from Grace McCallum on the uneven bars left the U.S. with room for improvement, though both were strong on other apparatus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so surreal to come out here and end up on top with the strength of the team that we have, even after having a couple falls out there,\u201d Biles said.\n\nRussia became the first team to get within six points of the U.S. since China at the 2015 world championships, something which pleased Russian gymnast Angelina Melnikova.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy that we got second because we can\u2019t battle the Americans just yet, but today the gap was significantly lower than at the last few world championships,\u201d Melnikova said.\n\nBiles said other teams were \u201cmost definitely\u201d closing in on the U.S.\n\n\u201cAll of the teams have improved their difficulty over the last quad, and I think that\u2019s really exciting to see the strength that they have.\u201d\n\nItaly ended its 69-year wait for a women\u2019s team medal with bronze, as China failed to make the podium for the first time since the 2003 world championships.\n\nChina was fourth after a tough day for Liu Tingting, who fell twice on the uneven bars and again on the balance beam.\n\nA fall on the beam mount by Italy\u2019s last gymnast, Elisa Iorio, made for a tense finish but she recovered to score enough to stay ahead of China by 0.536 points.\n\nIt was a big recovery for Italy, which qualified in last place for the final.\n\n\u201cThe goal for today was just to do better than qualification and how it goes, it goes,\u201d Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa said through a translator.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Simone Biles won a record 21st medal at the world gymnastics championships on Tuesday as the United States retained its women's team all-around title.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/Germany_Gymnastics_World_Championships_36149.jpg-cc459_c0-280-3912-2560_s1770x1032.jpg?31e7e23c40be29fa04fd3a3558f1e136d0701264", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
