Experts, meanwhile, say there\u2019s no evidence that any specific foods have the power to bring on a baby.\n\nIn 2013, midwife and certified nurse Michelle Collins told Fox News that while vinegars, spices, or certain foods like eggplant or pineapple have been rumored to induce labor, there\u2019s no scientific data to suggest that eating them actually works. On the other hand, she says that bromelain, an enzyme found in pineapple, can \u201cripen the cervix\u201d to increase the chances of a successful vaginal birth, though one would have to eat large quantities, and only with a doctor\u2019s approval.", "description": "Oh baby!", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/LaborInducerBUrgerTheSuburban33.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
