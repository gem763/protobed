Instead, Fiji now moves up to third spot behind Australia and group leader Wales.\n\nAfter veteran lock Mamuka Gorgodze trimmed Fiji\u2019s lead to 17-10 with Georgia\u2019s only try in the 52nd minute, free-flowing Fiji cut loose.\n\nWaisea Nayacalevu scored Fiji\u2019s only first-half try and fullback Soso Matiashvili\u2019s penalty goal for Georgia made it 7-3 at the interval.\n\nFiji\u2019s second-half tries came from scrumhalf Frank Lomani, right winger Josua Tuisova, two from left winger Semi Radradra, and one each from flanker Semi Kunatani and replacement lock Apisalome Ratuniyarawa.\n\n___\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nMaxime Medard played fullback when France lost to Tonga at the 2011 Rugby World Cup and he\u2019ll line up again in the No. 15 jersey when the teams meet again in Japan.\n\nFrance coach Jacques Brunel recalled Medard among 11 changes to the starting XV that beat the United States on Wednesday. He planned to finalize his reserves bench on Friday, two days before the Pool C game against the Tongans.\n\nFrance has opened with wins over Argentina and the United States and can secure a spot in the knockout rounds with a win over Tonga, even before it plays England.\n\nThe selection of Baptiste Serin and Romain Ntamack in the halves means that France have used three different combinations at Nos. 9 and 10 to start the tournament.\n\nFrance: Maxime Medard, Damian Penaud, Virimi Vakatawa, Sofiane Guitoune, Alivereti Raka, Romain Ntamack, Baptiste Serin; Gregorie Alldritt, Charles Ollivon, Wenceslas Lauret, Sebastien Vahaamahina, Paul Gabrillagues, Rabah Slimani, Camille Chat, Jefferson Poirot (captain).\n\n___\n\n3:25 p.m.\n\nSpringboks captain Siya Kolisi says Eben Etzebeth will definitely play against Italy on Friday at the Rugby World Cup and the squad hasn\u2019t had any \u201cdistractions\u201d amid an internal SA Rugby investigation into allegations the giant lock physically and racially abused a person in South Africa before the tournament.\n\nSA Rugby said earlier Thursday that it had started a confidential \u201cinternal process\u201d to look into the allegations against Etzebeth. SA rugby is publicly backing Etzebeth and has said it believes him when he denies any wrongdoing, but the organization also wants to understand what exactly happened.\n\nThe allegations surfaced in late August and relate to alleged incidents involving Etzebeth when he was on a night out while on vacation in a coastal town near Cape Town before the Springboks left for the Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\nThe person who made a complaint to the human rights commission said Etzebeth physically and racially abused them.\n\nThe South African Human Rights Commission says it\u2019s starting proceedings against Etzebeth in an equality court in South Africa on Friday, the same day South Africa plays Italy in Japan.\n\n___\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nFiji leads Georgia 7-3 at halftime in their rain-soaked Rugby World Cup Pool D match.\n\nA win for Georgia would all-but assure third place in the group and a place at the 2023 World Cup, while Fiji must win to maintain its slim chances of advancing after losing its first two matches.\n\nAfter Georgia fullback Soso Matiashvili missed a 15th-minute penalty goal _ initially awarded _ Fiji scored the first try four minutes later.\n\nA moment of typical Fiji improvisation caught Georgia cold as left winger Semi Radradra did well to stop flyhalf Ben Volavola\u2019s grubber kick going out on the left. He fed the ball quickly inside to the surging Nayacalevu, who sprinted clear and Volavola converted for 7-0.\n\nNayacalevu should have had a second try after a superb passing move cut Georgia open, but he fumbled midfield partner Levani Botia\u2019s pass inside and admonished himself after tumbling face-first into the wet turf at Hanazono Rugby Stadium on the outskirts of Osaka.\n\nGeorgia then launched a brilliant attack from deep in its own half, carving Fiji open at speed with some great handling.\n\nAfter left winger Alexander Todua and scrumhalf Vasil Lobzhanidze were held up, lock Konstantine Mikautadze emerged through a scrum but knocked on with the try-line in sight.\n\nTodua had been high-tackled near the neck area, however, and Matiashvil kicked the penalty goal to make it 7-3.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nBrothers Agustin and Juan Diego Ormaechea will start together for the first time at the Rugby World Cup after Uruguay made nine changes to its starting lineup for Saturday\u2019s Pool D game against two-time champion Australia.\n\nVeteran scrumhalf Agustin Ormaechea has been restored to the starting lineup to replace Santiago Arata and Juan Diego will start in the backrow. Uruguay opened its campaign with an upset 30-27 win over Fiji, then retained predominantly the same team in a 33-7 loss to Georgia.\n\nFlyhalf Felipe Berchesi, hooker German Kessler, lock Manuel Leindekar and backs Andres Vilaseca, Rodrigo Silva and Nicolas Freitas will make their third starts of the tournament.\n\nUruguay: Rodrigo Silva, Federico Favaro, Tomas Inciarte, Andres Vilaseca (captain), Nicolas Freitas, Felipe Berchesi, Agustin Ormaechea; Manuel Diana, Juan Diego Ormaechea, Manuel Ardao, Manuel Leindekar, Franco Lamanna, Diego Arbelo, German Kessler, Juan Echeverria. Reserves: Guillermo Pujadas, Joaquin Jaunsolo, Juan Pedro Rombys, Ignacio Dotti, Juan Manuel Gaminara, Santiago Arata, Felipe Etcheverry, Agustin Della Corte.\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nSamoa selected two sets of brothers in its matchday squad and made six changes to its starting lineup for the Rugby World Cup game against host Japan on Saturday.\n\nCaptain and No. 8 Jack Lam is joined by brother Seilala in the XV for the first time for Samoa at a World Cup. Hooker Seilala Lam, prop Jordan Lay and lock Piula Faasalele are all into the pack after the 34-0 drubbing by Scotland in Samoa\u2019s last game in Pool A.\n\nScrumhalf Dwayne Polataivao is back in the lineup after missing the Scotland game with a head knock and flyhalf Ulupano Seuteni and wing Ah See Tuala are also selected.\n\nWing Ed Fidow plays after a World Rugby disciplinary committee ruled his red card against Scotland _ after two yellow card offenses _ was sufficient punishment.\n\nIf James Lay comes off the bench to follow Jordan, it\u2019ll be the second pair of Samoan brothers to take the field in the game.\n\nSamoa faces a highly-confident Japan team in Toyota after the host nation shocked Ireland in its last game.\n\nSamoa: Tim Nanai-Williams, Ah See Tuala, Alapati Leiua, Henry Taefu, Ed Fidow, Ulupano Seuteni, Dwayne Polataivao; Jack Lam (captain), TJ Ioane, Chris Vui, Kane Le\u2019aupepe, Piula Faasalele, Michael Alaalatoa, Seilala Lam, Jordan Lay. Reserves: Ray Niuia, Paul Alo-Emile, James Lay, Senio Toleafoa, Josh Tyrell, Pele Cowley, Tusi Pisi, Kieron Fonotia.\n\n___\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones has made just one change to the starting XV that opened the Rugby World Cup for the crucial Pool C game against Argentina.\n\nLock Courtney Laws is the only player who featured in England\u2019s tournament-opening win over Tonga at Sapporo who has been dropped to the bench for Saturday\u2019s game against the Pumas at Tokyo Stadium. He was replaced by George Kruis.\n\nThe England squad has been boosted by the return of Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell to the bench. The pair missed England\u2019s opening two wins over Tonga and the United States because of hamstring and ankle injuries.\n\nJones has picked his best available lineup, with George Ford and Owen Farrell combined in the halves and Manu Tuilagi at center, where he scored two tries against Tonga.\n\nA win for England would ensure it advances to the quarterfinals ahead of its last group-stage game against France.\n\n\u201cArgentina is a completely different team from others we have played and are always about the physical contest,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis week it\u2019s about getting our set piece in a good place and making sure defensively we are organized and ready to find ways to score points against them.\u201d\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (captain), Jonny May, George Ford, Ben Youngs; Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, George Kruis, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Joe Marler. Reserves: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, , Lewis Ludlam, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jack Nowell.\n\n___\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nThe South African rugby union says it has begun a confidential \u201cinternal process\u201d with Springboks lock Eben Etzebeth over allegations he physically and racially abused a person in South Africa before the Rugby World Cup.\n\nSA Rugby\u2019s statement comes a day after the South African Human Rights Commission announced it would take Etzebeth to an equality court on Friday over the allegations. Etzebeth has denied any assault or racial abuse.\n\nSA Rugby didn\u2019t say if Etzebeth would still play against Italy in a crucial pool game at the World Cup in Japan on the same day the human rights commission says it\u2019ll begin court proceedings against him in South Africa. The indications are that Etzebeth will play and remain at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe case relates to a night out in the coastal town of Langebaan in late August when Etzebeth was at a bar with friends and family members. He has been accused of assaulting and racially abusing a person, who then complained to the human rights commission.\n\nSA Rugby says it has been in communication with the human rights commission and has \u201cinstituted an internal process to address the matter, the details of which remain an employment matter between SA Rugby and the player.\u201d\n\nEquality courts generally operate like civil courts in South Africa. No criminal charges have been filed against Etzebeth.\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nArgentina coach Mario Ledesma has made just one change to his starting lineup for the Pumas\u2019 must-win game against England at Tokyo Stadium on Saturday.\n\nNo. 8 Javier Ortega Desio replaces Tomas Lezana in the only change to the XV that started in Argentina\u2019s previous win over Tonga.\n\nDesio returns after starting in Argentina\u2019s opening 23-21 loss to France, a result which put the Pumas in jeopardy of missing the knockout stages from Pool C.\n\nHooker Julian Montoya and flyhalf Urdapilleta retain their places after replacing veterans Agustin Creevy and Nicolas Sanchez for the win over Tonga. Creevy remains on the bench, and Sanchez has dropped out of the match-day 23.\n\nIf ex-captain Creevy comes onto the field on Saturday, he will earn his 88th test cap to take the Argentina record in his own right.\n\nArgentina: Emiliano Boffelli, Mat\u00edas Moroni, Matias Orlando, Jeronimo De La Fuente, Santiago Carreras, Benjamin Urdapilleta, Tom\u00e1s Cubelli; Javier Ortega Desio, Marcos Kremer, Pablo Matera (captain), Tomas Lavanini, Guido Petti, Juan Figallo, Julian Montoya, Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro. Reserves: Agustin Creevy, Mayco Vivas, Santiago Medrano, Matias Alemanno, Tomas Lezana, Felipe Ezcurra, Lucas Mensa, Bautista Delguy.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nDay 14 of the Rugby World Cup features two games with Ireland taking on Russia and Fiji against Georgia.\n\nFiji needs to beat Georgia in Osaka on Thursday to have any chance of progressing to the knockout rounds from Pool D following its upset loss to Uruguay and an opening loss to Australia.\n\nIreland is coming off a shocking loss to host Japan and needs to get back on track against Russia at Kobe in Pool A. The Irish started the tournament with the No. 1 ranking but have slipped following a 1-1 start to the World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa and Italy meet in Shizuoka on Friday ahead of a weekend featuring five games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 14 of the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/japan_rugby_wcup_fiji_uruguay_49989_c0-131-3585-2221_s1770x1032.jpg?2b375e31d1d99eb33cf562da079c4c33d9b9b695"}
