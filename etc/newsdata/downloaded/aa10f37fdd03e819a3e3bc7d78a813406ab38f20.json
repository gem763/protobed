Smith also claimed his 28-year-old daughter, Valeria, was in the car when the alleged attack took place.\n\nAfter his wife died, Keith Smith gave numerous media interviews and lobbied Baltimore for legislation that would ban panhandling at city intersections, even saying he hoped to have the law named for his wife.\n\nThe 54-year-old mother\u2019s death drew nationwide attention and even prompted a response from Oprah Winfrey, who said at the time of the incident she would \u201cthink twice\u201d before giving panhandlers money.\n\nBALTIMORE MAN, DAUGHTER FACE MURDER CHARGES IN TEXAS IN ALLEGED CHARITY-GONE-WRONG LIE\n\nBut by March, police said they determined the charity-gone-wrong story was a lie, and the surviving Smiths had gone on the run. Both were ultimately arrested in Harlingen, Texas, near the Mexico border. Acting Baltimore Police Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said at the time the Smiths' timing at the border affected the timing of the arrest.\n\n\"I can say that being notified that they were in Texas certainly added to the evidence we already had to convince us that it was not the homeless person, [and] probable cause existed that it was more than likely their involvement,\" Harrison told the Baltimore Sun at the time. \"I think there's enough evidence to support that this still would have been the outcome.\"\n\nPolice believe that, at the time of her death, Jacquelyn Smith was about to divorce her husband of five years, and charging documents state a friend of Keith Smith told police that he asked his brother to \u201cget rid of Jacquelyn.\"\n\nPolice also told Keith Smith in an interview that cell phone evidence showed he and his daughter had driven into a wooded parking lot the night his wife was killed. Immediately afterward, police said the pair moved to Florida.\n\nPolice also said there was no evidence the crime took place at the spot they described and no evidence of a panhandler.\n\nMAN, DAUGHTER IN STAGED PANHANDLER KILLING EXPLOITED BALTIMORE\u2019S ISSUES, HOMELESS COMMUNITY, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nLast month, Valeria Smith pleaded guilty to acting as an accessory after the fact in the slaying of her stepmother. She was initially charged with first-degree murder.\n\n\"She's indicated in the plea agreement that she helped her father dispose of the knife. Helped her father dispose of the other property, things of that nature. She's taken full responsibility for that,\" Bradon Mead, Valeria\u2019s defense attorney, told FOX45 in September.\n\nThe 28-year-old will appear in court again on Jan. 29, 2020, where she faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIt's not yet known if Valeria will testify against her father, according to FOX45.\n\n\"Jackie was an awesome woman. It's really sad,\" Jacquelyn\u2019s friend, Michelle Kenney, told FOX45 at the time of her stepdaughter's plea. \"It's heartbreaking the way she was taken from us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe alleged panhandler crime attracted national attention and prompted many people to regard panhandlers warily. It also fueled additional concerns about Baltimore's violence.\n\nFox News' Katherine Lam, Nicole Darrah, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Baltimore man accused of killing his wife and blaming the fatal stabbing on a panhandler is set to go on trial Monday, weeks after his own daughter admitted to helping him try to escape to Mexico after the slaying.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
