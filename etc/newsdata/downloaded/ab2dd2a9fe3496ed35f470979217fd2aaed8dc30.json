I very much hope that our European, EU friends in Brussels, in Dublin, in Germany as well will want to take it forward.\"\n\nJohnson said he wanted to get rid of the hotly contested element of the Brexit divorce agreement - the Irish border backstop - and that there was no point in leaving the EU if one stayed locked in an EU customs union.\n\n\"What we want to do is to get rid of the backstop, that is the most important thing,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Getting rid of the backstop is a fantastic thing because what that does is it enables the UK genuinely to take back control of our regulatory framework, our tariffs, our customs and commercial policy and it allows us to go forward with a new and exciting relationship, not just with the EU but also with the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nThe backstop is an insurance policy to prevent the return of border infrastructure between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nJohnson brushed away criticism of leaked plans to manage the Irish border after Brexit, saying comments from Brussels and Dublin were not aimed at Britain's final proposals.\n\n\"As far as I can make out from what I've seen from the response from Brussels and I think Dublin, they're not talking about the proposals that we're actually going to be taking, they're talking about some stuff that went in previously,\" Johnson told the BBC.", "description": "PM Johnson to submit Brexit grand bargain but Ireland sceptical", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF90252_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
