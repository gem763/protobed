It will be Meir's first spacewalk and Koch's fourth.\n\nThe historic spacewalk will begin at 7:50 a.m. ET on either October 17 or 18, depending on when the crew finishes preparing equipment. NASA will air live coverage on its website and on NASA television starting at 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nKoch was previously scheduled to do a spacewalk with another female astronaut, Anne McClain, in March. That would have been the first all-female crew in 18 years of spacewalking, but NASA cancelled the event because it did not have the right size spacesuits.\n\n10 spacewalks in 3 months\n\nSpacewalks, formally called extravehicular activities or EVAs, are routine yet risky operations. During an EVA, two astronauts put on bulky spacesuits, step outside the ISS, and work together in the unforgiving vacuum of space.\n\nThe ISS has conducted 220 EVAs since its construction in December 1998.\n\n\"Looking at the workload that we have going forward, this was the right crew to send out to do this set of tasks,\" Megan McArthur, deputy chief of NASA's Astronaut Office, said in a press call about the upcoming spacewalk. \"All of our crew members are completely qualified to do this, and I think the fact that it will be two women just is a reflection of the fact that we have so many capable, qualified women in the office.\"\n\nNASA astronauts Andrew Morgan (left) and Christina Koch (right) are suited up in US spacesuits before beginning a seven-hour spacewalk to upgrade the station's batteries, October 6, 2019. In the center, NASA Flight Engineer Jessica Meir and Commander Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency assist. NASA/JSC\n\nThe milestone comes in the midst of an \"EVA blitz,\" with a record 10 spacewalks scheduled in just three months.\n\nOn Friday, astronauts Andrew Morgan and Christina Koch conducted a spacewalk to install new lithium-ion batteries along one of the space station's four sets, or \"channels,\" of batteries. But after that, one of the channel's three power boxes failed to integrate its new batteries into the space station's system. As a result, that channel is operating at only two-thirds of its normal power capacity.\n\nThe failure doesn't impact the crew's safety, ISS operations, or any space experiments happening at the station.\n\nTroubleshooting battery failures\n\nRussian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy takes a break during a six-hour spacewalk, August 22, 2013. Johnson Space Center\n\nThe faulty power unit is about 19 years old, Kenny Todd, who oversees ISS operations, said in the call.\n\nThe ISS suffered a similar failure in the spring after astronauts completed the same routine battery installations on another channel. Todd hopes to identify anything the failures might have in common.\n\n\"There is a fair level of concern,\" he said. \"We're still scratching our heads and looking at the data.\"\n\nAdministrators have pushed back three other spacewalks meant to complete the process of installing new batteries.\n\nWhen Koch and Meir exit the space station, its robot arm will carry them close to the repair site, where the two astronauts will spend about three hours replacing the 230-pound defunct unit, and about another hour doing other routine maintenance. Todd is confident that the battery channel will be in full operation by the end of the week.\n\nMcArthur said that as more women continue to pursue careers in science and technology, all-female spacewalks will likely become commonplace.\n\n\"What we see is more and more women with the education and background and skillset that qualify them to apply to the astronaut office,\" McArthur said. \"That broadens our field of folks to hire from, so that means we're seeing higher percentages of women in the incoming astronaut classes, so that means we're seeing higher percentages of women onboard the International Space Station. I would expect that to continue.\"", "description": "Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir have a new date for their first spacewalk together.
