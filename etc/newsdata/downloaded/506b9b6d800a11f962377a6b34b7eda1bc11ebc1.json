REUTERS\n\nHere's our list of top tips you need to know before hitting the road this summer:\n\n1) Hydration\n\nYou\u2019re going to be sweating a lot more than usual, so up your fluid intake before, during and after running, as dehydration will result in performance drop off, slower recovery, as well as possibly headaches and/or cramps. But, the answer isn\u2019t to simply drink more and more water, indeed over consumption can dilute your body\u2019s sodium concentration and lead to hyponatremia (aka water overload) in more extreme instances.\n\nInstead, try to replace both lost water and salts in a balanced way, the quantities of which vary from person to person. By drinking the right amount of water and salts (add an electrolyte powder into your water bottle), or popping some gels in your pocket - this will keep you at peak performance.\n\nHolmes notes: \u201cTry to space your fluid intake out over the course of your training, as opposed to taking large quantities at once.\u201d\n\n2) Acclimatization\n\nWhen the hot weather first arrives, don\u2019t be tempted to push yourself too much. Take it easy, then - over the next couple of weeks - your body will adapt and your threshold to perform in hotter temperatures will increase with it.\n\n3) Clothing\n\nWear lightweight clothing made from synthetic fabrics, these will help wick sweat away from your body keeping you cooler. If it\u2019s likely to be sunny, SPF rated fabrics - which are quite commonplace now in running sportswear - are a great option (particularly so if you\u2019re a little lazier on the suncream application front).\n\n4) Accessories\n\nA light mesh cap will help keep the sun off your face as well as helping with cooling, and sunglasses are a must too.\n\nHydration packs - or vests - are very popular in the running community, and for good reason. They can weigh as little as 90 grams, yet with a bladder and soft water bottles you can carry around 2L of water, plus items like your phone, sun cream etc - so you can head out for hours at a time whilst being totally self sufficient.\n\n5) Suncream\n\nApply sun protection on all exposed skin, particularly those sensitive areas that see less of the sun, such as the backs of your knees or neck. UV levels are high in the summer so use SPF30 as a minimum, and consider trying out one of the brilliant single application sun creams if you know you\u2019re a bit lazy on this front - they\u2019ll protect you for up to 10 hours without the need to re-apply.\n\n6) Shaded Routes\n\nIf your regular route doesn\u2019t offer much shade and it\u2019s a sunny day, choose a route that will take you through trees, woodland or along hedgerows - these offer a cooler alternative to a sun drenched path.\n\n7) Exertion Levels\n\nThe old adage of listening to your body has never been truer when running on a hot summer\u2019s day. Factors such as your core temperature rising too high, dehydration and loss of salts are very much in the mix, and once you\u2019ve overdone it, it\u2019s hard to get going again. So lower your usual pace, even consider dropping down to a speedy walk for a couple of minutes every mile or so if you\u2019re starting to feel it, just whilst you recompose yourself.\n\n8) Early Mornings and Long Evenings\n\nWe\u2019re blessed with almost 17 hours of daylight on the summer solstice, so why not take advantage of the coolest time of the day and set an early alarm. If you\u2019re not a morning person then leave it until the end of the day.\n\n9) Going for a longer run?\n\nIf you\u2019re likely to be heading out for over an hour, you\u2019ll be needing to re-fuel (this is the point at which your body starts to run out of glycogen, aka energy). There are a wide range of options that\u2019ll stop you hitting the \u2018wall\u2019 - energy drinks, gels, chews, bars and snacks, and be sure to choose those with electrolytes too, as this will help stave off the dehydration.\n\nHelp prevent hay fever symptoms\n\nWhile spring brings warmer weather it also marks the start of the hay fever season. If you\u2019re one of the 18 million people affected in the UK, it makes sense to try to help prevent the symptoms of hay fever. A single dose of Pirinase Hayfever Relief For Adults 0.05% Nasal Spray in each nostril once a day could help relieve sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion, and itchy and watery eyes.
