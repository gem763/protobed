(AMTD) is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter results here on Monday after the market's close. During Friday's \"Mad Money\" program Jim Cramer said he felt that no-commission trading could take a bite out of TD Ameritrade. Let's check out the charts of this brokerage company to see how traders and investors are positioned.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of AMTD, below, we can see that traders and investors have not treated AMTD kindly in the past year. Prices have been in a downtrend with a huge downside price gap recently. AMTD is extended on the downside well below the declining 50-day moving average line and the slower-to-react 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line only showed a slight decline until recently, but the heavy volume made on the gap knocked the OBV line to new lows. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator moved to a new low below the zero line but has since turned higher for a cover shorts buy signal. An outright buy signal will be a long time off.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of AMTD, below, we went back five years to see if the chart would suggest a band of support that might work in the weeks ahead. The $30-$25 might act as support but it certainly is not nearby and traders might not remember the area. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is bearish and the MACD oscillator, too.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AMTD, below, the software is projecting a possible upside price target of $43.\n\nBottom line strategy: I have no insight into AMTD's earnings, but I would suggest that the news is probably discounted already and we could see AMTD recover a bit in the days and weeks ahead.", "description": "TD Ameritrade Holdings (AMTD) stock could rebound as the brokerage already may have seen its shares discount the recent news about zero-commission trading....AMTD", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Td Ameritrade Could Rebound", "Commission-Free Trading Notwithstanding", "The Brokerage Already May Have Seen Its Shares Discount The Recent News About Zero-Commission Trading.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bret Jensen", "Guy Ortmann", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/4ddde510-b8d2-11e7-8e16-2b6180c89948.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
