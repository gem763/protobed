Waterbury, Connecticut, for example, is touched by eight other districts, each one whiter, more affluent, and receiving more dollars than Waterbury itself.\n\nThank you so much for writing on this very important topic. As a resident of Oakland, California, for decades I have witnessed the degradation of our public schools while right next door wealthy towns like Piedmont, Orinda, and Lafayette are funding state-of-the-art schools with local resources.\n\nI realize that I have accepted this situation as just how it is for many years. Articles like yours remind me that this is an insidious problem.\n\nKathleen Handron\n\nOakland, Calif.\n\nReaders responded on Twitter:\n\nI wonder why this system isn\u2019t actionable as a violation of Equal Protection. \u201cWaterbury\u2019s predicament points to an unstable aspect of the public-education system in the United States: The foundation of its funding comes from local property taxes.\u201d https://t.co/DqXhihHJ8s \u2014 Kevin J.

How many people will accept having their property tax dollars fund education in other towns? https://t.co/6WX7vMht8N \u2014 Tans (@steve_tansley) August 5, 2019\n\nMy research on achievement gaps has convinced me that school quality won\u2019t be equitable until school funding mechanisms aren\u2019t dependent on district property taxes. This great article by @AdamHSays in @TheAtlantic with research from @EdBuild explains why. https://t.co/YHqm9rYt3x \u2014 AchievementResearch (@AchieveResearch) August 2, 2019\n\nThoughtful piece by \u2066@AdamHSays\u2069 with ideas on how to fix this historical problem. But seems this has to be a state or national solution. Not sure pooling money by county works. Maryland has county-based schools and still has huge inequities. https://t.co/CV0qm0hmzZ \u2014 Jeff Selingo (@jselingo) August 2, 2019\n\nI grew on the south shore of Long Island. I still remember when I realized the term \u201cde facto segregation\u201d was not just in my history book but in my backyard.

The final numbers\u2014when you factor in both municipal funding and state funding\u2014show Waterbury spending about $1,500 more per pupil than Wolcott.
