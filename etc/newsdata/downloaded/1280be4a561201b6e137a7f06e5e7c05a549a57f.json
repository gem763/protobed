That\u2019s not possible,\u201d one source said.\n\nANC Women\u2019s League (ANCWL) secretary-general Meokgo Matuba told City Press that this was a victory for them.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the decision by the provincial executive of Gauteng and we are pleased that they would be able to comply with the national executive committee\u2019s decision \u2026 We are, of course, congratulating the new MEC, comrade Morakane,\u201d she said.\n\nMatuba said there were lessons that the ANC should learn from this incident.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is about the ANC structures that must begin to implement the party\u2019s constitution \u2013 and that constitution compels us, as ANC members, to comply with [maintaining] gender parity at all times.\n\n\u201cThey must know that other structures of the ANC will not keep quiet if things aren\u2019t done in accordance with the decisions or constitution of the ANC.\u201d\n\nMakhura took almost two months to make the decision.\n\nA source in the provincial government explained that this was because his cabinet wanted to finish planning their tenures.\n\nIn the premier\u2019s state of the province address, he tasked all the MECs to formulate strategies regarding their respective departments and then submit their proposals for the Growing Gauteng Together initiative.\n\nAn announcement regarding the initiative will be made this week and newly appointed MEC Mosupyoe will have to get straight to business.\n\n\u201cHe [Makhura] did not want to disrupt this process because appointing someone in the middle of the planning was not going to work,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source added that the new MEC was also chosen because the party felt Ramokgopa had to be replaced with a candidate from Tshwane.\n\nMosupyoe has served the city in various positions over the years, including as a councillor for the City of Tshwane from 2006 to 2016.\n\nShe also served as a member of the mayoral committee for health and social development, and formed part of the social and economic cluster over the same period.\n\nMosupyoe was the first woman speaker of the City of Tshwane, a position she held from 2011 to 2016.\n\nShe is currently a member of the provincial executive committee and also serves on the provincial working committee of the ANC in Gauteng.", "description": "The ANC intends to line up prospects for Gauteng MEC of economic development, agriculture and environment, Kgosientso \u201cSputla\u201d Ramokgopa, who was axed on Friday, to ensure that he is not left in the lurch.", "authors": ["Queenin Masuabi", "Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9354/fddd6291e99447cd9ed56f4b5c600571.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
