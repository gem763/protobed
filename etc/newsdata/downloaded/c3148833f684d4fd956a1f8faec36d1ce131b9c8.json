They have hailed its founder, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg of Sweden, who is currently on a North American tour to join protests and speak out on the alleged emergency facing the world, including at the United Nations last month.\n\nAnd while Thunberg has been careful to cater to indigenous groups and their activist supporters \u2013 she has claimed some protests are taking place on indigenous land \u2013 many are now turning on her, claiming that she is getting attention because she is white and that support for her is proof that white supremacy and white privilege are alive and well.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all need to ask yourselves why you find it so much easier to hear from white people, regardless of age, when it comes to the violence they have caused across the world,\u201d No White Saviours tweeted.\n\n\u201cIt is a SYMPTOM of global white supremacy that certain people are HEARD & given a platform, certain people have access to the RESOURCES to be the HEROES that the world will pay attention to.\u201d\n\nY\u2019all need to ask yourselves why you find it so much easier to hear from white people, regardless of age, when it comes to the violence they have caused across the world.
