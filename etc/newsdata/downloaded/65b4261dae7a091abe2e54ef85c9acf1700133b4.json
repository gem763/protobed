The Disney Cruise Lines port located 30 miles from Abaco is home to 60 full-time employees.\n\n\u201cMy sister is stuck in the middle of a Cat 5 hurricane. We were told they would evacuate and they didn\u2019t. Left them behind!! Why??,\u201d Twitter user Meg Green wrote in a deleted-tweet, according to the Miami Times.\n\nLater, she reportedly tweeted, \u201cRemember that time [Disney Cruises] left 97 employees on a tiny island in a Catagory 5 hurricane? I do.\u201d\n\nView photos Twitter user dm_meg, whose account was deleted, complained that her sister, a Disney Cruise Line employee, was stranded on a private island during Hurricane Dorian. (Screenshot: The Sun/Twitter) More\n\nIrish politician Anne-Marie McNally also blamed Disney Cruise Line for \u201cendangering\u201d the lives of employees.\n\nUnlike @RoyalCaribbean who evacuated CocoCay staff last week to allow them get to their homes & families and do their own hurricane prep. @DisneyCruise really need to be called out for endangering their workers lives like this. \u2014 Anne-Marie McNally (@amomcnally) September 2, 2019\n\nSo glad to hear that the Disney crew members are safe. I'm still interested though - why not just get them off of Castaway Cay? Why have them stay there with the track of Dorian so close? Seems like it would have been better to take the safest precautions and just evacuate? https://t.co/2axX88W1j0 \u2014 Bri Eggers (@BriEggers) September 2, 2019\n\nI agree. They should have been evacuated. They had the opportunity. Guess its not policy. Have not heard from my daughter (crew member) since Sunday, Disney can say they are safe all they want. But until I hear from her I am still going to worry. \u2014 gooch13 (@gooch13) September 3, 2019\n\n@DisneyCruise @Disney How could you leave 97 crew members on Castaway Cay, a flat tiny island only 5 ft above sea level, when you had 72 hours notice of the danger? None of the families have heard a thing. Corporate greed at its worst. #castawaycay #disneygreed #Dorian \u2014 Stephanie Ann (@StephDorazio) September 2, 2019\n\nIf the ship\u2019s not going there, why leave staff there? Strange decision but it\u2019s probably a financial one \u2014 DeanQUARTERPOUNDER\ud83c\udf54 (@SaltBeefYid) September 2, 2019\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald, Kim Prunty, vice president, communications and public affairs at The Walt Disney Company, had tweeted to Green, \u201cI understand your concern, as they are our co-workers. Castaway is south of the more significant weather. [Disney Cruise Lines] is in regular contact with island leadership and all are safe. Forecast calls for tropical storm force winds, which is what is there now. There are extensive measures in place to keep crew safe. A shelter on the island houses all crew and is stocked with a plentiful supply of food and water.\u201c\n\nGreen reportedly tweeted back, \u201cWhy risk the lives of 97 staff members? They had plenty of time to evacuate, but the decision was made to stay.\u201d\n\nThe Herald also reported that per a Disney staffer, removing employees from the island by way of boat and plane \u201cwould have been difficult.\u201d\n\nAccording to CBS 12, a Sunday statement posted to Disney\u2019s website (that was later revised) read, \u201cMany of our guests have asked questions about Castaway Cay. Some of our Crew remained on the island and their care and safety is our highest priority. We are in regular contact with island leadership, who is making sure our Crew is well taken care of in our storm shelter, which is designed for these types of situations and has restrooms, power and is well stocked with food and water. Castaway Cay remains south of the more significant weather and is currently experiencing tropical storm force winds, which based on the current forecast, are expected for the next several hours before gradually diminishing. Our thoughts are with the people in areas of The Bahamas that are being impacted by this storm and we stand ready to contribute to recovery efforts.\u201d", "description": "Disney Cruise Line came under scrutiny for allegedly ditching employees on Castaway Caye during Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yBZLWVEB3vZ6VFvz.COG6w--~B/aD0xNjExO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3cbfb840-ce6f-11e9-ade7-9d828aa59e88"}
