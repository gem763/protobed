Earlier that school year, a meeting between Marymount students and a fledgling feminist club at Regis, HeForShe, had crystalized some differences as students discussed the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her while he was a student at the elite all-boys Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Md. (Kavanaugh denies the allegation.)\n\n\u201cIt was just such a big thing for us,\u201d says Matias Benitez, 18, a Regis senior who co-founded the school\u2019s HeForShe club. \u201cWe were saying, we can\u2019t let this happen again \u2026 It\u2019s another all-boys school. It\u2019s another prep school. It\u2019s also Catholic, but we don\u2019t want this to be the same.\u201d\n\nWhile Marymount students recalled the boys seeming genuinely supportive during the meeting, they also noticed the way their perspectives differed at times. According to Marymount senior Kristin O\u2019Donoghue, 18, one boy said he believed someone\u2019s \u201cjob shouldn\u2019t be threatened because of something they did in high school.\u201d Benitez says he and most students did not share that view.\n\nThe dynamic illustrates a major challenge for all-boys schools as they\u2019re forced to consider their role in 2019. While they are hardly the only institutions confronting such issues, boys\u2019 schools are already entirely focused on educating boys and known for graduating students who often rise to positions of power, so their leaders see both an opportunity and a responsibility to do more.\n\nA recent survey by the International Boys\u2019 Schools Coalition found that boys\u2019 school leaders think the most important challenge facing their schools today is \u201chealthy concepts of masculinity and relationships.\u201d Asked about the challenges boys\u2019 schools will face over the next five years, a plurality of respondents said \u201cgender issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be less than honest to say it has not added a new complexity, a new challenge,\u201d says Regis High School principal Rev. Anthony Andreassi, referring to the discussions of toxic masculinity and gender equality playing out across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we address this.\u201c\n\nIn a January speech to parents, Jason Robinson, the headmaster of St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., identified this as an \u201cexistential moment\u201d for boys\u2019 schools.\n\nI would be less than honest to say it has not added a new complexity, a new challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very mindful of the fact, as a boys\u2019 school leader, that as we seek to convince families in the future to send their sons to us, they will rightfully ask me the question, \u2018Why should I send my son to a boys\u2019 school rather than a co-ed school? Please assure me that a boys\u2019 school will not be an incubator of male privilege and entitlement and misogyny,\u2019\u201d Robinson says. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve got to have really thoughtful, well-developed answers to those questions.\u201d\n\nThere were about 780 private all-boys schools in the U.S. during the 2017-18 school year, according to the most recent numbers available from the Department of Education, and about 650 private all-girls schools. Many boys\u2019 schools trace their roots to religious orders that sought to recruit and train young men, says Kirstin Pesola McEachern, a former boys\u2019 school teacher who wrote her 2014 dissertation on gender issues at an all-boys Catholic school in the Northeast. That raises a question, she wrote, about \u201cwhy single-sex education makes sense in today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nResearch has shown that all-boys schools can be more sexist environments than all-girls schools or co-ed schools, and that students at boys\u2019 schools display more traditional forms of masculinity and tend to show more respect to male than female teachers. \u201cWhat we know in practice is that when you segregate people, they tend to develop stereotypical views of their own group and the excluded group,\u201d says Juliet Williams, a professor of gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of The Separation Solution?: Single-Sex Education and the New Politics of Gender Equality. But proponents of single-sex schools say they bring out the best in their students, encouraging boys to be vulnerable and to build deeper relationships, while empowering girls to speak up in class and step into leadership roles that might be dominated by boys in a co-ed school.\n\nBenitez, the Regis senior, says some of his classmates seem more willing to start talking about feminism and gender issues in the comfort of an all-male space.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a communal sense that we don\u2019t talk about this as much as a girls\u2019 school would, or a co-ed school even,\u201d he says, adding that boys and men, \u201cas the people who benefit from [patriarchy], are the ones who really do need to hear about feminism and hear of an experience outside their own.\u201d\n\nBut too often, critics say, advice for boys still leans toward treating women as objects in need of protection rather than equals deserving of respect. On the day devoted to women\u2019s issues at Regis, a speaker who was lecturing about the legal definition of rape and consent, using examples of sexual assault at high school and college parties, encouraged the boys to remember, \u201cThat is somebody\u2019s sister, that\u2019s somebody\u2019s closest friend, that\u2019s somebody\u2019s cousin, that\u2019s somebody\u2019s cherished daughter.\u201d To the Marymount students, who thought the day\u2019s conversations were a good start, it was still an example of how not to teach gender equality.\n\n\u201cWe felt that she should have just said, \u2018Think of her as a person that you wouldn\u2019t defile and treat like this,\u2019\u201d says O\u2019Donoghue.\n\nWhile some single-sex schools are public, scrutiny of boys\u2019 schools tends to focus on those that are private and cater largely to students from wealthy families, with common critiques being that they enable male privilege and a \u201cboys will be boys\u201d mentality. (Regis is a private school, but it is tuition-free thanks to an endowment and alumni donations.)\n\nAdam Howard, an education professor at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, who studies elite schooling and affluent youth, says even as boys\u2019 schools engage in more conversations about privilege, sexism and social justice \u2014 often in more progressive parts of the country where the demand for that kind of school culture is greater \u2014 they have not fundamentally changed. \u201cThe core function of elite schools is to make and remake elites,\u201d he says.\n\nIn August 2018, for the first time in history, the American Psychological Association (APA) put out a set of guidelines for treating men and boys, writing that \u201ctraditional masculinity ideology\u201d \u2014 often characterized by \u201canti-femininity, achievement, eschewal of the appearance of weakness, and adventure, risk, and violence\u201d \u2014 can be harmful to boys and men.\n\nWhile the process of writing the guidelines began 14 years ago \u2014 similar guidelines have been introduced for girls and women, and LGBTQ people in the past \u2014 they were released into a world fraught with debate about changing gender roles, and the backlash was swift. Psychoanalyst Erica Komisar said the guidelines ignore biology and \u201cdemonize masculinity.\u201d On Fox News, American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Hoff Sommers accused the APA of \u201ctreating masculinity as a pathology in need of a cure.\u201d And researchers who worked on the guidelines were inundated with hate mail.\n\n\u201cWe can kind of argue about terms,\u201d says Matt Englar-Carlson, one of the authors of the guidelines and a co-director of the Center for Boys and Men at California State University, Fullerton. \u201cBut the reality is that men and boys in American society are not doing that well.\u201d\n\nThough the suicide rate is on the rise for all Americans, it\u2019s higher for men than women. Boys are more likely than girls to drop out of high school, and women outpace men in earning advanced degrees. And while the percentage of men participating in the workforce has declined significantly since the 1960s, due in part to technological advancements and declining demand for middle-skill workers, the opposite has been true for women. The female labor force participation has also rebounded more strongly since the recession. In addition, research has shown that stereotypical expectations of masculinity, including that boys hide their emotions or exhibit dominance, can make them less likely to seek help.\n\nExperts also say it\u2019s hard to combat bullying and toxic masculinity when the President of the United States boasts about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d or responds to a protester by saying he\u2019d \u201clike to punch him in the face.\u201d When the accusations against Kavanaugh surfaced last year, Trump warned that \u201cit\u2019s a very scary time for young men in America.\u201d\n\nAn institution that may look, on the surface, to be rather traditional may be ideally positioned to meet the great progressive questions and the great sort of progressive vision for the future we want for both our sons and daughters.\n\n\u201cThe way [Trump] speaks and bullies and denigrates people, like you\u2019d expect 9- and 10-year-olds to do,\u201d says Thomas Keith, an adjunct professor of philosophy and gender studies at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, who directed the documentary The Bro Code: How Contemporary Culture Creates Sexist Men, \u201cas long as there are people that think that\u2019s a positive trait, it\u2019s going to be difficult to really see a more widespread reversal of what we\u2019re calling bro culture.\u201d\n\nThese are challenges that exist in co-ed schools as well, but ideally, says Robinson, the headmaster of St. Albans, boys\u2019 schools provide an affirming environment for boys to \u201cinterrogate unhealthy notions of masculinity\u201d and discuss anxieties and frustrations without feeling self-conscious. \u201cCounterintuitively, an institution that may look, on the surface, to be rather traditional may be ideally positioned to meet the great progressive questions and the great sort of progressive vision for the future we want for both our sons and daughters,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s why Michael Reichert, a psychologist who leads the Center for the Study of Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Lives at the University of Pennsylvania, developed a program 25 years ago at the all-boys Haverford School outside Philadelphia to help boys learn to express their emotions. Now for an hour and a half every other week, about 50 boys gather to share pizza and their feelings. They dissect their emotions on topics ranging from sex and porn to their relationships with parents, girls and each other. Reichert says it\u2019s not uncommon for boys to cry, and they often shake his hand and thank him when they leave.\n\nPearse Glavin, 18, is a regular. Each session, he says, leaves him with \u201ca tangible feeling in my stomach that an emotional burden has been released.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for schools to have this, boys\u2019 schools especially, because the problems that are going on in the world \u2014 especially in our country with consent and harassment \u2014are really rooted in the stereotype that men should bottle up their feelings,\u201d Glavin says.\n\nIn one study, Reichert found that boys who spent more time in the program developed deeper friendships and greater self-awareness than those who did not. While boys said they were \u201cconstrained by the school\u2019s restrictive norms for masculinity,\u201d according to Reichert\u2019s study, they saw peer counseling as \u201can oasis of opportunity amidst a threatening and even punishing social world.\u201d\n\nSince 2014, the school has also offered a human relationships seminar that covers race and implicit bias, sex and consent, healthy relationships, feminism and manhood. \u201cSchools are becoming these spaces that are really thinking about emotional intelligence and giving kids not just a rulebook, but a play space to practice how to navigate this,\u201d says Brendon Jobs, the school\u2019s director of diversity and inclusion, who teaches the seminar. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answers for exactly how to do it, but we can set up scenarios and offer a reflective space to do the work.\u201d\n\nBut many students and alumni of boys\u2019 schools, and their girls\u2019 school peers, are pushing for more lasting change.\n\nIn early 2018, Kelsey Caine posted an open letter on Facebook to a boy she said had assaulted her in 2010, when she was a senior at St. Agnes Academy in Houston, an all-girls school, and he was attending the all-boys Strake Jesuit College Preparatory next door. In the post, Caine said she had been drinking at a friend\u2019s house, fallen asleep and woken up to find the Strake Jesuit student kissing her and groping her breasts. When others in the house heard her yelling and rushed into the room, the boy denied Caine\u2019s allegations, and everyone believed him. \u201cAll boys schools have an opportunity and responsibility to educate hundreds of thousands of young men about sexual assault,\u201d Caine wrote in her Facebook post.\n\nTo Caine\u2019s surprise, her attacker contacted her and apologized, acknowledging what he had done years before. \u201cWhen you appropriately called what I did to you sexual assault, it hit me like a sack of bricks,\u201d he told her. In April 2018, the two met with administrators at Strake Jesuit to advocate for incorporating sexual assault prevention into the curriculum. They delivered a petition signed by nearly 3,000 people, along with letters from recent alumni who supported it, and a 28-page outline Caine had written as a guide for a potential curriculum.\n\n\u201cPlease give freshmen, sophomores and juniors and seniors this information. I\u2019m telling you that that is something you have an obligation to do,\u201d her attacker told administrators, according to an audio recording of the meeting shared with TIME.\n\nAdministrators pointed to programs already in place at the school and said they were considering new measures. \u201cI think we all are very aware that it is an issue, and it is something that we don\u2019t want to sweep under the rug,\u201d a Strake Jesuit counselor said during the meeting.\n\n\u201cI never said we couldn\u2019t do more,\u201d an assistant principal said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we talk about all the time \u2014 how we can do this better.\u201d\n\nCaine, now 28, says she hasn\u2019t heard from Strake Jesuit leaders since then about the curriculum she proposed or about changes they are making to sexual assault education at the school.\n\nBut a school spokesperson told TIME that it launched \u201cCoaching Boys Into Men\u201d for athletes, \u201ca mentorship program that helps students process their relationships with a healthy vision of their own masculinity\u201d in the summer of 2018 and is incorporating a healthy-relationships program into its counseling curriculum for the first time this school year. It will cover \u201ccontemporary issues in gender relations, sexual violence, and relationship safety, including what the Church calls \u2018sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and women.\u2019\u201d\n\nRobinson took the job at St. Albans in July 2018, three years after the school had drawn criticism for a 2015 yearbook that contained sexist and misogynistic language, echoing problems with Georgetown Prep\u2019s yearbook from 1983. (Georgetown Prep declined to comment for this story, referring TIME to a letter from President Rev. James Van Dyke last September, in which he said it was \u201ctough to see the caricature that we have been painted with by some\u201d and that the school would \u201ccontinue to evaluate our school culture.\u201d) In a separate incident, students at the all-girls National Cathedral School created a Google Doc in 2014 that turned into a catalogue \u201cof unwanted sexual advances at parties, of inappropriate sexual comments\u201d and drew \u201cinappropriate\u201d responses from St. Albans boys on social media, according to letters both schools sent to parents at the time.\n\nRobinson called the yearbook and Google Doc controversies \u201creally, really unfortunate episodes,\u201d and said they fueled his decision to speak to students, families and alumni about issues of privilege and sexism. \u201cThat means acknowledging \u2014 in a very open, transparent way \u2014 moments in our past where we have not lived up to our mission and our moral commitments,\u201d he says.\n\nLast fall, during the Kavanaugh hearings, a few St. Albans seniors wrote a column calling on their peers to address the problematic ways they had treated girls in the past. \u201cOur time at St. Albans will put us in positions of power, big and small, throughout our lives,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd if in the future or in the present, we do not use that power for good, St. Albans will not have succeeded as an institution.\u201d Working with girls from the National Cathedral School, they started a group on consent and respectful relationships that met throughout the school year. Days before they graduated, they urged Robinson to create more co-ed programs so St. Albans students could develop better relationships with their female peers \u2014 something Robinson says he is now working on.\n\nI want people who meet our students to say, \u2018That is not at all what I would have expected of a boys\u2019 school graduate.\u2019\n\nSt. Albans is one of five schools \u2014 and the only all-boys school \u2014 that took part in a pilot program about consent and sexual relationships run by the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia this spring. The school also participated in a survey on \u201cresponsible sexual citizenship\u201d at boys\u2019 schools, conducted by a researcher at McGill University in partnership with the International Boys\u2019 Schools Coalition, and plans to adapt its sex ed curriculum accordingly when the results are released next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often said to our boys this year that I want St. Albans to be a stereotype-confounding school,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cI want people who meet our students to say, \u2018That is not at all what I would have expected of a boys\u2019 school graduate.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn a debrief at Regis at the end of the day addressing women\u2019s issues this spring, a group of students gathered in a classroom to reflect on what they had learned. One boy commented on how it was a rare opportunity to hear from \u201cthe other side.\u201d (\u201cThe other side?\u201d his teacher, a woman, joked. \u201cOf the war?\u201d)\n\nAnother suggested that he and fellow upperclassmen try to set a better example for freshmen by calling out sexist language they overhear or trying to change bad behavior at school dances. One student suggested Regis go co-ed.\n\nIt was the beginning of a conversation that school leaders hope will continue throughout the year. Next spring, Regis will devote a day to the theme of examining masculinity, holding events and inviting speakers to talk about the topic leading up to that day.\n\nThe HeForShe student leaders say their discussions in the coming year will cover toxic masculinity and the effects of the #MeToo movement. They kicked off the club\u2019s meetings last month by discussing sexism in politics and the way female candidates are often dismissed as \u201cshrill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still so much more to do,\u201d Benitez says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an effort that continues until \u2014 forever, really.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "All-boys schools are considering their role in 2019 amid conversations about the #MeToo movement, toxic masculinity and gender equality", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/boys_school.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
