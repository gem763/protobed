The county has yet not received reports of infections from members of the public, Duval-Harvey said.\n\n\u201cThose who feel they have been affected need to see their personal physician and clean their residence,\u201d county fire Chief Benjamin Barksdale said. He did not name the 13 stations impacted.\n\nThe mites are \u201chighly infectious\u201d and spread with close, physical contact, burrowing under the skin and causing rashes, Duval-Harvey said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how scabies spread to the various stations scattered throughout the county, but the close quarters firefighters share could have been a factor, Duval-Harvey and Barksdale said.\n\nFirefighters often are on duty for more than 24-hours and sleep in the fire stations, Barksdale said. Bed linens might have carried the scabies, Duval-Harvey said.\n\nSince the infection was first reported, 205 individual firefighters who might have been exposed have been screened and the 20 found with scabies have been receiving treatment.\n\nThe department has about 900 career firefighters and medics and about 1,000 volunteers.\n\nBarksdale said the infections have not impacted service to residents. Those infected have been off for about eight to 14 hours as they\u2019re treated and returning to work when they\u2019re no longer contagious, Barksdale said.\n\nDuval-Harvey urged residents who suspect they have scabies symptoms \u2014 a rash and raised bumps that look like pimples \u2014 to get treatment and clean their homes to prevent further infection.\n\n\u201cFrom the health perspective we want to be proactive,\u201d Duval-Harvey said.\n\nRead more:\n\nPrince George\u2019s fire chief to retire; will be replaced by deputy who would become the department\u2019s first female chief\n\nAfter a deadly shooting, a different kind of recovery takes shape at one of the nation\u2019s oldest methadone clinics\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "20 staff from the fire department have been infected, county fire and health officials say", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gBAcrDcOGhx9sg-VOCDW0UJU-M4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WTEJ4CGYZQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
