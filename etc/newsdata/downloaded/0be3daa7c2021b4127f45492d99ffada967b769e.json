It was a miraculous escape. The plane crashed into the cables but fortunately it became stuck rather than crashing to the ground.\n\n\u201cThe rescue operation was very tricky. The rescuers had to very carefully manoeuvre along the cables very, very slowly. We didn\u2019t want the cables moving any more than necessary.\n\n(Image: Stop Press)\n\n(Image: Stop Press)\n\n\u201cRopes were then secured around the two men. The whole operation to bring them to safety took an hour and a half.\n\n\u201cWe had 20 rescue personnel and two helicopters involved.\n\n\u201cIt was a miracle. The pilot suffered injuries but not too serious. Both men were of course very shocked also.\u201d\n\n(Image: Stop Press)\n\nMountain guide Marco Confortola, who posted a video on Facebook showing him edging along the cable to reach the victims, said: \u201cThe mountain rescue service worked perfectly. [The operation was conducted] with speed and professionalism.\u201d\n\nAn investigation has been opened to determine the cause of the crash.\n\nMr Milan said: \u201cThere are a number of possible reasons for the crash such as human error or a mechanical failure but we do not want to speculate. There is an investigation.\u201d", "description": "A dramatic rescue was launched in the Italian Alps after the pilot was thrown from his plane and ended up on the wing", "authors": ["Alexandra Williams In Geneva", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Stop Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539289.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-light-aircraft.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
