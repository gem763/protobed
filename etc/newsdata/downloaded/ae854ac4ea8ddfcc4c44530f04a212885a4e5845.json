The hideous monster? The ancient curse? The sharp fangs?\n\nOr the fact that these classic horror films were all rooted in real-life scientific experiments and discoveries?\n\nThat is the premise of a new exhibition at Los Angeles\u2019 Natural History Museum, showcasing movie props from Hollywood\u2019s golden age of horror alongside scientific artefacts that inspired them.\n\nThe \u201cNatural History of Horror\u201d \u2014 opening Thursday, as Halloween looms \u2014 displays the cloth wrappings used to mummify Boris Karloff in the 1932 classic movie alongside real ancient Egyptian corpse bindings from the museum\u2019s archeology collection.\n\nVisitors can pull a lever to recreate Luigi Galvani\u2019s 18th-century electrical experiment on twitching frog legs \u2014 which inspired Mary Shelley\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d \u2014 while examining the metal shackles used to bind The Monster on-screen in 1931.\n\n\u201cThe early electrical work that was done to see if you can re-energize animals and bring them to life was the beginning of \u2018Frankenstein\u2019,\u201d said museum director Lori Bettison-Varga, who moved frog specimens from the institute\u2019s herpetology collection to the new exhibition.\n\n\u201cThese films are essentially inspired by the natural and physical world, and the imagination that people had to create stories based on real things,\u201d she added.\n\nThe exhibition explains how 19th-century diseases such as cholera inspired the Dracula from Bram Stoker\u2019s vampire novel we know today.\n\nIt also features a silicon copy of the monster suit worn in 1954\u2019s \u201cCreature from the Black Lagoon.\u201d\n\nAccording to curators, the monster was inspired by the discovery of a living coelacanth \u2014 an ancient fish once thought to be extinct, which scientists then believed was the common ancestor of all land animals.\n\n\u201cWe have a real one on display in a tank out on the hallway on this floor,\u201d said Bettison-Varga.\n\nCreated as the Museum of History, Science and Art in 1913, the institution\u2019s early collection of motion picture props was boosted in the 1930s by a large donation from Universal Pictures \u2014 including a pitchfork from \u201cBride of Frankenstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we began so early, and before it was considered a real industry worthy of collecting, we were the first through the door,\u201d said curator Beth Werling.\n\nWhile science\u2019s astounding progress since the 1930s makes the discoveries that inspired these horror movies seem quaint \u2014 or obsolete \u2014 today, the same canon of legendary characters continue to resonate with modern audiences.\n\n\u201cSomething that I really love about the monsters is that they\u2019re continually reinterpreted over and over again,\u201d said NBCUniversal archivist Jeff Pirtle.\n\n\u201cUniversal has so many sequels to Frankenstein.
