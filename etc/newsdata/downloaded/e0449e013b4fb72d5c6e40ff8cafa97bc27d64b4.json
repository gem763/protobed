The seven-time Pro Bowler is holding out from the Redskins over his dissatisfaction with the team\u2019s medical staff and their handling of a benign growth on his scalp. Williams did not report to practice this week ahead of Washington\u2019s game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s here,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe had to come back to take care of some things. I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be in town. It was just good for me to catch up with him and see him because I haven\u2019t seen him in a long time.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s revelation came days after former Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hal said on a podcast that he thinks Williams could be returning to the team \u201csooner, rather than later.\u201d Hall has revealed he\u2019s been in contact with Williams and has shared updates on the situation.\n\nPeterson said Williams is \u201cdoing really good\u201d and is in shape, should he return. Peterson, though, declined to reveal if Williams plans on returning to the Redskins soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into all that,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s Week 1. It\u2019s Thursday. So he won\u2019t be back this week for sure. But that\u2019s not what we talked about. We just kind of caught up and see how he\u2019s doing and how things have been going for him. And of course, I\u2019m just asking how things are going here as well.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
