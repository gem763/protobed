Even though on Monday Trump backpedaled and said he did not want a war, the worry about an escalation in the Middle East remains. And one big loser from such an escalation would be China.\n\nFollowing the attacks on Saturday, Brent crude briefly jumped to over $70 a barrel before retreating to $68 at the time of writing. In China, crude oil and refined product futures soared yesterday, as refiners rushed to stock up. According to market research company JLC, every price increase of $5 in Brent will inflate costs of imported crude for independent refiners by about $40 per metric ton. That\u2019s quite a shock to deal with. And it could get worse.\n\nChina has pledged $400 billion in investments in Iran\u2019s oil, gas, energy infrastructure and transport industries over the next 25 years, Kenneth Rapoza noted in an article for Forbes yesterday. This is a major commitment aimed at securing a much needed future oil and gas supply for China whose domestic production cannot come close to satisfying its growing needs. For Iran, it is a way to continue making money from its oil despite the U.S. sanctions. The commodities will be priced in yuan and other currencies that China has reserves in. However, if the U.S. or Saudi Arabia decide to act on their conviction that Iran was behind Saturday\u2019s attacks and target oil fields, \u201cit might be setting a Chinese investment on fire,\u201d Rapoza writes.\n\nThe drone attacks on the Khurais oilfield and the Abqaiq oil processing facility took an estimated 5.7 million bpd in production capacity off the market, according to initial estimates. Oil data analytics firm OilX, however, has estimated the cumulative loss for the three days to Monday at some 12 million barrels. Saudi Arabia has enough oil in storage to cover 10 days of exports at a rate of 7 million bpd, OilX analysts note, adding that it may speed up the restart of production in the Neutral Zone with Kuwait to cover for losses.\n\nRelated: Is A Full-Blown War In The Persian Gulf Inevitable?\n\nA loss of 12 million barrels in supply, albeit temporary, is enough to shake markets and send prices higher. But for China, this is the smaller problem. The bigger one is retaliation. The Houthi rebels in Yemen were quick to take responsibility\u2014and boast\u2014about the attack, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran. Whether or not they are right is irrelevant, Forbes\u2019 Rapoza says. It\u2019s the fact that they claim it was Iran behind the attacks that could, besides a retaliatory attack, lead to a further tightening in U.S. sanctions, with China suffering the consequences alongside its ally.\n\nOthers have got burned already, Rapoza recalls. BNP Paribas got stung with a $9-billion fine for violating international sanctions against Iran a few years ago. Total, the French supermajor, had committed several billion in investments into the development of the South Pars gas field, but had to pull out of the country when Trump reimposed the sanctions on Tehran. The company left to take care of the field was China\u2019s CNPC. Yet it, too, later suspended all work on the field for fear of suffering a sanction penalty.\n\nChina is perhaps Iran\u2019s biggest creditor. It stands the most to gain if pressure from the United States is lifted and the most to lose if this pressure is intensified. For now, the situation is unfolding in the latter direction.\n\n\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Reliant on crude imports from the region and heavily invested in some of Iran\u2019s megaprojects, China stands to lose most if tensions in the Middle East escalate further", "authors": ["Irina Slav"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
