He has been active since the early 1960s, back when he was still known as Richard Alpert and worked alongside his Harvard psychology department colleague Timothy Leary, researching the mind-altering effects of LSD and psilocybin and helping to kick off the psychedelic era. Later, as did many people before him, he ventured east, spending time in India as a disciple of the Hindu mystic Neem Karoli Baba. Upon his return, newly known as Ram Dass, he wrote the philosophically misty, stubbornly resonant Buddhist-Hindu-Christian mash-up \u201cBe Here Now,\u201d in which he extolled the now-commonplace, then-novel (to Western hippies, at least) idea that paying deep attention to the present moment \u2014 that is, mindfulness \u2014 is the best path to a meaningful life.\n\nPublished in 1971, that book, an early classic of New Age thinking, has sold around two million copies, according to his website; Ram Dass, who has since written a dozen other books, continues to find new readers via praise from the likes of Lena Dunham and the presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. The 88-year-old\u2019s archived lectures have also found second lives as popular podcasts, and he has been the subject of multiple documentaries, including the life-spanning \u201cBecoming Nobody,\u201d which premieres on Sept. 6. \u201cFirst I was a professor,\u201d said Ram Dass, who in 1997 suffered a stroke that affected his speaking ability. \u201cThen I was a psychedelic. Now I\u2019m old. I\u2019m an icon.\u201d He smiled knowingly. \u201cThere are worse things to be.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cBe Here Now,\u201d1 you write about going to an ashram in India and spending months in deep meditation. Most of us can\u2019t drop out like that and can find it hard enough to not check our phones every five minutes or get away from work email for a day, let alone spend hours a night focusing on breathing, as you did. All of which is a preamble to asking: Is modern Western life anathema to the effort needed for the kind of spiritual development you espouse? Yes. Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts: Those are the daily attention-grabbers that make it so that you can\u2019t come from your mind to your heart to your soul. The soul contains love, compassion, wisdom, peace and joy, but most people identify with the mind. You\u2019re not an ego. You\u2019re a soul. You\u2019re not psychologically full of anxiety and fear.\n\nRalph Metzner, Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) in 1965 in Laredo, Tex., where Leary was standing trial on charges of marijuana possession. Lawrence Schiller/Polaris Communications/Getty Images\n\nSpeak for yourself. If you identify with the ego plane, you\u2019ll find you\u2019re in time, you\u2019re in space, you\u2019re a little body. But go to the spiritual heart, and there will be a doorway to the next plane of consciousness: soul land. My guru2 once called me over after I threw a plate of food at a Westerner at the ashram. Maharaji said: \u201cRam Dass! Is something the matter?\u201d I told him my complaints about the Westerners who were hanging around, and he got a glass of milk and fed it to me, and he said, \u201cNow, you do it for them.\u201d So I fed the milk to every one of the Westerners. It made me feel good in my heart. Feed them. Love everybody.\n\nWell, along those lines, your belief is that the universe is unfolding perfectly. So how do we, as human beings, make sense of that perfection given the impending awful catastrophe of something like climate change? Humans can have consciousness on two planes. For example, when you are a reporter at The Times, it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s a dance. How many people do you have to impress? It\u2019s stuff like that. But the soul has in it the witness, and it witnesses our whole incarnation. The soul watches the game without judgment.\n\nAm I playing the game the right way? Um, no.\n\nAh, Christ. Is there at least a \u201cbut\u201d coming? But your intellect will keep you on track! I sense that you are in your spiritual work. You are a soul. Your baby is a soul. Your wife is a soul. The reader is a soul. The editor is a soul. I am a soul. But many of those people don\u2019t identify with their soul. There\u2019s a metaphor that Maharaji described for me: There\u2019s a fisherman, and he\u2019s got a pole, and you\u2019re the fish and I\u2019m the worm. In India, they say: \u201cDon\u2019t look for a guru. The guru looks for you.\u201d\n\nYou believe that the \u201cI\u201d is an illusion, and in your most recent book3 there are quick references to your being gay, which isn\u2019t something I\u2019d seen you mention before. But what does individual sexual orientation mean if the \u201cself\u201d is just a construct of the ego? It\u2019s part of a dream. From when I was a teenager until I found Maharaji, I was homosexual in my head. In high school, prep school, I was attracted to men. That tendency shaped my life. Owsley \u2014 you know Owsley?\n\n\u201cA Discussion of LSD and Consciousness Expansion\u201d poster for an event with Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass). The New York Public Library Digital Collections\n\nYeah, he was a sound engineer for the Grateful Dead.4Yes. I was hanging around backstage, and he took a tab of acid and put it on my tongue. Then a girl had a tab of acid, and Owsley shepherded us to the dance floor. She and I had a jovial time from that dance and on through the next probably three months. Then years later I got a letter from a guy. He said: \u201cI believe that you are the father of my older brother because I found you on the internet and you look like him. For 50 years my mother did not talk about it.\u201d She was a graduate student at Stanford, and she became linked to me. You can imagine my surprise that I had a 50-year-old son. So much for being a good homosexual!\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be crass, but how has suffering the cognitive effects of a stroke inhibited your ability to move toward enlightenment? Well, the stroke5 took away my cello playing, golf, making love. So all I could do after the stroke was go inside and concentrate on my spiritual side.\n\nWhy do you think younger generations are showing a renewed interest in New Age thinking and practices? Nostalgia for the \u201960s and \u201970s. They\u2019re tired of our culture. They\u2019re interested in cultivating their minds and their soul.\n\nDo you ever worry that all these individuals turning inward rather than outward are doing it as a way of avoiding political engagement? Social action and spiritual work are not mutually exclusive. The witness witnesses the politics or the many games we play. In the long run, this is beneficial to individuals and the culture.\n\nRam Dass at an ashram in India in 1971 with his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. Rameshwar Das\n\nIf you had an audience with President Trump, what advice would you give him that would be helpful to him in his job? Identify with your soul.\n\nThat could take some work. No.\n\nNo? Am I being unfairly judgmental? On my puja table6 is Donald Trump. When I look at his picture, I say to him, \u201cI know you from your karma, and I don\u2019t know you for your soul.\u201d And I am compassionate about that soul because he has heavy karma.\n\nWhen I went back and read the work of your old colleague Timothy Leary, he was all about expressing the hope that widespread use of LSD could transform society for the better. That didn\u2019t happen. Is it possible that you and Leary were aiming at the wrong targets when you were promoting the revolutionary possibilities of psychedelic drugs? Maybe they can be revolutionary only on the individual level and not societally. Tim was a social scientist, and he was experimenting with social situations. That\u2019s where his focus was. In the last period of Tim\u2019s psychedelic world, he heard the mantra: \u201cTurn on, tune in and drop out.\u201d That\u2019s radical. That\u2019s radical.\n\nEver want to take acid for old times\u2019 sake? Yeah. I think I want to delve into planes of consciousness. I gave my guru in India LSD, and he said that plants with similar effects were around in the olden times and that by taking them you could stay in the room with Christ for only a few hours instead of living with the Lord. That\u2019s why I went to the east. They had methods for living with the Lord.\n\nRam Dass in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in June 1972. Allen Ginsberg, from The Ginsberg Estate\n\nYou talk about your guru as a perfect teacher. But at the risk of sounding glib, no one is perfect. Maharaji guides me, and I feel secure in that guidance, so I feel secure in my teaching. \u201cRam Dass\u201d means \u201cservant of Ram,\u201d and the highest ideal of that is Hanuman,7 who is completely selfless in his service and love. I serve Maharaji with that love. This is all not to do, at the ultimate level, with a body. It\u2019s to do with that thing that\u2019s beyond.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that you\u2019re ready to die. When did you know? When I arrived at my soul. Soul doesn\u2019t have fear of dying. Ego has very pronounced fear of dying. The ego, this incarnation, is life and dying. The soul is infinite.\n\nO.K., here\u2019s something I\u2019m struggling with: You teach that we\u2019re supposed to be free from desires. I can imagine myself being free from the desire for prestige or money or some unattainable person\u2019s attention. It\u2019s much harder to imagine being free from the desire, for example, that my loved ones not come to any harm. Are we even supposed to let go of desires like that? Yep! Desire is desire. Attachment is attachment. When I came back to the U.S. from India, I came back bringing the message of Maharaji. I had never experienced the love that he showered on me. It was unconditional love. Everything in my life had been conditional love. When I was a good boy, then they loved me. When I was a good student, they loved me. When I was a good lover, they loved me. I thought that I could come back and show unconditional love. The core message is that kind of love.\n\nAbout that core message: I\u2019ve read \u201cBe Here Now\u201d probably a half-dozen times. I\u2019ve listened to countless lectures of yours and read a bunch of your other books. And I have to say that I still find it difficult to explain exactly what your philosophy is beyond the phrase \u201cBe here now,\u201d which is admittedly a very useful phrase. So while I have you: What is your philosophy? \u201cBe here now\u201d is: In each moment, go into the moment. Our minds take us back and forth in time. I teach a moment. And I teach that we identify with the ego. The ego is a mind warp, and most people don\u2019t identify with their soul. They\u2019re worried about excess meaning. The soul witnesses the ego and witnesses thoughts. \u201cBe here now\u201d gives people an opportunity to reidentify outside of their thinking-mind ego and into that thing that\u2019s called the soul. It is the perspective from which we could live a life without being caught so much in fear. To reidentify there is to change your whole life.", "description": "\u201cSoul doesn\u2019t have fear of dying.
