The Ukrainian president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, traveled to Washington in March \u2014 but only after the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, had already been dismissed by the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nWhy the confusion? Because Biden managed to squeeze months of diplomacy into a few hours when he recounted the story years later at the Council on Foreign Relations. Biden\u2019s tale, ironically, has become exhibit 1 in President Trump\u2019s false narrative that Biden ousted the prosecutor because he was investigating a company associated with his son Hunter Biden. As we have reported, the drive to push out Shokin was an international effort widely celebrated at the time.\n\nAD\n\nWe don\u2019t normally do media criticism, but it\u2019s important to correct the timeline.\n\nAD\n\nThe Facts\n\nHere\u2019s\u2019 what Biden said during a 2018 appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations:\n\n\u201cI remember going over, convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor [Shokin]. And they didn\u2019t\u2026They were walking out to a press conference. I said, \u2018Nah, \u2026 We\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars.\u2019 They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, \u2018Call him.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars.\u2019 \u2026 I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nFrom Biden\u2019s story, it sounds like things had happened very fast, in the space of six hours. But it was really a diplomatic slog that extended from September through May. In August 2016, in fact, Biden gave a somewhat less dramatic version of the story to the Atlantic magazine:\n\n\u201cHe described, for example, a meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u2014whom he calls \u2018Petro\u2019\u2014in which he urged Poroshenko to fire a corrupt prosecutor general or see the withdrawal of a promised $1 billion loan to Ukraine. \u2018Petro, you\u2019re not getting your billion dollars,\u2019 Biden recalled telling him. \u2018It\u2019s OK, you can keep the [prosecutor] general. Just understand\u2014we\u2019re not paying if you do.\u2019 Poroshenko fired the official.\u201d\n\nBiden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The $1 billion in loan guarantees was essential leverage because the Ukrainian government needed the credit line to underwrite its budget. At stake was not just Shokin, but a broad package of reforms, including a shake-up of the cabinet, sought by Western powers.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. ambassador at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, along with then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, were key champions of the policy at the day-to-day level. Shokin was considered a close associate of Poroshenko, so his removal required a lot of work. \u201cHe\u2019s was completely Poroshenko\u2019s creature,\u201d recalled one former U.S. official involved in Ukraine policy.\n\nAD\n\nPyatt kicked off the effort with a speech on Sept. 24, 2015 in which he blasted Shokin for \u201copenly and aggressively undermining reform\u201d and having \u201cundermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases.\u201d In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Oct. 8, Nuland declared: \u201cThe Prosecutor General\u2019s Office has to be reinvented as an institution that serves the citizens of Ukraine, rather than ripping them off.\u201d\n\nBiden followed up with a visit to Kiev in December. On Dec. 7, he held a news conference with Poroshenko and announced $190 million to \u201cfight corruption in law enforcement and reform the justice sector.\u201d He made no public mention of the loan guarantee, but behind the scenes he had explicitly linked the $1 billion loan guarantee to reform efforts, including removing Shokin, according to Colin Kahl, Biden\u2019s national security adviser at the time.\n\nAD\n\nA day after the news conference, he addressed the Ukrainian parliament and decried the \u201ccancer of corruption\u201d in the country. \u201cThe Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform,\u201d he noted.\n\nAD\n\nKahl said Biden had a version of the parliament speech in which he would have announced the loan guarantee if Poroshenko immediately had taken the actions demanded by the United States and its international partners. But since the Ukrainian leader did not remove Shokin during that trip, Biden instead emphasized the country\u2019s corruption in his speech.\n\n\u201cIt was very politically challenging thing for Poroshenko,\u201d Kahl said. \u201cYou could see he was not happy\u201d about not getting the loan guarantee.\n\nAD\n\nBiden next met on Jan. 20 with Poroshenko on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when he also pressed \u201cthe need to continue to move forward on Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption agenda,\u201d according to a White House statement. Kahl said Biden at that meeting reinforced the linkage between the loan guarantee and the necessary reforms.\n\nAD\n\nThen a series of calls followed.\n\nFeb. 12: Biden spoke to Poroshenko by phone. \u201cThe two leaders agreed on the importance of unity among Ukrainian political forces to quickly pass reforms in line with the commitments in its IMF program, including measures focused on rooting out corruption,\u201d the White House said.\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 16: Poroshenko announced he had asked Shokin to resign. \u201cThis morning I have met and had a serious conversation with the prosecutor general. I have suggested Viktor Mykolayovych [Shokin] should write a letter of resignation,\u201d the president said in a statement. Shokin agreed to do so.\n\nFeb. 18: Another call took place between Biden and Poroshenko. \u201cThe Vice President also commended President Poroshenko\u2019s decision to replace Prosecutor General Shokin, which paves the way for needed reform of the prosecutorial service,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe Vice President urged President Poroshenko to continue on this positive trajectory, to include successful implementation of the new legislation and continued visible progress on anti-corruption reforms, noting this will require unity and stability.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 19: Poroshenko announced he has received Shokin\u2019s resignation letter. It still required parliamentary approval, and Shokin did not go away quietly.\n\nAD\n\nThat same day, Biden spoke separately to Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. \u201cHe urged Ukraine\u2019s leadership to unite and rebuild popular trust around a strong governing coalition and reform program, and to accelerate Ukraine\u2019s efforts to fight corruption, strengthen justice and the rule of law, and fulfill its IMF requirements,\u201d the White House said.\n\nMarch 16: Reports emerged that Shokin was back at work after having been on vacation. He later fired a reformist deputy who had called for his removal from office.\n\nMarch 22: Biden and Poroshenko spoke again by phone, mainly about Russia\u2019s conviction and sentencing of Ukrainian pilot and member of parliament Nadiya Savchenko, who had been captured by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMarch 29: The Ukrainian parliament, in a 289-to-6 vote, approved Shokin\u2019s dismissal.\n\nOn March 31, Poroshenko met with Biden during a trip to Washington, and Biden emphasized that the loan guarantee was contingent on further reform progress beyond Shokin\u2019s removal. \u201cThe Vice President welcomed the efforts of President Poroshenko to form a stable, reform-oriented government, and stressed that this step, as well as the enactment of needed reforms, are critical to unlocking international economic assistance, including the third $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee,\u201d the White House said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama originally was not expected to meet with Poroshenko but a meeting was arranged on April 1. \u201cPresident Obama confirmed willingness to provide the third tranche of loan guarantees in the amount of $1 billion upon completion of the formation of a new government in Ukraine, the Ukrainian press service reported.\n\nAD\n\nOn April 14, Biden and Poroshenko had another call. Biden congratulated the president on his new cabinet and \u201cstressed the urgency of putting in place a new Prosecutor General who would bolster the agency\u2019s anti-corruption efforts and strongly support the work of its reformers,\u201d a White House statement said. The Ukrainian press service reported \u201cthe parties agreed that an agreement on the issue of the third tranche of credit guarantees in the amount of $1 billion will soon be signed.\u201d\n\nMay 12: Poroshenko nominated Yuriy Lutsenko as the new prosecutor general.\n\nOn May 13, in a phone call, Biden told Poroshenko he welcomed Lutsenko\u2019s appointment and creation of an inspector general in the prosecutor\u2019s office. \u201cThe Vice President informed President Poroshenko that the United States was prepared to move forward with the signing of the third $1 billion loan guarantee agreement, which will support continued progress on Ukrainian reforms,\u201d a White House statement said.\n\nThe loan guarantee was finally signed on June 3, with Pyatt representing the United States.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs we demonstrated, Biden was never in Kiev in March 2016, as many news organizations have reported. The tying of $1 billion in loan guarantees to needed reforms, including the ouster of Shokin, was a policy pursued over many months, but Biden\u2019s explicit linkage was made during his trip to Kiev in December \u2014 three months earlier.\n\nBiden\u2019s overly dramatic foreshortening of events has confused many reporters, including here at The Fact Checker. We\u2019ve corrected our mistake, and we urge other news organizations to do so as well.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "Many news organizations have reported former vice president Joe Biden traveled to Kiev in March, 2016.
