And while 2.3kg sounds heavy, it's pretty good for a gaming notebook.\n\nAcer also announced the new Predator Triton 500, which will be thinner than its predecessor. It will still come with a 15.6-inch Full HD display, but will now roll at 300 Hz.\n\nImage: Acer\n\nLastly, there is also a brand new version of the Predator Thronos, which was first unleashed at IFA in 2018 and disappeared from the show floor after one day.\n\nDubbed the Predator Thronos Air, it continues what its predecessor started by taking gaming \"chairs\" to the next level with sheer ridiculousness.\n\nThe setup is really more like a cockpit, coming with a modular desk, monitor arm, adjustable keyboard and mouse tray and support for three monitors. There is also a place for your PC to live and a neat cable management system.\n\nAnd the chair itself can be adjusted to 130 degrees inside the \"cabin\" or 180 outside of it and has a massage function because of course it does.\n\nBut before you get too excited, it's unlikely that this thing will ever come to Australia. It certainly didn't last year.\n\nBut hey where there's a will (and enough cash to throw at shipping) there's a way.\n\nAcer's Predator Triton will be available in Australia sometime in Q4 and will have an RRP of $1,999.\n\nThere is currently no local pricing or availability for the Predator Triton 500.", "description": "At IFA this week Acer announced its new Predator Triton 300 - a thin and light notebook designed for gamers wanting a decent amount of power in a more portable and affordable chassis....", "authors": ["Mark Serrels", "Jason Schreier"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/09/predator-triton-2.jpg"}
