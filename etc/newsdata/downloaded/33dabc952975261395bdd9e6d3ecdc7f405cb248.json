The Climate Pledge calls on its participants to be at net-zero carbon across their businesses a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of 2050.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue \u2014 we\u2019ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. \u201cIf a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon \u2014 which delivers more than 10 billion items a year \u2014 can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can.\u201d\n\nThe pledge comes in the days leading up to the much-publicized United Nations \u201cclimate crisis\u201d meeting in New York on Sept. 23. That gathering has encouraged a flurry of activism, including another walkout on Friday by students and employees of big companies, Amazon among them, to bring attention to the climate issue.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s goal of net-zero carbon by 2040 is ambitious but achievable,\u201d said Sue Reid, vice president of climate and clean energy at Ceres. \u201cMany of the solutions, like switching to renewable energy and amping up energy efficiency, are no-regrets strategies that can bring near-term and long-term cost savings.\u201d She notes that light-duty electric vehicles already are cheaper on a total-cost-of-ownership basis, and are rapidly approaching cost parity with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles right at the time of purchase. Amazon with the size of its purchase will have economies of scale on its side.\n\nBut not all observers are quite convinced.\n\n\u201cAnnouncements like these [from Amazon], while they have great potential to be the change that is very much needed by corporate leadership, are bound on both ends by history,\u201d said Stephen Donofrio, founder of Greenpoint Innovations. \u201cIt includes many years of Amazon standing idle to requests for disclosure of their climate and other environmental impacts from investor organizations like the Carbon Disclosure Project, which has in turn shaded them from their stakeholders\u2019 efforts to establish a clear pathway to impact management, accountability and ultimately action.\u201d\n\nConsumers and shareholders have had to reconcile the retailer\u2019s creative destruction, which allows everything from fresh fruit to diapers to bicycle chain oil to be delivered, heavily packaged in some cases, on doorsteps. Some argue that mass deliveries are more efficient than a car culture that drove to shopping malls and grocery chains.\n\nIn a 2013 study, Anne Goodchild, director of the University of Washington\u2019s Supply Chain Transportation and Logistics Center, found that grocery delivery trucks emitted between 20% and 75% less carbon dioxide per customer on average than passenger vehicles driving to the stores around Seattle, but only if grocery stores, and not customers, could choose drop-off times and optimize delivery routes.\n\nAmazon said in July that this year\u2019s two-day Prime Day shopping event surpassed its Black Friday and Cyber Monday totals combined. More than 175 million items were purchased for Prime Day.\n\nNow, with what it\u2019s calling Amazon Shipment Zero, the retailer thinks it can eventually make all shipments net-zero carbon, and be at 50% net-zero carbon by 2030, the company said Thursday. Getting there will include use of its existing sustainable packaging initiatives like Frustration-Free Packaging and Ship-in-Own-Container, which have reduced packaging waste by 25% since 2015.\n\nAmazon was featured recently in efforts by shareholders and the funds that represent them to put pressure on companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics. Shareholders increasingly want Amazon to be more transparent about its fossil-fuel use.\n\nRead: Demand for climate-proofed portfolios was a key proxy-season theme this year\n\n\u201cDespite investors\u2019 efforts, it\u2019s incredible to see that it was the company\u2019s employees who were finally able to draw a duel. However, it will be up to all of us \u2014 from Amazon\u2019s employees to its business partners to governments, investors and yes, even consumers \u2014 to ensure that the other side of Amazon\u2019s history, the one that\u2019s yet to play out, is met with real investments and initiatives to create the solutions needed to achieve such significant goals,\u201d said Donofrio.\n\nAmazon is now pledging to reach 80% renewable energy by 2024 and 100% renewable energy by 2030 on its path to net zero carbon by 2040.\n\nIt has already made investments that could change the way it delivers, including $440 million in Michigan-based, and Illinois-built, Rivian emissions-free electric vehicles. Amazon on Thursday said it has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, with vans starting to deliver packages to customers in 2021. Amazon plans to have 10,000 electric vans on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030, saving 4 million metric tons of carbon per year by 2030, it says.\n\nAmazon will order 100,000 electric delivery vans from EV startup Rivian, Jeff Bezos says https://t.co/PMuo2W4PAD pic.twitter.com/heZ1Gogu2F \u2014 Verge Transportation (@vergecars) September 19, 2019\n\n\u201dAmazon\u2019s size cuts both ways. On one hand, as one of the world\u2019s largest companies it has considerable resources and capacity \u2014 including a robust in-house sustainability team \u2014 that can enable ambitious climate action,\u201d said Reid of Ceres. \u201cOn the other hand, the company\u2019s sheer size and breadth add complexities that must be addressed, for example with regard to addressing indirect emissions from operations and products that it doesn\u2019t fully control.\u201d\n\nAmazon stock has rallied 21.7% in 2019 but is down 5.1% over the past year. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00% is up 20.4% so far in 2019.", "description": "Amazon has set a goal to meet the Paris Climate Agreement objectives by 2040, 10 years early, including a pledge to emit net-zero carbon.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia", "Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR651_amazon_ZG_20190919125437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
