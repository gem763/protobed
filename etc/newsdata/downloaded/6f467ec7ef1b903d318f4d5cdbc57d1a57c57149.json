The Lakers forward said Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d on the issue, and he spoke of the \u201cnegative\u201d side-effects of free speech.\n\nWatch:\n\nLakers\u2019 LeBron James on NBA\u2019s China controversy: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a \u2026 feud with Daryl Morey but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\u201d pic.twitter.com/KKrMNU0dKR \u2014 Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) October 15, 2019\n\nJames received tremendous backlash over the comments, much of which Barkley felt was \u201cunfair.\u201d Barkley told TMZ Sports, \u201cEvery major American company does business in China and it\u2019s not fair to act like LeBron\u2019s gonna save the world.\u201d\n\nFull credit to the TMZ photog for pressing Barkley. The former 76er and TNT host\u2019s insistence that ones business interests should outweigh their social justice activism, is clearly an opinion that is held by James, the NBA, and Nike. One could argue Barkley is looking out for his business interests in defending James, considering Barkley\u2019s business is the NBA and LeBron is the league\u2019s most popular player.\n\nThe only question now, is why anyone would listen to any of them on any social or political issue ever again?\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "TNT commentator and former NBA star Charles Barkley defended Lakers forward LeBron James against \"unfair\" criticism, following", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/R-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
