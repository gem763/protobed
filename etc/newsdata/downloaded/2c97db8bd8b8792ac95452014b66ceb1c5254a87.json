He required hip replacement surgery.\n\nCarter fell again on October 6 and despite receiving 14 stitches, traveled the same day to Nashville, Tennessee, to rally volunteers and, later, to help build a Habitat for Humanity home.\n\nHe used a cane when he rallied volunteers that morning.\n\nCarter told the crowd of volunteers that despite going to hospital, 'I had a number one priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses'.\n\nHe survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 and surpassed George H.W. Bush as the longest-lived U.S. president in history this spring.\n\nCarter is the oldest living former president in U.S. history.\n\nHe and 92-year-old wife Rosalynn recently became the longest married first couple, surpassing George and Barbara Bush, with more than 73 years of marriage.\n\nThe first accident on October 6 left Carter with 14 stitches above his brow and bruising around his left eye. He is pictured with his wife Rosalynn just one day after the earlier incident this month\n\nDespite his injuries earlier this month, Carter still showed up to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity the next day in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife\n\nThe 39th president has continued with his humanitarian work despite his health setbacks.\n\nCarter still teaches Sunday school twice a month at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains.\n\nCarter also has occasionally weighs in on politics and policy, recently expressing hopes that his Carter Center will become a more forceful advocate against armed conflicts in the future, including 'wars by the United States'.\n\n'I just want to keep the whole world at peace,' Carter had said as he presented his annual Carter Center report last month.\n\n'We have been at war more than 226 years. We have been at peace for about 16 years' since the Declaration of Independence in 1776, he said, adding that every U.S. military conflict from the Korean War onward has been a war of 'choice'.\n\nCarter has also been accepting visits from several 2020 presidential candidates of late, but he has held back on endorsing any of his fellow Democrats, offering few clues about his thoughts of the campaign.", "description": "A spokesperson for the Carter Center said the former president was treated at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center (inset) in Americus, Georgia.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20150240-0-image-a-52_1571946346750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
