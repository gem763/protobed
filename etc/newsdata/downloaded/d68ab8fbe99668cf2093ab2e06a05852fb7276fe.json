He said Canadians didn't want the campaign debate to focus on women's reproductive rights and old political battles about LGBTQ rights, yet those issues featured prominently throughout the campaign.\n\n\"That was thrust on the agenda and [it] hung around Andrew Scheer's neck like a stinking albatross, quite frankly. And he wasn't able to deftly deal with those issues when the opportunities arose,\" he said.\n\nMultiple sources tell CBC News that, behind the scenes, people around MacKay have formed a team that is building infrastructure \u2014 including organization and fundraising \u2014 for a possible leadership bid if Scheer quits or is pushed out.\n\nScheer meets with caucus Wednesday\n\nScheer is working to keep a grip on his leadership and has been meeting with senior members of his caucus to discuss the path forward heading into Parliament. Next Wednesday, he will meet with the full group of newly elected and re-elected MPs.\n\nMost MPs are taking a united front publicly.\n\nRe-elected Alberta MP John Barlow said he doesn't agree with MacKay's remarks and believes the Conservatives made great strides in the election\n\n\"Peter MacKay is able to have his own opinion, but he wasn't a candidate. He wasn't campaigning. I think we did everything we possibly could,\" he said.\n\n\"Absolutely, we have to learn from the results from this election, we have to own the results and there will be a strong post-mortem over what occurred, but let's not lose focus on the results. We have a million more votes than we had before. We won the popular vote. We reduced a very strong majority to a minority government.\"\n\nOffside with Canadians?\n\nMany party supporters (who want to remain anonymous) say that if Scheer is the leader in the next election, he'll hand Justin Trudeau a majority.\n\nSome of them feel Scheer is offside with most Canadians with his views on same-sex marriage and abortion, and that his campaign offering on climate change was not robust enough.\n\nSources say that MacKay will only consider running if Scheer is no longer in the picture. He, like many other potential candidates, is not interested in an unseemly fight that would see Scheer shoved out of the job.\n\nMacKay ran to lead the Progressive Conservatives in 2003 and won.\n\nIn December of that same year, he merged the PC party with Stephen Harper's Canadian Alliance. The new party was named the Conservative Party of Canada, and Harper eventually became its leader.\n\nAlready, a petition and a Twitter account calling on Scheer to quit are making the rounds. A former staffer in Harper's office, Sara MacIntyre, blasted Scheer over the weekend on social media.\n\nMy thoughts.. I am pissed off that the leader of my party WILL NOT walk in a pride parade. I am sick of this, disgusted and ashamed. I believe and support in LBGTQ rights, gay marriage and being equal. I no longer support the CPC while a leader like that is at the helm.
