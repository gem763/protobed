Breadth remains strong with the FANG names doing much of the heavy lifting. The biggest positive right now is our old pal FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). While many stocks are becoming a bit extended and there is the potential for increased volatility on the Fed decision on Wednesday, there are many underinvested investors struggling to put some capital to work.\n\nThe action of the past week has been particularly painful for anticipatory bears that have paid a very high opportunity cost while they sat with cash or shorts. They may have had good bearish arguments but the price action ran over them.\n\nI've been doing some selling to lock in gains but have no interest in trying to short the indices at this point. However, there are some shorts of interest in certain sectors that are suffering from rotation. One such sector is restaurants.\n\nEvery Monday I pick a 'Stock of the Week'. This week my pick is a short sale of Wingstop (WING) . Wingstop owns and franchises over 1200 restaurants that offer chicken wings in 43 states and 10 countries.\n\nAfter negative responses to earnings from both McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle Mexican (CMG) , market players are likely inclined to react negatively to WING unless there is an exceptionally strong report. MCD and CMG sold off mainly due to concerns about slowing growth and aggressive valuations. Those arguments seem even stronger in the case of WING.\n\nWhile WING had revenue growth of 31% last quarter, EPS dropped from $0.23 to $0.17, and the company expects to see EPS drop 13% year-over-year. EPS is supposed to pick up next year, but the stock sells with a trailing PE of 115 and at 6.4x sales. In the current market environment, that aggressive valuation puts the stock at risk especially in an out of favor sector.\n\nIn addition to the valuation issue, the chart has been deteriorating. WING sold off sharply in late August and into September on growth concerns but found support around $85. It has been churning since then and broke down last week on the MCD earnings. There is a gap down to around $81.50 that has the potential to be filled on a negative catalyst.\n\nEarnings are due on Wednesday, Oct 30, after the market close. I am generally not inclined to hold into an earnings report but will be anticipating weakness in front of the news and will look to play that before waiting for the earnings for another setup.", "description": "After negative responses to earnings from McDonald's and Chipotle, market players are likely inclined to react negatively to WING unless there is an exceptionally strong earnings report.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Here'S Why Wingstop Is My 'Stock Of The Week'", "After Negative Responses To Earnings Mcdonald'S", "Chipotle", "Market Players Are Likely Inclined To React Negatively To Wing Unless There Is An Exceptionally Strong Earnings Report.", "Eric Jhonsa", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/wingstop-exterior.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
