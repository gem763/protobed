PRECIOUS-Gold gains on rate cut bets; platinum hits over 3-wk high\n\n* Platinum hits highest since Sept. 30\n\n* Silver, platinum and palladium up 1%\n\n* GRAPHIC-Plat/palladium ratio: http://tmsnrt.rs/1QjSZAC\n\n\n\n(Adds comment, details, updates prices)\n\nBy Brijesh Patel\n\nOct 24 (Reuters) - Gold scaled a near two-week peak on\n\nThursday after weak economic data from the United States\n\nincreased expectations for another rate cut by the Federal\n\nReserve, while platinum jumped to its highest level in more than\n\nthree weeks.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.6% to $1,501.28 per ounce as of\n\n10:38 a.m. EDT (1438 GMT). U.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.5%\n\nto $1,504.30.\n\n\"The bump we got now is because of the miss on durable goods\n\nnumbers in the U.S.,\" said Bob Haberkorn, senior market\n\nstrategist at RJO Futures said.\n\n\"We had a couple of misses in the last few weeks on these\n\nnumbers, be it retail sales or durable goods, and some of the\n\nPMI numbers. Overall, it lends support to another rate cut from\n\nthe Fed before year-end.\"\n\nNew orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell more than\n\nexpected in September and shipments also declined, the data\n\nshowed. Also adding to the concerns over the health of the global\n\neconomy, Euro zone business activity stagnated in October as\n\ndemand withered, according to a downbeat survey published on\n\nThursday. Central banks globally are facing increasing pressure to\n\ndole out monetary support for flagging economies as the\n\nU.S.-China trade dispute continue to take toll on trade and\n\nbusiness sentiment.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year and investors\n\ncurrently see another reduction in borrowing costs when\n\npolicymakers meet next week.\n\nLower U.S. interest rates put pressure on the dollar and\n\nbond yields, increasing the appeal of non-yielding bullion.\n\n\"One thing that will help propel gold higher is yields. I\n\nreckon the downward trend for yields will resume because\n\nfundamentally, nothing has changed,\" said Fawad Razaqzada,\n\nmarket analyst with Forex.com.\n\n\"We are still seeing central banks conveying a dovish\n\nmessage across the board and that should keep yields under\n\npressure long-term,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, the European Central Bank left key\n\ninterest rates unchanged. Among other precious metals, platinum XPT= gained about 1%\n\nto $923.68 per ounce, after climbing to its highest since Sept.\n\n30.\n\n\"Platinum is also expected to benefit from positive\n\nspillovers from gold. However, its sizeable and rising\n\nabove-ground stocks will remain a key headwind over the rest of\n\n2019 and in 2020,\" Metals Focus said in a weekly note.\n\nPalladium XPD= , which hit a record high of $1,783.21 last\n\nweek, climbed 1.2% to $1,762.56 an ounce. Silver jumped\n\n1.3% to $17.79.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold gains on rate cut bets; platinum hits over 3-wk high", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC180R0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
