(Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nThe longtime public relations agency for the National Rifle Association claimed in a new court filing this week that NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre \u201cbristled\u201d at the group\u2019s early endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016, thought the real estate developer would lose the election and referred to his administration as the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d\n\nThe assertions are the latest claims in a brutal legal brawl between the NRA and Ackerman McQueen, its now-estranged PR firm, and emerge at a delicate moment for both the gun rights lobby and the White House.\n\nLaPierre\u2019s direct line to Trump is major currency for the NRA at a time when it is trying to quash calls for stricter gun control and contend with allegations of misspending by top leaders. In turn, the NRA\u2019s ongoing support for Trump is a valuable asset for the president heading into a reelection campaign and could help assuage supporters concerned about tentative White House interest in stronger background checks on gun buyers.\n\nIn a statement, William Brewer III, an outside attorney for the NRA, said Ackerman McQueen\u2019s court filing was \u201cfraught with false and misleading information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the ultimate act of desperation, Ackerman attempts to discredit Mr. LaPierre\u2019s support of President Trump,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cMr. LaPierre\u2019s support of the president is well-known \u2014 as an advocate, fundraiser and partner in the fight to protect our constitutional freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe allegations of LaPierre\u2019s skeptical views toward Trump are the most recent salvo by the Oklahoma City-based PR agency Ackerman McQueen, which the NRA recently accused of continuing to tout its work for the gun group, despite the severing of their decades-long relationship.\n\n[How a hard-charging lawyer helped fuel a civil war inside the NRA]\n\nThe firm has denied any wrongdoing and, in a counterclaim filed Tuesday in Texas, lobbed a series of accusations against LaPierre.\n\nAmong the most provocative: that he balked when the NRA threw its support behind Trump in May 2016, months earlier than the group had weighed in on behalf of presidential contenders in the past.\n\nWhen the NRA endorsed Trump at its convention in Louisville that month, LaPierre posed for pictures with Trump and warned the crowd of the dangers of a potential Hillary Clinton presidency. \u201cYou can kiss your guns goodbye,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s political arm went on to spend a record $30 million in support of Trump\u2019s candidacy despite his previous support for some gun-control measures.\n\nBut Ackerman claims that LaPierre was not happy about the move.\n\n\u201cLaPierre bristled at the thought of openly supporting Trump so early,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s court filing. \u201cHe continued his cynicism regarding Trump during the entire presidential election, noting on multiple occasions that he didn\u2019t believe Trump could win.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was elected, LaPierre routinely referred to the Trump presidency as the \u201cTrump slump,\u201d the firm claims.\n\nThe White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump and the NRA chief have met as recently as last week and have spoken several times since the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, renewed calls for federal restrictions on guns.\n\nTrump has told aides that while he believes the NRA has lost some of its influence, he remains impressed by its large membership and personally likes LaPierre, whom he calls a \u201csurvivor,\u201d according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.\n\nIn the latest court filing, Ackerman McQueen described the NRA chief executive, who was reelected in April, as someone who \u201cbeset by paranoia or a passion for secrecy or both, adopted a dictatorial, micro management style. He demonstrated an obsession with privacy, distancing himself from the public eye and exhibiting terror at the thought of public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nAmong the issues LaPierre has not dealt with transparently, according to the ad agency, were ties between NRA officials and Russia. An Ackerman McQueen contractor asked to investigate the matter was \u201cstonewalled,\u201d the firm claims, adding that \u201cNRA officials even implied that they were more concerned with hiding the facts of the investigation instead of bringing the entire story to light in order to fix any issues that existed.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats last week said the NRA may have violated tax laws when top officials traveled to Moscow in 2015. A long-running inquiry led by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) found that senior NRA officials pursued personal business interests on the trip and then helped a senior Russian government official and a Russian gun rights activist meet GOP presidential candidates and other political figures during the 2016 campaign.\n\n[NRA may have violated tax laws with 2015 trip to Russia, according to report by Senate Democrats]\n\nThe NRA rejected the findings and said the report \u201cpromotes a politically motivated and contrived narrative.\u201d The organization has said the trip was not officially approved by the tax-exempt organization and that LaPierre was opposed to it. But Wyden pointed to NRA documents that suggest it was an official NRA trip.\n\nAckerman McQueen also claimed this week that LaPierre turned against the firm because it refused to go along with his \u201cfinancial adventurism and organizational mismanagement.\u201d\n\nThe filings list NRA expenses that drew condemnation by members when they were revealed this year, including spending on LaPierre\u2019s personal wardrobe, costly bills for meals and transportation, extensive legal fees and the \u201cattempted purchase of a Texas mansion.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported in August that LaPierre wanted the NRA to buy him a multimillion-dollar estate in the Dallas area last year; the NRA has said the purchase was Ackerman McQueen\u2019s idea.\n\nIn his statement Wednesday, Brewer said that Ackerman \u201crefuses to account for the claims and allegations against the agency \u2014 and instead opts to smear the NRA and its most senior officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe agency clings to a desperate strategy, doubling down on its reputational attack against the senior leaders of its former client who determined to hold the agency accountable for its intentional wrongdoing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe NRA is eager to bring all the facts to light.\u201d\n\nCarol D.
