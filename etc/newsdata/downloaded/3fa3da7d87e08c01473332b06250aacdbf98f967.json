We do recover. We do overcome. We do rebuild. But we never forget. We still have scars. They fade. The sun begins to shine and close out the shadows. Trust returns,\" the 45-year-old star wrote on Instagram.\n\nJENNA JAMESON: 'I MUST PROTECT MY LOVE FOR GOD'\n\nJameson, who once quit Twitter over anti-Semitic comments and attacks on her sobriety, said she believes there is more to be done to raise awareness of people struggling with addictions.\n\n\"I wish the stigmas around addiction would stop,\" she wrote. \"I wish people would stop saying things like 'Are you high?'\"\n\nShe continued, \"I wish someday people in active addiction and new recovery weren\u2019t shamed. So many people are suffering\u2026 not only the addicts, but their friends and family.\"\n\nJENNA JAMESON CONVERTS TO JUDAISM\n\nIn January, Jameson, who has since returned to Twitter, explained why she took a break from the social media site.\n\n\"I want to clarify why I\u2019m leaving,\" she tweeted at the time. \"My sobriety and faith are the most important things to me. I am being attacked for my faith. Being Jewish.
