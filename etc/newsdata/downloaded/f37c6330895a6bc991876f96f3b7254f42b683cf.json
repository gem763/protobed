But he said any withdrawal would happen as part of a peace agreement with the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. has about 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan as part of the American-led coalition. U.S. forces are training and advising Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism operations against extremists. President Donald Trump had ordered a troop withdrawal in conjunction with the peace talks that would have left about 8,600 American forces in the country.\n\nU.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad had a preliminary peace deal with the Taliban, but a surge in Taliban violence and the death of an American soldier last month prompted Trump to cancel a secret Camp David meeting where the peace deal would have been finalized. He declared the tentative agreement dead.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to still get a peace agreement at some point, that\u2019s the best way forward,\u201d said Esper, who was making his first trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary. He visited Afghanistan in his previous job as U.S. Army secretary.\n\nHe would not say how long he believes it may be before a new peace accord could be achieved.\n\nA month after the peace agreement collapsed, Zalmay met with Taliban in early October in Islamabad, Pakistan, but it was not clear what progress, if any, was being made.\n\nEsper\u2019s arrival in Kabul came as Afghan government leaders delayed the planned announcement of preliminary results of last month\u2019s presidential election. Esper said he plans to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\nBoth Ghani and his current partner in the unity government, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, have said they believe they had enough votes to win. The Sept. 28 vote was marred by widespread misconduct and accusations of fraud.\n\nOfficials said the announcement of preliminary results has been delayed due to problems with the transparency of the process, delays in transferring ballot papers and delays in transferring data from a biometric system into the main server.\n\nEsper planned to meet with his top commanders in Afghanistan as the U.S. works to determine the way ahead in the 18-year war.\n\nTrump, since his 2016 presidential campaign, has spoken of a need to withdraw U.S. troops from the \u201cendless war\u201d in Afghanistan. He has complained that the U.S. has been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and says that\u2019s not the American military\u2019s job.", "description": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived Sunday in Afghanistan, where stalled peace talks with the Taliban and persistent", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/67143f_trump-53087-president-donald-trump-shakes-hands-defense-secretary-mark-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
