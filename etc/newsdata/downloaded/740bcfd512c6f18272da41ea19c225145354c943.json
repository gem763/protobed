Their work on Artificial Intelligence has the potential to touch every corner of life, including every area of energy, from improving energy efficiency to bolstering grid security.\n\nTheir work will build on America\u2019s astounding energy success story. Thanks to innovation, we are producing a wider range of fuels more abundantly and affordably while using them more cleanly and efficiently than ever.\n\nAnd today, the Trump Administration is deploying every one of our energy sources as part of a balanced energy strategy, bringing us to the dawn of what I call the New American Energy Era.\n\nAmerica is now the world\u2019s second biggest generator of wind and solar power \u2014 and its number one oil and natural gas producer.\n\nWe export our liquefied natural gas (LNG) to 36 countries spanning five continents. We also expect to become a net energy exporter next year and for decades to come.\n\nThanks to innovation, we have more than enough energy to share with the world, and with it comes freedom of choice for energy consumers everywhere, including places where it has never previously existed.\n\nFor those countries, choice means this: If they were bound to just one nation for their energy needs, they are bound no more. If they were restricted to just one energy source for those needs, they are restricted no more. If they were compelled to depend on just one energy route for those needs, they are compelled no more.\n\nThe implications are monumental.\n\nBy exporting our energy bounty, particularly our natural gas, we are freeing friends and allies, especially in Europe, from decades of dependence on unfriendly nations that have long wielded their energy supply as a political weapon.\n\nAnd we are poised to share not just our abundant energy but the same innovative technology that unleashed it in the first place. We are ready to provide other countries the means to create their own energy revolutions. That includes some of the world\u2019s poorest nations where hundreds of millions of people live without any electricity.\n\nWe can best help these nations break out of energy poverty by doing for them what we are doing for ourselves. The United States can offer them the fuels and technologies we have and allow them to decide which combination works best to provide the necessary power to drive their development. We reject the notion of a tradeoff between robust economic and energy development and environmental progress. We believe that, even for fuels that produce emissions, the answer is not to drive out the fuels by regulation but to drive down the emissions through innovation.\n\nAnd by any measure, our approach is succeeding.\n\nIn the same way we made unprecedented progress in energy production, we are making our energy cleaner.\n\nWe are doing it through innovation, much of it in our National Laboratories.\n\nIn recent decades, our labs have developed technologies to achieve spectacular reductions in emissions from coal-fired generation. And through the technology of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), we are on a path to further reductions.\n\nAnd the irony is that through innovation, the U.S. \u2014 the world\u2019s leading oil and gas producer \u2014 also leads every signatory to the Paris climate accord, as well as every other nation, in reducing energy-related carbon emissions.\n\nIn this New American Energy Era we have entered, spurred by innovation and armed with every fuel at our disposal, we will pursue and achieve our shared goal of advancing prosperity and security while protecting the environment for this generation and generations to come.\n\nRick Perry is the U.S. Secretary of Energy.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
