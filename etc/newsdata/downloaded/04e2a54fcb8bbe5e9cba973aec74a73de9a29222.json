Damage can include:\n\nIndecipherable details\n\nThe laminate has lifted enough to allow the possibility of photo substitution\n\nDiscolouration to the bio-data page\n\nChemical or ink spillage on any page\n\nMissing or detached pages\n\nThe chip or antenna shows through the end paper on the back cover for the new style e-passports\n\nThe chip has been identified as damaged after investigation\n\nWhat about wear and tear?\n\nNormal wear and tear is expected and shouldn\u2019t count as damage \u2013 but what is deemed \u201cnormal\u201d?\n\nHM Passport Office says: \u201cWhen deciding whether a passport falls under wear and tear, examiners should look at the travel history of the document \u2013 multiple visas and stamps would indicate heavy use. Wear and tear is therefore more likely.\n\n\u201cPassports classed as wear and tear can be accepted as evidence of nationality and identity.\u201d\n\nWhat are airlines\u2019 rules?\n\nAirlines typically say: \u201cWe may decide to refuse to carry you or your baggage if the following has happened or we reasonably believe may happen ... you have not, or do not appear to have, valid travel documents.\u201d\n\nThey may be more likely to err on the side of caution as they can incur fines for allowing a passenger to fly with inadequate documentation; these average $3,500 (\u00a32,780) per passenger.\n\nIf denied boarding, you would have to take the airline to court to attempt to get compensation and, as this is an area where definitions of a damaged passport vary greatly, it wouldn\u2019t be straightforward.\n\nWhat about getting an emergency passport renewal?\n\nIf you suspect your damaged passport could stop you from flying, the best thing to do is replace it \u2013 but bear in mind, if sufficiently damaged you won\u2019t be eligible for the premium fast track service. This costs more and enables those who need a new passport urgently to book an emergency appointment within a few days, during which they\u2019ll get their renewed travel document. However, damaged passports require more checks and therefore the process takes the usual three weeks.", "description": "The news that a 22-year-old man missed out on a family holiday to the Caribbean because his passport had a small rip in it has highlighted the issue of damaged passports.", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/03/16/passports-stamps.jpg"}
