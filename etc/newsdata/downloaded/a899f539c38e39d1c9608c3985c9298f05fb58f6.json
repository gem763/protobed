So policy measures will be carried out with a focused and orderly way,\" he said, referring to China's overall debt level.\n\nThe government is targeting growth of 6-6.5% this year.\n\nThe outlook is unlikely to change for the better any time soon even as tensions in the protracted trade war between Beijing and Washington have eased somewhat. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff hike, but officials said much work still needed to be done.\n\nA slide in China's exports accelerated in September while imports contracted for a fifth straight month.\n\nThe drags on demand, both domestic and global, have hit several key parts of the economy with weakness seen in freight shipments, factory power generation, employment and entertainment spending. In September, auto sales posted their 15th straight month of decline while factory gate prices fell at their fastest pace in three years.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has warned the U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, but said output would rebound if their dueling tariffs were removed.\n\nHowever, while a shock dip in GDP growth below 6% in the third quarter would hit sentiment, it might not necessarily add to the case for urgent stimulus given employment remains steady, policy insiders said.\n\nSLOW TO RESPOND\n\nBeijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the current slowdown, including trillions of yuan in tax cuts and local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects and efforts to spur bank lending.\n\nBut the economy has been slow to respond with business confidence shaky and local governments facing increasing strains as tax cuts hit revenues, weighing on investment.\n\nThe government publishes third-quarter GDP data on Friday (0200 GMT) along with other indicators for September.\n\nIndustrial output is expected to rise 5.0% in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 17-1/2 year low of 4.4% in August. Growth of retail sales could pick up to 7.8% from 7.5%.\n\nFixed-asset investment growth is expected to slow to 5.4% in the first nine months from 5.5% in the first eight months.\n\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) would ease policy further by cutting banks' reserve retirement ratios (RRR) and the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a new benchmark lending rate.
