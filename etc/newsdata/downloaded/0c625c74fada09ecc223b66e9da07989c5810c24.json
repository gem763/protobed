I\u2019ve said it before; I\u2019ll say it again: I don\u2019t write this stuff, I just type it out.\n\nIt\u2019s Wednesday morning. It\u2019s day two of the biggest court case anybody can remember. You, the prime minister, stand accused of lying to the Queen in order to shut down parliament, and you\u2019re in an especially deep hole because, thus far, you\u2019ve refused to provide any kind of witness statement to deny it.\n\nYou\u2019ve got your top lawyer on it. He\u2019s standing up in the Supreme Court, patiently explaining not just to 11 Supreme Court judges but to the entire world (seriously, they\u2019re livestreaming this stuff in Beirut airport), that you definitely haven\u2019t lied to the Queen. And even if you had, that\u2019s her problem not yours.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd there you are, in a hospital in east London, being filmed by the TV news cameras you have invited there, as you are berated by the dad of a sick child, for, in his words, \u201cdestroying the NHS.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t care, you\u2019re only here for a press opportunity,\u201d the dad tells him.\n\nAnd you, the prime minister, the one who\u2019s halfway through a huge court case about whether or not you lied to the Queen, open your gob and the following words come out.\n\n\u201cThere are no press here.\u201d\n\nThe words are almost inaudible at first, scarcely picked up by the TV camera filming you, beneath the noise of the cameras from the press photographers. The angry dad wafts an open palm at the press, whom you have just said are not there, and says \u201cWhat are they then?\u201d\n\nThis is, again, filmed and photographed \u2013 by the press you have invited there, and whose existence you are denying while standing three yards away from them.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nAlas, by the time legal cases reach the Supreme Court, no fresh evidence is admissible. It is too late, for example, for the prime minister to submit a witness statement about whether or not he lied to the Queen. And it is also too late for the Supreme Court to consider that, while they sit there weighing up whether or not the prime minister has lied to the Queen, the prime minister is standing in front of the press, saying it isn\u2019t there.\n\nStill, it is, as ever, happy days for the lawyers. It is surely a matter of time before the Supreme Court is asked to consider whether the prime minister lied to an angry dad in Whipps Cross hospital, Leytonstone. What might the in house lawyer come up with for that one?\n\nOne supposes it could be said that, in a way, \u201cthe press\u201d were not there. The visit was kept a secret from the local MP, the local paper, and indeed anyone who might press upon the prime minister anything more challenging than standing there holding a camera while your very existence is denied.\n\nHad the local paper, the Waltham Forest Echo, been made aware of the visit, they had a question they would have liked to ask the prime minister. And it\u2019s this: why is it that Whipps Cross hospital, which is 116 years old and described recently as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, is not one of the 20 hospitals that the prime minister has found some new money for.\n\nJust as well \u201cthe press\u201d weren\u2019t there then.\n\nExcept they were. And so, alas, were the general public, who from Wakefield to Waltham Forest, from Leeds to Luxembourg, loathe him in equal measure absolutely everywhere he goes.", "description": "And so we turn to today\u2019s auto-satirical Boris Johnson wire service.
