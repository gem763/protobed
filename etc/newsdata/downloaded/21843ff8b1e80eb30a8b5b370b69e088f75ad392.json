USA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert! This story contains details from \"The Masked Singer\" Season 2, Episode 4, including the identity of the eliminated celebrity.\n\nAnother \"Masked Singer\" bites the dust.\n\nBut, \"don't be sad,\" host Nick Cannon said. \"When we say goodbye to a character, we say hello to a star.\"\n\nSix masked celebrities \u2013 Butterfly, Flamingo, Leopard, Black Widow, Skeleton and Thingamajig \u2013 returned to the stage Wednesday for their second performance of the season on the Fox show, offering judges and viewers another round of hints on their identities.\n\nBut a scary incident with Butterfly almost overshadowed the show after she experienced \"a literal shock.\"\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nLast week on 'The Masked Singer': Jenny McCarthy was 'so close' to correctly guessing Eagle\n\nFlamingo in \"The Masked Singer\" on Fox. (Photo: Michael Becker / FOX)\n\nFlamingo\n\nThe pink bird shook up the competition with a choreography-filled performance of Kenny Loggins\u2019 \"Footloose.\" Jenny McCarthy was blown away by the singer's vocals. \"I was smiling so big I thought you broke my botox.\"\n\nBut McCarthy said Flamingo's vocals may have given away her identity. \"This week we got to hear a little bit more of your real tone. To me, immediately you screamed Adrienne Bailon.\" Robin Thicke stuck with his girl-group hunch, guessing Xscape's Kandi Burruss. Scherzinger thinks it may be Fifth Harmony's Ally Brooke.\n\nHer clue? Flamingo came from \"humble beginnings\" and went from \"hood-rat to Hollywood triple threat.\"\n\nLeopard\n\nNext up was Leopard with a rendition of Shawn Mendes\u2019 \"Stitches.\" Thicke said he \"exudes glamour.\" McCarthy said the singer has \"drag queen style\" like RuPaul. Scherzinger piggybacked on her guess, adding that Leopard gave her \"Billy Porter vibes with your mannerisms.\" Ken Jeong guessed Neil Patrick Harris before being shut down by his fellow judges. \"No way! Neil is not that tall,\" McCarthy said.\n\nHis clue? \"No matter what the world labels you, it\u2019s never too late to flip the script.\"\n\nBlack Widow\n\nThe singer went country with Carrie Underwood\u2019s \"Before He Cheats\" to get the judges \"even more tangled up in my web.\" McCarthy got chills from her impressive vocals: \"You did a phenomenal job, even with an injury.\" (The singer, who had her left arm in a sling, joked that \"spiders shouldn\u2019t ride hoverboards.\u201d) Thicke picked Raven-Symon\u00e9 because of a child actor clue. Scherzinger agreed, picking Disney alum Christina Aguilera.\n\nAnother clue? \"Ever since I was an itsy bitty spider, I had to embody a squeaky clean image.\"\n\nSkeleton\n\nThe boney contestant rocked out to Jet\u2019s \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl.\" Halfway through his performance, McCarthy confidently yelled out, \"I know the voice!\" She guessed Paul Shaffer because he played \"second fiddle\" during his career.\n\nScherzinger got \"Vegas Vibes\" from his rendition and picked magician Teller. Ken Jeong thought it was Martin Short following a \"Three Amigos\" clue. Thicke surprisingly agreed with Jeong: \"I\u2019m with Ken for the first time in my life.\u201d\n\nSkeleton's clue? \"I was once inducted into the National Black Sports and Entertainment Hall of Fame.\" Scherzinger asked, \"Do you have to be black to (be inducted)? I don\u2019t know!\"\n\nThere's no lazy bones in this #SkeletonMask! \ud83d\udc80 Check out their rockin' performance! #TheMaskedSingerpic.twitter.com/SxPHZG9aM5 \u2014 The Masked Singer (@MaskedSingerFOX) October 17, 2019\n\nThingamajig\n\nThe furry creature showed off his soft side with Kacey Musgraves\u2019 \"Rainbow.\" His performance moved Scherzinger to tears. \"I don't know who you are, but you have a real gift,\" she said. The judges were seriously confused. \"All of the clues say that you\u2019re an athlete, but your voice is saying you\u2019re a singer,\" McCarthy said before guessing Dennis Rodman. Thicke picked Dwight Howard, while Jeong thinks it\u2019s singer Montell Jordan.\n\nHis hint? \"My darkest moment was when I went to rehab.\" McCarthy quipped, \"If that\u2019s Dennis Rodman, I will shave my head during the show.\"\n\nButterfly\n\nLast up was Butterfly, who brought down the house with Bon Jovi\u2019s \"Livin\u2019 on a Prayer.\" Finishing her performance was a feat of its own after the masked singer got quite the shock during dress rehearsals. Butterfly explained that when the carbon dioxide stage effects went off during her song, \"something short-circuited and I got electrocuted through the platform I was standing on.\"\n\n\"It was scary,\" Butterfly said, referencing her song: \"I don\u2019t want to be dead on a prayer, I want to be livin.'\"\n\n\"We are happy that you are alive,\" Cannon added.\n\nButterfly in \"The Masked Singer\" on Fox. (Photo: Michael Becker / FOX)\n\nMcCarthy guessed Butterfly is Fantasia because of previous clues on church and isolation. Jeong thinks she\u2019s a girl-group member. He guessed Spice Girls alum Mel B. Nicole went out on a limb and picked Twiggy because of a London background in the clue package. Thicke disagreed and picked Leona Lewis.\n\nHer clue? \"At the height of my career, I had everyone saying my name. But when I tried to spread my wings, I lost flight.\"\n\nThe Reveal\n\nIn the end, it was Skeleton who was sent packing after receiving the fewest audience votes and ordered to unmask. The judges final guesses? McCarthy picked Shaffer, Scherzinger selected Teller, Jeong thought Martin Short and Thicke also picked Shaffer.\n\nWhen the mask comes off it's \u2026 drum roll please \u2026 Shaffer, the longtime musical director and band leader for David Letterman.\n\n\ud83d\udea8SPOILER ALERT\ud83d\udea8 Only click this video if you're ready to find out who #SkeletonMask \ud83d\udc80 really is! #TheMaskedSingerpic.twitter.com/d14F4QSxu2 \u2014 The Masked Singer (@MaskedSingerFOX) October 17, 2019\n\n\"This is nuttier\" than working with Letterman, Shaffer said. \"It gave me a chance to try songs that I never would've thought I could pull off in real life. (The judges) had my number from the very beginning. \u2026 I don\u2019t even know why I bothered.\"\n\nShaffer joins unmasked singers Dr. Drew Pinsky (Eagle), boxing champion Laila Ali (Panda), Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir (Egg) and gaming YouTuber Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins (Ice Cream). Five celebs down, 11 to go.\n\n'The Masked Singer': Robin Thicke (jokingly) guessed this unmasked star right!\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/16/masked-singer-butterfly-soars-after-truly-shocking-rehearsal/4001678002/", "description": "Six masked celebrities\u00a0returned to the stage for their second performance of the season, offering judges another round of hints on their identities.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
