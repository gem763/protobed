Gonzalez, who finished 3-for-6, had tied the game earlier in the inning with a two-run single.\n\nRyan LaMarre also homered on a night when the Twins became the first team in baseball history to have five players hit 30 home runs in a season. Sano joined Nelson Cruz (37), Max Kepler (36), Eddie Rosario (31) and Mitch Garver (30) in the 30-homer club with a 482-foot drive into the third deck in left-center.\n\nTim Anderson homered and had four hits, Eloy Jimenez had three hits, and Ryan Cordell, Zack Collins and Adam Engel also homered for Chicago, which lost its fourth straight game, three of them in walk-off fashion.\n\nGiants 7, Red Sox 6 (15 innings)\n\nPinch hitter Alex Dickerson lofted a sacrifice fly in the top of the 15th inning to send San Francisco past host Boston.\n\nDickerson\u2019s fly ball decided a game that featured a major-league-record-tying 24 pitchers used between the two clubs.

Rosario and Alonso had two hits and two RBIs apiece.\n\nA\u2019s 2, Royals 1\n\nMatt Olson ignited a two-run seventh inning with a home run, and Seth Brown broke a tie with an RBI double two batters later as host Oakland rallied past Kansas City.\n\nBrown finished with a single and a double for the A\u2019s, who have won seven of eight and lead the race for the first American League wild card by two games over the Rays.\n\nRookie A.J.
