Guardiola admitted they will have their work cut out trying to haul back Liverpool.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot of points,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t drop points for many circumstances. Today was the day we created less than the other games, even [in the 3-2 defeat against] Norwich we created a lot.\n\n\u201cWe have faced many teams who defend deep and more or less we found a way to win but today we had a problem. It is better not to think that one team is eight points ahead.", "description": "Pep Guardiola claimed nerves got the better of Manchester City and admitted the champions have given themselves a mountain to climb in the title race after their worst start to a season for six years.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212213375_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
