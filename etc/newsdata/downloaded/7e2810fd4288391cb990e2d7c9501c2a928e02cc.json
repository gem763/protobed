It called on the US administration to take measures to avoid steps that will further damage bilateral ties.\n\nTurkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies that the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide.\n\nFor decades, measures recognizing the Armenian genocide have stalled in Congress, stymied by concerns that it could complicate relations with NATO ally Turkey.\n\nUS lawmakers have been fuming about Turkey, however, in recent months, because of its purchase of a Russian missile defence system in defiance of US sanctions and, more recently, its incursion into northern Syria to fight Kurdish forces after Trump abruptly announced he was withdrawing US troops from the area.\n\nTurkey views the Kurds in northern Syria as a security threat. Many members of Congress were furious about the assault against Kurdish troops, who until recently were fighting alongside US forces against Islamic State militants.", "description": "US House recognises Armenian genocide, backs Turkey sanctions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/88/58/1000x563_cmsv2_51a651e9-727b-54e3-853a-37b71b08f9c0-4268858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
