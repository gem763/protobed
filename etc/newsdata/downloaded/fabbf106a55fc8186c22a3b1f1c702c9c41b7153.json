A rumoured rift between royal siblings Prince William and Prince Harry were hinted at by The Duke of Sussex in a clip of an upcoming documentary titled: Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.\n\nIn the clip, Harry tells ITV's Tom Bradby: \"Inevitably stuff happens. But we're brothers, we'll always be brothers\u2026We're certainly on different paths at the moment, I'll always be there for him, and as I know, he'll always be there for me. We don't see each other as much as we used to because we're so busy, but I love him dearly\u2026The majority of stuff is created out of nothing. As brothers, we have good days, and we have bad days.\"\n\nAccording to The Metro following the publication of that snippet, Prince William expressed concern about his brother's \"fragile\" state.\n\nBut now it seems, at least according to royal sources at The Sun, that the Prince of Wales is worried about his youngest son in the same way he used to fear for his ex-wife Princess Diana.\n\nHowever, the 70-year-old will not air his concerns publicly and will continue to defend them publicly.\n\nThe publication's royal source revealed: \"The Prince of Wales is very busy at the moment touring Japan, including a visit with the Welsh rugby team. But the point is that this whole kerfuffle has completely undermined the work he is doing, just as it undermined the work Prince William and Kate were doing in Pakistan.\"\n\nThe royal family are no strangers to conflict and disagreements \u2013 one need only look at the most recent trailer for The Crown \u2013 we really hope the Windsor men find some common ground, soon.\n\nHarry & Meghan: An African Journey and will air on BBC Lifestyle (DStv 174) on Thursday, 24 October at 20:00.\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
