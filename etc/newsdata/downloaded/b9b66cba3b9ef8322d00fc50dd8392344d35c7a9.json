Their presence in the chamber reportedly erupted into yelling matches with committee members.\n\nScott Thuman (@ScottThuman) WATCH: here's the video of when 2 dozen GOP members, led by @mattgaetz entered the secure hearing room (SCIF) to interrupt witness testimony in the #ImpeachmentInquiry as they demand access, despite not being committee members. They're complaining it's a \"Soviet-style process\". pic.twitter.com/8KddYz3r9D\n\n\u201cBREAKING: I led over 30 of my colleagues into the SCIF where Adam Schiff is holding secret impeachment depositions. Still inside \u2013 more details to come,\u201d tweeted Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican congressman and one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, referring to secured areas of the Capitol known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs, and Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee leading the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Republicans who led the protest do not sit on the committees involved in the impeachment inquiry \u2013 Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs \u2013 and are not permitted to attend. Members of those committees already include Republican members of Congress, as well as Democrats, and both parties attend and ask questions at the hearings, whether public or, as in this case, closed to the public and the press.\n\nBut the members who staged protest on Wednesday have sought to attack the inquiry on procedural grounds, objecting to the private nature of the hearings and demanding access to the full breadth of the testimony that has rattled Washington in recent weeks.\n\nMuch of the testimony that has been made public, however, and news reports confirm key elements of a whistleblower complaint that set in motion the impeachment inquiry. The investigation centers on reports of Donald Trump withholding military aid and dangling a meeting at the White House for Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in return for favors that would benefit him in domestic US politics.\n\nPlay Video 5:26 Could Donald Trump actually be impeached? \u2013 video\n\nThe invading Republicans remained in the hearing room into the early afternoon and even ordered pizza and fast food.\n\n\u201cReporting from Adam Schiff\u2019s secret chamber,\u201d Republican congressman Andy Biggs began, in a series of tweets from inside the room. Biggs has accused Democrats of conducting a \u201cSoviet-style\u201d impeachment inquiry and demanded the testimony be made available to all lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWhen Republican members were in the SCIF, Chairman Schiff immediately left with the witness,\u201d he tweeted. Biggs later clarified that he had \u201ctransmitted\u201d to aides for publication, as the use of electronic devices in the secure area violates security protocols.\n\nMore than five hours after the standoff began, committee members were recalled to the room and Cooper\u2019s deposition began.\n\nDemocrats were furious and, suggested the timing \u2013 days after Trump called on Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d the impeachment inquiry amid mounting evidence of misconduct \u2013 was no coincidence.\n\n\u201cThis is a stunt that corresponded very specifically to the president\u2019s complaint that they weren\u2019t fighting hard enough for him, and in direct response to devastating testimony yesterday from Ambassador Taylor,\u201d Democratic congressman David Cicilline, a member of the House foreign affairs committee, said. \u201cRepublicans are playing to an audience of one, and the president\u2019s proud of them, but we\u2019re going to continue to do all the work.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear if Republicans would attempt to disrupt future hearings.\n\n\u201cTheir frustration was boiling over,\u201d said Republican congressman Lee Zeldin, also on the foreign affairs committee, one of the three panels leading the inquiry. \u201cI would imagine things would get worse not better if the process doesn\u2019t improve.\u201d\n\nThe dramatic escalation by Republicans on Capitol Hill came after Bill Taylor, the most senior US diplomat in Kyiv, testified for hours before House investigators on Tuesday, delivering an account that was so shocking to some lawmakers freshman Democrat Andy Levin described it as \u201cmy most disturbing day in Congress so far \u2013 very troubling\u201d.\n\nIn a lengthy opening statement, Taylor said Trump wanted \u201ceverything\u201d, including military aid to Ukraine, tied to a commitment by Ukrainian leaders to investigate Democrats and the 2016 election plus a company linked to the family of Trump\u2019s leading 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden.\n\nTaylor said Trump \u201cwanted President Zelenskiy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations\u201d.\n\nTrump emerged briefly on Wednesday to declare victory in enforcing what he called a \u201cpermanent\u201d ceasefire along the northern Syrian border, after his abrupt withdrawal of US troops effectively opened the door for a Turkish offensive against Kurdish-led forces in that region, leaving scores of civilians and fighters dead and hundreds of thousands of people displaced.\n\nTrump, who has denied wrongdoing in the impeachment inquiry, spent the morning on Twitter downplaying the investigation\u2019s findings, including Taylor\u2019s explosive testimony. He did not address the impeachment issues or take any questions after delivering his statement on Syria.\n\nGiuliani associates plead not guilty to illegal campaign finance charges Read more\n\nLater, leaving the White House for Pittsburgh to speak at a fracking conference, Trump was unusually quiet when heading to the Marine One helicopter on the lawn.\n\nMeanwhile a report emerged noting that as early as 7 May the newly elected Zelenskiy told senior aides he was already worried about pressure from the Trump to investigate his Democratic rivals.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s group of advisers spent most of a three-hour meeting talking about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for such an investigation, and how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting.\n\nAmong the many defenses the White House has offered is that Ukraine had not been aware that Trump was withholding military aid that Congress approved unless it launched two investigations.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Group chanting \u2018Let us in\u2019 enter closed-door meeting where top Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy was to testify", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino", "Joan E Greve", "Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a63dcbe426fa2b205ef0c367293966001077ac1a/0_67_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e45f1719b356324fa50db4434e27e71a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
