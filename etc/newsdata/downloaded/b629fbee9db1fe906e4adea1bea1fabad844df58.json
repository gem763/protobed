He has bullied and projected \u2014 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \u2014 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s moods flared on Twitter. Five days after the impeachment inquiry began \u2014 on Sunday Sept. 29 \u2014 Trump sent forth a torrent four dozen tweets and retweets, making it at the time the third most prolific day of tweeting of his entire presidency. Over nearly 16 hours on Twitter, he suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) be questioned for \u201cFraud & Treason\u201d and quoted an Evangelical pastor who warned that the impeachment of Trump would \u201ccause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen on Friday, Trump passed that previous milestone with 59 total tweets, including 33 in just 20 minutes. All told, in the week before the launch of the inquiry, Trump averaged 18 tweets per day. In the two weeks following the launch, that doubled: On average, Trump was tweeting three dozen times a day.\n\nHis behavior during a news conference with the Finnish president appeared so erratic to some viewers that a hashtag \u2014 #TrumpMeltdown \u2014 began trending on Twitter. Commentary about the president\u2019s mental fitness ensued.\n\nAD\n\nStaring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\u2019s Shakespearean monarch. At a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump boasted about his own fortitude in surviving so many scandals.\n\nRaising his hand and twirling his fingers to point to his right temple, the president mused, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a little different up here. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere is a look at the characteristics Trump has displayed \u2014 and the characters he has inhabited \u2014 since impeachment proceedings began.\n\nMartyr\n\nTrump strode onstage to rapturous applause at a packed arena in Minneapolis Thursday night ostensibly to campaign for reelection in 2020. But he was obsessed instead with the 2016 election, delivering a jeremiad of persecution and self-pity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom Day One, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president cast himself as the ultimate victim of harassment from congressional Democrats, the intelligence community and the media.\n\n\u201cI can do the greatest things in history, and they\u2019ll make them bad to very bad,\u201d Trump decried. \u201cAnd if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\u2019s like, \u2018Give him the electric chair! That was terrible!\u2019 \u201d\n\nVictimization has long been central to Trump\u2019s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\u2019s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump tells it, he is the victim of a corrupt, \u201cdeep state\u201d whistleblower who, along with other perceived enemies, has orchestrated a broad conspiracy to claim malfeasance in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 which, in the president\u2019s estimation, was \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first so-called second hand information \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty,\u201d Trump tweeted last Saturday, deploying his nickname for Schiff.\n\nDriving Trump\u2019s persecution mentality is his undying frustration that his electoral victory in 2016 is undermined by the fact that Russia interfered to boost his candidacy \u2014 and that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\n\n\u201cI was investigated, okay? Me! Me!\u201d Trump told reporters Oct. 4 at the White House. \u201cIn my campaign \u2014 I ran, I won. I was [investigated]. You won\u2019t say that, will you? I was investigated. I was investigated.\u201d\n\nHeckler\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another episode of \u201cChopper Talk\u201d \u2014 Trump\u2019s freewheeling question-and-answer sessions with reporters before he boards the Marine One helicopter \u2014 only this time the president was especially agitated. He strode back and forth and sliced the air with his hands.\n\nThen, as Kelly O\u2019Donnell of NBC News asked him to clarify what exactly he was trying to say, Trump gave her The Hand \u2014 five fingers splayed across the lens of her iPhone.\n\nThe gesture was perhaps inadvertent, but the resulting snapshot epitomized Trump\u2019s bullying persona, in which he heckles, belittles and bellows with abandon.\n\nAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \u201cShifty Schiff,\u201d Pelosi is \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\u2019s conduct, is \u201cPompous Senator.\u201d\n\nDuring the Oct. 2 news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Trump acted like a schoolyard bulldozer when Jeff Mason of Reuters pressed him repeatedly on a question he did want to answer: What, specifically, Trump sought from Zelensky during a controversial phone call in which he asked him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Trump offered a lengthy digression that failed to answer the question, Mason followed up twice. The second time, Trump was curt.\n\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he asked.\n\nWhen Mason answered affirmatively, Trump began to badger him, using his perch behind the presidential lectern to order Mason to pose a question to his foreign counterpart.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me? Did you hear me?\u201d Trump angrily admonished Mason, before again urging him to switch topics. \u201cAsk this gentleman a question. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to berate Mason for being part of the \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ccorrupt media.\u201d\n\nThe president never did answer the original question.\n\nAutocrat\n\nIn Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d he is a leader to be obeyed.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the president offered that self-assessment in response to criticism of his decision to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria and, in doing so, abandon a longtime critical ally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nBut the general sentiment also reflected the often defiant posture Trump has adopted while facing impeachment, a \u201cDear Leader\u201d tone more associated with an authoritarian regime than a democracy.\n\nIn defending his call with Zelensky, Trump used a similarly autocratic construction.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe phrase is one with which the president is comfortable; Trump has asserted he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do something \u2014 including the absolute right to pardon himself \u2014 over a dozen times since taking office.\n\nProjectionist\n\nAD\n\nIf the Twitterati takeaway of Trump\u2019s news conference with Niinist\u00f6 was that the president was having a #TrumpMeltdown, in Twitter parlance, Trump had a different view of the situation: It was Schiff who was imploding.\n\nAt one point during the East Room event, in response to a question about whether the White House would comply with House subpoenas, Trump accused Schiff of having \u201csome kind of a mental breakdown.\u201d\n\nHe repeated the claim several days later at another White House event, this one ostensibly about the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement. Referring to previous Schiff comments, in which the Democratic chairman summarized the controversial conversation between Trump and Zelensky using mock dialogue, Trump said Schiff had delivered \u201ca horrible speech\u201d not based in reality, and concluded: \u201cI think he\u2019s having some kind of a breakdown.\u201d\n\nThe tactic is one long-favored by Trump, in which he takes a charge or accusation leveled against him and wields it like a cudgel back on a perceived foe, even in cases where the counterassault may seem hypocritical or preposterous.\n\nNow facing impeachment over a problematic call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 where he asked Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival as \u201ca favor\u201d \u2014 Trump has rejected the notion that his conversation with Zelensky was anything but \u201cperfect.\u201d Instead, he has accused Biden and his son Hunter of corrupt dealings of their own with Ukraine, despite little evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nFacing the assessment of his own intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect Trump, the president has frequently rejected that verdict \u2014 while offering a contradictory theory of his own, supported by no evidence: That Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections, but with the goal of helping the Democrats.\n\nTrump has even tried to upend impeachment itself, suggesting Pelosi and Schiff should be impeached instead \u2014 never mind that it has been a matter of practice for over two centuries that members of the House and Senate cannot be impeached. He also turned on a member of his own party, Romney, after the Utah senator was critical of him calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\u201d Trump wrote, again suggesting his own potential penance be meted out instead to someone with whom he was feuding.\n\nConspiracist\n\nTrump decried the impeachment effort against him as a \u201ccoup.\u201d He accused the intelligence community whistleblower \u2014 as well as the whistleblower\u2019s sources \u2014 of spying on him and committing \u201ctreason.\u201d He described the impeachment process being run by Pelosi and Schiff as \u201ca totally compromised Kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nTo Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations.\n\n\u201cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP,\u201d Trump tweeted on Oct. 1.\n\nSchiff has been a particular target of Trump\u2019s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \u2014 a crime still punishable by death.\n\n\u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d Trump wrote in one missive.\n\nHe even brought up the charge while sitting next to the Finnish president, saying of Schiff\u2019s behavior: \u201cAnd some people even say it was treason.\u201d\n\nTrump has spread some of his own conspiracy theories, including that he has been investigated by the Australians, British and Italians, among other foreign governments. He has also suggested that contrary to the assessment of his own intelligence community \u2014 which found that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections in an effort to help him \u2014 it was Ukraine that meddled, hoping to help the Democrats.\n\nPerhaps most ominously, Trump has warned of a civil war. On Sept. 29 \u2014 a day of extreme presidential angst as measured by his near-record output of tweets \u2014 Trump shared with his 65.6 million followers a warning from pastor and televangelist Robert Jeffress from Fox News.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they never will be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn moments, Trump seems to understand the peril he faces \u2014 and acknowledges the differing ways he has responded to the impeachment threat engulfing his presidency.\n\n\u201cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable,\u201d he said Monday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. \u201cAnd it\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m the president, because I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know why \u2014 a lot of people said very few people could handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sort of thrive on it,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "He has bullied and projected, portrayed himself as a victim and struck an authoritarian tone as he battles the biggest threat to his presidency so far.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yTgkOQzn-VaZyZ2FvUUYeQI5vmE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7GLVRMXKCUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
