She also took issue with comments Gowdy made last year in which he urged Trump to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into the Trump campaign\u2019s role in Russian attempts to intervene in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cHe screwed up the Benghazi hearings and he came out with the advice to Trump, \u2018Well if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.\u201d\n\nToensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump\u2019s legal team. The pair, who are close with Trump, are regulars on the conservative cable network Fox News. Last month, the channel reported they were \u201cworking off the books\u201d with Giuliani to help get opposition research on former Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently mounting a White House bid.\n\nLast March, it was announced that Toensing and DiGenova were set to formally join the team of lawyers working for the president on the Mueller probe. However, days later, Jay Sekulow, who works as Trump\u2019s personal attorney along with Giuliani, said the pair could not come on board due to conflicts. \u201cThose conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the president in other legal matters,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nAfter issuing her scathing critique of Gowdy, Toensing went on to suggest other lawyers working for the president shared her opinion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not on the team. Trey Gowdy is not on the team. Who told you Trey Gowdy? Not to my knowledge, not to Rudy\u2019s knowledge, not Joe\u2019s knowledge,\u201d said Toensing, who had not heard of the move at the time of her interview with Yahoo News on Wednesday morning. \u201cI have to check that with Rudy because that would be a joke, because we all don\u2019t think much of him,\u201d Toensing said of Gowdy, adding, \u201cAre you kidding? ... Trey is a joke among us.\u201d\n\nHowever, by Wednesday evening, Sekulow officially announced Gowdy\u2019s appointment.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that former Congressman Trey Gowdy is joining our team as Counsel to the President,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cI have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress. His legal skills and his advocacy will serve the President well. Trey\u2019s command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team.\u201d\n\nNeither Gowdy nor Sekulow responded to a request for comment about Toensing\u2019s misgivings.\n\nVictoria Toensing, left, and Joe diGenova listen to testimony of Valerie Plame at a 2007 House Oversight Committee hearing.

Last month, following news of a whistleblower complaint about the call and evidence that Trump withheld a $400 million aid package to Ukraine, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry. That inquiry is being led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and two other committee chairs.\n\nGiuliani, a former New York City mayor who plays a dual role of legal adviser and media surrogate for the president, defended Gowdy when asked about Toensing\u2019s criticisms. Specifically, Giuliani suggested Gowdy\u2019s experience on Capitol Hill would be an asset to Trump.", "description": "The president\u2019s decision to bulk up his legal team with former congressman Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LV0NvcfJR9MDmNmd4IWkkQ--~B/aD0zNTcwO3c9NDk0MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/990bae70-eb88-11e9-9dfc-77ccf3267373", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
