It also forces Democrats to either pry those files loose by fighting an uncooperative Pompeo in court, or to rely on the testimony and documents of others to back up their new star witness.\n\nDemocrats re-upped their demand for State Department documents on Wednesday, requesting \u201cwritten readouts and write-ups of meetings and conversations that document activity and conduct under investigation by the Committees.\u201d\n\nThose who watched Taylor\u2019s closed-door appearance on Tuesday praised his \u201cexcruciatingly detailed\u201d narrative, in which he recalled top diplomats setting about fulfilling Trump\u2019s demands to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president into announcing investigations of Democrat Joe Biden and the 2016 election.\n\nRead: The 5 Bombshells From Bill Taylor's Testimony on Trump and Ukraine\n\n\u201cHe had a very long opening statement,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia. \u201cAnd it was based on meticulous notes he had taken of meetings and phone conversations and the like.\"\n\nBut the State Department has shown no sign of being willing to turn over those documents, or any others subpoenaed by House Democrats in late September \u2014 and legal experts say that any courtroom challenge could easily take so long that it would outlast the impeachment investigation, if not the entire Trump presidency.\n\nMy subpoena, your subpoena\n\nIronically, the Congressional subpoena sent to the State Department appears to be providing an additional unintended legal rationale for the Trump administration to withhold the documents from Congress.\n\nHaving received the subpoena, the department would theoretically, under normal circumstances, begin gathering files together in order to satisfy the request.\n\nTaylor\u2019s files were handed over to the Statement Department in connection with that Congressional subpoena, the person said.\n\nBut the department is simultaneously refusing to hand those docs over to Congress \u2014 presenting the astonishing portrait of the department both relying on the subpoena to gather records, then refusing to actually turn them over.\n\nHouse investigators subpoenaed Pompeo for Ukraine records in late September, a request that so far his department has denied.\n\nThat refusal falls in line with Trump\u2019s blanket bank on any cooperation from his administration with the impeachment inquiry, and argument legal observers have dismissed as a legally dubious Trumpian rant subsequently dressed up in legalese by top White House attorneys.\n\nIndividual diplomats like Taylor have defied that order when it comes to verbal testimony, and marched down to Capitol Hill to speak. But at the top level, Pompeo\u2019s State Department has held firm on the request for documents, and been partly successful.\n\nOne case in point: Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s EU Ambassador, who testified last week that Trump ordered him to work with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine policy.\n\nBut Sondland also refused to turn over documents to the committee. In a letter, Sondland told Congress that his records were technically government property, and couldn\u2019t be released if the State Department didn't agree \u2014 which it didn\u2019t.\n\nCongress did get one big batch of damning documents, however, from Ambassador Kurt Volker, who was Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine before he abruptly resigned after his role in the Ukraine scandal emerged.\n\nVolker handed over multiple pages of a group WhatsApp chat between himself, Sondland and Taylor that showed discussions aimed at figuring out how to get Ukraine to announce investigations. Those text exchanges support Taylor\u2019s version of events, if not in every detail \u2014 and did not look good for Sondland.\n\nVolker was in a different position from either Taylor or Sondland when he handed over his files to Congress: He\u2019d quit his government job.\n\nBoth Sondland and Taylor remain State Department employees, making it much harder for them to disregard Pompeo\u2019s orders about what should happen with their documents.\n\nCameron Joseph contributed to this report.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump delivers remarks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House on October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.
