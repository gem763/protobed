(AP) \u2014 Los Angeles Rams linebacker Clay Matthews is expected to be out for four to six weeks with a broken jaw.\n\nCoach Sean McVay said Monday that Matthews won't return until after the Rams' bye in early November.\n\nMatthews was hurt when Seattle running back Chris Carson inadvertently kicked him in the face during the fourth quarter of the Rams' 30-29 loss to the Seahawks last Thursday. Matthews' jaw has been wired shut, McVay says.\n\nMatthews has six sacks in his first five games with the Rams, who signed the 33-year-old pass rusher to a two-year contract in the offseason. Matthews had spent the past decade with Green Bay.\n\nSamson Ebukam is expected to take Matthews' starting spot Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
