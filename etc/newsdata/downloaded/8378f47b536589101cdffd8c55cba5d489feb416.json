Schumer said Republicans\u2019 insistence on steering more funding toward President Trump\u2019s desired U.S.-Mexico border wall in next year\u2019s spending legislation was putting the entire process in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThis ruse, this stunt \u2026 puts the entire appropriations process in jeopardy,\u201d the New York Democrat said in a speech on the chamber floor.\n\n\u201cSomehow in the wake of all this, the Republican leader has been accusing Democrats of threatening to block military funding. Now that is an absurd statement if there ever was one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate is set on Wednesday to hold a procedural vote \u2014 which is expected to fail \u2014 on a four-bill package that would fund programs in defense, labor, health, education, energy and water, and foreign operations.\n\nLawmakers are facing an end-of-month deadline to pass new spending legislation or risk another government shutdown, and are likely to opt for a separate shorter-term stopgap bill and delay a bigger fight over the wall.\n\nBut the comments Wednesday suggest another shutdown showdown could be in the offing, after a dispute over wall funding helped trigger the 35-day shutdown that ran from last December into January.\n\nBefore Mr. Schumer\u2019s remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for any potential hold-up, saying that they have been talking about how they might try to \u201cshoehorn\u201d their disagreements with Mr. Trump into the appropriations process.\n\n\u201cOur men and women in uniform do not deserve to have the funding for their tools, their training and their own pay raises used as leverage by Senate Democrats to try to extract concessions from the White House,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
