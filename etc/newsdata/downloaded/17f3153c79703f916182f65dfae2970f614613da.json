My goal is to be a walking piece of political art every time I show up. To challenge expectations. What is masculinity? What does that mean? Women show up every day in pants, but the minute a man wears a dress, the seas part,\u201d he continued.\n\nTake a look at some of his red-carpet looks below.", "description": "Actor Billy Porter is about to make history again after being cast to play the fairy Godmother in the latest Cinderella movie.", "authors": ["Billy Porter To Play The Fairy Godmother In New Cinderella Movie"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9475/14051216afa647a790723f9f53d5d964.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
