Clearly, the outlook for ISX revenue growth is very strong!\" writes LHC.\n\nThe hedge fund does not reflect on the events leading up to the fintech's admission on October 7 that Andrew Karantzis, the brother of John Karantzis, is a beneficiary of the second-biggest shareholder, Red 5. Previously, the company declined to identify who was behind Red 5.\n\nBut it does acknowledge a report from governance firm Ownership Matters, published in September, which examined the issue of performance shares triggered in 2018 upon the meeting of escalating revenue hurdles. Those shares came to be worth around $500 million as iSignthis stock went up 10-fold this year.\n\nThe report \"invited the reader to conclude that the issuance was cynical as the revenue threshold for the last tranche of shares was only narrowly exceeded,\" the fund managers say.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that the performance rights were granted at a time when there was very little ascribable value to ISX, evidenced by the $0.03 a share purchase price for Isignthis BVI,\" referring to the original company which became the basis of the listed group in a 2014 backdoor listing.\n\n\"The fact that the value of the performance rights that were issued is now many multiples of the initial $10 million value at issue reflects the considerable value management has created for all shareholders,\" Mr Hughes and Mr Aboud say.\n\nFurther, no directors have sold shares and no new money has been raised over the last 12 months despite the share price advance.\n\niSignthis has so far declined to explain the nature of transactions highlighted in a September report by The Australian Financial Review and Danish business daily B\u00f8rsen which showed that payments to and from an account in the name of iSignthis eMoney Ltd triggered suspicious activity alarms 26 times at collapsed Danish bank KAB. The timing of those alarms, in June and July of 2018, coincided with the deadline for the meeting of revenue-based hurdles that led to the issue of the performance shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreviously, the company has replied that it is prevented from commenting on transactions of such a nature and that it is fully compliant with respect to regulatory matters. It also said that it reports key statistics on a monthly basis and raises suspicious activity reports with regulators when they occur.\n\n\"Public market investing involves making decisions with imperfect information. As we reconsider and challenge our investment thesis, and in light of the presently known facts, we remain comfortable with our holding in the business,\" LHC says.\n\nThe hedge fund has also rebuilt a position in Freedom Foods, which it says could be to the nutritional food industry what CSL is to blood plasma.\n\nFreedom \"have identified an opportunity to maximise yield via the creation of new high-value products\" from the extraction of proteins, such as lactoferrin, which can be added to infant formula.", "description": "The high-performing hedge fund explained its confidence in iSignthis and why it sees explosive growth ahead for the fintech in a letter to investor clients.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_59%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a9f188aa7f503b8d2150f6d63f3298b0ff3d17fb", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
