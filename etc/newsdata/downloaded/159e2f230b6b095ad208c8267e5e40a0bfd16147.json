So, who is Claudine De Niro?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFormerly known as Claudine DeMatos, she married actor Robert De Niro\u2019s son, Raphael, when they were both 31-year-old real estate brokers at Prudential Douglas Elliman. The posh nuptials were held at an exclusive estate in the Bahamas in 2008, according to their wedding announcement in The New York Times.\n\n\u201cA Bahamian band played and DJ Jus Ske, fresh off Madonna's Oscar bash, provided dance music. Lobster and steak were served,\u201d according to a People report on the nuptials. \u201cDad Robert De Niro spoke briefly. Rolled cigars were handed out to guests. And fireworks lit the sky.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the pair worked side-by-side in a thriving real estate unit named the De Niro Team, according to the Times.\n\nA Fashion Institute of Technology graduate, her father founded a New York-based travel agency and owned several Brazilian restaurants in New York, according to the wedding announcement.\n\nRaphael is the oldest son of the \"Raging Bull\" star, also in the news recently for an alleged harassment case involving a female employee.\n\nClaudine and Raphael have three kids together but split in 2016. They are still not divorced, according to Page Six.\n\nThe Cuba Gooding Jr. incident isn't Claudine's first brush with scandal. She made headlines herself after getting slapped with a lawsuit in April 2017 by her former nanny for alleged unpaid wages, according to the papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\nThe suit was later changed to reflect allegations from a second former employee who worked as a housekeeper and nanny. She claims Claudia terminated her 12-month agreement \u201cbased on discriminatory motives and biases.\u201d\n\nDefendant stated to Plaintiff WILLIAMS: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hired you if I had known you were black\u201d ... \u201c[I] never had a black nanny\u201d... \u201cMy kids don\u2019t like old nannies\u201d ... \u201chow old are you?\u201d - Thais Dilazary and Linda Williams v. Claudine De Niro\n\nThe case is still ongoing, with the next court date scheduled for the end of October in Manhattan.\n\nRoughly two years after the De Niros split, Page Six reported that Claudine was \u201chooking up\u201d with Gooding after the pair was spotted together in Miami.\n\nAt the beginning of June 2019, Page Six spotted Claudine FaceTiming with Gooding during a dinner party in Manhattan.\n\nJust days later, on June 9, she was allegedly with Gooding inside Magic Hour Rooftop Bar at the Moxy Hotel in Manhattan, when a woman approached them.\n\n\u201c[Gooding] then made a sexually suggestive remark to this woman \u2026 placed his hand on this woman\u2019s left breast, without her consent, and squeezed her breast,\u201d court papers show.\n\nSeemingly unfazed by the allegations, the duo was spotted on the red carpet last month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gooding pleaded not guilty to an indictment in connection to the June 2019 assault, in addition to an incident from October 2018.\n\nCourt documents show that on Oct. 24, 2018, Gooding was inside TAO Downtown Nightclub, which is also in Manhattan, when he pinched a woman\u2019s backside. When confronted, he \u201cclaimed that he had only pinched her back, not her buttocks.\"\n\nClaudia was not mentioned in connection to the October incident. She did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment. Gooding's attorney, Mark Heller, declined comment for this story.\n\nTwelve additional women have since come forward with their own claims against the \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d star, with alleged crimes dating as far back as 2001, documents show. Although Gooding has not been criminally charged as a result of their claims, the women\u2019s\u2019 allegations can \u2013 and will \u2013 be used as evidence at trial, prosecutors said in court papers.\n\nIn one instance, in February 2011, Gooding approached a woman at a Los Angeles bar, where he allegedly reached into her shirt and grabbed her bare breast, court papers show.\n\n\u201c[H]e stated, in sum and substance, \u2018sit on my face, pee in my mouth.\u2019\u201d - The State of New York v. Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\nWhile at Nobu Malibu in 2015, where Gooding is a frequent diner known to take selfies with female fans, he tried to kiss a different woman on the mouth, then bit her, according to documents.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCoincidentally Nobu was co-founded by Claudine\u2019s father-in-law in 1994.\n\nThe elder De Niro and Gooding are also no strangers. The actors starred alongside each other in the 2000 film \"Men of Honor.\"\n\nLess than honorable, however, was a bombshell voicemail De Niro left to one of his former employees, which was just released as part of a lawsuit.\n\nBOMBSHELL AUDIO: DENIRO TERRORIZES FEMALE EMPLOYEE IN PROFANITY-LACED TIRADE\n\nGraham Chase Robinson worked for De Niro\u2019s production company for a decade, during which time she says was discriminated against \u201cday in and day out,\u201d her lawyer Alexandra Harwin told FOX Business.\n\nShe claimed the 76-year-old Hollywood star treated her like his \u201coffice wife,\u201d the federal lawsuit states, and often went ballistic on her, once calling her a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d in a profanity-laced voicemail when she did not answer his phone call.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"Among these duties,\" Harwin said, \"De Niro directed Ms. Robinson to put away his boxers, hang up his clothes, wash his sheets, vacuum his apartment, set his table, mend his clothing, and select gifts for his children.\"", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert De Niro are connected in more ways than you might think, starting with Gooding\u2019s gal pal, Claudine De Niro.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Cuba-Gooding-JR-Claudine-DeNiro.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
