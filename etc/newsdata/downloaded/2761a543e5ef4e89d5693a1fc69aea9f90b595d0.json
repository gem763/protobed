And now she has the Mystics one victory away from the first title in franchise history.\n\n\u201cBasically (I\u2019ve been) doing anything possible to get back out there,\u201d Delle Donne said after the 84-71 win Sunday. \u201cWe have a really great medical staff, phenomenal doctors, great trainers. So they\u2019ve been working on me for five days straight. I was glad to have a little bit of a break to get it to calm down a little bit, just trying to find ways to stay comfortable and stay loose.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne, who has been snake-bitten by injuries and illnesses throughout her career, hadn\u2019t been on the court since leaving Tuesday\u2019s game early on. An MRI revealed that she had a small herniated disk that is pinching a nerve in her back.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to go today because I hadn\u2019t done anything until right up before the game,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we were able to kind of test it a little bit and go from there.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-5 wing played 26 minutes, scoring 16 points. She hit her first four shots, including three 3-pointers, before her only miss of the day. Seeing their star out there provided an emotional lift for the Mystics and Kristi Toliver and Emma Meesseman took care of the rest.\n\n\u201cHer presence alone, whether she\u2019s 100 percent or 10 percent, just instills confidence in the rest of the group,\u201d said Toliver, who had 20 points and 10 assists. \u201cAnd she showed a lot of character and showed a lot of heart just being out on the floor today because she\u2019s obviously not feeling great.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne played in spurts, going for 4-5 minutes at a time before subbing out and riding a stationary bike in the tunnel behind the Mystics\u2019 bench. Even when she wasn\u2019t riding the bike, she didn\u2019t sit, so her back wouldn\u2019t tighten up.\n\n\u201cSitting is my worst enemy,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t sat much these past couple of days. When I do, I get really stiff and it\u2019s hard to get up from it. So I\u2019ve been doing a lot of standing, a lot of core work, a lot of glute work. But, yes, sitting has been really bad for me.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne stayed mostly on the outside on offense, driving to the basket sparingly. She picked her spots though, hitting one big basket on a drive in the fourth quarter as the Sun were making a run.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of one of the moments like, \u2018Hey, I might give my back up and my body up on this one,\u2019 but I feel like it was such a big moment to stop that run they\u2019re making,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I knew I\u2019ve got a phenomenal team. They\u2019ve carried me this whole series, and they\u2019re going to carry me the rest of the way. So I just saw I might have a lane, because I hadn\u2019t driven or done anything really, so I just tried to attack.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics were fortunate to have all the time between the second and third games of the series. There\u2019s less rest time now with Game 4 on Tuesday and a potential Game 5 in Washington on Thursday.\n\n\u201cShe wants to win a championship bad enough that we\u2019ve got another 40-some hours to recover, 50-some hours,\u201d Mystics coach Mike Thibault said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll try to do the same process we\u2019ve done the last couple of days and see what we feel like come Tuesday.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Elena Delle Donne spent the last five days doing everything she could to be able to play in the pivotal Game 3 of the WNBA Finals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/mystics_sun_basketball_73197_c0-212-3517-2262_s1770x1032.jpg?a990e71c421892df6bd516a6836a7f3d05500e0f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
