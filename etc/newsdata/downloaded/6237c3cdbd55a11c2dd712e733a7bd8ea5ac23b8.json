Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nRemember the tea party? Ten years ago its activists looked omnipresent. They railed against the Affordable Care Act, swept a slate of far-right Republicans into office, got Paul Ryan on the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential ticket, and helped force generous tax cuts. Then they dissipated, casualties of a Republican presidency that will not solve the budget deficit. At least, that\u2019s the gist of a piece in the New York Times. On Wednesday, reporter Jeremy Peters asserted that the movement\u2019s principles \u201chave been largely abandoned by Republicans under President Trump.\u201d The Affordable Care Act survives, and so does the deficit.\n\nPeters does not quite say that the movement is totally defunct. \u201cEven if the Tea Party\u2019s ideas are dead, its attitude lives on,\u201d he writes. But is difficult to prise out a meaningful difference between the movement\u2019s ideas, and its attitude; the latter was indelibly shaped by the former. As long as its attitude persists, so do its ideas. Both find their natural expression in the person of Donald Trump. Though Peters claims the president \u201ccares little\u201d for the tea party\u2019s \u201cfounding ideas,\u201d that narrow framing asks us to believe that the tea party patriots of recent history actually cared about budget deficits.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s obvious that the tea party\u2019s deficit obsession was a fa\u00e7ade. Behind it lurked a specific racial politics that informed its commitment to small government. Think back again to the bad old days. If any single person deserves credit for sparking the tea party movement, it\u2019s Rick Santelli. Though it\u2019s undeniable now that the Obama administration failed homeowners rocked by the foreclosure crisis, its halting efforts still outraged Santelli. On an infamous CNBC broadcast in 2009, the stock-market analyst used the issue to call for the creation of a new \u201ctea party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is America!\u201d he screamed. Turning to the traders behind him, he yelled, \u201cHow many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can\u2019t pay their bills? Raise your hands!\u201d The traders, who were mostly white, did not raise their hands. They booed. They did not object to government spending per se; Santelli wasn\u2019t complaining about defense spending. They booed the nation\u2019s first black president for spending public money on people who \u2014 in their estimation \u2014 did not deserve it. The tea party amplified white, middle-class resentment. It embodied the same fear of falling that would later make Trump president.\n\nPeters does mention in passing that Obama allies believed the tea party gave \u201ccover and a voice to those who wanted to attack the first black president \u2014 people who in some cases showed up at rallies waving signs with racist caricatures and references.\u201d Not only is that conclusion obviously right; it\u2019s central to any sensible understanding of the tea party. Racism was its animating force. The movement was revanchist to its core. Its \u201cbare-knuckle, brawling style,\u201d as a source described matters to Peters, was a reaction to Obama\u2019s blackness as much as it was to his perceived socialism. Peters does not mention birtherism in his piece, but the claim \u2014 which combined anti-black racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia into one Franken-theory about Obama\u2019s ineligibility to be president \u2014 was popular among tea party activists. Further, though Peters refers to it as a \u201cmass uprising,\u201d it was not a spontaneous, organic populist movement, at least not entirely. It was Astroturf, too, funded by libertarian donors like the late and little-lamented David Koch.\n\nKoch is no more, but his brother is still around. So is the family\u2019s money, and so are the libertarian ideals they toiled for decades to push into the mainstream. Though the Kochs have soured on Trump, along with the tea party activists Peters quotes in his piece, the president is mostly aligned with their point of view. If Mick Mulvaney, former tea party congressman, is happy to work for him, it\u2019s not proof of Mulvaney\u2019s hypocrisy. Trump slashed taxes on \u201cthe capitalists,\u201d as Santelli called them. He\u2019s doing his utmost to shrink the federal government. The damage is subtle, sometimes, but it\u2019s present. Departmental vacancies go unfilled. He\u2019s packed his government with opponents of industry regulation. Betsy DeVos has delivered the Department of Education to unscrupulous student lenders and for-profit colleges with a bow tied around it.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of government spending. To understand exactly how Trump delivers on old tea party demands, it\u2019s important to remember that the tea party itself didn\u2019t deviate much from Republican norms. As the political theorist Corey Robin has argued, the tea party\u2019s ideas were unoriginal at the time. By 2009, Republicans had been railing against \u201cwelfare queens\u201d for years. The phrase \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d already signaled a form of denialism, where Republicans and centrist Democrats alike blamed poverty on the lifestyle choices of the poor rather than the priorities of lawmakers. The tea party\u2019s central innovation was to take these older ideas and incorporate them into a broad critique of government spending.\n\nSome activists did seek cuts to defense spending, and so did a few allied members of Congress. And if you look no further than the budget deficit, and the fact that it still exists, perhaps it does seem as if the tea party ultimately lost. But the tea party had other ideas too. Its activists despised welfare, and so, too, does the Trump administration. From food stamps to Medicaid, Trump officials pursue welfare cuts with single-minded diligence. The Baltimore Sun reported last week that the Department of Agriculture\u2019s proposed changes to SNAP would kick around 15,000 Baltimore residents off food assistance. \u201cThose people are living in hell in Baltimore,\u201d Trump told the press in July. \u201cThey\u2019re largely African-American \u2026 and they really appreciate what I\u2019m doing, and they let me know it.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments weren\u2019t inspired by the USDA\u2019s SNAP cuts, but by his grudge match with Representative Elijah Cummings. But they are revealing, nonetheless. In rhetoric and policy, the administration\u2019s disdain for \u201cthose people\u201d is a universal and palpable wound.\n\nYears after Santelli screamed \u201cThis is America!\u201d into the stale air of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Trump promised to make a threatened homeland great again. In this way, he is Santelli\u2019s president. He is the president of birthers and small-government hysterics. He might not be a tea party purist, but he\u2019s clearly a believer.\n\nThe tea party is not dead, and neither are its ideas. We look not at its defeat but at its victory \u2014 incomplete, but real all the same.", "description": "The budget deficit endures, but in other respects, the Trump administration upholds most of the Tea Party\u2019s ideals.", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/28/28-tea-party.w1200.h630.jpg"}
