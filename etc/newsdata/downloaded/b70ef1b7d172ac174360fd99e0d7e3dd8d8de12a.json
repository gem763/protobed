But conservative women in the United Kingdom called out the media outlet for only focusing on not only left-wing women but controversial figures while leaving out exceptional conservative individuals who hold a different worldview.\n\nThe Conservative Woman website posted a blog about the obviously biased list:\n\nIf anyone can spot a supporter of an overtly conservative or social conservative cause, please let me know. No doubt many of the women are doing wonderful and courageous things. It\u2019s just that the socially liberal if not downright Leftist and activist bias is unrestrained. The categories say it all \u2013 they include \u2018Earth\u2019 and \u2018Identity\u2019. The list of 100 women includes two men. Oddly, while one of them identifies as a woman, the other does not. Owl Fisher is an Icelandic transgender activist who identifies as non-binary and uses the pronoun they/them. Will \u2018they\u2019 also be on the BBC\u2019s list of \u2018100 inspiring and influential men from around the world for 2019\u2019? If not, why not? And isn\u2019t the BBC \u2018mis-gendering\u2019 Owl? If the BBC can do so, presumably the rest of us also can relax a bit on this front.\n\nThe post includes descriptions of some of the women on the BBC\u2019s list that paint a different picture of these women\u2019s impact.\n\nThe post points out the actress Bella Thorne directed her first porn film at 22.\n\n\u201cThis is not a list for your daughters,\u201d the post said.\n\nTwo young climate change activists also made the list \u2013 American Jamie Margolin and Swede Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cThe future must be de-colonised and re-connected to the ancient wisdom of the Earth we once cherished. Climate change is a man-made problem, which is why women should rule the world,\u201d Margolin said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a list to show your sons either,\u201d the Conservative Woman post said.\n\nThunberg is most likely not being honored for \u201cterrifying millions of children,\u201d the post said, adding that a growing number of young people are now seeking psychiatric help.\n\nAnd women who are left-wing politicians also made the list, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\n\u201cBut if you are looking for conservative commentator Candace Owens or one of the female Brexit Party MEPs doing wonders to promote the causes of democracy and self-government in Brussels . . . don\u2019t bother trying to find them,\u201d the post said. \u201cThey\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither is Priti Patel, one of the most, if not the most successful British Asian women of the moment \u2013 and the most purposeful Home Secretary of recent times,\u201d the post said.\n\nThe Conservative Woman blog concluded by stating an obvious fact about the annual list. The BBC is a left-wing media outlet honoring its own.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "The Conservative Woman website in the UK calls out the BBC about its annual list of 100 inspirational women, all of whom are left-wing.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Candace-Owens-Speaking-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
