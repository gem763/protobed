By ehpien via Flickr. (ehpien/ehpien)\n\nIf you are going to World Series Game 4 tonight, lucky you! I think the majority of the game will remain dry, but can\u2019t rule out a light shower or two as we progress through the evening. Otherwise, it will be a rather cloudy and somewhat humid night at the ballpark, before a rainy Sunday morning. We should be dry again well before first pitch Sunday night.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: After the chance of a light shower or two during the evening hours, we\u2019re mostly cloudy overnight with steadier rain developing after 2 a.m. or so. Lows drop to the mid- to upper 50s with winds picking up out of the southeast as well, gusting to 20-plus mph in the predawn hours.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): Pockets of moderate to heavy rain rotate through the region during the morning before ending by early afternoon, making for a wet Marine Corps Marathon. We can\u2019t rule out a few rumbles of thunder with some of the heavier rain. It\u2019s a mild and muggy day with midday temperatures jumping into the mid-70s before a cold front moves through in the late afternoon. We\u2019re left with clearing skies tomorrow night for Game 5, with evening temps falling through the 60s, followed by overnight lows in the 50s and winds from the northwest around 10 mph.\n\nSee Ian Livingston\u2019s forecast through next week.
