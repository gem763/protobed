Mr. Soros, pointing a finger in the air, called China \u201ca mortal enemy\u201d and said the West gave it too much of the benefit of the doubt. \u201cWe should recognize it: It\u2019s a different system. It\u2019s totally opposed to ours, diametrically opposed to ours,\u201d he said. Perhaps to qualify his words, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Chinese at all. I\u2019m just anti Xi Jinping.\u201d\n\nSoros\u2019s words echo an op-ed he published in the Wall Street Journal last month in which he praised President Donald Trump\u2019s policy of confronting China as a \u201cgreat achievement.\u201d\n\nThough Soros told the Times that he expected the political pendulum to swing back to \u201cglobalists\u201d (his word), and said he expected Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to be the Democratic Party nominee (without endorsing her), his feelings on China are firmly in line with those of the Trump administration.\n\nRead the full Soros interview here.\n\nJoel B.
