She also noted that the new revelations about Trump\u2019s contacts with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has \u201cunited almost the entire Democratic caucus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the ground has shifted. I don\u2019t believe in making decisions based on polling,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez continued. \u201cI believe in our ability to organize the public, to educate the public, to talk to the public about why not just we as members of Congress much impeach the president but why all people in the United States of America must recognize and understand that need to put our country first before our consideration of reelection. And that goes for members of Congress all the way up to the president of the United States.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Media Aoc-Dismisses-Polls-Showing-Disapproval-Of-Impeachment-Suggests-Dems-Should-Be-Willing-To-Lose-Reelection"], "top_image": ""}
