David Seinker has some tips to avoid burnout\n\nAdvancements made in technology have resulted in people\u2019s ability to always be online, always check their email and always be available for meetings.\n\nIn many cases, we cannot switch off, and this means that no one truly rests after a day at the office.\n\nThis is even more true among those who run their own businesses.\n\nEntrepreneurs are, essentially, the face and brand of their businesses.\n\nIn many cases, an hour that they are not working is an hour they are not earning any money, which is something that is always at the back of their minds.\n\nThese entrepreneurs are fiercely passionate and often obsessive about getting work done, servicing clients and ensuring that no ball is dropped.\n\nAs a result, entrepreneur burnout is a real thing.\n\nHere are a few tips on how to avoid entrepreneur burnout and how to ensure that you are taking care of yourself, all while taking care of your business:\n\n1 Make time for the things that keep you sane\n\nI have found that it is often easy to let time with family and friends slide. You always think that your loved ones will understand and that there will always be time to do that fun activity another time.\n\nIt\u2019s a slippery slope. If you do it too often, you will do it all the time and, soon enough, you\u2019re missing out on moments you used to enjoy being part of.\n\nIf you say yes to an event, go to it. If you\u2019ve planned a date night, stick to it, and if Sunday mornings are usually reserved for mountain bike rides, then commit to it. This way, your days aren\u2019t only filled with work, and you are giving your head and heart some time to re-energise.\n\n2 Talk to other entrepreneurs\n\nYou\u2019re not the only one going through this.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to believe that our problems are unique and that we don\u2019t want to burden other busy entrepreneurs with our problems. But you would be surprised at how easily other business owners are willing to talk about what they are going through and offer some advice.\n\nNo man or woman needs to be an island, and a good chat about shared issues can be very therapeutic and business beneficial.\n\n3 Check in with yourself\n\nDon\u2019t get so buried under the pressure and volume of work that you don\u2019t even notice the signs of burnout.\n\nTake some time every now and then to check in with yourself.\n\nYou can ask yourself questions such as: Am I easily irritated by small issues? Do I feel tired and rundown all the time? Am I missing out on other parts of life because I\u2019m working too much?\n\nIf the answers to all of these questions are yes, perhaps it\u2019s time to take a breather.\n\n4 Take some time off and don\u2019t feel guilty\n\nIf you need time off, take the time and don\u2019t feel guilty about it.\n\nIn fact, if you can regularly schedule a break, do it.\n\nPerhaps you could block out the first weekend of every month to just unplug and relax.\n\nOr plan for the first week of a certain month to take a mini holiday with friends or family. Give clients notice well in advance, delegate tasks to other staff members \u2013 if you have people working for you \u2013 and enjoy some guilt-free down time.\n\n5Make sure you\u2019re in an environment that allows you to thrive\n\nIt is important that your work environment is relatively free of stress and allows you to thrive.\n\nIf you work out of your garage surrounded by clutter, for example, your mind will be cluttered and add to your stress levels.\n\nIf you\u2019re working from home and you need to schedule an important meeting and then need to scramble for a suitable meeting location, you will feel stressed. Take these small issues off your plate by making sure that your working environment puts you at ease rather than on edge.\n\nSeinker is CEO and founder of The Business Exchange", "description": "The modern workforce is tired and stressed.
