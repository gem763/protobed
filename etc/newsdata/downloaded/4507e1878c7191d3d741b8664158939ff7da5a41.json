He seemed distracted and not thinking of her. She considered what she'd had as a ''near death experience''. She said Paul was not only unmoved by [what she went through]; he actually appeared to be angry with her about it.\n\n'This is when Carrie knew the marriage to Paul was over.'\n\nThe biography also delves deeper into Fisher's three-month affair with her Star Wars co-star Harrison Ford, revealing the two had a standing Friday night sleepover where they would smoke weed together.\n\nCarrie Fisher was heartbroken after losing her and Paul Simon's child in a severe ectopic pregnancy, a new book obtained by DailyMail.com reveals.

My two follow-ups met with no response\u2026 It is my great admiration for Carrie Fisher's life and work that compelled me to write the book in the first place.'\n\nCarrie was young and impressionable when she met Ford in 1976 auditioning for what would be her iconic role as Princess Leia in Star Wars.\n\nAt the time, Ford was married to Mary Marquardt with two young children but was a Hollywood hipster working as a carpenter, making ends meet by selling dope while waiting for his big break.\n\nHe smoked weed on the way to the set and blazed between takes.\n\nCarrie came to the set fresh from a Texas weight loss camp where she lost 10 pounds.

Pictured: Ford and Fisher in 2015\n\nFisher's smoking weed habit would eventually evolve to developing a cocaine habit and self-medicating - which would play a role in her death in December 2016.\n\nHer toxicology report identified that within 72 hours before her death, she had ingested cocaine, methadone, ethanol and opiates as well as having been exposed to heroin and ecstasy.\n\nThe Star Wars icon was on the last stretch of a flight from London to Los Angeles when she woke abruptly, vomiting uncontrollably and unable to breathe.\n\nSleep apnea had worried her for years, but now here it was and she was in full cardiac arrest. Fisher was rushed to intensive care at UCLA's Medical Center as soon as the plane landed.\n\nThere was no news until three days later when Carrie's daughter Billie and Billie's father, Bryan Lourd confirmed Carrie's death on December 27, 2016.\n\nDiagnosed as bipolar two \u2013 the name changed from manic depression \u2013 Carrie was an admitted drug addict and had refused lithium treatment opting to self-medicated with opiates, until it killed her.\n\n'Carrie would alternately defy and celebrate the diagnosis for years' and indulge in her own 'cocktail of meds', Weller writes.\n\n'The diagnosis made her freer about and more accepting of the mania that she had always understood in herself \u2013 with the unofficial caveat that she didn't have to follow treatment in an orthodox fashion.'\n\nCarrie inherited her drug addiction and bipolar disorder from her father, 1960s crooner Eddie Fisher who scandalously abandoned the family for the arms of Elizabeth Taylor - later returning to hit on Carrie, commenting on her large breasts and butt, and to borrow money for the rest of his dissolute life.\n\nOn the night before her wedding to Paul Simon, Eddie told her, 'You have a great a**. You should be marrying me'.\n\nCarrie inherited her drug addiction and bipolar disorder from her father, 1960s crooner Eddie Fisher (pictured together in 1983) who scandalously abandoned the family for Elizabeth Taylor and only returned to see his daughter and hit on her. He reared his ugly persona the night before her wedding to Paul Simon, saying: 'You have a great a**. You should be marrying me'\n\n'Carrie inherited a double whammy from her father and struggled mightily with it,' Weller writes, saying that inheriting both bipolarity and drug addiction was 'a perfect storm'.

Ecstasy, MDA, Percodan. It's hard to get. You have to lie to doctors'. She even blurted out that she also snorted heroin.\n\n'I am mentally ill, she told Sawyer. 'I feel like I'm the doctor and the patient, but a lot of time the doctor isn't in'.\n\nEddie shot speed for 13 years and then he was a pill addict and so was I. I'm mentally ill. I feel like I'm the doctor and the patient, but a lot of time the doctor isn't in.\n\nFisher found a lifelong close friend in fellow manic-depressive actor Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nBipolar himself, Dreyfuss understood what it was like to trip through a racing bipolar mind on and off meds.\n\nThese were the early days of Saturday Night Live and the cast was hanging out together with Lorne Michaels and Paul, the show's first musical guest.\n\nCarrie and John Belushi, an SNL regular, had become close platonic friends according to Judy Belushi, and shared 'a predilection for cocaine'.\n\nCarrie confessed to musical director Guy Strobel that she was taking large quantities of Percocet, oxycodone plus acetaminophen, a drug that bipolars use to self-medicate but typically only taking two a day, according to NY psychologist, Dr. Dean Parker.\n\n'Carrie would eventually admit to taking thirty a day', writes Weller.\n\nDescribing what it was like to live in her mind during a mild mania:\n\n'I will tell myself nine stories about what I'm looking at... My drug thing was, if I tell seven stories about every situation, [the drugs would help] to take it down to maybe three.'\n\nThe attraction between Carrie and Paul was feverish. Simon, who wore a toupee, was almost as short as Carrie, measuring a mere five foot one. 'Don't stand next to me at a party \u2013 people will think we're salt and pepper shakers', she jested\n\nPaul and Carrie decided to marry in July 1983. He proposed at Yankee Stadium and they were married eight days later. She was 26, he was 41 and they had been together on and off for five years. They divorced nine months later in 1984\n\nCarrie was also consuming Percodan and was first introduced to it from head SNL writer Michael O'Donoghue who used it for migraines.\n\n'She lived in her head like a madwoman locked in a tower, hearing the wind howling through her hair and waiting for someone to come and rescue her,' O'Donoghue is quoted.\n\nMeanwhile, Dreyfuss had introduced Carrie to Simon who had divorced his first wife Peggy Harper and was now seeing Popeye actress Shelley Duvall.

Can you rescue me?'\n\nMeanwhile, Carrie grew increasingly uncomfortable in Paul's more sophisticated world she viewed as intellectual.\n\n'I wasn't ready for them', Carrie admitted, feeling challenged after dropping out of high school.\n\nFisher's relationship with her mother actress Debbie Reynolds was a complicated mother-daughter neediness which made Carrie feel less than in comparison to her mother who always dazzled \u2013 and increased Carrie's drug intake\n\nFisher's close friend Guy Strobel saw a disapproving and judgmental mother while Fisher was rehearsing for an upcoming musical production and got the feeling, 'Nobody can look as good as Debbie Reynolds'. Pictured: Fisher and Reynolds in 2003\n\nShe loved to spend her day shopping in Soho with girlfriends. She'd give them money; they'd jump out of the limo and rush to see who could buy the most the fastest.\n\nPaul and Carrie decided to marry in July 1983. He proposed at Yankee Stadium and they were married eight days later.\n\nShe was 26, he was 41 and they had been together on and off for five years. They divorced nine months later in 1984.\n\n'Carrie was an addict. Paul was not', writes Weller, and her independence was difficult for Paul who really wanted his wife to be waiting at home for him.\n\nCarrie was in rehearsals for a Joseph Papp musical and there were rumors that SNL regular John Belushi would show up at the stage door at the end of rehearsals to snort cocaine with Carrie.\n\nThe rumors persisted that Carrie and Belushi were doing coke all night.\n\nIn the stands at rehearsal was Debbie Reynolds, who came into the city to help Carrie rehearse.\n\nIt was a complicated mother-daughter neediness that made Carrie feel less than in comparison to her mother who always dazzled \u2013 and increased Carrie's drug intake.\n\nBy 2007, Carrie seemed to be on fire. But even that extreme treatment didn't resolve her addictions and she never escaped feeling insecure about her talent compared to that of her razzmatazz mother even though she so successfully metamorphosed from actress to writer who acts and a script doctor. A day after Carrie died on December 27, 2016, her mother Debbie Reynolds also died following a stroke.

You could tell she was getting crazy, getting overdosed. You knew she was looking for some kind of peace, and you were worried she could die'.\n\nBy 2007, Carrie seemed to be on fire.\n\nShe had been in rehab and agreed to ECT \u2013 shock treatments initially three times a week for three weeks and then once every six weeks.\n\nBut even that extreme treatment didn't resolve her addictions and she never escaped feeling insecure about her talent compared to that of her razzmatazz mother even though she so successfully metamorphosed from actress to writer who acts and a script doctor.\n\nSheila Weller's upcoming book Carrie Fisher: A Life on the Edge is available November 12", "description": "Carrie Fisher was heartbroken after losing her and Paul Simon's child in a severe ectopic pregnancy around early 1984, a new book obtained by DailyMail.com reveals.", "authors": ["Caroline Howe For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20384546-0-image-a-36_1572451389460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
