To get him out, the rescue mission started with five JCBs that were used to dig a hole parallel to the borewell but could only dig till 20 feet after they hit a rocky terrain.\n\nDon't Miss 152 SHARES 37.8 K SHARES 4.8 K SHARES 4.1 K SHARES 637 SHARES\n\nThey also used tiny cameras that were sent down the hole in the borewell to check on the child's health, which was fine as he showed some movement during that time and he even responded to his mother's voice.\n\nA special thermal device, developed by Anna University was also used to monitor Sujith's temperature, while oxygen was constantly being supplied.\n\nANI\n\nRobots that tried to rescue Sujith\n\nOn the first day of the rescue operation, robots designed for rescue operations were brought. The robot tried to rescue Sujith with the help of ropes. While the robot managed to get one hand locked into place, the other hand was out of reach. Multiple attempts ended up resulting pushing Sujith to go lower to over 80 feet.\n\nAfter the robotic rescue failed the rescuers switched to the conventional digging method and called for an advanced ONGC rig equipment to drill the hard surface. With this, they began drilling 110-feet deep hole, six feet away from the borewell. However, this too faced a snag at a depth of 40 feet due to the hard nature of the soil.\n\nThey called for a more powerful drilling rig -- three times more powerful than the previous one -- to continue with the operation. But even this drilled just 10 feet due to the nature of the soil and persistent rainfall.\n\nWhen all the above machines failed, the authorities brought in a private boring machine with 1200 horsepower to drill three holes. This was installed to drill through the rocks and cross the 40-feet mark that was done by the ONGC rig.\n\nWhile this machine was successful in getting to Sujith, it was too late as Sujith's body was found dismembered and in a highly decomposed state.\n\nWhat more could have been done?\n\nTech has tried to save lives in rescue missions. Last year in June, 13 teenage boys of a soccer team in Thailand were stuck in a cave after water levels in it rose. Using conventional protocols and advanced communication equipment, they could finally rescue the boys safe and sound. Last year in January, a drone was able to save lives of two divers in an ocean by reaching in the nick of time and providing them with flotation devices.\n\nIn Sujith's case too, it is established that the primary fault for such a sad occurrence is the sheer negligence of the authorities in the Thiruchirpalli district pertaining to borewells.\n\nRegardless of that, even during the rescue operation, while the rescue authorities tried using the best of tech that was at their disposal, the use of tech without any proper training or testing in realistic situations was what worsened the child's situation in an already hellish setup.\n\nANI\n\nCould we have shown tech ingenuity like the ones in the diving incident in Australia or like the Thai NAVY SEAL divers in Thailand? Tech did come to their rescue, against all odds, and saved lives of everyone involved. Granted a borewell isn't the same as a cave or a mine, and it presents its own unique challenge, but existence of tech isn't everything.\n\nThe inclusion of special robots that tried to pull Sujith out resulted in making matters worse for the child, pushing him further into the ground. If robots like these would have been tested as rigorously as rockets or aircraft, or other emergency rescue equipment like a defibrillator, in different scenarios and condition, pushing the equipment to the limit and getting better with every challenge, maybe it would be more fitted and would have resulted in a positive outcome.\n\nIn the end, such incidents do leave a mark not just on the family, but to the community and eventually the whole country. But do authorities really learn from this?", "description": "On Friday, a three-year-old Sujith Wilson fell in a 600 feet borewell in Nadukkupatti Town of Tiruchirapalli district in Tamil Nadu.
