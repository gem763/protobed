He subsequently headed to Pakistan - which has five of the peaks - as a part of his mission, and finished his pursuit in Tibet.\n\nPurja, who arrived in Kathmandu wearing a black baseball cap, previously worked with the UK's special forces and Royal Marines.\n\nDuring his ascent of Mount Everest in May, Purja took photographs showing scores of climbers lined up on the summit ridge, exposing a jam at the so-called \"death zone\" of the world's highest mountain.\n\nNepal subsequently drafted a new set of climbing rules aimed at reducing the crowding on Everest.", "description": "Nirmal Purja, 36, scaled the 14 highest peaks in six months and six days to become the world's fastest mountaineer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/422517c1d4804ed9bae8d48041a7d7fa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
