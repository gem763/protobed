Photo: Courtesy of Saturday Night Live\n\nThe 45th season of Saturday Night Live is set to premiere later this month, and while the cast will no longer feature Leslie Jones, it will feature two new faces, and a third who will be making a jump from the writing staff. The show just announced the three new featured players for the upcoming season are stand-up Shane Gillis, improviser Chloe Fineman, and SNL writer (and former Vulture contributor!) Bowen Yang.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start off with the SNLer: Bowen Yang racked up an impressive list of hit sketches during his first year as a writer on the show, including the \u201cCheques\u201d sketch with host Sandra Oh (co-written with Julio Torres) and the \u201cGP Yass\u201d sketch with host Steve Carell (co-written with James Anderson). He also appeared as Kim Jong-un in the \u201cKremlin Meeting\u201d sketch alongside Sandra Oh:\n\nIn addition to his work at SNL, Yang co-hosts the Las Culturistas podcast with Matt Rogers, but on Twitter he\u2019s perhaps best known for being the best damn lip-sync impersonator ever.\n\nwhen u gay pic.twitter.com/3q5yJHxIGP \u2014 Bowen Yang \u6768\u4f2f\u6587 (@bowenyang) May 5, 2018\n\nNew York\u2013based stand-up Shane Gillis, meanwhile, was named a New Face at 2019\u2019s Just For Laughs festival, as well as an \u201cUp-Next\u201d Comic at Comedy Central\u2019s 2019 Clusterfest festival. He\u2019s a regular on Big Jay Oakerson and Dan Soder\u2019s Sirius XM show, The Bonfire. Check out some clips below:\n\nFinally, Groundlings alum Chloe Fineman has appeared on shows like Search Party, Jane the Virgin, Mozart in the Jungle, and Grown-ish and was named a New Face at Just For Laughs in 2018. She\u2019s very, very good at celebrity impersonations, including Melania Trump and Marianne Williamson:\n\nSeason 45 of SNL debuts on September 28 with host Woody Harrelson and musical guest Billie Eilish.", "description": "\u2019Saturday Night Live\u2019 has added three new cast members for its upcoming 45th season: stand-up Shane Gillis, improviser Chloe Fineman, and \u2018SNL\u2019 writer Bowen Yang.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-snl-new-cast-members.w1200.h630.jpg"}
