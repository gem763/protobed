Days later, curiosity over who had drawn a loop on a weather map played out alongside life-shaping questions about who should, and shouldn\u2019t, flee the storm.\n\nOn broader questions about climate, and air quality in particular, neither Trump nor some Democrats seem to be able to get it right.\n\nA look at recent claims from Trump and the Democratic campaign, also covering the Green New Deal, war, the economy and more:\n\nSTORMY WEATHER\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5.\u201d - tweet on Sept. 1, 7:51 a.m.\n\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, Birmingham: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d - tweet on Sept. 1, 8:11 a.m.\n\nTHE FACTS: The episode showed what has been learned from other destructive storms: Trump can\u2019t be counted on to provide reliable information as a potential natural disaster takes shape, even as his agencies try to do so. It was never \u201cmost likely\u201d that Alabama would be hit hard, never mind by \u201cone of the largest hurricanes ever.\u201d\n\nWithin a half hour of Trump\u2019s tweet, the weather service\u2019s office in Birmingham, Alabama, had tamped down any expectations of a hit on Alabama with its \u201cno impacts\u201d tweet. A meteorologist in the Birmingham office said the tweet was in response to residents\u2019 concerns.\n\nAnd Christopher Vaccaro, speaking for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, said that day: \u201cThe current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\u201d The official forecast at 8 a.m. Sunday, closest to Trump\u2019s warning tweet, showed a large zone of possible strikes, but Alabama was outside that zone by at least 180 miles.\n\nAt the time, several graphics issued by the National Hurricane Center showed that parts of Alabama had a small chance - 5% to 10% - of getting tropical storm force winds. Graphics from the previous week had suggested much more of Alabama could see an impact, though the odds even then were against it. But those graphics, which are not official forecasts in any event, were outdated by Sunday.\n\nMeantime, Alabama was not mentioned in any of the 75 forecast advisories the hurricane center issued between Aug. 27 and Sept. 2, a period covered by Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nDigging in his heels, Trump on Wednesday displayed a map of the hurricane forecast from the previous week. It had been altered to include what appeared to be a hand-drawn half-circle that extended the cone of uncertainty over a swath of Alabama. He had no explanation for the alteration.\n\nThen late Friday, NOAA issued a statement walking back its position from the previous weekend, and now lending a measure of support to the president. It said the tweet from the Birmingham weather office about no impact to Alabama had been \u201cinconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nThis time, the \u201cspokesperson\u201d was anonymous.\n\n___\n\nCLIMATE\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: \u201cWe\u2019ve got, what, 11 years, maybe, to reach a point where we\u2019ve cut our emissions in half. \u2026 We\u2019d better be willing to put the resources into it because the alternative is unthinkable.\u201d - CNN town hall with Democratic presidential candidates Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: These statements are out of step with science. Climate scientists don\u2019t agree on an approximate time frame, let alone an exact number of years, for how much time we have left to stave off the deadliest extremes of climate change.\n\nA report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, drawn from the work of hundreds of scientists, uses 2030 as a prominent benchmark because signatories to the Paris climate change agreement have pledged emission cuts by then. But it\u2019s not a last-chance, hard deadline for action as Warren and other Democratic candidates have cast it.\n\n\u201cThe hotter it gets, the worse it gets, but there is no cliff edge,\u201d James Skea, co-chairman of the report, told The Associated Press.\n\nClimate scientists certainly see the necessity for broad and immediate action to address global warming, but they do not agree that 2030 is a point of no return.\n\nCornell University climate scientist Natalie M. Mahowald told the AP that a 12-year time frame is a \u201crobust number for trying to cut emissions\u201d and to keep the increase in warming under current levels.\n\nBut she said sketching out unduly dire consequences is not \u201chelpful to solving the problem.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: \u201cFor me and everybody I know, for the children that we hope to have, for the people who will be alive at the turn of the century, when if we don\u2019t change what we\u2019re doing, we could lose half the world\u2019s oxygen because of what\u2019s going on in the oceans. That is unthinkable.\u201d - candidates\u2019 town hall on CNN.\n\nTHE FACTS: This is not sound science. You and your descendants can breathe easy about the planet\u2019s oxygen levels. There are other things to worry about from climate change, fossil fuel combustion and Amazon fires.\n\nClimate scientists told the AP that Buttigieg\u2019s claim that half of Earth\u2019s oxygen is at risk is false.\n\n-\u201cThat one is indeed a howler,\u201d said Michael E. Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State. Global oxygen concentrations \u201care maintained by long-term geological cycles and nothing here is going to alter that in any significant way.\u201d\n\n-\u201cIf climate change is left unchecked, the atmosphere could lose about a tenth of one percent of its oxygen content by the end of the century,\u201d said Jonathan Overpeck, professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s School for Environment and Sustainability. \u201cThere is no science behind the idea that we could lose half the world\u2019s oxygen. Instead, it\u2019s only a tiny amount. \u2026 One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about is oxygen levels in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\n-While burning fossil fuels does use up oxygen, it\u2019s a far smaller amount than Buttigieg suggests, said Texas A&M; University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. He calculated the figures and came up with at most a reduction of oxygen of about 2%, adding \u201cthis is an absolute upper limit. More reasonable estimates would be much, much smaller, probably less than a few tenths a percent. And this is if we burn everything.\u201d\n\n-Atmospheric scientist Scott Denning of Colorado State University has estimated that if oxygen production were to stop now, Earth would have 1 million years of oxygen left.\n\nSuch scientists see an urgent need to do more to address the emissions that are warming the climate and bringing profound change to life as billions know it. Depletion of atmospheric oxygen is not one of those changes.\n\n___\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE, proposing U.S. leadership on climate change: \u201cConvene those other top wealthy economies to make sure that this is our focus, to save the lungs of the planet that produce 6 percent of the oxygen that we breathe and to ensure that we do not trigger a crisis in the Amazon. Once it is set, we will never be able to roll back.\u201d - candidates\u2019 town hall on CNN.\n\nTHE FACTS: Lands of the Amazon are not \u201cthe lungs of the planet.\u201d That\u2019s a familiar phrase but not an accurate one.\n\nOxygen production comes primarily from ocean sediments, not forests, which indeed generate oxygen but also consume it.\n\n\u201cEven if all plants in the Amazon stopped doing photosynthesis, we would not notice,\u201d Jonathan Foley, executive director of Project Drawdown, a global climate solutions, told the AP. \u201cIt would take millions of years for the atmosphere to run out of oxygen.\u201d\n\nThe Amazon is key in draining heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Scientists also see grave consequences to nature and communities from fires in the rainforest. But Earth is not losing its lungs.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWho\u2019s got the world\u2019s cleanest and safest air and water? AMERICA!\u201d - tweet Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet - we\u2019ve now got that!\u201d - tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: False. Air quality hasn\u2019t improved under the Trump administration and dozens of nations have less smoggy air than the U.S.\n\nAs to water, Trump is correct that one measure, Yale University\u2019s global Environmental Performance Index, found the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water.\n\nBut after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. Over the past two years the U.S. had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier, federal data show.\n\nThere were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when the U.S had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980.\n\nThe Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days.\n\nThe nonprofit Health Effects Institute\u2019s State of Global Air 2019 report ranked the United States 37th dirtiest out of 195 countries for ozone, also known as smog. The U.S. ranks eighth cleanest on the more deadly category of fine particles in the air.\n\nOn environmental quality overall, the Yale index put the U.S. 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1.\n\n___\n\nGREEN NEW DEAL\n\nANDREW YANG: \u201cThey are right that we need to take urgent action, but the timeline that they put out there would do away with commercial air travel and a lot of other things in a particular time frame.\u201d - candidates\u2019 town hall on CNN.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s repeating a false claim spread by Trump that the Green New Deal would ban air travel. The plan, backed by some liberal Democrats but greeted cautiously or opposed by others in the party, calls for a drastic drop in greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.\n\nThe claim extrapolates from a fact sheet that was initially distributed by the office of Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in February, then disavowed by her and replaced with a more accurate summary of the plan.\n\nThe first version described measures beyond those contained in the plan, such as: \u201cBuild out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\u201d And it made the impolitic statement: \u201cWe set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman at the time, Corbin Trent, said that was meant as a quip.\n\n___\n\nWAR\n\nJOE BIDEN, Democratic presidential candidate, on the Iraq war: \u201cImmediately, that moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment.\u201d - interview Tuesday with NPR.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not so. As a senator in 2002, Biden had voted to give President George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq, which he did in March 2003 as part of a \u201cshock and awe\u201d bombing campaign with some coalition allies. While he gave mixed signals at times by acknowledging some frustration with the handling of the war, Biden still said four months later he would vote the same way on Iraq.\n\n\u201cNine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force, and I would vote that way again today,\u201d Biden told the Brookings Institution.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2005 that he came around to calling the war a mistake, blaming Bush because \u201cwe went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.\u201d\n\n___\n\nECONOMY AND TRADE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cChina has now had the worst year that they\u2019ve had in 57 years. This is the worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years. And they want to make a deal.\u201d - speaking to reporters Wednesday in Hurricane Dorian briefing.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cChina wants very much to make a deal. We\u2019ll see. They had the worst year in over 50.\u201d - remarks Wednesday at announcement of state opioid response grants.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not even close.\n\nIt\u2019s true that China\u2019s economy is decelerating, slowed by Trump\u2019s taxes on Chinese imports and by Beijing\u2019s deliberate campaign to combat runaway debts. The International Monetary Fund expects the Chinese economy to grow 6.2% this year. Though much faster than the U.S., that\u2019s the slowest in a long time for China - since 1990, or 29 years, in fact.\n\nBut it\u2019s a fantasy to suggest the Chinese economy is the worst in a half century or more. In 1962, 57 years ago, the country was an impoverished wasteland recovering from the massive famine caused by Mao Zedong\u2019s radical economic policies.\n\nThe economy would also plummet during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Since adopting economic reforms in the late 1970s, China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, established a growing middle class and vaulted over Japan to become the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken 10 cents in from China. If you look back over the years, it\u2019s been the other way around. They\u2019ve taken from us; we never take from them. Now we\u2019re taking from them.\u201d - remarks Wednesday in briefing on Hurricane Dorian.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s false to say the U.S. never collected a dime in tariffs on Chinese goods before Trump took action; they are simply higher in some cases than they were before. He\u2019s also wrong to suggest that Americans aren\u2019t paying in any way for the tariffs.\n\nAs he escalates a trade war with China, Trump refuses to recognize a reality that his own chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has acknowledged. Tariffs are mainly, if not entirely, paid by companies and consumers in the country that imposes them.\n\nIn a study in May, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with Princeton and Columbia universities, estimated that tariffs from Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China were costing $831 per U.S. household on an annual basis, before tariffs were recently escalated. Analysts also found that the burden of Trump\u2019s tariffs falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imported products.\n\nA report last month by JPMorgan Chase estimated that tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 per year if tariffs on an additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China proceed in September and December. Trump has since bumped up the scheduled levies even higher, probably adding to the U.S. burden. To be sure, China is feeling the economic hit, too.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cGermany, and so many other countries, have negative interest rates, \u2018they get paid for loaning money,\u2019 and our Federal Reserve fails to act! Remember, these are also our weak currency competitors!\u201d - tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump once again misrepresents the impact of Federal Reserve policies and is mistaken about Germany\u2019s economy, suggesting that it enjoys some kind of advantage. In fact, negative yields are a sign of that economy\u2019s weakness.\n\nThe German economy shrank in the previous quarter and there are expectations from investment banks that it could soon fall into a recession. Nor is the phenomenon isolated to Germany. Japan and much of Europe are also struggling with interest rates on government debt that are negative or close to negative.\n\nInvestors are betting that stimulus efforts by the European Central Bank will keep rates persistently low. But the negative interest rates on German bonds also reflect that government\u2019s aversion to issuing debt, even though the borrowing would allow it to spend more on roads and bridges to spur stronger economic growth.\n\nBy having even slightly positive interest rates compared with the rest of the world, the United States is in a better position to attract global investment.\n\n___\n\nJAMES COMEY\n\nTRUMP: \u201cBased on the IG Report, the whole Witch Hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal SCAM. The House of Representatives should now get back to work on drug prices, healthcare, infrastructure and all else. The Mueller Report showed No Collusion, No Obstruction!\u201d - tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is presumably referring to a recent Justice Department inspector general report that criticized former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of memos about his interactions with the president. But the report passed zero judgment on the investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia, a probe Comey that led until his May 2017 firing and that Trump has repeatedly derided as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d It did not criticize the FBI for opening the investigation or suggest in any way that it was a \u201cgiant and illegal SCAM.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s also wrong about the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. It did not find evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but that\u2019s not the same thing as \u201cNo Collusion.\u201d The report also found instances in which the president sought to obstruct the investigation but said that Justice Department legal protocol prohibits the indictment of a sitting president.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Science took a beating in the political arena as President Donald Trump sowed confusion about Hurricane Dorian's path and Democratic presidential candidates rang false alarms about the air we breathe and a looming point of no return on the climate.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Calvin Woodward", "Hope Yen", "Seth Borenstein"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/trump_07754_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
