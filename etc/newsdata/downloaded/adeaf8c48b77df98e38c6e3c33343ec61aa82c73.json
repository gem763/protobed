Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe ecommerce titan announced a dizzying 15 new hardware products across its range of brands, most of which are aimed at offering consumers new or simpler ways of interacting with Alexa. As Amazon looks to further embed its AI assistant into consumers' everyday lives, it's changing its approach to the space and moving into parts of the smart home market where it had declined to venture in the past.\n\nHere are a few of Amazon's new devices we think are most emblematic of its shifting strategy:\n\nThe new Echo Studio is Amazon's first smart speaker featuring premium audio. The $199 device includes microphones to listen for a user's commands to Alexa, as well as technology that analyzes a room and optimizes music output for the space it's being used. The new smart speaker looks directly aimed at winning over consumers who might consider competitors' devices like the Apple HomePod, Google Home Max, or still-unreleased Samsung Galaxy Home, while undercutting all of them on price.\n\nAmazon also announced Echo Buds, a pair of Alexa-enabled wireless in-ear headphones. The Bluetooth earbuds will tether to a smartphone and include microphones that are always listening for the Alexa wake word so that users will have access to the assistant on the go; they'll also be able to use the headphones to access their phones' built-in AI assistant via hardware buttons. Amazon's answer to Apple's popular AirPods will sell for $129, include Bose technology for noise-cancelling, and look set to offer a marked improvement over Alexa earbuds from third parties like Jabra.\n\nIt's also releasing a new, slightly tweaked variant of its popular Echo Dot mini smart speaker that includes an LED display across the fabric-covered exterior of the device. This new version will sell for $59 \u2014 just $10 more than the regular Echo Dot \u2014 and addresses a part of the market where third parties have stepped in to offer Alexa-enabled devices with built-in clocks for those who don't want something like the Echo Show 5 on their nightstand.\n\nExpanding the breadth of its Echo lineup to more directly challenge its main competitors in the space highlights a shift in Amazon's approach to the market for Alexa-enabled devices. Previously, to have Alexa on the go via headphones or included in a premium audio device, consumers needed to turn to one of Amazon's partners. Now, they can turn directly to Amazon \u2014 the company they associate with Alexa \u2014 to get nearly any device incorporating the AI assistant that they want, rather than having to wade through third-party offerings.\n\nThis shift will likely boost adoption of Alexa-enabled devices, as across the board they'll have the well-known Amazon brand behind them. Smart speakers are in more than half of US households, according to primary research from Business Insider Intelligence using the Attest Consumer Growth Platform, and those who own them are buying additional devices as they spread throughout the home, to the point that over half of smart speaker households own multiple devices. Amazon's range of devices should help to drive adoption of Alexa even more in the coming years.", "description": "Amazon is vastly expanding the breadth of its Echo lineup, highlighting a shift in its approach to the market for Alexa-enabled devices.", "authors": ["Hirsh Chitkara"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cb97e2e22af5602553665-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
