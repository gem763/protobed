The current leaders of the race to create 5G networks \u2014 American companies who fund and do the research and development, implement the inventions, and broadly license the use of those inventions \u2014 create the conditions by which technical specifications are adopted to become standards by which the future is shaped.\n\nUnfortunately, a court in California is taking actions based on a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that will harm American leadership in 5G. On May 21, a federal judge in California ruled in FTC v. Qualcomm that the practices leading wireless chipmaker Qualcomm uses to license its patented technologies to cellular device manufacturers are not allowed under federal antitrust laws. The judge then ordered Qualcomm immediately to dramatically transform its core business model, and further set the stage for the company to fork over large damages. While an appeals court has temporarily stayed the trial court decision, pending consideration of the appeal, the ruling, if left in place, raises significant national security concerns for the United States in this time of rapid technological transformation and growing cybersecurity threats.\n\nFor decades, the United States Government and American companies have been the global leader in R&D. Qualcomm alone has invested tens of billions of dollars in developing key new communications technologies, and is the U.S. company making the most significant investments in 5G foundational R&D. Qualcomm licenses the fruits of its R&D to device manufacturers for use in new products. In turn, the broad licensing contributes to the development and adoption of industry-wide, international standards. By requiring the company to abandon this business model, the ruling jeopardizes Qualcomm\u2019s ability to continue making these R&D investments and therefore undermines America\u2019s continued R&D leadership in essential technologies like 5G. Contrast that model with the Chinese approach, through Huawei, to become the dominant end to end provider of mobile communications through its physical network infrastructure and devices. In the absence of alternatives, China (and Huawei) would have a significant advantage in its ability to pressure industry to adopt and build upon its \u201cde-facto\u201d standard. American leadership \u2014 and Qualcomm\u2019s vitality in particular \u2014 therefore is important not just for the economy, but also for national security.\n\nAccordingly, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) argued in a recent filing in the case that unless the court\u2019s injunction is stayed, it \u201ccould put our nation\u2019s security at risk.\u201d Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen M. Lord agreed. In her statement accompanying the DOJ filing, Lord explained that \u201cany measure that inappropriately limits Qualcomm\u2019s technological leadership, ability to invest in research and development (R&D), and market competitiveness, even in the short-term, could harm national security.\u201d Under Secretary Lord concluded that a weakened Qualcomm \u201cpresents a serious threat to DoD\u2019s extensive networks, advanced telecommunications systems, and ultimately its ability to control the battlespace.\u201d\n\nFurther, as Department of Energy Chief Information Officer Max Everett noted in a statement submitted in the case, \u201cQualcomm plays a central role in the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and supply chain, specifically in regard to its important role in the setting of international 5G standards and the supply of 5G chipsets that drive mobile devices.\u201d\n\nIt is vital that Qualcomm remain a leader in this space because, Under Secretary Lord explained, \u201c5G technologies have significant military value, and will be foundational for new military capabilities, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and a number of advanced sensing devices.\u201d Because the race to set standards for 5G is \u201ca zero-sum game,\u201d without Qualcomm\u2019s leadership, it is likely that Chinese companies \u2014 and Huawei in particular \u2014 will gain ground. The national security concerns associated with Huawei and other Chinese companies have been well documented. A 5G landscape dominated by Chinese companies \u2014 and therefore the Chinese government \u2014 would require future U.S. defense infrastructure to operate on a network over which China has substantial control.\n\nThese concerns, while serious, are not new. In early 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d), a federal committee within the Treasury Department that reviews transactions involving foreign investment in American businesses, blocked an attempted takeover of Qualcomm based on similar concerns. It concluded that a \u201c[r]eduction in Qualcomm\u2019s long-term technological competitiveness and influence in standard setting would significantly impact U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nGiven the grave national concerns raised by the Departments of Justice, Defense, and Energy, as well as CFIUS, a decision to undermine Qualcomm\u2019s business model should not be made lightly. With the rollout of 5G continuing, this is a critical moment for the future of our telecommunications infrastructure, and the decisions we make now cannot be undone. Our adversaries pose an existential threat to the security of American networks, and we should not undermine our ability to face this threat by sidelining an essential American asset.\n\nWilliam J. \u201cJim\u201d Haynes was General Counsel of the Department of Defense under President George W.
