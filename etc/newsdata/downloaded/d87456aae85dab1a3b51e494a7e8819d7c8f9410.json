Popular brands such as More Than, Churchill, Axa and Esure were among some of the worst offenders\n\nLaurent Matras, executive managing director of Axa Retail, also said insurers are charging more in this situation due to past claims data.\n\n'Customers who arrange insurance at short notice tend to have more claims and more expensive claims than others,' he said.\n\n'This additional cost gets reflected in prices.'\n\nA Churchill spokesperson offered a similar explanation: 'Analysis shows us that customers who purchase insurance cover closer to the start date of a policy are more likely to make a claim, therefore, their risk will be reflected in their calculated premium.'\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for trade body the Association of British Insurers said: 'Individual insurers will set their own premiums, taking into account a wide range of factors, including any evidence they may have that someone seeking cover to start immediately may be at greater risk of making a claim.'\n\nHowever, if this is true it doesn't explain why on other types of cover, such as home insurance, only around half of providers see it as necessary to add the extra charge.\n\nBrian Brown, head of general insurance insight at Defaqto, said: 'It's clear that insurers amend pricing on this basis because they know that as you get closer to renewal or purchase time you have less time and inclination to shop around.\n\n'It's hard to see there being any reason for this price discrepancy other than the insurers charging more for customers who are \"desperate\" for cover. Insurers take advantage of customers by increasing premiums the closer you get to the renewal or start date.'\n\nDoes the regulator know this is going on?\n\nThe city watchdog is currently in the middle of trying to sort out a different insurance pricing practice known as 'dual pricing'.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority recently launched a crackdown on companies stinging loyal car and home insurance customers for \u00a31.2billion a year by using this practice.\n\nIn an interim report published this month it found that while new customers are often offered insurance policies at a discount, those who renew see their premiums go up, penalising customers who are less likely to switch.\n\nThis practice has become known as the 'loyalty penalty' in the press, and following years of pressure from This is Money and others the watchdog has now put forward potential reforms with the aim of delivering a final report next year.\n\nBut the regulator's recent interim report makes no mention of price hikes for those who have no option but to buy in a hurry.\n\n\n\n'I don't think the FCA are aware this is happening,' the industry source told This is Money.\n\n'It's sort of like the reverse of dual pricing but it's a part of it \u2013 instead of ripping people off when they renew, they're taking advantage of them at the start, because they have to buy on that day.'\n\nThe FCA is currently trying to sort out a similar insurance scandal known as 'dual pricing'\n\nAfter This is Money presented its findings to the FCA, a spokesperson for the watchdog replied: 'We do not have major concerns when a firm prices insurance based on information which is clearly linked to the probability and size of claims or to fraud.\n\n'However, we do have concerns if other factors come into play and are taking steps to ensure that insurance firms put fair value and treatment of customers at the centre of their pricing practices.\n\n'Alongside we have a programme of supervisory and enforcement work to ensure that firms comply with existing rules and principles and we will not hesitate to intervene where they are not.'\n\nThe FCA did not respond to questions over whether this practice would be examined as part of its wider report on dual pricing, which is due to be released early next year.\n\nAll the insurers quoted in this article were asked if they intended to change this practice in light of the FCA's potential dual pricing ban, but none of them responded specifically to this question.", "description": "Insurers are penalising customers who need to purchase insurance at the last minute, sometimes to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year, an investigation can reveal.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
