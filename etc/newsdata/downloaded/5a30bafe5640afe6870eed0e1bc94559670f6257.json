When you're trying to move, you can't play because an injury or whatever else can scupper everything.\n\n'I wanted to leave so it was normal for me to not be on the pitch. Beyond that, it's the manager's decision. He's the one who decides what's best for the group.\n\n'Like I've said, the season is long so we'll try and be better going forward and for what comes next. That desire to leave, I think it's a bit normal. I'm an important player of the national team. I'm not 20 anymore and I need to play, to be happy.\n\n'There are situations that mean you need to make a decision. I'm a big boy and a dad, so there are choices that are good for me and my family.'\n\nInstead, it was Kieran Trippier who left north London for Atletico Madrid, which has boosted Aurier's appearances and made him a more important part of the team.\n\nDespite that, Aurier is still not sure what the future holds and admits - despite his current focus - any exit depends on Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nKieran Trippier's exit to Atletico Madrid has opened the door for Aurier to play more football\n\nThe Ivorian says any potential exit in the coming months is down to boss Mauricio Pochettino\n\n'I'm not the only one who decides. Today, the window is closed so I'm focusing on my club and we'll see what happens later.\n\n'I'm not disappointed to have stayed because that will allow me to surpass myself, to have a very good season and we'll see.\n\n'The boss has the last word and here the boss is the manager.'", "description": "The Ivorian full-back made just eight Premier League appearances last season, resulting in him pushing for an exit over the summer transfer window.
