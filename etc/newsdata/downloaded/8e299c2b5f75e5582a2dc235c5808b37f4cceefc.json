And that\u2019s not just because of better sensors or new software tricks \u2014 phones like the iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ literally have multiple lenses to choose from, giving you options when capturing an image the way you want it.\n\nThe newest addition to today\u2019s smartphones, the all-encompassing ultrawide lens, can be intimidating to learn how to use. Sure, you\u2019re no doubt ready to snap shots of the first skyscraper, mountain peak, or perfect sunset you find. But before you run off filling up your phone with warped subjects, noisy backgrounds, or random detritus, here are a few pointers from pro photographers to keep in mind while you point and shoot with a wide-angle lens.\n\nGet Those Edges Together, Girl\n\nIf you\u2019ve already snapped a few ultrawide shots, there\u2019s probably one thing you\u2019ve noticed right off the bat: All that crud around your photo\u2019s edges. Don\u2019t lament when you can simply adjust. \u201cBe really careful about what is in the edge of the frame, because it will always be distorted,\u201d says Tyler Stalman, who runs a photo and video production company with his wife, Ania Boniecka. Whether it\u2019s street lights, innocent bystanders, or your own two feet, not accounting for all those formerly hidden obstructions can quickly rob your image of its intended impact.\n\nPut Your Subject Front and Center\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good off-center image? No one, that\u2019s who. Unfortunately, ultrawide shots don\u2019t quite play well with subjects that aren\u2019t centered, and can leave them looking a little too lanky for comfort. On a smartphone like the iPhone 11, that 120-degree ultrawide lens will suffer from that same off-center issue. \u201c\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Unless you\u2019re deliberately shooting at weird angles to capture a certain perspective, keeping your distance from your subject is your best bet for images that are truly in focus. \u201cIf your subject comes closer than about 1 meter from the camera you might not only end up with some exaggerated wide angle distortion, but they might go out of focus too,\u201d Stalman says.\n\nArchitecture Is Your Friend\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing ultrawide lenses are good at, it\u2019s really nailing the imposing nature of any architectural marvel (or even your ho-hum office building). \u201cTry to capture and portray the height of a building or the spaciousness of the interior,\u201d says Smashpop. \u201cSince the scene is wide, humans tend to look smaller in these shots. Take advantage of that by getting someone to casually walk or pose in the photo to create the \u2018minimal people\u2019 effect with the surroundings of spacious architecture or interior.\u201d\n\nNight Shooting Is a No-No\n\nSmartphones like the iPhone 11 and Samsung Galaxy S10 have incorporated \u201cnight mode\u201d photography into their camera capabilities, letting you get vastly improved images in low-light situations by holding your phone still for an extra second or three. But unlike the traditional wide angle on the iPhone 11, Night Mode shooting is a no-go on the ultrawide lens. \u201cThe ultrawide lens has an aperture of f/2.4, hence is it not a very bright lens,\u201d says Smashpop (the lower a lenses\u2019 aperture number, the more light they can let in, brightening up your low-light shots). \u201cTry to limit the usage of the ultrawide to daytime or at brightly lit locations.\u201d Compared to the wide angle lens and its f/1.8 aperture, that ultrawide lens won\u2019t help you much when the sun goes down.\n\nPanorama Shots are Even Wider\n\nIf you want to capture the majesty of that forest landscape you\u2019re staring at, or need to show your friends just how, uh, huge, your new college dorm room is, you can\u2019t go wrong with a panoramic shot. Still not enough image for your liking? \u201cNow we can include more into every panorama shot when we swipe across the scenery using the iPhone,\u201d says Smashpop. Perfect! That ultrawide lens, paired with your smartphone\u2019s Panorama shooting mode, can make for some incredibly encompassing images. Just be sure to keep yourself steady, and aligned with the image guides, or else you\u2019ll have to contend with some choppy-looking sections of your ultrawide panorama shot.\n\nLook for Lines\n\nSince the ultrawide lens on the iPhone 11 gives you a wide field of view, and your photo a slightly warped look, you can use that to your advantage during composition. Any straight lines in your scene can become critical elements if you know how to capture them properly. \u201cWe can use lines in our scenes to create a warp illusion, or leading lines which guides the audience\u2019s eyes to the subject,\u201d says Jason. \u201cTilt the phone so that straight lines are curved to create dramatic scenes or simple just align the camera to grids, fences, or brick walls to use those lines to your advantage.\u201d\n\nWrite to Patrick Lucas Austin at patrick.austin@time.com.", "description": "Here's how to make your iPhone or Galaxy ultrawide photos look stunning.", "authors": ["Patrick Lucas Austin"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ultrawide-photo-tips.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
