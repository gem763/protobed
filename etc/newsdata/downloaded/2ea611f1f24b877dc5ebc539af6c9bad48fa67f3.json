As the saying goes, the remedy for bad speech is more speech.\n\nThose who want to purge \u201cmisinformation\u201d from social media should learn from this incident. Mr. Silver is smart, thoughtful and well-educated. He\u2019s an active participant in policy debates and has every reason to be familiar with the First Amendment. And the First Amendment isn\u2019t an obscure area of law. Most Americans are broadly aware of it; it is constantly discussed and in the news and throughout the education system; it is foundational to our democracy. How can someone like Mr. Silver confidently misstate such a familiar part of U.S. law?\n\nMore to the point, if someone whose full-time job is to analyze politics and policy can get the First Amendment wrong, how can anyone be expected to understand more-complex policy issues\u2014housing, banking, health care, technology, trade, national security?", "description": "", "authors": ["Gus Hurwitz", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
