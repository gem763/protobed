Morgan and Morgan Stanley for its IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe company, which was valued at about $1.5 billion in a financing round last year, is expected to file its prospectus publicly by the first quarter of 2020 and possibly sooner, said the people, who asked not to be named because the plans are confidential. Representatives from One Medical, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley all declined to comment.\n\nShould One Medical make it out successfully, it will join a growing class of health-technology companies to test the public markets, though Wall Street hasn't show much enthusiasm for the category of late. Livongo, a chronic disease management company, has plunged 27% since it started trading in July, and Health Catalyst, a data and analytics company, is up just 9% from its initial price. Progyny, a fertility benefits provider, just filed for its IPO.\n\nThe challenge for One Medical is that hospitals and medical clinics don't get a high multiple from public investors because profit margins are thin and they largely rely on insurance reimbursements. But One Medical has Silicon Valley DNA in the company that can help to differentiate its story. The San Francisco-based company is backed by Alphabet's GV venture arm and venture capital firm Benchmark, and secondary share sales have recently valued the company at over $2 billion.\n\nBut public markets have provided a reality check to other companies that claim to have a technological advantage. Uber and Lyft have struggled since their debuts earlier this year amid hefty losses and WeWork had to withdraw its IPO filing.", "description": "Having built a network of over 70 medical clinics, One Medical is getting set to tell its story to Wall Street.", "authors": ["Christina Farr Alex Sherman", "Christina Farr", "Alex Sherman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104594276-Unknown.jpeg?v=1500424015", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
