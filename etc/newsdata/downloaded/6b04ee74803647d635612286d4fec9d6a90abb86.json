After reviewing the incident, the referee awarded Scotland a second penalty try and Fidow was sent off for his second yellow.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sam Warbuton: Wales aiming for World Cup final Replay More Videos ...

Whichever team finishes second will likely play reigning champion New Zealand with the top side facing South Africa.\n\n\"We were all delighted to get that bonus point,\" said head coach Townsend.\n\n\"It means we're still in this World Cup. We have two games to go and if we play like we did tonight and can improve a couple more aspects, we'll very much be in this World Cup.\"\n\nAs for Samoa, the result is a disappointment following an opening 34-9 victory over Russia. The Pacific Islanders became the first side to fail to score a point in a game this tournament, while poor discipline also continued to be a problem.\n\nSamoa played today without center Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu'u who both were handed three-match bans for dangerous tackles against Russia. Fidow's two yellow cards against Scotland all but extinguished hopes of a comeback in Kobe, meaning chances of progressing out the group rest on victories against Japan and Ireland.", "description": "Scotland set up a thrilling finale to Group A in the Rugby World Cup after a convincing 34-0 victory over Samoa in Kobe.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190930130607-sean-maitland-scotland-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
