That makes it a key target for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s bid to sell off state assets.\n\n\u201cA proposal to divest the state\u2019s 63.8% holding has been submitted to the cabinet which will decide later this month,\u201d said a ministry of shipping official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak with the media. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a wider move to privatize a number of state assets.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSCI operates close to a third of all Indian waterborne tonnage, with five very large crude carriers and 29 smaller crude tankers, product tankers and gas carriers. Its fleet also includes dry bulk carriers, container ships and ferries.\n\nThe government first tried to sell its stake in 2017 but the sale was canceled after pushback by various bodies, including the ministry of shipping. Privatizations in India are often complicated, with a number of senior politicians standing steadfast against the sale of what they describe as vital national assets.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s government has been pushing to sell government stakes in dozens of Central Public-Sector Enterprises or Undertakings, CPSEs, as part of what it calls \u201cinvestor-friendly reform\u201d across many parts of the economy including railways, shipping, banking, mining, petrochemicals and airlines.\n\nAlthough many economists believe the majority of India\u2019s more than 300 CPSEs can be privatized, public-sector jobs are highly sought-after in India because they offer relatively secure employment and better-than-average salaries and working conditions.\n\nIn a 2018 jobs competition, around 25 million people applied for 90,000 positions at the country\u2019s giant state-run railways, according to government data.\n\nThe Mumbai-based Shipping Corp. of India, which is listed on the local bourse, has a market value of around $290 million. Apart from ships it also owns premium property in Mumbai, including its 19-storey headquarters.\n\nOpponents of the sale say a good part of India\u2019s vital oil imports move on SCI ships and selling the carrier could rattle oil supplies.\n\nCompany executives say the biggest hurdle to the sale will be trying to sell a company with so many ship types, however. Private-sector operators may view such spread across various markets as inefficient.\n\n\u201cThere are few shipping operators or other investors that are looking to invest in so many ship types,\u201d the shipping ministry executive said. \u201cIt could be broken up and then sold, but this will take years and face a lot of opposition.\u201d\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "The Indian government is again looking to sell its majority stake in the country\u2019s biggest shipping company, but may face the same headwinds that have blocked past privatization efforts.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114839/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
