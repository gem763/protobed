They are used to getting what they want and like spoiled brats, have learned that tantrums work.\n\nShould Donald Trump prevail in his bid for a second term, the left will go insane, deploying every \u201cinsurance policy\u201d weapon at their disposal to negate four more years of the Orange Man. What Obama, Comey, and Brennan et al. did to Trump in his first term will seem mild in comparison to what the left is planning should he win.\n\nAntifa, the military arm of the Democratic Party, has not spent the last three years practicing and organizing merely to sit on the sidelines. They have used the interregnum to mobilize and learn tactics, while probing to find what government will allow, media will trumpet, and the public will endure.\n\nThe skirling \u201cresistance\u201d has morphed from pajama-boy blobs of perpetually offended little dictators and pussy-hat sporting shriekers into balaclava-wearing avengers who crave the opportunity to put deplorables in their place and give them the government they deserve good and hard. They will flood the streets after a Trump victory in their Antifa costumes looking to bust the heads of anyone near enough to become part of their 15 minutes of YouTube fame.\n\nIt will start in the cities -- the Democrat-run cities, of course -- where the political leadership will provide them a measure of protection against identification and arrest. Seattle, Portland, LA, San Francisco, NYC, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, and Baltimore, among others, will become flashpoints of unrest.\n\nThe riots will be portrayed by the media and the Democrats as a groundswell of support for deposing a racist president. They will bemoan the necessity of the violence, destruction, and loss of life, but remind Americans that \u201cthe people have spoken.\u201d Some among the Antifa will be championed. In lockstep, both the New York Times and the Washington Post will run headlines calling them: \u201cThe New Founding Fathers.\u201d People who fight back will quickly grow in number -- even as the media label them \u201cwhite supremacists.\u201d Blood will be spilled.\n\nChina, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela will plead for calm and offer to mediate the evolving humanitarian crisis\u2026\n\nTrump Loses\n\nThe right will never believe the Democrats didn\u2019t cheat their way to victory; in addition to understanding that a Democratic President will undemocratically implement policies by executive order that are inimical to their interests and desires.\n\nMany on the right are weary of leaders who prioritize good press over good policy, and who prefer losing gracefully over winning ugly. They believe they did build that and that they have not yet made enough money and are fed up with being portrayed as ignorant and evil just because of political disagreements. Eight years of Obama and three years of watching his slow-motion coup have made them angry.\n\nTone-deaf to this silent majority and emboldened by victory, the new president will borrow Barry\u2019s \u201cpen and phone\u201d and start issuing executive orders throwing open our borders, banning fossil fuels, and of course, implementing \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control. Buoyed by media, the new president will start with universal background checks and a gun registry.\n\nEventually, the president will overreach, signing an order for gun confiscation, euphemistically called, \u201cmandatory buybacks.\u201d Antifa and their ilk will flood the streets in support of seizing these \u201cweapons of war.\u201d Media will declare, \u201cIt\u2019s the will of the people.\u201d\n\nAnd for the right, that will be the last straw (plastic or paper).\n\nThe left doesn\u2019t understand that every gun owner is a single-issue-voter; millions will refuse to give up their guns. And, many gun owners in this country will not go \u201cmeekly into the night,\u201d there will be \u201crage\u201d against what they will see as a usurpation of their constitutional rights.\n\nConfiscation will go well at first, with gun owners in the cities acquiescing to the knock on the door in the middle of the night and the intimidation of, \u201cPapers please.\u201d\n\nBut in flyover country, a different scenario will play out. Most gun owners will hide their weapons and most local police departments will accept that, not wanting to jail their neighbors. Resistance will be broad, perhaps encompassing hundreds of millions of Americans. Barack Obama, for once in the dismal history of his efforts to kill the America we love, will be proven correct. Americans do \u201ccling to their guns.\u201d\n\nThe media will call it \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d but a still unregulated internet will be rife with videos of an out of control government battling its own citizens.\n\nThe president will call for mobilizing the National Guard. Some governors will refuse, and army units now overseas will be sent home to deal with the growing unrest. Mistakes will be made and there will be gunfire in the streets; people will die on both sides. The president will desperately call for martial law.\n\nMany Army, National Guard, and police will defect, or desert, or simply refuse orders.\n\nWhat will happen after that is anybody's guess.\n\nPlease follow William L.
