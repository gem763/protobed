Council's Evans probe", "language": "en", "text": "D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said Monday that the investigation into council member Jack Evans won\u2019t be complete for another month because some witnesses have refused to comply with subpoenas.\n\n\u201cIt is my intent that the investigation be completed as quickly as possible,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said at a press briefing. \u201cI am quite disturbed at the lack of cooperation.\u201d\n\nOf the six people who were served subpoenas, several of whom are clients of Mr. Evans\u2018 consulting firm, only one has cooperated in the council\u2019s investigation, said Mr. Mendelson, at-large Democrat. He added that Mr. Evans has not been subpoenaed, has been interviewed twice and appears to be cooperating.\n\nThe chairman in July hired the law firm of O\u2019Melveny & Myers to investigate whether Mr. Evans, Ward 2 Democrat, violated the council\u2019s code of conduct by using his position to benefit himself or clients of his firm, NSE Consulting.\n\nThe law firm originally had been scheduled to deliver its report to city lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, Mr. Mendelson said the council on Tuesday will pass a resolution that authorizes the filing of a D.C. Superior Court petition to compel witnesses to comply with their subpoenas or else be held in contempt of court.\n\nMr. Mendelson said the council\u2019s investigation does not interfere with that of the U.S. attorney for the District because it focuses solely on council conduct. He said there is no reason for witnesses not to cooperate with the council\u2019s probe. The investigation, he said, should be complete by mid-October, when the report also will be made public.\n\nThe chairman said he will announce at the Oct. 9 legislative meeting which council members will serve on the ad hoc committee to review the investigation\u2019s findings. Mr. Evans will be able respond to the investigation, he added.\n\nThe extension of the investigation does not affect the $250,000 contract with O\u2019Melveny & Myers to conduct the probe, Mr. Mendelson said.\n\n\u201cIf I were to have said to the law firm that is doing the investigation that it is OK to issue the report by what you\u2019ve got, I am sure that any conclusions in that investigation will be criticized and rightfully so,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the questions need to be answered or it needs to be clear that there aren\u2019t answers.\u201d\n\nMr. Evans declined a request for comment.\n\nBefore its summer recess, the council stripped Mr. Evans of his chairmanship of the Finance and Revenue Committee, after having reprimanded him over the findings of an investigation by the Metro Board of Directors.\n\nMr. Evans earlier had resigned his chairmanship of the Metro Board and as one of its D.C. representatives after the transit agency found that he had failed to disclose his business relationship with companies seeking to do contract work with Metro.\n\nThe District\u2019s longest-serving lawmaker, Mr. Evans is facing a grassroots effort to recall him and several challengers for his seat in next year\u2019s Democratic primary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
