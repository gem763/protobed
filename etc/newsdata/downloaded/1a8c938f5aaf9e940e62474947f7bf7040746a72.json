Jeremy Piper\n\n\u201cThe risk function can start to be seen as value-adding, because it is taking in all the data on the external and environmental factors, and can help (management and the front-line) see how those trends might impact both the current strategy, as well as its traditional role of risk mitigation.\u201d\n\nFellow roundtable participant Robb Eadie, BHP\u2019s global chief risk officer, said 20 years ago the role of the risk function \u201crevolved around stopping bad things happening\u201d. Now the risk function is \u201call about making good things happen\u201d, and that is primarily enabled by technology.\n\nThe role of technology in risk has also been greatly empowered by the realisation that risk resides at all levels of an organisation, and is not just handled centrally by a risk function, according to Jason Smith, board director at the Risk Management Institute of Australasia.\n\n\u201cRisk management has to be embedded not only in operational performance, but business planning and performance management, and really every function. Technology is accelerating this process.\u201d\n\nIf one looked at organisations\u2019 operational risk, said Mr Smith, there was \u201chuge opportunity\u201d to use tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\u201cThat is certainly an area where businesses can start to collect and collate and understand their operational data better, to understand the relationships between the operational data and the key risk indicators, and allow AI and machine learning to start to discern the trends and the relationships between them,\u201d he said.\n\nBoard director at the Risk Management Institute of Australasia, Jason Smith. Jeremy Piper\n\n\u201cHistorically, risk managers have tended to rely on what the historical loss events have been, and doing scenario analysis, and it's actually been very subjective and very backward-looking. Technology is now allowing organisations to be a bit more objective and predictive around what's happening with the operational risk profile of the organisation.\u201d\n\nBut a wonderful kitbag of tech tools did not guarantee great insights, said Mr Smout.\n\n\u201cA tech solution doesn't fix an inherent problem that an organisation has, culturally, with its attitude to, and appetite for, risk. You can have the best governance, risk and compliance (GRC) platform or system, for example, but if you don't have the right people, processes, and quality of input data, you can't use it.\n\nIntuitive interpretation of data still important\n\n\u201cThe value in such a platform comes when you start to get the business actually inputting the data into it, owning it, and keeping it up to date. Otherwise, the platform is viewed as not having worked, it gets written off,\u201d Mr Smout said.\n\n\u201cBut if it is \u2018owned\u2019 by the business, that\u2019s where you get the value in good risk management.\u201d\n\nMr Smith agreed and said, \u201cOften, it's not so much that the system doesn't work, it's that the system doesn\u2019t give the organisation the value it should.\n\n\u201cTaking the GRC system example further, if it\u2019s just used to allow the business to tick compliance boxes, it won\u2019t be giving them meaningful insights to allow them to be more predictive around the risk profile of the organisation.\u201d\n\nTo a large extent, the insights still come from humans \u2013 as do the risks.\n\n\u201cThe biggest risk you have in any organisation is the human being, because as an entity we are quite error-prone in comparison with the alternative, with the alternative being algorithmic machine-based data analysis,\u201d Mr Eadie said.\n\n\u201cBut on the other hand, the one thing that human beings are exceptionally good at is that element of insight \u2013 that intuitive interpretation of data. The factual algorithmic interpretation of data is very useful, but sometimes it can miss the subtle nuances that will be seen by people who have many years of experience, and in-depth knowledge and insight into specific areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThis factor is \u201cthe human in the loop,\u201d said Zoe Willis, KPMG Partner Data and RegTech.\n\n\u201cAs we see automated technologies advancing, the human element becomes more important. The \u2018human in the loop\u2019 is what actually provides the context,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd this is the true paradox of technology and data, says Anne O\u2019Driscoll, non-executive director at Steadfast Group. \u201cThe business processes themselves are being increasingly automated, and the risk processes and access to data and tools to interpret that data are increasingly prevalent.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is ensuring that you have people on the frontline and people in the risk function that have the experience,\u201d Ms O\u2019Driscoll said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that concerns me, seeing the degree to which we are automating these things, how we actually continue to ensure that people, as they grow through organisations, have that judgment that comes by intuition.\n\n\u201cUltimately, will people have the experience to say, \u2018Just because the machine says that, it still doesn't look right to me, based on my experience?\u2019 That\u2019s my concern,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "Technology is playing a major part in the evolving nature of organisational risk but the real value lies in its ability to empower people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3597%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_72%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7faef79cbc6d7a6792d05f8514157e674eee0020", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
