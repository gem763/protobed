Ilhan Omar (D-MN).\n\nFollowing the end of her call-in interview during Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of America First with Sebastian Gorka, Pirro continued her conversation with the former Trump aide while they were still being taped for Gorka\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cHey Jeanine, we\u2019re still live, the mics are live on YouTube,\u201d Gorka said, in a moment first reported by Media Matters for America. \u201cAre you doing any events in D.C. again? In the near future?\u201d\n\nPirro, meanwhile, went on to grouse about Fox News\u2019 restrictions on her, after telling Gorka she would need to see if the network would allow her do a live studio interview with him.\n\n\u201cYou know Fox reviews everything. They\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d she complained, prompting Gorka to ask if she had some flexibility due to her recent book release.\n\n\u201cNo. They\u2019re still saying you cannot do Bill O\u2019Reilly, you cannot do Newsmax,\u201d Pirro noted. \u201cYou know what, they suspended me. And I\u2019m not going to get fired. You know I\u2019m worried that that suspension was the basis to tee up for anything I do wrong, they\u2019ll fire me.\u201d\n\nWhile it was reported back in March that she was suspended after openly questioning Omar\u2019s loyalty to America because she is Muslim, this is the first time either Pirro or Fox News have publicly confirmed the suspension.\n\nAfter Pirro\u2019s show was bumped from the air for two weeks, a Fox News spokesperson declined to talk about any potential suspension, merely stating, \u201cWe are not commenting on internal scheduling matters.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, was absolutely livid over the sidelining of one of his most loyal media boosters, demanding that she be placed back on the air immediately.\n\nAfter she returned to the air, Pirro did not address the controversy, instead merely thanking her viewers for tuning in to her program.", "description": "\u201cYou know Fox reviews everything.
