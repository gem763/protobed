We have not been under the threat of a direct attack for decades, but our troops are killing and being killed all over the world in our name.

But here\u2019s what we know for certain: 1: Saudi Arabia should not determine \u201cunder what terms\u201d the United States enters into armed conflict. 2: President Trump lacks the authority to launch a military conflict without congressional approval. It\u2019s evident from this tweet that the president believes otherwise -- and, if left unrestrained, he could use this attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities to drag us into a disastrous war with Iran. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that Congress finally pass the Khanna-Gaetz amendment, which denies Trump funding for a war with Iran without congressional approval. The amendment has the support of the majority of the House and Senate. Its fate is in the hands of a small group of legislators putting together the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nJ Street Flyer\n\nThe above paragraphs are from a J Street email flyer to a friend of mine.\n\nJ Street is a nonprofit liberal advocacy group based in the United States whose stated aim is to promote American leadership to end the Arab\u2013Israeli and Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflicts peacefully and diplomatically.\n\nMy friend comments \"Jewish opinion is not monolithic and Netanyahu and his government are not Israel.\"\n\nIf there is proof or even strong evidence that Iran did this, then show it.", "description": "President trump is waiting for Saudi Arabia to tell us .09/17/2019 19:21:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/252/0f0f9ffd-20cd-41e6-a601-82b1a8679269.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
