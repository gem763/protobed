Although race has everything to do with the crisis, any split wouldn\u2019t be purely along racial lines.\n\nThe question on many people\u2019s minds is: \u201cWhat\u2019s the next move for the trio?\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by their erstwhile party\u2019s intransigence to contribute to enduring nationhood, the formidable trio will probably establish a new political home.\n\nThis could, however, be seen as fragmenting further an already fragmented and ineffectual opposition party landscape.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s anecdotal evidence of space and desire for an alternative political voice.\n\nA party led by the trio would not only transcend barriers imposed by race and class, but could be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nOtherwise our democratic experiment will be poorer for their political exile.\n\nLike impeachment, the power of the vote is, like Goliath\u2019s sword, kept in the temple, and not used but on great occasions.\n\nThe upcoming local elections in 2021 will be one such occasion.\n\nIn the end, it appears voters will have a lasting voice in the future of the DA as an official opposition party.\n\nVoters will have an opportunity to decide whether the race denialism of the DA, the incorrigible corruption of the ANC, the hypocrisy of the EFF and the United Democratic Movement, or the freshness and appeal of a Maimane-inspired party deserves their vote.\n\nAnd belated as it was, it is encouraging that Maimane realised that there are many things worth fighting for ... and the DA isn\u2019t one.\n\nKhaas is chairman of Corporate SA, a strategic advisory and consulting firm", "description": "The party\u2019s internecine political stands afford an opportunity for a new voice, writes Tebogo Khaas.", "authors": ["Tebogo Khaas"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9522/a24baf0c72984bef936170e2d203c533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
