But It Still Looks Bleak on the Men\u2019s Side.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Every year American men play at all four Grand Slam singles events, and every year American men lose. Andy Roddick was the last U.S. man to win a major title, 16 years ago in 2003. And everyone agrees that this drought will likely continue, with no stars on the horizon.\n\nIt\u2019s an annoying and frustrating problem, but there\u2019s a simple answer. Men\u2019s tennis needs someone like Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff.\n\n\u201cTo have a guy like Coco would be huge, and participation, my guess is, will go up,\u201d said Jose Higueras, a long-time coach who works with the U.S. Tennis Association Player Development team.\n\nBut while Gauff is buoying interest from all fans\u2014and maybe even persuading some teenage boys there is a path to stardom beyond more popular sports like basketball\u2014the USTA can\u2019t just wish a boy version of Coco into existence.\n\nIn America, there hasn\u2019t been a men\u2019s player who seems a sure bet since Roddick, who retired in 2012. There is one player, John Isner, who remains inside the top 15 on the ATP Tour (he is 34 years old). Sam Querrey, 31, is now No. 46. Frances Tiafoe, age 21, was at No. 29 earlier this year, the best of his career. But he has since fallen and is now at No. 45. Donald Young Jr. showed promise, but, at age 30, he has never been ranked higher than No. 38 (that was in 2012). Two other players\u2014Taylor Fritz, 21, and Reilly Opelka, 22\u2014have had some success, but they have accomplished little at the Slams.\n\n\u201cSome of these big guys have been struggling,\u201d John McEnroe said. \u201cThey\u2019re dangerous, but I don\u2019t think they could be winning majors. We\u2019re in a frustrating period that\u2019s continuing. Hopefully that will change sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nReilly Opelka reacts during a break in play against Dominik Koepfer during the second round of the U.S. Open.

There are fewer opportunities for young, athletically gifted American girls than boys, and nothing is as popular\u2014and possibly as remunerating\u2014as tennis. American women have dominated for decades, with Serena Williams at the top as she tries to win her 24th Grand Slam title.\n\nBut young American men have other options, such as basketball, hockey, baseball, football and soccer. In other countries, such as Serbia and Spain, tennis is among the most popular sports entertainment. In the United States, tennis communities might spread out too thin.\n\nThat\u2019s why Gauff matters so much. When she played at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Saturday night, she and her opponent Naomi Osaka sold out the event. For America, Gauff looks like the first true phenom since Venus and Serena Williams became stars after Serena won her first major title in 1999.\n\n\u201cI think [Gauff] is just incredibly talented,\u201d Serena Williams said. \u201cAnyone that\u2019s 15 playing like that, people are going to be drawn to them. I think that\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nAmerican men once ruled professional tennis. Since Richard Sears won a tournament in the 1880s, the country has been consistent. Arthur Ashe won the U.S. Open in 1968. Jimmy Connors, McEnroe and Michael Chang won major titles in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Jim Courier were dominant, with Sampras winning 14 major titles by 2002, a year before Roger Federer won his first. Roddick won just one Slam title, but there were other players ranked high, such as James Blake (No. 4 in 2006) and Mardy Fish (No. 7 in 2011). Both Isner and Querrey have reached major semifinals, but no one has matched Roddick\u2019s last final in 2009.\n\nSome complain that the USTA hasn\u2019t done enough to inspire young boys.\n\n\u201cThere is really no domestic pathway for competitive boys in tennis in America, either in college tennis or pro tennis,\u201d said Geoff Grant, a longtime tennis parent who recently completed two terms on the USTA\u2019s National Junior Competition Committee. \u201cIf you look at the last six or seven years, the level of participation in junior tennis in the United States has fallen off a cliff.\u201d\n\nMartin Blackman, the USTA\u2019s General Manager for Player Development, said another piece of the puzzle will start helping younger male players.\n\n\u201cWe want to start giving more comprehensive support to the boys at an earlier stage,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s a focus on the boys and men\u2019s side to start earlier.\u201d\n\nThe USTA can\u2019t be blamed entirely for the European takeover of men\u2019s tennis. That\u2019s mostly due to the unlikely simultaneous ascent of the three best players in the modern era. Since 2006, all 55 majors have been won by just seven men, from Europe and South America: Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka, Mart\u00edn del Potro and Marin Cilic. Combined, the Europeans Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have won 54 majors since 2003, a total that has never been reached by a trio in tennis history.\n\nJohn Isner, age 34, remains inside the top 15.

Opelka, who is 6-feet-11, wouldn\u2019t win Slam titles just by smashing a serve. But Opelka is more athletic and can run faster than most would expect.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the real deal,\u201d said coach Rick Macci, who has worked with Opelka. \u201cBut overall, young players need more of a package and the movement part. I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nFinding a male player like Gauff is not easy. Grant would like to see more American competitive opportunities so talented athletes don\u2019t need to travel internationally and can get more competition at higher levels. But more than anything, the American men need a spark.\n\n\u201cBasically, the men in the U.S. need someone like Coco,\u201d Patrick Mouratoglou, who coaches Gauff at times. \u201cYou need a guide.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s been 16 years since Andy Roddick won the U.S. Open.
