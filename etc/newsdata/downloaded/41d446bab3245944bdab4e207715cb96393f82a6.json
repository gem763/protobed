He was getting it going there,\u201d said Hodge.\n\nAway from the tropical north, cyclones are a rarity in Australia and Sydney-born Hodge said it was an \u201cinteresting experience\u201d listening to the typhoon whistle through the hotel\u2019s windows.\n\n\u201cJust a shout-out to everyone in Japan in the affected areas. Hopefully everyone\u2019s bunkered down well and remains as safe as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nAustralia are on track to play England in the quarter-finals, unless Wales slip up against emerging rugby nation Uruguay later on Saturday.\n\nThere will be fierce competition among the squad to claim a starting berth for the match in Oita next weekend, particularly among the back three.\n\n\u201cYou only had to see what Marika (Koroibete) did on the weekend with his opportunity there ... to know that we\u2019re in a good spot as a back three,\u201d said Hodge, referring to his winger team mate who conjured a breath-taking try against Georgia.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m back in the mix, hopefully we can kind of keep working as a unit and get the result this week.\u201d\n\nBeing sidelined was tough for Hodge, but it had given him plenty of time to work on his tackling technique.\n\n\u201cI learned my lesson that it is going to be quite harsh if you stray from that kind of goal so I\u2019ll definitely be trying to tackle low this weekend for sure,\u201d he said.", "description": "As karaoke singers, Australia\u2019s squad make fine rugby players, according to winger Reece Hodge, who would prefer to belt out the national anthem with his team mates during the World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
