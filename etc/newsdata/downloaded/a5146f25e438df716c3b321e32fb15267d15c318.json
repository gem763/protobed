His family had been growing tobacco for eight generations, but the market was withering. If he wanted to keep his farm profitable, he needed something new to grow.\n\nSo he helped pioneer Kentucky\u2019s hemp industry, a new crop the state was eager for farmers like him to try, and which showed promise as a high-profit alternative to tobacco. Hemp, he was told, could be used as fiber for clothing and textiles, as livestock feed, and to make an oil that\u2019s used in food supplements. Furnish became the state\u2019s first licensed hemp grower.\n\nA few years later, in the fall of 2017, he sent off samples of his crop for testing. When the results came back he discovered that for some reason \u2013 maybe there\u2019d been more rain than usual, or too much sun \u2014 five acres of his hemp fields had turned into marijuana. Since marijuana remains illegal both federally and in Kentucky, Furnish had to burn all five acres.\n\nBrian Furnish, an eighth generation farmer in Kentucky, has started growing hemp, which is a variety of cannabis with low levels of the chemical that causes smokers to get high. | M. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nAs Furnish knows firsthand, hemp and marijuana are versions of the same plant: cannabis. The only difference is that marijuana contains higher concentrations of a chemical called THC, which causes a psychoactive high when smoked or ingested. But since cannabis can be used for other purposes than to get high, the federal government has decided that cannabis that has only a small amount of THC, no more than 0.3 percent, is a different crop \u2014 hemp.\n\n\u201cThis whole industry is an experiment,\u201d Furnish said. \u201cWe\u2019re not marijuana people \u2026 we\u2019re hemp people trying to make a living.\u201d\n\nAll forms of cannabis used to be illegal to cultivate. But to help farmers like Furnish, Congress legalized production of hemp nationwide as part of the 2018 farm bill. In a declining farm economy, the crop offers a new source of income for farmers who are under siege because of the trade war with China, dropping commodity prices and a series of natural disasters. The potential economic boom is luring scores of agricultural novices.\n\nBut while legalizing hemp has provided new opportunities, it has also created new problems. One of them is that farmers need to keep a close eye on their crops to make sure that the THC level in their cannabis doesn\u2019t creep above 0.3 percent. Even in states where marijuana is legal for adult consumption, hemp farmers who accidentally grow marijuana can\u2019t just turn around and sell it to a dispensary to be smoked or ingested \u2014 THC levels for marijuana are typically much higher than what a hemp farmer would see, usually around 15 to 20 percent.\n\nMeasuring the THC level in growing plants is a delicate, high-stakes task. It\u2019s one of many issues that have popped up in the past year as the country grapples with how to grow and regulate this brand new crop. The Department of Agriculture is under pressure to overwrite a patchwork of state regulations on measuring THC by setting a national testing standard. USDA has yet to produce federal guidelines that will shape how the new commodity is grown and sold, though the department has said it plans to do so this fall, ahead of the 2020 growing season.\n\n\u201cWe all want one thing \u2014 that is an equal playing field,\u201d said Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is states pitting themselves against each other with different testing measures which may or may not accurately determine if hemp is marijuana or not.\u201d\n\nHemp proponents like Furnish try to keep a strict distinction between hemp and marijuana. But during the debate over the farm bill, proponents of legalized marijuana made clear that they saw them as connected, that legalizing hemp would be a step toward legalizing production of all varieties of cannabis. So far, that isn\u2019t happening \u2013 opponents of legalization in Congress still have the upper hand. It remains unclear how the growing popularity of hemp will factor into the debate over legalizing marijuana.\n\nBut on the ground across the country, the exploding number of hemp farmers and proliferation of products containing hemp oil are quickly normalizing consumption of cannabis products, potentially changing the political equation and complicating an already complex legal and policy debate around cannabis in all its forms.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of the first step to getting cannabis rescheduled,\u201d said Michael Boniello, managing director of Poseidon Investment Management, a cannabis investment firm. \u201cThe industry is just waiting to see how these guidelines are going to play out.\u201d\n\nWorkers on Furnish\u2019s farm hang tobacco leaves to dry in a barn. The declining profitability of tobacco encouraged Furnish to convert some of his acreage to hemp. | M. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nHEMP HAS A range of uses, but most farmers grow it to produce cannabidiol, or CBD \u2014 a compound that doesn\u2019t get you high. CBD is the key ingredient in trendy new products from lotions to gummy vitamins, and companies claim it can alleviate anxiety, pain and treat other health conditions. It\u2019s also trapped in a regulatory black hole at the Food and Drug Administration, which hasn\u2019t explained how it plans to regulate products containing the chemical.\n\nDespite that uncertainty, hemp harvests have exploded in just a few years. In 2014, the first year of Kentucky\u2019s program, farmers planted just 33 acres. This year, Kentucky approved the planting of an eye-popping 56,000 acres across the state.\n\nSky-high enthusiasm around hemp, which can bring in as much as $2,200 per acre, has helped farmers feel more comfortable about growing a plant related to marijuana, said Jeff Sharkey, a lobbyist in Florida on behalf of the medical marijuana and hemp industries. Farmers by nature are familiar with risk, and the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and endorsement of hemp by the farm bill, legislation widely known by producers, certainly helps, Sharkey added.\n\n\u201cThe stigma is slowly being eroded and hemp has certainly helped that out,\u201d Sharkey said. He pointed out that even \u201cvery conservative rural potato farmers\u201d are interested in growing hemp.\n\nHemp is hardy enough to grow in many climates and soils: Montana, Colorado and Oregon also rake in sizable hemp harvests, and many other states are experimenting with it.\n\n\u201cCertainly a lot of people see hope with this crop,\u201d said Laura Pottorff, a program coordinator at the Colorado Department of Agriculture, which has been managing a hemp program since 2014. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the gold rush mentality there.\u201d\n\nBecause the U.S. hemp industry is nascent, growers often need to import seeds from overseas, mainly from Canada and Europe, increasing the chances that they unknowingly grow a crop more like marijuana than hemp. That puts a farmer\u2019s entire crop on the line: Regulations in many states mandate that a harvest with high THC levels must be destroyed.\n\n\u201cTest early and test often,\u201d Erica Stark, executive director of the National Hemp Association, said she tells farmers. \u201cThat\u2019s where a farmer is going to risk failure. If they spike THC levels and their crop is destroyed, they\u2019ve lost thousands and thousands of dollars, and that can be devastating.\u201d\n\nFurnish examines some of the hemp produced at his farm in Kentucky. \u201cWe\u2019re not marijuana people,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re hemp people trying to make a living.\u201d | M. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nJay Noller, head of hemp research at Oregon State University, compared varying THC levels to the amount of sugar in fruit, which increases as crops like strawberries redden and ripen. Different varieties of hemp exhibit a range of THC levels, and those rise and fall with weather and other variables that can be hard to control. So growers can figure out only through trial-and-error which types of cannabis are riskier to grow, such as ones that contain \u201ccherry\u201d in the name, like \u201cCherry Wine\u201d and \u201cMaui\u2019s Cherry.\u201d But there\u2019s a Catch-22: Varieties that are high in THC also produce more CBD, the treasured, high-valued compound farmers covet.\n\n\u201cThe amount of THC varies today in any sort of hemp variety because we still don\u2019t have any U.S.-bred stable varieties,\u201d Noller said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at 15, in some cases 25 years, before you have something that\u2019s actually assuredly stable.\u201d\n\nHemp farmers are risking more than a failed crop and lost cash if their plants test \u201chot.\u201d They could also get into legal trouble. A Minnesota farmer in June was charged with two felonies after his crop was seized by authorities and tested at THC levels of 3 percent \u2014 10 times the legal threshold for hemp.\n\nThose consequences extend beyond hemp farmers; law enforcement officers have struggled to figure out just what is marijuana and what isn\u2019t. A truck driver transporting hemp in January from Oregon to be processed in Colorado was arrested and charged with drug trafficking at a weigh station in Idaho. The case made its way to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit as lawyers for the hemp processor, Big Sky Scientific, fought to get the charges dropped and the hemp released from police custody.\n\nThe contradictions between federal and state policy have kept the trucking case cycling through the court system. Hemp remains illegal in Idaho, so authorities had the right to seize the truckload, county prosecutors argued. Idaho also has the ability to prohibit transportation of hemp within the state because the product must first be lawfully produced \u2014 and the prosecutors argued that\u2019s impossible since even though Congress voted to legalize the crop, USDA still hasn\u2019t approved any state plans for regulating it.\n\nBrian Furnish on his farm in Kentucky. | M. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nA plea deal was reached with the truck driver in September. The state dropped all drug trafficking charges and the driver pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for hauling an improperly permitted load. But Elijah Watkins, lead attorney for Big Sky Scientific, complained that Idaho \u201ccontinues to hold Big Sky\u2019s hemp and is refusing to return it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to state court to hopefully have the issue heard on the merits,\u201d he said.\n\nTHERE ARE TWO main methods for analyzing hemp: liquid or gas chromatography, a process that separates and measures the various types of THC present in the plant, said Larry Smart, a plant geneticist and leader of Cornell University\u2019s hemp program. But he explained that the same plant could be tested using both technologies and the final THC measurement could vary. States can choose to employ either testing technology.\n\nSmart and a team of researchers are working to develop ways that farmers can more easily test THC levels themselves in their fields, potentially through infrared technology. Growers may be able to get their hands on that tool in as soon as two years, he said.\n\nWhen it comes to sampling, every state takes its own approach. In Pennsylvania, hemp fields are tested randomly and department employees visit about 25 percent of the more than 800 fields when the plants sprout flowers.\n\nBut in Colorado, random testing occurs at a different point in the season. The top two inches of the plant are sampled within two weeks of harvest. Which parts of the plant that are tested matter: THC levels can also fluctuate depending on how much of the plant is analyzed, from just the top two inches to the entire plant.\n\nOther states are taking note. In Florida, for example, the state agriculture department is in the midst of designing its own hemp program. Holly Bell, the architect of Florida\u2019s hemp market, said the state has learned from other states not to just focus on the farming side of hemp but also the processing, manufacturing and distributing components of the industry.\n\nHemp growing on the Furnish farm in Kentucky. | M. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cThat is the approach we\u2019ve tried to take with this program, to be working on them all at once, making sure that they can all interact on a timely basis and be ready for each other when we start the program,\u201d Bell said.\n\nA USDA spokesperson told POLITICO that the draft rule regulating hemp is under review by the Office of Management and Budget and the department intends to have the regulations in effect this fall. \u201cUSDA staff are exercising due diligence to address multiple requirements for hemp,\u201d including maintaining records, designing inspections and developing THC testing standards.\n\nTesting THC levels is far from the only challenge facing hemp farmers. The post-harvest stage of hemp is precarious: Freshly harvested plants need to be quickly dried or the crop will begin to mold. Then farmers need to track down a processor to extract CBD or turn the hemp into fiber. But in many places that infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist at the scale necessary to handle the massive influx of hemp, which has federal and state officials on edge.\n\n\u201cIn my career in agriculture I think there\u2019s more interest in hemp than anything I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson said at the Minnesota Farmfest in August. \u201cI think this is a crop that has potential and there\u2019s going to be a future. But I am nervous about what\u2019s going on because we don\u2019t have any processing for the fiber part of hemp.\u201d\n\nVermont hemp farmer Peter Dallison has seen a business opportunity in all the confusion. Many of Vermont\u2019s beleaguered dairy farmers, who have been going out of business as milk consumption has declined and the industry consolidates, were interested in switching to growing hemp for CBD. But Dallison realized that high barriers to entry, especially for smaller growers, and the complications of testing and processing, could keep potential hemp farmers on the sidelines.\n\nSo Dallison joined GreenTop Farm, which is testing different varieties of cannabis on its 130-acre farm, monitoring THC levels by testing plants as often as twice a week. GreenTop hopes to supply plants vetted to thrive in Vermont with high CBD and low THC levels and eventually provide services to local farmers to help them harvest, dry and extract CBD.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for these guys to make their land profitable again,\u201d Dallison said. \u201cIt does give new life to a family farm that really didn\u2019t see an opportunity in their future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of marijuana legalization continue to believe that the growing popularity of hemp and hemp products are laying the foundation for the federal government to legalize all forms of cannabis.\n\nStates with approved medical marijuana programs often legalize marijuana for adult use about five years later, said Boniello of Poseidon Investment.\n\n\u201cI look at industrial hemp very similarly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is kind of the first step to getting cannabis rescheduled.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiz Crampton is an agriculture reporter for POLITICO Pro.\n\n", "description": "The growing popularity of hemp is both easing \u2014 and complicating \u2014 the debate over cannabis.", "authors": ["Liz Crampton"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/69/6f/f631127e45189e839cb38e0a4514/191016-hemp-crampton-social-politico-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
