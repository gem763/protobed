The method relies on mimicking a natural process of muscle-tissue regeneration occurring inside a cow\u2019s body.\n\nWorld\u2019s first lab-grown steak revealed \u2013 but the taste needs work Read more\n\nThe experiment took place on 26 September on the Russian segment of the space station, and involved the assembly of small-scale muscle tissue in a 3D bioprinter under controlled microgravity conditions. In future the technique could be used to provide meat for people living on the space station.\n\nThe development marks a further step forward for a nascent industry that aims to provide people with real meat without the environmental impact and welfare problems of intensive livestock production.\n\nIn December, Aleph Farms announced it had produced a prototype \u201cstrip\u201d of steak grown from cells in the lab in two weeks, although it admitted the taste needed to be improved.\n\n\u201cWe are proving that cultivated meat can be produced anytime, anywhere, in any condition,\u201d said Didier Toubia, co-founder and chief executive of Aleph Farms. \u201cWe can potentially provide a powerful solution to produce the food closer to the population needing it, at the exact and right time it is needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn space, we don\u2019t have 10,000 or 15,000 litres of water available to produce 1kg of beef,\u201d added Toubia.\n\n\u201cThis joint experiment marks a significant first step toward achieving our vision to ensure food security for generations to come, while preserving our natural resources.\u201d\n\nRecent scientific studies have found that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential in order to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid dangerous climate change. One found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce an individual\u2019s environmental impact on the planet.", "description": "Israeli company successfully cultures bovine cells on International Space Station", "authors": ["Rebecca Smithers", "Arwa Mahdawi", "Ian Jack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f77efcc0696375edba68d7cb4f0c51d9125f700/0_9_2448_1470/master/2448.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e402379ae34875dc7de8463e2f5a8c9f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
