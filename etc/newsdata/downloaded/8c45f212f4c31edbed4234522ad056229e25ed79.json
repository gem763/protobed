However, after contacting the venue to flag the issue with them and suggesting they should increase their security, Shantel was met with doubt and criticism from the club\u2019s owner.\n\nNeil Scott, 66, replied to her via Facebook messenger, claiming that she was not \u201cworth someone trying to spike [her] drink\u201d and that \u201cno one would be stupid enough to waste their drugs on spiking anyone\u2019s drink.\u201d\n\nObviously, the internet went wild over the ridiculous response, and rightfully so. Drink spiking can happen to anyone, and people absolutely do \u201cwaste their drugs\u201d on it every single weekend.\n\nBut since the scandal began last weekend, a group of Perth locals have decided to take the boycott of Rapture Nightclub a step further, and have organised a protest on October 11.\n\nThe Facebook event \u2018Protest At The Rapture Nightclub\u2019 has amassed 95 attendees, 406 people interested and 59 shares since it was created on Monday.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019ve all seen how (Mr Scott) completely ignored and even ridiculed a patron who claimed her drink was spiked at his venue,\u201d the event organiser wrote. \u201cIt is important that we as a community try and work together to stop the Rapture Nightclub which holds disgusting values from running.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we all work together and hold protest we can change the way the nightclub is running.\u201d\n\nNeil Scott, who has been running clubs for 38 years, welcomed the protest, claiming he\u2019d like to see the faces of the people who have been abusing him.\n\n\u201cIt will be good to see the faces of the up to now, anonymous haters hiding behind tag names,\u201d Scott told Daily Mail. \u201cThen there are a lot of messages of support and some telling me that Shantel was a brat in school.\u201d\n\nScott, who seems to have an issue with being politically correct, has continued to dribble nonsense since the screenshots surfaced over the weekend.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s all a big waste of time and people are dumbing down our Aussie culture with all this political correctness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHer multiple scenarios in the story would have the same odds of being true as the winner of the $100million Powerball.\u201d\n\nIn addition to doubting the offence, Scott also made wild claims to 9News that Shantel simply isn\u2019t \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d, so why would anyone want to spike her? Um, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how spiking works, Neil.\n\n\u201cLets face it, why would somebody spike her drink? Why would they do that? What are they hoping to get? What is she hoping to get from it?\u201d\n\nWhether we have proof of the incident occurring or not, allegations of drink spiking and blatant drugging of people without their consent or knowledge need to be taken seriously.", "description": "A protest has been planned at Rapture Nightclub in Perth on Friday night following the club's disgusting response to a drink spiking allegation last weekend", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pjimage-48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
