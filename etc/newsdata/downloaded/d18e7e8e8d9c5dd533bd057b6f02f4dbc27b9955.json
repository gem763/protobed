I begged them to stop but they kept on kicking me \u2013 and they took my friend away.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man holds a Chilean flag in front of a barricade on La Alameda, the main avenue running through Santiago, on Monday evening.

Soldiers have returned to the streets for the first time since an earthquake devastated parts of the country in 2010. Self-defence groups wearing yellow vests have set up citizen militias to defend petrol stations and small businesses from further looting and attacks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police fire a water cannon to disperse demonstrators on La Alameda in central Santiago on Monday.

An arrest is normal. I am doing what I have to do \u2026 but to beat people to their limit, that is torture.\u201d\n\nA 22-year-old student who did not want to give his name said: \u201cI\u2019m not in favour of violence [on the part of the protesters] at all. In fact, I have never liked it. But I think it is the only way that they [the government] will listen to us. We had many peaceful marches, and they ignored us.\n\n\u201cI want to live peacefully. I live on my own, pay my bills. [But] If I have an accident and can\u2019t work for a month I can\u2019t pay for food and have to drop out of university.\u201d\n\nIn response to Pi\u00f1era\u2019s declaration of war, he added: \u201cThe people clanking pots and holding up their hands are not military, they are not armed. Even us, erecting barricades, what do we have? Sticks and stones \u2026 these aren\u2019t weapons. What war? Who are they fighting against?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators clash with riot police for a fourth straight day on Monday.

Some protesters held up blank ammunition cartridge allegedly fired by police.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester shows a blank ammunition at a protest in Santiago on Monday.

At 11.45pm, nearly four hours after the nightly curfew, they were still protesting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soldiers patrol the presidential government palace during curfew in Santiago on Monday night.

Pensions for the elderly are miserable. We have conflicts in every part of our day-to-day life. Day-to-day, we suffer.\n\n\u201cThe dictatorship is over. Our generation is not afraid. But now the military are using the same strategy that they used during the dictatorship, they are shooting.\n\nProtests in Chile against cost of living \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\n\u201cWe have to keep fighting until this is resolved for all, not just for a sector of the society. Not for the privileged. Not for the businessmen,\u201d she added.\n\nAs she finished speaking a car swerved through the barricade and men fired eight shots through its open windows. People ran for cover behind a tree, and the bark split open.
