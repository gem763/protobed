It turns out that noted traitor Edward Snowden, currently residing in Russia, has finished a memoir and found someone to publish it. As you will recall, Snowden is hiding out in Russia because he\u2019s wanted on very serious charges back here in the United States. But our government isn\u2019t so wild about the process he followed in preparing to release his book, so the Justice Department is taking him to court. Well\u2026 in spirit, anyway. (NBC News)\n\nThe Department of Justice has sued Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked secret documents, over the publication of his new memoir, arguing the book violates the non-disclosure agreements they say he signed with the CIA and NSA. \u201cThe lawsuit alleges that Snowden published his book without submitting it to the agencies for pre-publication review, in violation of his express obligations under the agreements he signed,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release Tuesday. The Justice Department said it is not seeking the stop of the release of the book, titled \u201cPermanent Record\u201d and published by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers. Instead, the department said it would seek to recover any proceeds Snowden earns from the book.\n\nThis story is kind of bizarre when you dig into the details. The DoJ isn\u2019t even saying that Snowden shouldn\u2019t have written the book. They\u2019re citing his non-disclosure agreement which says that he needed to run the book past both the NSA and CIA before having it published. You know\u2026 so he wouldn\u2019t inadvertently publish any sensitive information.\n\nDo we all remember why Snowden is stuck hiding out in Russia? It\u2019s because he stole and released tons of sensitive information. That\u2019s sort of his thing. It\u2019s hard to picture him sitting in his Moscow apartment and fretting over whether or not he should clear the book with his former bosses before sending it to the publisher.\n\nThe DoJ either couldn\u2019t stop the release of the book or weren\u2019t interested in trying. But what they can do is stop Snowden from profiting off of it if they can get the courts to go along with the plan. Then again, surely someone at NSA knew this book was in the works before it was ready to go on sale. If there was really any seriously damaging information in there that might compromise national security, they could have pulled Macmillan Publishers aside for a word.\n\nThe reality is that we probably don\u2019t need to be worrying all that much about whether or not Edward Snowden gets a book advance. He needs to be in Leavenworth, not property claims court. And perhaps we\u2019ll get a chance to make that happen. Just this week Snowden called on the President of France to grant him asylum and allow him to move there. Macron didn\u2019t offer a comment on the request, but he\u2019s still technically supposed to be an ally of ours, right? And it\u2019s a long haul from Moscow to Paris. Sounds like there might be an opportunity for us to get our hands on him during such a transition. It\u2019s something to think about, anyway.", "description": "Somehow I think he misses the court date", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Snowden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
