It also prompted a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters held in Kurdish jails.\n\nTrump has praised the deal with NATO-ally Turkey as one that would save lives. Turkey cast it as a victory in its campaign to control territory more than 30 km (around 20 miles) deep into Syria and drive out Kurdish fighters from the YPG, the SDF's main Kurdish component. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\n\"As of now, the 120-hour period is on. In this 120-hour period, the terrorist organization, the YPG, will leave the area we identified as a safe zone,\" Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul. The safe zone would be 32 km deep, and run \"440 km from the very west to the east\", he said.\n\nBut the U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting, between the two border towns of Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, just 120 km away.\n\nSpeaking to journalists later on Friday, Erdogan said Turkey plans to set up 12 observation posts in northeast Syria. A map of the region showed the planned posts stretching from the Iraq border in the east to the Euphrates river 300 miles to the west.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn Brussels on Friday night at NATO headquarters, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \"we also saw some very positive activity - the beginning of a coordination that will be required so that there can in fact be a safe withdrawal of the YPG fighters that are inside the Turkish-controlled area that is covered by the agreement.\"\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized that northern Syria was of concern and matters to all NATO allies.\n\n\"We all understand that we have a common enemy - Daesh,\" Stoltenberg said, using another name for Islamic State. \"We must not jeopardize the gains we have made in the fight against our common enemy Daesh.\"\n\nNATO defense ministers would address the issue when they meet next week, Stoltenberg said.\n\nA U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States would continue aerial surveillance in northeastern Syria to monitor prisons holding Islamic State militants.", "description": "Turkey will set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, insisting that a planned \"safe zone\" will extend much farther than U.S. officials said was covered under a fragile ceasefire deal.
