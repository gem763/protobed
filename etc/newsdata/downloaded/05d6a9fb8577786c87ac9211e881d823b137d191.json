Anyone who joined after that date is not.\n\nThe company says it is in the process of contacting everyone affected, but as a precaution, it is encouraging all customers to change their passwords via a dedicated website.\n\nThe company operates in Canada, and data on Canadian customers is believed to have been included. But DoorDash did not immediately reply to a request for comment by CBC News as to how many Canadians may be impacted.\n\nMore to come", "description": "Online food-delivery service DoorDash says it's the victim of a data breach in which the personal information of 4.9 million people was stolen, including names, email addresses, delivery addresses, phone numbers, and partial banking and credit card details.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299595.1569591507!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/doordash.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
