The revelation comes only a few weeks after Google announced its support for political action to fix the climate crisis.\n\nGoogle contributes to conservative political organizations and lobbies that are in support of regulatory efforts that benefit the company. Defending the donations to organizations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) that were cited in the report, Google said that it might not endorse every policy position of an organization when it makes a contribution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly alone\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,\u201d a Google spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nAccording to people at Google, The Guardian said that people at the company said that it makes these donations in hopes of influencing conservative lawmakers and pushing forward a deregulatory agenda, something that has become ever more important in recent months as Congress works to craft data privacy legislation.\n\nIn the past, CEI has taken tough stances in opposition to tech regulation and antitrust enforcement. Over the past year, Republican lawmakers have taken to criticizing tech platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google for being rigged in favor of Democrats, a position CEI has opposed before as well.\n\nIn September, Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the company would make the \u201cbiggest corporate purchase\u201d of renewable energy in history. The decision came only a day before Google employees were staged to walk out of work with other students and tech employees to draw corporate attention to the climate crisis. In a blog post, the strikers listed out their demands of the company, which included a call for it to cease from funding climate change-denying lobbyists and politicians. Google touts its stance in favor of climate action on its website as well.\n\n\u201cWe believe the private sector, in partnership with policy leaders, must take bold steps and that we can do so in a way that leads to growth and opportunity,\u201d Google\u2019s SVP of technical infrastructure, Urs H\u00f6lzle, says on the site. \u201cAnd we have a responsibility to do so \u2014 to our users and the environment.\u201d\n\nUpdate October 11th, 11:53AM ET: Clarified that CEI has supported the rights of Google and other tech platforms to enforce their content moderation policies how they choose, not the calls from conservatives alleging that the platforms are biased.", "description": "Google, like most every major corporation, makes sizable contributions to political organizations that support regulatory efforts that benefit the company.
