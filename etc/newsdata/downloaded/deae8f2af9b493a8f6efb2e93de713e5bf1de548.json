He shaped his style in the mould of post-war leader Charles de Gaulle, seeking to strengthen France\u2019s status as a player on the world stage.\n\nThe National Assembly interrupted a sitting to hold a minute\u2019s silence. President Emmanuel Macron cancelled a public engagement and scheduled a televised address later on Thursday.\n\nChirac passed away peacefully surrounded by his loved ones, his son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux told Reuters.\n\nMayor of Paris for 18 years and prime minister for presidents on the political left and right before entering the Elysee Palace himself, Chirac had a knack for connecting with voters, particularly in rural France.\n\n\u201cJacques Chirac knew how to form a personal bond with the French people,\u201d said former socialist President Francois Hollande. \u201cFrance was in his blood. He explored every corner, tasted every local delicacy.\u201d\n\nIn death, he will be remembered for his defiant opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a military campaign which turned Chirac\u2019s relationship with then British Prime Minister Tony Blair into an acrimonious low.\n\nBlair said he was deeply saddened by Chirac\u2019s passing.\n\n\u201cHe was a towering figure in French and European politics over many decades. Whatever our differences from time to time, he was always unfailingly kind, generous and personally supportive,\u201d Blair said in a statement.\n\nIn Europe, Chirac became one of the bloc\u2019s main standard bearers. He forged an alliance with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder which brought Europe\u2019s two traditional powers closer together but upset some of their European Union partners.\n\nHe said of Eastern European countries that supported then-U.S. President George W. Bush\u2019s coalition in Iraq that they had \u201cmissed a good opportunity to keep quiet.\u201d\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel called Chirac a \u201cgreat partner and friend to us Germans\u201d. Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing leader of the European Union executive, said the continent had lost a man of strong convictions.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former French President Jacques Chirac arrives to attend the award ceremony for the Prix de la Fondation Chirac at the Quai Branly Museum in Paris November 21, 2014.

He studied at the elite Sciences Po university and ENA civil service academy, and served as an army officer. By 1967, he had become a junior minister and was just 41 when he became prime minister in 1974.\n\nHe left the government and by 1977 was elected as Paris\u2019s first mayor, a job he would keep for 18 years, until his election as president in 1995. He won a second term in 2002, after a fraught battle with far-right challenger Jean-Marie Le Pen, father of Marine Le Pen.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nDuring his career, Chirac had flirted with Communism and ultra-nationalism before settling on mainstream right-of-centre politics, earning him the nickname \u201cChameleon Bonaparte.\u201d\n\nAnother of his nicknames was \u201cHoudini\u201d, a reference to his knack for managing to escape serious punishment, despite the allegations of misuse of funds.\n\nIn the last years of his life, he suffered from neurological problems and was rarely seen in public. He lived quietly with his wife, Bernadette, in an apartment on Paris\u2019s Quai Voltaire, and worked on his memoirs.", "description": "Former President Jacques Chirac, a political chameleon who dominated French politics for decades and strived to make France's voice heard in Europe and beyond, died on Thursday at the age of 86.", "authors": ["Sudip Kar-Gupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434104230&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0SP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
