I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screens hotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It\u2019s......... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
