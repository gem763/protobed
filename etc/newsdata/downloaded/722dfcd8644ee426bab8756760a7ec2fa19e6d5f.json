Liu, they\u2019ve heard \u201crumors from reporters\u201d that a grand jury rejected an indictment.\n\n\u201cWe have no independent knowledge of whether the report is accurate but for present purposes we assume the grand jury may have voted a no true bill,\u201d Mr. McCabe\u2019s legal team wrote, citing media reports in The Washington Post and The New York Times.\n\nA \u201cno true bill\u201d is a conclusion by a grand jury that there isn\u2019t sufficient probable cause to charge a defendant.\n\n\u201cThe only fair and just result is for you to accept the grand jury\u2019s decision and end these proceedings,\u201d the letter continued.\n\nMedia outlets reported Thursday that Mr. McCabe had appealed criminal charges recommended by Ms. Liu. The Justice Department denied his request.\n\nProsecutors can present a case to a grand jury again, but that requires approval from a U.S. Attorney. Mr. McCabe\u2019s legal team said if Ms. Liu reopens the case, she should submit the supposed findings of the previous grand jury.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s legal team implored Ms. Liu not resubmit the case to a grand jury.\n\n\u201cIf the evidence presented by your office was insufficient to convince 12 members of the grand jury to find probable cause to believe that Mr. McCabe had committed any crimes, no attorney can reasonably believe that \u2018the admissible evidence is sufficient to obtain a guilty verdict by an unbiased trier of fact,\u201d his lawyers wrote.\n\nMr. McCabe was tied in March 2018 after a Justice Department inspector general report found he mislead investigators about his involvement in a leak to the news media about an FBI probe into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe, currently an analyst for CNN, has sued the Justice Department over his firing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
