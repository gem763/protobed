The feature is just a bit odd and less straight-forward than cameras that shoot in just one direction \u2014 there just aren\u2019t that many typical situations where you really need to shoot 360 degrees. You have to go out and find it or create those situations intentionally, which is why the Max, a descendent of GoPro\u2019s Fusion 360 camera from 2017, is taking aim at the influencers, artists, and other insufferables among us.\n\nPacking two different lenses, the Hero Max is capable of shooting 360-degree panorama video as well as shooting in \u201cHero mode,\u201d which includes many of the capture options you\u2019d get with the Hero8 Black that the company also announced today.\n\nUnlike the Hero8 Black, the Max has a selfie screen, six microphones for capturing \u201cambisonic spatial audio\u201d in 360 videos, and a higher-end version of the HyperSmooth image stabilisation than you\u2019ll get in the Hero8. At a press event in August GoPro\u2019s VP of management and user experience, Pablo Lema, even claimed it\u2019s the first image stabilisation that can make footage captured while attached to a dog look stable. You also get a built-in shotgun mic, four different shooting lens options including extra-wide Max SuperView, and panoramic photo capabilities.\n\nThe Fusion, which was GoPro\u2019s first consumer 360 camera, was just not that easy to use compared to a standard GoPro. Plus, it required the use of desktop software to make the 360-degree footage usable.\n\nWith the Max the processing is moved in-camera, and you can fully edit the footage and share using the fully overhauled GoPro mobile app. We haven\u2019t had the chance to test out the Max just yet, so we\u2019ll have to wait to see just how easy it really is.\n\nGiven that the Hero Max is around $150 more than the Hero8 Black, is it worth spending the extra dough get what is effectively two cameras in one? Well, not necessarily. For one, the Max\u2019s \u201cHero mode\u201d lacks a few options that you\u2019ll get in the Hero8, such as 4K capture.\n\nIt instead taps out at 1440p and 60 frames per second. (Although you do get the bonus of 5.6K at 30 frames per second with the Max.) The second, as Lema explained to me in August, is that the Max can\u2019t take quite as much of a beating as the Hero8. It\u2019s still waterproof, it\u2019s still meant to be strapped to a mountain bike or a snowboard and sent down a mountain, but it\u2019s not going to hold up to extreme wear and tear the way the Hero8 should.\n\nSo unless you\u2019re a vlogger or simply want to get really weird with your videos, the cheaper Hero8 is probably a better choice. That said, if the ease-of-use is really there with the new app, it may be worth giving the Max a try. The 360 video does look incredibly cool and can probably make even a boring vacation look even more of an experience than it actually is.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to wait on reviews the GoPro Max is available for pre-order today. It ships late October.", "description": "GoPro is giving the 360 camera thing another try, this time with the Hero Max, a $798 dual-lens camera that the company swears is a far more user-friendly device than its previous consumer version, the GoPro Fusion....", "authors": ["Adam Clark Estes", "Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/djkq52pg25ovsyw0ktbb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
