You\u2019re basically saying if you\u2019re not blind then you can\u2019t bring any assistance dog in here.\u2019\n\nThe father said they are regularly challenged when they bring Fern into establishments but once people realise the dog\u2019s purpose, they tend not to face further issues.\n\nBut Mr Bulner, who wants to raise awareness of \u2018invisible disabilities\u2019, continued: \u2018That\u2019s how it should be.\n\n\u2018The dog gets him out of this stage where he goes into a meltdown and nobody can do it better than the dog.\n\nThe incident occurred at a Londis in Andover (Picture: Google)\n\n\u2018(Fern has) changed his life completely.\u2019\n\nVas Mohanathas, area manager for JP&S Services, the company who run the store, said in a letter to Mr Bulner: \u2018I am appalled at the way this was handled by the staff on site.\n\n\u2018I have forwarded the videos to the director and discussed my concerns with him. Please take assurance in knowing that he feels the same way about this as you and I and has asked me to action the investigation and staff training immediately.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that a new sign saying \u2018assistance dogs allowed\u2019 had been ordered and that the company will add a local guide dog trust to the charities they support.\n\nThe manager added that staff will give free dog treats to guide and assistance dogs that visit the store.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
