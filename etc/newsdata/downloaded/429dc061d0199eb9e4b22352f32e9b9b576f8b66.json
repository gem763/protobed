I don't see any great difficulty in closing the gap on the first announcement,\" Goyal said at the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).\n\nThe deal under discussion includes lowering tariffs on U.S. farm produce while giving Indian pharmaceuticals faster approval to enter the U.S. market.\n\nIndia dominates the world\u00b4s generic drugs market and the United States is among its top importers.\n\n\"With regards to the trade talks between India and the US, Commerce and Industry Minister said that things are on the right track and India is looking to the U.S. for technology, innovation, skills and quality education,\" a government statement quoted Goyal as saying.\n\nAccording to USISPF estimates, India-U.S. bilateral trade is projected to grow to $238 billon by 2025 from $142.1 billion in 2018.\n\nU.S. trade and investments are expected to grow in sectors such as defense, commercial aircrafts, oil and LNG, coal, machinery and electronics.\n\nIndia is aiming to promote automotive, pharmaceuticals, seafood, IT and travel services to the U.S. market.\n\nGoyal said India and the U.S. must look at a larger trade agreement, the government statement said. It did not elaborate.
