For three years, the right has been defending Donald Trump\u2019s actions with smugness and swagger. For three years, the left has been issuing strident and sometimes desperate condemnations of violations by the president. As political thermometers go, the way people talk is a slippery and ineffable measure. But political discourse has a subtext: The frames people choose reflect who has power and who doesn\u2019t\u2014or who thinks they have it, which sometimes amounts to the same thing. For a long time now, the right has held this particular set of cards. You see it in the easy dismissals, the eye-rolls and chuckles at serious criticisms, the pleasure in watching \u201clibs\u201d be \u201cowned\u201d or \u201ctriggered,\u201d the general, luxurious unconcern. And while many on the left have only intensified their efforts in decrying the horrors of incarcerated children, white supremacist rallies, and other awful, unforgettable episodes, many of those grief-stricken condemnations have shared a pitch we can all hear even if we don\u2019t realize it: They come from a place of powerlessness\u2014whether actual or perceived.\n\nTo those who wanted to mitigate the damage this administration was inflicting, change seemed impossible. Indeed, a feature of the political landscape as presently configured is that the left often feels weaker than it actually is: A historic Democratic wave swept through the House in 2018, but because of learned skittishness over polls and how long it took for electoral results to roll in with close races, Democrats (the \u201cSquad\u201d excepted, tellingly) never really adopted the discourse\u2014or the attitude\u2014of the victor. The result has been enormously frustrating to liberals and progressives who have watched Democratic politicians condemn this administration with the same plangent rhetoric that those without power wield to compensate for what we don\u2019t have. You have power, the 2018 voters expressly reminded the Democratic Party. You can actually do something, so stop speaking as if you have no ability to act.\n\nAnd suddenly, overnight, the party has acted. An entire landscape of political feeling that felt drearily constant seems to have changed. A whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Donald Trump pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden for his own political gain\u2014with help from Rudy Giuliani and William Barr, and from White House officials who tried to hide the conversation by relocating the transcript\u2014seems to have blown open political possibilities that were previously unthinkable. For the moment at least (but what a notable moment!) the impression is of one of a party pursuing a clearly defined goal while the opposition careens wildly. Understatement can communicate power, and Democrats who railed against Trump\u2019s actions during the Mueller report have spoken about the Ukraine affair more in sorrow than in anger.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable what a difference a day (and a formal inquiry) can make. What just weeks ago may have seemed like lackadaisical resignation on the part of Democratic leadership now somehow scans as sober purpose. \u201cThis is not a cause for any joy that we have to go down this path,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told New Jersey Democrats Friday night, the reluctant warrior. While Breitbart is tweeting \u201cPresident Trump says Pencil Neck Has to Go!\u201d and GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz claims that Pelosi has been \u201cfunctionally catfished\u201d based \u201con a bloodlust for the president,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s calmness comes off as steely by comparison. While Trump implies that members of his own White House are \u201cclose to spies\u201d and appears to wish them dead, even friend-of-the-resistance Rep. Ted Lieu is echoing the speaker\u2019s \u201clast option\u201d and \u201csad time\u201d rhetoric. You don\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re more confident of the hand you\u2019re playing\u2014one that makes bombast and hyperbole unnecessary.\n\nJust as instructive is what\u2019s happening to Trump\u2019s defenders: Despite emailing their talking points to everyone\u2014including the Democrats, by accident\u2014the right has not figured out how to respond. It is not in control of its tone. Money may be pouring in for Trump\u2019s re-election as the threat of impeachment looms (his more fanatical supporters will follow him no matter what he does) but the discourse on the right, which is supposed to rationalize that loyalty, is scattershot and unfocused\u2014even sensitive. Take Fox News: Trump acolytes on the network\u2019s The Five started literally shouting at co-host Juan Williams when he brought up the talking points that had, by this point, circulated widely. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Greg Gutfeld yelled.* \u201cAre you saying I got talking points? You got to answer to the accusation!\u201d The rest of the network is no more composed: Vanity Fair\u2019s Gabriel Sherman reports that Lachlan Murdoch is considering a new post-Trump direction for the network; that Paul Ryan, who now sits on the board, is urging him to cut ties with Trump; and that Shep Smith and Tucker Carlson are feuding. Chris Wallace appeared on Fox News colleague Sandra Smith\u2019s show to object to \u201cthe spinning that has been done by the president\u2019s defenders over the last 24 hours.\u201d Carlson was reduced to calling Schiff \u201cmentally ill\u201d on Thursday night\u2014and even Sean Hannity, Trump\u2019s smarmiest propagandist, told a confidant that the allegations in the complaint were \u201creally bad.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Breitbart referred to the whistleblower (whose identity is unknown) as a \u201cpartisan federal employee,\u201d and the Federalist called the exploding scandal \u201can elaborate gossipy game of telephone.\u201d But no one can quite agree on the angle: While some have argued that the complaint was sloppy, others aver that it was much too polished. A commentator and former Trump staffer claimed that the complaint is \u201ctoo convenient and too perfect to come from a typical whistleblower.\u201d A lack of confidence is leaching through most of these attempts to launder tribalist loyalty into a principled stand. There might be no better approximation of the current state of the right\u2019s rhetorical power than Devin Nunes\u2019 claim at Thursday\u2019s hearing that Democrats want \u201cnude pictures of Trump.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the right won\u2019t find its footing. But its machinery is actually slow and ungainly relative to the whistleblower story, while what the Democrats have working for them is speed. The impeachment inquiry feels like an emergency (because it is one, even if others have come before it and gone unrecognized). And the Democrats\u2019 single-minded sense of urgency is somehow outpacing the hurricane of misinformation the right usually generates to drive American news cycles.\n\nIt helps that this is a pretty straightforward case that has unfolded in good time. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint builds on what we already know about how Trump operates and crystallizes the stakes in a new way, and perhaps most importantly it\u2019s packaged in a way Americans can easily recognize as a scandal. The Mueller report was too long and too complicated, too kneecapped by Justice Department guidelines and too already-reported for the average busy American to process and understand. But the Ukraine situation is clear-cut, and the complaint is mercifully short. These factors have turned out to be key ingredients in a remarkable turn in political expression.\n\nWhat has set this week apart from other scandals\u2014and may be contributing to a noticeable shift in public support for impeachment\u2014is that Trump\u2019s latest potential high crime did not happen out in the open, that its details have had to be ferreted out and revealed, piece by piece, and in rapid and damning succession. That\u2019s legible as malfeasance in ways that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening\u201d isn\u2019t. Americans still don\u2019t quite believe that things that are done in the open are bad; it might be a joke, or a bit, or a performance, or a mistake. (We can\u2019t even agree that Trump is lying because maybe he believes in his heart that the \u201cfalsehood\u201d is true.) Convincing the public of ill intent seems to require a \u201crevelation\u201d or an \u201cexposure\u201d or a secret. I wrote back during the Mueller investigation that this was key to understanding why that effort was doomed\u2014not because it lacked merit, but because it misunderstood American psychology:\n\nAmericans have few tools for dealing with an administration that relies so wholly on lying\u2014publicly, chronically, without shame. \u2026 We fixate instead on secrets because secrets are how government malpractice has been accounted for in the past: Investigations are done, sins are exposed, and consequences are meted out.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining why the Case of the Ukraine Call has broken through, and why Trump defenders are having a hard time keeping up any one defense: Talking points are raised and then disproven within a day. On Wednesday, several Republicans suggested that raising the specter of impeachment without examining the evidence was premature. Texas Rep. Roger Williams\u2019 statement was typical of this genre: \u201cIt was an irresponsible and political move to, once again, call for impeachment before we had any facts or evidence of what allegedly transpired.\u201d Yet by that very night, that evidence had been released corroborating the complaint. The Washington Post reported that several Republicans were \u201cprivately stunned\u201d that the White House released the so-called transcript\u2014and believed it would help its case\u2014with one unnamed senator calling it a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that the party now had to defend.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that confirmation came from sources the right has a harder time disputing, namely the president himself, Rudy Giuliani, and the reconstructed transcript of the call the White House released. While Republicans like Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. Lindsey Graham have loudly supported the president, a choice few, like Rep. Mike Turner, offered mild recriminations: \u201cI want to say to the president, \u2018This is not OK. That conversation is not OK,\u2019 \u201d he said during Thursday\u2019s intelligence hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joe Maguire. Dozens of Republican politicians are claiming they haven\u2019t managed to read the explosive 8.5-page document. (This is less persuasive than it was with the doorstopper of the Mueller report.) Others, like Sen. Susan Collins, are claiming they can\u2019t comment because they will serve as \u201cjurors\u201d during an impeachment trial.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help a frazzled GOP that every new piece of information that has come out has made the case against the president worse. That progression hasn\u2019t always happened, in previous crises. First, all we knew was that a whistleblower existed, and that Maguire had not given the report to Congress as required by law; no one knew why, or what he or she was revealing. (An air of mystery!) When the rough contents of the complaint were made public\u2014something about a phone call with the Ukrainian president and Biden\u2014it seemed problematic but remained unconfirmed. (Hints of something bigger!) The White House \u201ctranscript\u201d proved that this was quite serious. (An unexpected escalation!) And when the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was finally made public, it was clear that the White House\u2019s readout of the Zelensky phone call largely corroborated it, and that the allegations were even more serious than anyone realized.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Barr appears to be involved as well\u201d appears in the first paragraph of the complaint, a sentence that sits conspicuously beside reports that the Justice Department knew about the whistleblower complaint a week before the inspector general of the intelligence community issued a formal referral. Senior White House officials allegedly intervened\u2014before the whistleblower\u2019s complaint\u2014to \u201c \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced,\u201d by improperly relocating the transcript into \u201ca separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d In short, the golden egg of political scandals: a cover-up.\n\nReactions from the principal parties have only compounded the challenge of defending the president. Trump, leaning into the mob-like portrait painted by the complaint, raged at a fundraiser that the whistleblower was \u201calmost a spy\u201d and fondly recalled how spies used to be \u201cdealt\u201d with. Attempts to downplay this as a joke or a fabrication were quickly disabused: a recording surfaced later in the day. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right?\u201d Trump is heard saying. \u201cWe used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d Not to be outdone, Giuliani, far from exculpating himself, is using the spotlight to inculpate State Department officials: He\u2019s for some reason talking like a mobster, referring to a \u201cnice little paper trail\u201d of text messages with the now-resigned envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, that he plans to use to prove that he hadn\u2019t acted alone. He went on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show to share the screenshots.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s disclosures are useful, however\u2014partly because the involvement of the State Department, if confirmed, would mean the scandal was even more widespread, and partly because Giuliani\u2019s own lack of clarity about who exactly he was working for is likely to become a matter of national interest as these proceedings move forward. On Sept. 20, when CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked him, \u201cSo, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d Giuliani replied, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d When pressed, Giuliani explicitly claims that he was working on behalf of his \u201cclient,\u201d Trump. But Thursday, talking to the Atlantic\u2019s Elaina Plott, he said the opposite: \u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleges that Volker (and U.N. Ambassador Gordon Sondland) \u201csought to help Ukrainian leaders understand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels on the one hand, and from Mr. Giuliani on the other.\u201d Whether Giuliani was acting as Trump\u2019s lawyer or not may affect his ability to claim attorney-client privilege. Then again, that might not matter. \u201cYou can\u2019t claim privilege if the president told you to take action, because that\u2019s not advice,\u201d John Moscow, a senior prosecutor, told Bloomberg. \u201cAnd if the request was political in nature, it\u2019s not protected.\u201d Giuliani is currently insisting that he is a hero.\n\nThings are moving fast. Friday morning, the White House blamed National Security Council lawyers for relocating the Ukraine transcript to the server it had no business being on. Some interpret this as another sign the circular firing squad is taking aim. As my colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley pointed out, Trump and Giuliani\u2019s inclination to keep talking is generating a very useful list of witnesses for the impeachment hearings. And amid all this chaos, something palpable has shifted, and it might be our collective sense of how the seesaw of power has tilted anew, perhaps not so subtly. On the day Trump tweeted that if his \u201cperfect phone call\u201d wasn\u2019t considered appropriate\u2014\u201cthen no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!\u201d\u2014Pelosi went on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to say that \u201cthe clarity of the president\u2019s actions is compelling and gave us no choice but to move forward.\u201d She was by then in a position to afford some magnanimity. \u201cI pray for the president,\u201d she added. \u201cI pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Sept. 28, 2019: In an earlier version of this article, Greg Gutfeld\u2019s first name was misspelled.", "description": "A political possibility that was once nearly unthinkable.", "authors": ["Lili Loofbourow"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/78169418-5533-486e-81d0-fb64f471430a.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=5430x3620&offset=0x0", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
