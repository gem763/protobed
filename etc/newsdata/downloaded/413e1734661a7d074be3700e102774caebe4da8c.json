California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with Governor Gavin Newsom, led a joint coalition of 24 attorneys general and the cities of Los Angeles and New York in filing a lawsuit against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\nThe suit comes after Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced Thursday that the EPA would withdraw the 2013 Clean Air Act waiver that enabled California to set its own tailpipe greenhouse gas emission standards.\n\nPresident Trump touted the move in a tweet on Wednesday, saying that it would result in less expensive and safer cars, and insisting that new cars would be cleaner, even though they will burn more gasoline than they would have under the fuel efficiency standards established during President Obama's administration.\n\n\"Two courts have already upheld California's emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify its misguided Preemption Rule. Yet, the Administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,\" Becerra said.\n\n\"The Oval Office is really not a place for on-the-job training. President Trump should have at least read the instruction manual he inherited when he assumed the Presidency, in particular the chapter on respecting the Rule of Law. Mr. President, we'll see you in court,\" Becerra added.\n\nThe rollback is a part of the new \"One National Program Rule,\" which, as the name states, means the federal government will have one set of nationwide fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards for automobiles and light-duty trucks.\n\nAfter Friday's filing, Governor Newsom admonished the president, saying his latest move is \"bad for our air. Bad for our health. Bad for our economy.\"\n\n\"We will see him in court,\" he added.", "description": "California is leading a coalition of 24 other states in a lawsuit against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).", "authors": ["Emily Tillett", "Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter", "Video Editor For Cbs News Digital"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/20/8b8fe0db-a494-47c0-a9f0-d9945be5e932/thumbnail/1200x630/932b9b4ea809254f82c486c521365c34/ap-17226677873385.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
