Once Britain does leave the EU, its economic growth is\n\nexpected to slow, which is likely to be a negative for sterling\n\nin the longer term, analysts warn. \"Assuming we clear the parliamentary hurdle, the pound has\n\nroom to rise further because there are a lot of shorts to be\n\nunwound,\" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research\n\ndepartment at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.\n\n\"But after that, people will start to question whether this\n\nis really good for Britain's economy, and further gains in\n\nsterling could become difficult.\"\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 traded at $1.2856 in Asia on Friday,\n\nclose to a five-month high of $1.2988 reached on Thursday after\n\nEU leaders unanimously backed the new Brexit deal with Britain.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP=D3 , sterling traded at 86.57\n\npence, near a five-month high of 85.77 pence.\n\nFor the week, the pound was on course for a 1.6% gain versus\n\nthe dollar and a 0.8% increase against the common currency.\n\nBritain's new Brexit deal has a \"decent chance\" of clearing\n\nparliament on Saturday, finance minister Sajid Javid said, but\n\nsome investors are wary because debate so far on Brexit has been\n\nfractious and difficult to predict.\n\nEven if Johnson can win approval in parliament, Britain is\n\nstill on course for more distant economic ties and increased\n\ntrade barriers with the EU, which many economists say will slow\n\ngrowth in the UK.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed more than expected to 6.0%\n\nyear-on-year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in at least\n\n27-1/2 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered amid a\n\nbruising Sino-U.S. trade war. In the onshore market, the yuan CNY=CFXS traded at 7.0740\n\nper dollar little changed on the day. In the offshore market,\n\nthe yuan CNH=D3 was quoted at 7.0730 versus the greenback.\n\nFriday's data marked a further loss of momentum for the\n\nChinese economy from the second quarter's 6.2% growth, likely\n\nraising expectations that Beijing needs to roll out more\n\nmeasures to ward off a sharper slowdown.\n\nThe world's two-largest economies have imposed tariffs on\n\neach other's goods in a dispute over China's trade and\n\nindustrial policies that has slammed the brakes on global\n\neconomic growth.\n\nWorries about weak U.S. economic data kept the greenback\n\nlower against other currencies.\n\nThe dollar traded at 0.9879 Swiss franc CHF=EBS , close to\n\nthe lowest since Sept. 25 and on course for its biggest weekly\n\ndecline since Aug. 9.\n\nThe dollar JPY=EBS was quoted at 108.56 yen, headed for\n\nits second week of gains.\n\n\n\n(\n\nEditing by Jacqueline Wong and Lincoln Feast)\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Sterling trades near 5-month high on Brexit, yuan steady after China GDP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/chinese_yuan_3_800x533_L_1412681147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
