Don\u2019t look at me!\n\nReadjusting to being a former prime minister can\u2019t be easy. Tony Blair described having to learn to use a mobile phone, after years when aides took charge of all his communications. Theresa May was to be seen earlier this week pottering about in the palace of Westminster, not a flunky in sight, buying herself lunch.\n\nBut the sense from David Cameron\u2019s Times interview is that the hardest readjustment has been getting used to the idea of not always being a winner.\n\nCameron once reportedly said he wanted to be prime minister, because \u201cI think I\u2019d be good at it\u201d; and when he unexpectedly secured a majority at the 2015 general election, he and George Osborne saw it as confirmation of their political genius.\n\nThey were indeed clever, and ruthless \u2013 but not ruthless enough, it turned out, when it came to the brutal 2016 referendum campaign, the outcome of which Cameron says made him \u201cdepressed\u201d.\n\nMuch of his fury is directed at Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, his erstwhile political and personal friends, whom he accuses of behaving \u201cappallingly\u201d.\n\nIronically, had Cameron\u2019s memoir been published several months ago when it was originally due to appear, these character notes on his old rivals would have seemed of little more than historical interest.\n\nBut he has burst out of his shepherd\u2019s hut just as the Vote Leave crew are back together in Downing Street, and applying the same battering-ram approach to parliament, the judiciary and anyone else who stands in their way, as they did to the Stronger In campaigners in 2016.\n\nAnd the \u201cTory psychodrama\u201d that he claims prevented the remainers\u2019 message from getting through has become a full-scale civil war, that could yet rend his old party in two.\n\nYet what Dave doesn\u2019t really seem to feel, is a heavy weight of personal responsibility.\n\nOsborne apparently still chides him, \u201cyou and your fucking referendum\u201d.\n\nBut Cameron still believes it was necessary and all but inevitable because of the pressures inside his own party and out in the country at large; and that his EU renegotiation was a grand idea that could have been a \u201cboon\u201d for Britain if the leavers\u2019 dastardly tactics hadn\u2019t stopped him from getting his message across to the great British public.\n\nAnd his analysis of the great rupture of Brexit appears to be that its causes lie more in the political swordsmanship of that brief campaign in the summer of 2016, than in the years of public sector austerity, industrial decline and anti-immigrant rhetoric that preceded it.\n\nIt\u2019s much too soon to say, of course \u2013 but history may well judge otherwise.", "description": "In an interview to promote his book, the former PM still says Brexit poll was necessary", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405978667535f754f954299763cbc2bcedaeb4c3/0_192_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d5df1021d78e8ad26ea4a0cac3b9d0f", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
