By midmorning in Asia on Monday, it was trading up 10.9% at $66.71 a barrel. On Sunday, President Trump said he authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.6%. Gold and the Japanese yen, which are often considered haven assets during times of turmoil, edged up.\n\n\u201cIf oil prices are out of control, it\u2019s obviously a negative for equities,\u201d said Weiqi Zhu, a fund manager at Gao Zheng Asset Management in Hong Kong.

Kerry Craig, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said oil producers could dip into stockpiles, which would help stabilize prices. \u201cThe bigger issue is what premium markets will build in to reflect the risk of further attacks,\u201d he said in a note to clients.
