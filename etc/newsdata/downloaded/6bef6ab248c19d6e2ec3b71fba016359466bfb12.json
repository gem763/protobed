If you choose to use it, Apple will create what is essentially a burner email address so that you can sign up for the app or website while hiding your real email address from the third party.\n\nWhenever the website or app then tries to contact you, it will email the burner address and not your real email address. Apple will forward the note to you so you are aware of it. Then if a business starts sending spam to the burner email address, you can easily delete your account and the business won\u2019t have your real email address.\n\nI tested Sign in with Apple with a few apps like the travel-booking app Kayak. It worked smoothly. Here\u2019s how: When I opened the Kayak app, the button labeled Sign in with Apple showed up. After clicking through, I saw the option to hide your email address. From there, Apple generated a random string of characters as a burner address and automatically set a password for the account.\n\nSign in with Apple then made logging in and out of the Kayak app a breeze. I didn\u2019t have to memorize the burner email address or password; after signing out of the app or website, I signed back in by scanning my face and using Apple\u2019s Face ID biometric system.\n\nThere are some downsides. If you try to sign in with the burner email account on, say, a web browser that lacks Sign in with Apple, you will have to manually enter the email address and reset the password.\n\nSo this feature is most convenient with apps and sites that you plan to use primarily on the iPhone, to spare you the hassle of jotting down strange email addresses and their passwords.\n\nShoo, robocallers\n\nRobocallers can make random calls to you throughout the day, which is invasive. But a new option in iOS 13 lets you silence calls coming from all unknown numbers. I had mixed feelings about this tool, which I\u2019ll explain in a bit.", "description": "We tested the new suite of privacy tools in Apple\u2019s latest mobile software, from minimizing location sharing to silencing robocalls.", "authors": ["Brian X.
