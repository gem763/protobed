Kimi (Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion for Ferrari and now with Alfa Romeo) has had his 40th birthday so why not?\"\n\n\"In between we need to continue to deliver a good enough car. If we do that, then yes he could shatter (Schumacher's records),\" added the Austrian, whose team have been pushed hard by Ferrari this season.\n\nSchumacher, who won five titles in a row for Ferrari between 2000 and 2004, retired in 2012 at the age of 43.\n\nHamilton, now on 83 victories, has maintained an average of 10 wins a season for the past six years with the dominant team of the sport's V6 turbo hybrid era.\n\n\"I think it\u00b4s exciting. It\u00b4s an exciting potential new target,\" Wolff said of the prospect of chasing Schumacher's tally.\n\n\"Of course the pressure will increase but if he would not be able to cope with pressure, he wouldn\u00b4t be a five or six times world champion.\"\n\nFormula One is set for a major rules overhaul from 2021, with technical and financial changes aimed at creating a more level playing field among teams and to make it easier for drivers to overtake.\n\nMercedes have already won this year's constructors' championship and are sure of completing an unprecedented sixth title double in succession.\n\nWolff said Mercedes, who have one of the biggest budgets and are set to provide engines to four of the 10 teams in 2021, relished the opportunity 2021 represented.\n\n\"This team has won in 2009, 2014, 2017 and 2019 -- every year that there has been a change. We are really looking forward to this change,\" he declared.\n\nHUNGRY ANIMAL\n\nIn 2009, the Brawn GP team won both titles with a 'double diffuser' concept that wrong-footed rivals and left them rushing to catch up.\n\nMercedes promptly bought the team and returned as a manufacturer in 2010. The V6 turbo era started in 2014, with the Mercedes engine immediately proving a cut above the rest.\n\nWolff said the will to win was as strong as ever, and referred to a comment made by the New Zealand coach ahead of the All Blacks' Rugby World Cup semi-final defeat to England in Japan.\n\n\"Put in very simple words, he was asked whether there was a risk of losing against England and he said: 'You\u00b4ve got to be careful of the hungry animal, because if the animal is hungry it\u00b4s going to eat you'.\n\n\"We are very aware of the hunger and ambition of other teams,\" said Wolff. \"Every single person in this team is hungry. It hasn\u00b4t changed.\"\n\nPRAISEWORTHY\n\nHamilton has well-documented interests outside Formula One, in music and fashion, and is outspoken on environmental issues that have attracted criticism because of his jet-setting lifestyle in a fuel-burning sport.\n\nWolff hailed the Briton as \"one of the greatest racing drivers that ever existed\" and made clear that he could count on full support.\n\n\"I think that having a message that goes beyond racing is important. I find it positive for him to utilise his impact and his audiences to transmit another message and that is around environment. That is praiseworthy,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian saw more criticism coming from Britain than elsewhere, for reasons he could not fully understand, but added that \"criticism can be quite a force\" for motivation.\n\nHe also saw parallels with Schumacher's career for how Hamilton might be seen in future.\n\n\"It is a funny thing with extraordinary achievements that they are recognised and praised much more once a career has ended,\" he said.\n\n\"Michael, while in the middle of his career, polarised a lot. There was a lot of criticism. Today there is not one person who doesn\u00b4t speak about him as the greatest of all time.\n\n\"At the moment he is still leading the table.\" (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "description": "By Alan BaldwinLONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff can see Lewis Hamilton going on to smash Michael Schumacher's greatest Formula One...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
