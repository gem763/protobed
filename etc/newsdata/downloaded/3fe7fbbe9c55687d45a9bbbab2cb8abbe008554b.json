Everything seems clearer than ever before,\u201d Babers said Monday, less than 48 hours after his Orange were soundly beaten 63-20 at Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s like rebooting your entire computer. It\u2019s really kind of eye-opening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see how we do. Maybe we reboot. Maybe everything\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nMaybe.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nThe answer likely will come very soon. The Orange (1-1, 0-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) host No. 1 Clemson (2-0, 1-0)) in their home opener on Saturday night. It\u2019s a key matchup in the Atlantic Division between the defending national champion Tigers and the only ACC team to beat them in the past two seasons.\n\nAt least the Orange might have their first sellout crowd in the Carrier Dome nearly two decades - less than 175 tickets remained on Monday (capacity is 49,262), though all were season passes.\n\n\u201cI think we have a big task,\u201d Babers said. \u201cWhat we just went through, that was big. And now we have an opportunity against the best team in the country, so we\u2019ll have to see how we do.\u201d\n\nNot much went right against the Terps (2-0), who scored six touchdowns in the first half, three in each quarter. The dominant performance - it was the most lopsided victory by an unranked team over a ranked team since Oklahoma beat No. 13 Texas A&M; 51-13 on Oct. 23, 1999 - knocked the Orange from their perch at No. 21 out of the AP Top 25, replaced in the same spot by Maryland.\n\nSyracuse defeated Liberty 24-0 on the road in its season opener the previous week. Babers was counting on a veteran defense and a superlative special teams unit to provide time for the Orange offense to develop behind redshirt sophomore Tommy DeVito, in his first year as the starting quarterback.\n\nWhen Andre Szmyt clanged an extra-point attempt off the left upright midway through the second quarter, that was a bad omen. It was the first career miss for Szmyt, the nation\u2019s top kicker last season, after 65 conversions in a row.\n\nBabers attributed the defense\u2019s poor showing in allowing 354 yards rushing and 650 yards overall - 7.8 per play - to miscommunication and bad tackling. Some examples : Maryland\u2019s Javon Leake scored untouched on a 64-yard run and averaged 15.3 yards on seven carries; Jake Funk averaged nearly 19 yards on five carries and scored once; and Anthony McFarland scored on a 20-yard run, also never touched by a defender.\n\nMaryland quarterback Josh Jackson said afterward that the goal was to try to make Syracuse quit, and he thought the Terps \u201cdid a good job at that.\u201d\n\nBabers disagreed.\n\n\u201cI thought the entire defense played extremely hard,\u201d Babers said. \u201cNow, playing hard and not being in the right place still adds up to the same score. There was effort. They didn\u2019t give up. But they were in the wrong place and the wrong calls, and there\u2019s missed tackles. And when there\u2019s not communication, when communication\u2019s not received and you miss your tackles, it\u2019s going to make it look really, really bad.\u201d\n\nDeVito went 28 for 39 for 330 yards and three touchdowns in his second career start, but he lost a fumble and threw an interception, and Maryland converted both turnovers into scores. On the season, DeVito is 45 of 74 for 506 yards with three TDs and three interceptions.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Eric Dungey, a powerful runner and one of the premier dual threat QBs in the country, DeVito\u2019s game is to set up in the pocket. He has been sacked six times and is not much of a threat to run, taking a big element from the offense that has been there in the past, and he\u2019s operating behind an offensive line that\u2019s dealing with a key injury to center Sam Heckel.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be OK. I think he\u2019s coming along great,\u201d Babers said of DeVito. \u201cHe\u2019s moving along at a pace that\u2019s acceptable to me. I think things are going to get better and better and better for us. I think we\u2019re right there where we\u2019re supposed to be.\n\nDungey stayed relatively healthy last season and led the Orange to a breakout 10-win season, its best in nearly two decades. But he missed 10 games with injuries in his college career and Babers wants to avoid that with the 6-foot-2, 212-pound DeVito.\n\n\u201cI think the big thing with him is he needs to be smart,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThe whole goal of your quarterback is not to get hurt. The key is whoever you start the season with, if you finish the season with him you have an opportunity for a fantastic season.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli in South Carolina contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Syracuse coach Dino Babers knows there's nothing like a knockout to get your attention.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/syracuse_maryland_football_05499_c0-203-4928-3076_s1770x1032.jpg?851f51b6135813e8f0fc2c85d5a4529f78fa139b", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
