Not only is he the top-projected performer against a Yelich-less Brewers offense, he\u2019s also one of the best dollar-for-dollar values at the position. He\u2019s likely to perform comparably to Jacob deGrom and Mike Clevinger while costing less. Over his last 12 starts, Flaherty has posted an absurd 0.80 ERA with 10.91 K/9 and an average of 6.5 innings per outing. The Brewers had a slightly below average offense before losing Yelich. Now they\u2019re borderline exploitable.\n\nAlso Consider: Jacob deGrom, Mike Clevinger, Madison Bumgarner, Dylan Cease (value), Felix Hernandez (value)\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nDaniel Murphy \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Eric Lauer)\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst basemen carry relatively modest projections tonight \u2013 partly because several of the big boppers at the position are in the early slate or have tough matchups. Murphy is set to face a neutral opponent at the most hitter friendly venue. While we usually avoid lefty-on-lefty matchups in DFS, Murphy and Lauer have steep reverse platoon splits this season. In both cases, we\u2019re looking at a small sample. At best, we can conclude that facing Lauer probably isn\u2019t detrimental to Murphy. The Rockies are likely to use him as their cleanup hitter. Multiple hits with run production are likelier than a home run.\n\nAlso Consider: Sean Murphy (value), Austin Hedges (value), J.T. Realmuto, Eric Hosmer (value), Pete Alonso\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nLuis Urias \u2013 San Diego Padres (at Peter Lambert)\n\nIt\u2019s not often you can snag a decent hitter with a bargain basement price at Coors Field. Urias is starting to make critical adjustments at the major league level which should eventually lead to solid-but-unspectacular performance. He\u2019s a ground ball hitter set to face a ground ball pitcher which would normally be a red flag. Lambert allows copious quantities of hard contact and line drives. Urias is very likely to supply multiple hits \u2013 hopefully with some run production. Unfortunately, he\u2019ll probably bat eighth in the lineup. Still, this is a good place to save cash without giving up much upside.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, Greg Garcia, Nick Solak, Ryan McMahon, Garrett Hampson (value), Chad Pinder (value)\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nNolan Arenado \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Eric Lauer)\n\nArenado is one of the top hitters in the slate, and he has the price to match. If you\u2019re looking to save money, Manny Machado has a similar projection at a cheaper price. Arenado is a top play thanks to his reputation as a lefty slayer. This season, he\u2019s batting .315/.420/.617 versus southpaws. That lines up with his career numbers too. As an added bonus, he\u2019s batting .356/.417/.665 at Coors Field. We can expect something on the order of a 1.100 OPS versus Lauer and friends.\n\nAlso Consider: Manny Machado (value), Matt Chapman (value), Garcia, Rafael Devers\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nTrevor Story \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Eric Lauer)\n\nOnce again, Machado is a viable alternative to this Rockies slugger if your platform allows it. Story is the top-projected hitter in the slate. While he\u2019s one of the pricier players available, he\u2019s also an excellent value. Unlike Arenado, Story doesn\u2019t have notable platoon splits. He\u2019s an equal opportunity masher with over a one-in-three chance for a home run. He\u2019s also perhaps the best bet for a multi-homer game.\n\nAlso Consider: Machado, Alex Bregman, Marcus Semien, Urias\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nTommy Pham \u2013 Tampa Bay Rays (at Jaime Barria)\n\nLet us escape the tyranny of Coors Field. Many of the outfielders playing there are among the top projections and values. Pham is also extremely attractive as a high floor, high ceiling pick. He\u2019ll face Barria, a fly ball pitcher who has been plagued by home runs (2.30 HR/9). Pham powers up against fly ball pitchers. He\u2019s ordinarily a multi-hit threat due to frequent hard contact at a low angle. However, he turns into a true slugger against pitchers like Barria. He has a one-in-four chance to homer.\n\nJaylin Davis \u2013 San Francisco Giants (vs Robert Dugger)\n\nDavis bats near the bottom of the Giants lineup. He\u2019s also the best dollar-for-dollar value in the slate. Use him to connect expensive Coors Field sluggers with valuable pitchers like Flaherty. He\u2019s a volatile ground ball hitter. His high strikeout rate and frequent wormburners are offset by an elite home run to fly ball ratio (HR/FB). In the minors, nearly half his fly balls left the yard. The best players in the majors manage around a 35 percent HR/FB rate. Dugger, at times throughout his minor career, has been a fly ball pitcher. Perhaps Davis will lift a fly ball or two.\n\nAlso Consider: Charlie Blackmon, Nick Martini (value), Austin Meadows, Wil Myers, Willie Calhoun, Josh Naylor (value), Mike Trout, Aristides Aquino, Yordan Alvarez, Josh Rojas (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Saturday, September 14.
