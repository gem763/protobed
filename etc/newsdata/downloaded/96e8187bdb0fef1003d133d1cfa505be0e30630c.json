Some of the videos reportedly targeted potential future fighters, with shots glorifying militants set to ISIS songs. Others seemed to target young girls, reportedly using the term \u201cjihad lover,\u201d and women calling themselves \u201cjihadist and proud.\u201d The videos also used TikTok\u2019s in-app features, like filters and hearts.\n\nPromoting terrorism is specifically banned under TikTok\u2019s community policy, which states that terrorist organizations and any other criminal organizations are banned from using TikTok.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider: \u201cContent promoting terrorist organizations has absolutely no place on TikTok. We permanently ban any such accounts and associated devices as soon as identified, and we continuously develop ever-stronger controls to proactively detect suspicious activity. This is an industry-wide challenge complicated by bad actors who actively seek to circumvent protective measures, but we have a team dedicated to aggressively protecting against malicious behavior on TikTok.\u201d\n\nRead more: Trading in your smartphone could be a \u2018ticking time bomb\u2019 for your personal data \u2013 here\u2019s how one expert says you can protect yourself\n\nThe Islamic State has recruited members through social media since the group\u2019s infancy, which has caused trouble for other tech companies like Facebook as it tries to delete content that promotes violence, in accordance with its community standards. TikTok now has thousands of content moderators in China and the US, according to the Journal.\n\nWhile other tech companies like Facebook have been criticized for not removing terrorist content \u2013 like footage from the Christchurch shooting \u2013 quickly enough, TikTok has reportedly been too quick to censor videos, especially those dealing with topics that might anger the Chinese government.\n\nEarlier this month, TikTok hired a US law firm, including two former lawmakers, to help it revise content moderation policies. The Guardian reported in September on internal documents from Chinese parent company ByteDance instructing moderators to censor content about controversial topics likely to upset the Chinese government, like Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence. Sen. Marco Rubio has since asked the federal government to investigate the company for censoring content at China\u2019s request.\n\nTikTok has wide reach as a propaganda tool. Parent company ByteDance is the highest-valued private company in the world, and in September, TikTok was the top free non-gaming app. One-third of the app\u2019s users are under 18, the Journal reported.", "description": "Business Insider - Members of the Islamic State have reportedly posted propaganda videos on TikTok of fighters and young women, which have since been deleted..
