(Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images)\n\nLisel Heise celebrated two major milestones this year.\n\nIn March, she turned 100. In May, she won her first election for political office.\n\nHeise is the oldest active politician in all of Germany, serving as a local council member in this western town of 8,000 known as \u201cKibo.\u201d\n\nHer story could have easily fed worries about the dominance of older generations in German politics: In what is one of the world\u2019s most rapidly aging countries, every third voter is over 60. And that\u2019s raised uncomfortable questions about how democracy can work when one cohort gains overwhelming and long-term political sway over others.\n\n\u201cDemographics shapes democracy,\u201d said Wolfgang Gruendinger, 35, author of the book \u201cOld Geezers Politics.\u201d \u201cIn Germany, many older politicians cannot relate to younger perspectives on the world anymore.\u201d\n\nBut instead, almost half a year after her victory, Heise is offering an example of how to avoid a generational clash.\n\nHer top-priority proposals are about improving the lives of young people as much as older residents. She wants a youth center and dance venue. She wants to cut down on cars and carbon emissions. She wants to reopen a shuttered swimming pool.\n\n\u201cWhen you imagine someone at that age, you might come up with the stereotype of a lovely, doddery and perhaps a bit indulgent elderly woman,\u201d said Maurice Conrad, 19, the youngest councilor in the nearby city of Mainz.\n\n\u201cInstead, she was more like: If nothing changes, then I\u2019ll just get involved myself and I\u2019ll call the shots,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cThat\u2019s something you would usually call youthful and rebellious.\u201d\n\nOn a recent afternoon, after refusing an offer to go by car, Heise bounded through the streets of Kibo on her way to the former pool.\n\n\n\nHeise wants to reopen the town\u2019s outdoor swimming pool, which closed in 2011.

(Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images)\n\nHer father taught her how to swim when she was 3, and he helped build the pool when he was a town council member. For decades, Heise \u2014 who briefly swam professionally before becoming a teacher \u2014 came to Kibo\u2019s pool almost every day. When it was closed in 2011, it was a shock, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked in the city, people would come up to me and ask: \u2018Can\u2019t you do anything about it?\u2019 \u201d Heise recalled, standing on the empty field where the pool once was.\n\nAt the time, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do. She attended official functions as a concerned citizen but says the microphone was shut off when she spoke. She felt like authorities wouldn\u2019t listen to her.\n\nIt was her son who suggested she run for office herself.\n\nHeise joined up with the left-leaning \u201cWe for Kibo\u201d political association, which sought to challenge the centrist coalition that had controlled town politics for decades.\n\nHow did she manage to win?\n\n\u201cMany residents of Kibo,\u201d she said with a wink, \u201cwere my students once upon a time.\u201d\n\nAnd now, Heise said, other town authorities have no choice but to take her seriously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to hit back sometimes,\u201d she said.\n\nHeise\u2019s youth was dominated by the rise of the Nazi regime, which brutally stifled any dissent. Her father was jailed for several weeks after he publicly criticized Nazi pogroms targeting Jews.\n\nThe Nazis also deemed Heise \u2014 a new teacher at the time \u2014 as too critical and temporarily transferred her to a different part of the country as punishment, she said. As a result, and after seeing what her father went through, she became cautious about speaking out. But after the war, she was able to embrace the freedom to express her political views more openly.\n\nIn her hillside house, Heise keeps swaths of books on her role models and the issues she cares most deeply about.\n\nBarack Obama? \u201cHe was amazing, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nClimate change? Don\u2019t let \u201ccrazy guys\u201d derail efforts to stop it.\n\nBrexit? Send those who advocate for it \u201cto the moon,\u201d she recently told reporters.\n\n\n\nLast month, Heise attends the first working session of the local city council since she was elected to the body in May. (Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images)\n\nSome in her town have watched with bemusement or confusion as Heise has become a world news commentator and national sensation. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit exaggerated \u2014 everything has been reduced to Lisel Heise,\u201d said Christian Fischer, 35, an engineer.\n\nBut to others, her life experience \u2014 combined with her humility and her conviction that she can make a difference \u2014 makes her someone they do not begrudge for being in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been able to find a number of allies, as she\u2019s advancing topics that are close to her heart,\u201d said Manfred Grill, 54.\n\nThe town\u2019s mayor, Marc Muchow, called her an \u201cicon who makes the town famous.\u201d\n\nAt a recent town council meeting, Heise followed the granular details of local politics until deep into the evening, listening in silence to most debates that were not among her own priorities. When she finally took the floor herself \u2014 urging councilors to take action against speeding drivers \u2014 she regained the passion residents here know from the many interviews she has given.\n\nTo Heise\u2019s dismay, not everyone agreed with her proposals that evening. When one councilor made a counterpoint, Heise swiftly intervened, saying, \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Heise and an ally, Thomas Bock, walked out of the town hall into a dark, cold night. As they were passing the deserted squares of Kibo, Heise appeared annoyed with the pace of the council debates and eager to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s lacking, somehow,\u201d she said, \u201cis speed.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nAt Germany\u2019s biggest car show, signs that Europe\u2019s biggest economy is stalling\n\nSame-sex penguin couples keep adopting eggs, and the Berlin Zoo is celebrating\n\nTrump impeachment proceedings trigger caution, and a little schadenfreude, overseas\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Lisel Heise won her first election as a town council member this year.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/58o3B7Fo0_7z3kv2u7dFh5e41y0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQ6TPGG6E4I6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
