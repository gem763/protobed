It added that Markram had left for home and no replacement has been called.\n\nMarkram admitted emotions had got the better of him but said that was no excuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to be going home on this note and I completely understand what I\u2019ve done wrong and take full accountability for it,\u201d the 25-year-old said in the statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable in a Proteas environment and to let the team down is what hurts me the most. I\u2019ve learned a lot from this and the other players I\u2019m sure, have learned from it as well.\n\n\u201cWe understand in sport that emotions run high and sometimes the frustration gets the better of you as it did for me, but like I said, it\u2019s no excuse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken full responsibility for it, I have apologised to the team and hopefully I can make it up to them and the people of South Africa soon.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident on Sunday, Australia all-rounder Mitchell Marsh broke his hand punching a dressing-room wall in frustration during a Sheffield Shield match and could be out of action for six weeks.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "South Africa opener Aiden Markram will miss the third and final test against India due to a wrist injury after he lashed out in frustration at his own performance in the previous match in Pune, the tourists said on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Markram.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
