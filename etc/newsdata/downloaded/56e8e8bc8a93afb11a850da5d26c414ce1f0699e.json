Rite Aid has effectively implemented NarxCare in 12 States, including all of its Pennsylvania locations.\n\nNarxCare utilizes, analyzes, and presents information from State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) to enable pharmacists to more efficiently and effectively identify and manage patients at risk for Controlled Substance Misuse and Abuse. NarxCare equips pharmacists with advanced analytics, tools, technology, and invaluable insights that are presented and accessed directly within Rite Aid\u2019s pharmacy management system. NarxCare also provides machine learning and artificial intelligence-based patient risk analysis in a visually interactive format to support pharmacists\u2019 dispensing decisions and state law compliance.\n\n\u201cNarxCare is another efficient and effective solution to help our pharmacists make responsible dispensing decisions, while mitigating possible controlled substance misuse or abuse,\u201d said Jocelyn Konrad, executive vice president, pharmacy and retail operations, Rite Aid. \u201cThe integration of NarxCare and PDMP information into our pharmacist\u2019s workflow empowers them to focus more on building relationships with patients and improving health and wellness across the communities they serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Rite Aid, patient safety and compliance are important priorities,\u201d said Rob Cohen, President, Appriss Health. \u201cWe applaud Rite Aid\u2019s efforts to rapidly deploy technologies to help reduce potential customer risk by leveraging the state PDMPs, utilizing an advanced analytics platform, and integrating these solutions seamlessly into their pharmacists\u2019 daily workflow.\u201d\n\nWhile pharmacists have access to PDMP information, it can be difficult to navigate and analyze. With NarxCare in place, pharmacists are able to identify potential problems up front, in real-time, for every customer, every time they consider a controlled substance dispensation. Pharmacists also have the support they need to better engage with their customers and determine the best course of action for them, while fulfilling their corresponding responsibility to ensure all controlled substances are filled for a legitimate medical purpose pursuant to a valid prescription within the scope of the prescriber\u2019s practice.\n\nAbout Rite Aid Corporation\n\nRite Aid Corporation, which generated fiscal 2019 annual revenue of $21.6 billion, is one of the nation's leading drugstore chains with 2,464 stores in 18 states and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) capabilities through EnvisionRxOptions and its affiliates.
