Centuries of extensions have culminated in a maze-like family home with a guard\u2019s room, dungeon cells, a baronial hall and a now-boarded escape tunnel.\n\n\n\nThe estate, located in the village of Rhynie, about an hour west of Aberdeen, hit the market on Thursday and spans 1,561 acres\u2014four and a half times the size of London\u2019s Hyde Park.\n\n\n\nAn ornate arched gateway constructed in the first half of the 18th century guards the castle entrance and bears the initials of members of the Gordon family, who built much of the estate and were its stewards for over 300 years.\n\n\n\nThere are even remnants of an original doorbell at the entryway, the sound of which would have rung out \u201cgiving off the impression of momentous occasion,\u201d according to the listing agents, Strutt & Parker.\n\n\n\nThe oldest portion of the castle features dramatic barrel-vaulted ceilings and centuries of heraldry, including family coats of arms from various generations of Gordons. It also contains most of the home's quirkiest architectural elements, including a historic guard\u2019s room on the ground floor, complete with an adjacent dungeon cell. There\u2019s also a co-called \u201cpriest hole\u201d\u2014a hiding place for clergy during a time when Catholics were persecuted\u2014and what is believed to be a now-blocked escape tunnel, according the listing agents.\n\n\n\nA spiral staircase from the ground floor leads to an impressive baronial hall that originally served as a chapel and up to the third and fourth floors, which contain two of the castle\u2019s nine bedrooms.\n\n\n\nThe Gordons added a substantial three-story wing overlooking the estate's walled garden in the 17th century. Today, it includes a library and another dizzying spiral staircase that ascends to four en-suite bedrooms. The most recent addition to the castle, in the early 1900s, created additional bedrooms and a new kitchen, according to the listing agents.\n\nBy the 1950s, the castle served as the home of Col. Alexander Barlas and Lady Gertrude Craik, and has remained in family hands for generations, according to the listing agents. The owners could not be reached for comment.\n\nFrom Penta: Banksy\u2019s Largest Work Heads to Auction\n\nThe castle isn\u2019t the only historical site on the property. There\u2019s also a B-listed sundial dating back nearly 200 years and a stone garden wall built in the 18th century, according to Historic Scotland.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-103116?width=1280"}
