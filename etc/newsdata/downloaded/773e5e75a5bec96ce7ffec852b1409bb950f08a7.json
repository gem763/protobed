When your team is too high in confidence, when they are becoming a little bit too much, you have to get them back to the middle again.\n\n\"At the moment, based on this interview, and based on what I\u2019ve seen in the game, I\u2019m not sure if he really knows how to find the buttons there.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nSky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp was also unsure of Solskjaer's attributes for the role in his analysis, as United slipped to 12th with just eight points from eight games.\n\n\"Whatever way you dress this up, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a very lucky man to get this job,\" Redknapp said.\n\n\"He managed Molde and he managed Cardiff . Is that really the credentials to manage one of the biggest clubs in the world? I don\u2019t think so.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\"Do you give him time? There comes a point where if this carries on, you can\u2019t, it is impossible. But the problem is, who is out there right now better than him?\n\n\"If you didn\u2019t know any better the next man you would be looking at is Jose Mourinho, and he had a go at it and he failed. This is a very difficult job right now.\"\n\nUnited now have a brief respite from their difficult patch due to the international break, but return to Premier League action on October 20 against rivals and league leaders Liverpool , who are looking to maintain their perfect start to the campaign.", "description": "Solskjaer was held to account for United's dismal showing at St James' Park but van Persie criticised his comments", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528372.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
