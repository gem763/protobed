But he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause once you have it, you need it.\u201d\n\nAnd when he couldn\u2019t get it, Tina Bojarski said, he turned to the streets. Last month, the 36-year-old died of a suspected overdose.\n\n\u201cThese doctors do this to people. This medication does this to people. And then what are they supposed to do?\u201d his stepmother said.\n\nPurdue has entered a proposed settlement with about half the states and 2,000 local governments, but attorneys general in Pennsylvania and many other states have come out against the deal, calling it insufficient. They vowed to continue litigation against the company and the family that owns it. Days after reaching the tentative settlement that could be worth up to $12 billion over time, Purdue filed for bankruptcy in White Plains, New York. The chairman of the board of directors said in a statement that the company would work with the plaintiffs \u201cto finalize and implement this agreement as quickly as possible,\u201d but several states plan to object to settlement in bankruptcy court.\n\nIn the meantime, communities are struggling with the personal toll wrought by the crisis as well as a ballooning tab for drug treatment, social services and law enforcement. Since 1999, opioids have killed about 400,000 Americans. U.S. drug overdose deaths climbed year after year for decades, topping 70,000 in 2017 before falling slightly last year.\n\nThe coroner serving the Columbus, Ohio, area reported nine overdose deaths in just 48 hours in July. Police in Norwalk, Connecticut, responded to eight overdoses - five fatal - over a six-day period in August and September.\n\nIn Wilson, North Carolina, where Purdue has a manufacturing plant, Jonathan Cannon took opioids before moving on to heroin. He died of an overdose at 26. At Cannon\u2019s 2015 funeral, his father, Mike Cannon, warned Jonathan\u2019s friends - who were also using - to go to rehab or risk meeting the same fate.\n\nOne of them did wind up in rehab, and she continues battling addiction, said her mother, Elizabeth Fenner.\n\nFenner said her 31-year-old daughter, Ashley, became addicted to Percocet so quickly after taking it at a party that she began shooting heroin within a month. Ashley has been in recovery for three years, but Fenner remains wary of the \u201cmanipulator\u201d who once stole her valuables to support her habit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just who she is,\u201d said Fenner, who had known Mike Cannon since high school. \u201cI really accept that she has the addiction, and I accept that it\u2019s a disease. But I\u2019m trying to work on the anger that comes out of this. I just don\u2019t understand parts of it and I never, ever, ever will because I haven\u2019t been there.\u201d\n\nAfter their son\u2019s death, Cannon and his wife launched a nonprofit group aimed at helping addicted people, but he said Purdue has never stepped up.\n\n\u201cWhere I really struggle more than anything is they realize they\u2019re a major contributor to the problem, but they\u2019re not rolling up their shirt sleeves and saying, \u2018Hey, let me get in here and help,\u2019\u201d Cannon said.\n\nState and local governments aren\u2019t waiting on potential Purdue settlement money before taking action, promoting \u201cwarm handoff\u201d policies that connect overdose survivors to immediate drug treatment, dramatically expanding distribution of the life-saving overdose-reversal drug naloxone and keeping better tabs on opioid prescribing.\n\nIn the wake of at least 16 fatal overdoses, Elk Grove Village, a community of 32,000 outside Chicago, launched a program in which addicted people can ask police officers and other municipal workers for help without fear of arrest, even if they have illegal drugs or paraphernalia. Drug treatment is offered regardless of ability to pay, and local employers commit to hiring graduates of the program.\n\nMayor Craig Johnson, who helped create the program, said 32 people have taken part, and 21 are \u201cstill clean and sober.\u201d\n\nOne of the success stories is Tom, a 54-year-old who owned a construction company before breaking his hip and leg in a fall and becoming addicted to painkillers. He eventually lost his company and his house.\n\n\u201cAll you do is spend your days looking for meds off the street because you don\u2019t want to detox. It was horrifying,\u201d said Tom, who has since completed Elk Grove Village\u2019s recovery program and landed work with a catering company. He did not want his last name used because he\u2019s now seeking a job in the medical field.\n\nGay said nearly all of the overdose deaths in York County this year involved heroin and fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that\u2019s 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine. In almost every case, the overdose victim started with prescription painkillers like OxyContin, she said.\n\n\u201cYou can see from their medical records how they were on prescription drugs for chronic sports injuries, pain,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is why so many counties are going after Big Pharma.\u201d\n\nIn Virginia, Scott Zebrowski became addicted to opioids after being prescribed OxyContin for a back injury.\n\nOn Feb. 28, 2017, Zebrowski, who was young, fit and managed a gym, took a pain pill a friend had given him. He didn\u2019t know it was laced with fentanyl. Zebrowski dropped dead in the parking lot of a Starbucks.\n\nJill Zebrowski, Scott\u2019s twin sister, who lives in Midlothian, Virginia, said she holds Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies responsible.\n\n\u201cI think they knowingly did this. They\u2019ve caused such pain and heartache for my family and so many others.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Emery P.
