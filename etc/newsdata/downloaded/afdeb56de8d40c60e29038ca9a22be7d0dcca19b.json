A press release said Biden was in charge for the company's legal affairs with international companies, but Biden has disputed that characterization. At the time, Burisma's founder faced multiple investigations into alleged tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nHunter Biden later stepped down from the board in April 2019 when his term expired.\n\nJoe Biden was part of a larger push coming from former President Obama's administration for the Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin to be removed over concerns of corruption in his office. Biden acted as a vocal opponent of Shokin and has publicly detailed his threat to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from the country if Shokin wasn't fired.\n\nHowever, it's since been reported that there was not an active investigation into Hunter when the former vice president made the push for Shokin's firing, and Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said this week that he had no evidence of wrongdoing against either Biden.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have been pushing a narrative suggesting that the Biden's were involved in corruption\n\nRudy Giuliani endorses Marco Rubio for Florida's open Senate seat during a campaign rally in Miami.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Associated Press\n\nThe Washington Post reported that two former US officials said Ukraine was at the center of the complaint, and a July 25 phone call between Trump and president-elect Volodymyr Zelensky has come into focus as a key potential piece in tracing the administration's efforts to influence Ukranian officials.\n\nRead more: A mysterious exchange between Trump and a foreign leader is Washington's latest obsession. Here's what is actually going on.\n\nAccording to an official statement on Zelensky's website from the time the July 25 call centered around Trump offering his congratulations to Zelensky over his recent election to the presidency. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump pressed Zelensky to probe Hunter Biden, at least eight times, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nTrump dismissed the reports, saying that he has \"conversations with many leaders.\"\n\n\"It's always appropriate, always appropriate,\" Trump said of his conversations. \"At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets in the days after the complaint was revealed, Trump denied the reports and repeated his claims about Biden executing a bribe.\n\nBiden issued a statement late Friday demanding Trump release the transcripts of the call, but Trump's Saturday morning tweets suggest he won't back down yet, ramping up the tensions as the 2020 contenders get closer to a tense election year.", "description": "Controversy has brewed for months among former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, Ukrainian authorities, Rudy Giuliani, and Trump.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8632952e22af7f83565d93-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
