He just said at least we don\u2019t need to have any more.\u2019\n\nBut their joy turned into heartbreak when doctors later recommended two of the babies be aborted.\n\nGeorge, identical twins Francesca and Fredrica and Grace were born at 31 weeks (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThey were given just days to make a decision after scans revealed one of the identical twins was taking her sister\u2019s blood supply.\n\nTracey decided to \u2018leave it up to nature\u2019 after seeking advice from a US doctor who had delivered 120 quads.\n\nThe former drugs counsellor added: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I\u2019d have chosen the termination.\u2019\n\nDespite the risks, she gave birth to George, Grace and identical twins Francesca and Fredrica in London on October 26 last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTracey said she had always been saving her mum\u2019s money \u2018for a rainy day\u2019 and thought her dream of having more children was the perfect way to use it.\n\nShe added: \u2018Mum always wanted one of her girls to have twins so I feel blessed that I was able to do that for her.\n\n\u2018She was a wonderful person, she would give you her last penny.\u2019\n\nTracey describes Francesca as a \u2018bossy boots\u2019 who sets off Fredrica if she cries.\n\nTracey and her roofer husband Stephen explored IVF after failing to conceive naturally (Picture: SWNS)\n\nShe says Grace \u2018is her own person, nice and placid\u2019, while George is \u2018laughing from when he gets up to when he goes to bed.\u2019\n\nDue to their premature birth, the babies are not yet crawling, and only began sitting up six weeks ago.\n\nTheir mother said: \u2018They will be mobile soon, but it doesn\u2019t bother me.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got a big playpen and I will use that for when I need to go and do something in the house.\u2019\n\nTracey tied the knot with roofer Stephen seven years ago after meeting in 2005.\n\nShe was a teenager when she had her older daughter and son and 28 when she had her third.\n\nMore than two decades later, she\u2019s noticed plenty of changes in her approach to parenting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018When you\u2019re young, you want to go out, go clubbing, go abroad and you get frustrated when you can\u2019t get a babysitter.\n\n\u2018But when you\u2019re older you\u2019re more relaxed and you\u2019ve got that out of your system. I want to enjoy the blessing I\u2019ve been given.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
