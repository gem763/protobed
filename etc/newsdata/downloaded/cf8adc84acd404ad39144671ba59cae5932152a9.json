Was that selfish \u2014 or great?", "language": "en", "text": "We had my son, Eddie, late in life, when I was 47 and my husband was 51. I remember wondering in those early years how we would fare as parents, given that we were older. I feared people would think we were my son\u2019s grandparents. What\u2019s happened instead is that I\u2019ll see grandparents my age with a child and mistakenly assume they\u2019re the parents.\n\nEven my son used to get confused. When he was one, I took him to the beach, and as he sat on the sand, watching a man in a floppy hat approach us, his face lit up. He thought it was his father. It was actually our neighbor, Paul, a retired cardiologist who is 70.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a small child. His vision isn\u2019t fully formed,\u201d I told my husband, Bruce. \u201cHe probably sees like insects do, like you\u2019re looking through a kaleidoscope.\u201d\n\nThere are practical issues with our age. For instance, my eyesight is deteriorating. Everything\u2019s become an approximation. My eyeliner looks bolder because I\u2019m no longer able to follow the contour of my lid so I keep drawing and redrawing the line, making it thicker and thicker with every stroke. I can\u2019t see my toe nails so I dab polish on them like I\u2019m stencil painting, coating the entire top of the toe because I know over time, the shower water will take off the excess. In restaurants, if I forget my reading glasses, I\u2019m left to order general food categories. \u201cI\u2019ll have fish.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019d like the chicken please.\u201d Subtleties about how it\u2019s cooked are lost.\n\nIt\u2019s not just my sight, however. It\u2019s my strength. And it wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t lift my baby son. It was that afterward, I couldn\u2019t lift my arms.\n\nWhen I was pregnant I had watched a woman push a baby in a carriage in the subway station, and when she reached a set of stairs, she lifted the carriage up in the air and ascended the steps easily, as if she were holding a carton of eggs or a couple of towels. I was walking behind her, carrying only a newspaper, and by the time I reached the top of the stairs, I was winded. I thought, this baby business is a younger woman\u2019s game. I could never understand how women carried their baby in a basket (that piece you would clip into the stroller) on their arm, like a purse. I had to use to both hands to heave it out of the stroller, like a kettle bell.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, I visited a friend who had two children and I accompanied her when she picked them up at their elementary school. The boy was young and sweet, but the girl looked at me suspiciously, almost with contempt. I thought she was wondering why someone as old as me would be pregnant.\n\n\u201cDo I look old to you?\u201d I asked. \u201cGo on. Tell me. If you saw me picking up one of your friends at school, would you think, casually, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s so-and-so\u2019s mother,\u2019 or would you think, \u2018That can\u2019t be so-and-so\u2019s mother. She\u2019s so old!\u2019 \u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember what she said because I don\u2019t think I really asked her. Given how preoccupied I was about being an older mom, I know I wanted to.\n\nNew York magazine once did a cover story on how an increasing number of people are having children in their fifties. The cover photo was a profile of a naked pregnant woman \u2014 a la Demi Moore\u2019s Vanity Fair naked and pregnant cover \u2014 but her face was that of a 60-something woman.\n\nThe article, \u201cParents of a Certain Age\u201d raised people\u2019s ire, but I think it was the photo that incited them to post 266 nasty comments on the magazine\u2019s website. I knew I shouldn\u2019t read them, that they would only make me feel bad as an older mother, but I was like that young priest in the movie, \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d who is warned not to listen to the devil who would try to speak to him through the young girl who was possessed, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He listened as the devil spoke to him in his mother\u2019s voice and asked him why he\u2019d left her to die. I poured through the comments on the magazine\u2019s Web page and read as they called older parents \u201cselfish!\u201d and said things such as \u201cMenopause is for a reason!\u201d\n\nOne commenter, writing under the pseudonym, Madworld, said, \u201cWhat could be more selfish than having a child when you will knowingly leave the child/children prematurely parentless or worse, unnecessarily burdened with having to care for your old, selfish ass?\u201d\n\nI posted a comment of my own, saying, \u201cI had a child at 47. I don\u2019t think I was selfish to do that. My child may be sad when his parents die earlier than those of his friends, and that\u2019s something that pains me, but hopefully all the love and caring and nurturing he gets before that point will make up for it.\u201d Five people gave my comment a \u201cThumbs Up,\u201d perhaps because they, too, had a child when they were older or knew someone who did.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t say in my comment \u2014 but have thought about \u2014 was that my father died when he was just 62, leaving me fatherless at 38. He missed my wedding. He never met my son. It broke my heart. But he had his children young. It\u2019s all a crap shoot.\n\nIn some ways, Eddie is lucky to have older parents. With age comes a maturity, a centeredness, a sense of perspective and well-being that younger parents may not have. At least in theory. We also wanted him so badly, having gone without him for so long, the way someone stranded on a desert island might appreciate his first meal back home, that it\u2019s hard to imagine he could be more loved.\n\nHe will also benefit from the fact that my husband and I grew up at a time when the world seemed more innocent, a safer place, when people played kickball at the bus stop and you could trick or treat without an escort, when music had sweeter words, getting into college was not something a child prepared for starting in middle school (and when plastic bags at the grocery store weren\u2019t so thin they ripped right through when you stuck an ear of corn inside). There was a sense of realness, a presence, an innocence, in the world when we grew up that made us less worried or determined or directed.\n\nMy son eats breakfast to Cat Stevens and Leonard Cohen and dinner to Simon and Garfunkel and Neil Young. He learned to dance to Santana, with me bouncing his dirty little feet on the butcher block table that I did not rub with an antimicrobial liquid afterward, and when he was upset, we put on Marlo Thomas\u2019s CD \u201cFree to Be . . . You and Me,\u201d and it calmed him. He now plays pinball and Pong at a local vintage video arcade, and hopefully, I\u2019ll convince him to play me in \u201cAsteroids.,\u201d a space-themed video game from the 1970s that they have at our local arcade.\n\nI wrote an article the other day on how children as young as 8 are increasingly attempting suicide and how some experts blame it on the bullying and alienation that occur on social media.\n\nMy son, now 8, won\u2019t have those high-tech social issues because he\u2019s not getting an iPad or a phone until he\u2019s 30. My husband and I decided that early on, particularly after seeing a couple in a diner with a young boy, who sat glued to his iPad wearing headphones the entire meal. We thought, Why have a child?\n\nWhen my son was small, I would sometimes sit on the kitchen floor with him and telephone him on a gourd I\u2019d plucked out of a bowl full of squash and potatoes that sat on my counter.\n\n\u201cDing-a-ling-a-ling,\u201d I\u2019d say, holding the S-shaped gourd to my ear. \u201cHello? You want to speak to Edwin Joseph? Why he\u2019s right here.\u201d And while he\u2019d never seen an old-style landline, he\u2019d hold his head to the earpiece with great anticipation, for a voice that had requested his presence. It was the first of many cultural references that would exist only inside our home.\n\nAs I sat at my computer this morning, I thought about a mom who recently told me she was helping her son move into a new apartment while he attends graduate school. I then did what I always do: advanced maternal age calculus. If I\u2019m 55 now and my son is 8, when he\u2019s in graduate school, I\u2019ll be nearly 70. I envision myself helping my son unpack his clothes in his new dorm room, and I think, \u201cGeez, if I\u2019m afraid people think I\u2019m my son\u2019s grandmother now, they\u2019ll most assuredly think it then.\u201d\n\nJust then my son, still in his pajamas, lies down on the couch next to me, and waiting for me to cover him with a blanket says, \u201cMommy, can you tuck me in?\u201d And all thoughts of age and distinction dissipate.\n\nRead more\n\nHe\u2019s 26 years old and still seeing his pediatrician: Why some adults don\u2019t move on.\n\nI constantly fumed at \u2018selfish\u2019 drivers, rude cellphone uses, slow walkers \u2014 and then I learned a lesson\n\n\u2018Should I freeze my eggs?\u2019: A doctor\u2019s second opinion made all the difference", "description": "\u201cWith age comes a maturity, a centeredness, a sense of perspective and well-being. .\u2009.\u2009.
