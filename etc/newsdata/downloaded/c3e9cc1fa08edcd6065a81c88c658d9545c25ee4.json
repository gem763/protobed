His rent was always paid, along with other utilities, and he would see me weekly.'\n\nShe added: 'Anthony is at rest now and will not suffer anymore pain.\n\n'The really sad thing is that it cost me almost the same amount of money to pay for his death that it would have to have private dental treatment.'\n\nPC Simon Collins told the hearing at Winchester Coroner's Court police had been called by Mr Hoskins's mother, who said she had not heard from him for a couple of days and he had gone home from work with an illness the previous week.\n\nOfficers forced entry into his top-floor flat and found him dead in his bedroom.\n\nA bank receipt found in the address showed Mr Hoskins was overdrawn by \u00a33,000.\n\nHe was often asking for overtime at work in the weeks prior to his death, the inquest heard.\n\nA statement from Dr Gabriella Day, of Burgess Road Surgery, said Mr Hoskins had last visited the practice in August 2018 with a tooth ache complaint.\n\nPathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes carried out a post mortem and provided a cause of death as hanging.\n\nActing area coroner Samantha Marsh recorded a conclusion of suicide.", "description": "Anthony Hoskins, 38, was found dead in his flat in Southampton by police on April 3.
