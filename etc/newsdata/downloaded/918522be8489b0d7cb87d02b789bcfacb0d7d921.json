The stock gained 3.8 per cent in the quarter, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 1.2 per cent.\n\nThe company's shares have jumped this year on optimism about the cloud business. The stock is also being helped by some investors' belief that Microsoft is a safer bet as US and European regulators sharpen their scrutiny of other large technology firms, including Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nMicrosoft's market capitalisation rose above $US1 trillion briefly in April and returned to that level in June. Apple overtook Microsoft as the most valuable publicly traded US company earlier this month.\n\nMicrosoft said commercial cloud revenue rose 36 per cent to $US11.6 billion. Margins widened by 4 points to 66 per cent, \"driven by material improvement in Azure gross margin\", the company said in a slide deck posted on its website. Microsoft doesn't break out Azure revenue separately or comment on whether that business is profitable.\n\nKeith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects commercial cloud sales of $US48 billion for the 12 months that end June 30, rising to $US79 billion in fiscal 2022. He also expects continued improvement in margins as increasing use of Microsoft's cloud data centers allows the company to run the services more efficiently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They're doing a good job with the move to the cloud,\" Synovus's Morgan said. \"Of all the old smokestack tech companies -- you look at IBM, you look at Oracle -- of all those companies, Microsoft is the one that has done a really good job.\"\n\nSales of Windows to PC makers rose 9 per cent. Surface revenue declined 4 per cent, in part because the company introduced new models for the holiday season after the end of the first quarter.\n\nMicrosoft still gets more than 15 per cent of its sales from Windows, and that business remains heavily dependent on the cycle of companies replacing PCs.\n\nIn the September quarter, global shipments of personal computers increased 1.1 per cent, Gartner said earlier this month, fuelled by businesses upgrading to the latest Windows operating system.\n\nMicrosoft is ending support for Windows 7, which was released in 2009, in January, meaning companies need to upgrade to Windows 10 if they want to continue to receive updates and service on their systems.\n\nThe older software's expiration is also helping boost sales of the company's Microsoft 365 bundle, which includes Windows and Office cloud software such as Word, Excel and Teams, Microsoft's rival to Slack Technologies's product.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Demand for Azure cloud-computing programs and internet-based versions of Office productivity software bolstered Microsoft's bottom line.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3381%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_586%2C$y_102/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aaa79e459f53d415fe25d474023d041d4ece7046", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
