Mr Furnish is pictured with Sir Elton and their children Elijah Furnish-John and Zachary Furnish-John\n\nFour years after the couple adopted their sons Elijah and Zachary, the boozing had become so severe that Sir Elton feared they would split up.\n\n\u2018It all came to a head in Los Angeles in 2014, two days before I was due to start a US tour\u2026 David was feeling low and wanted me to stay the extra night with him. I said no. We had a huge row, I went anyway,\u2019 Sir Elton writes.\n\n\u2018The next morning, David called and we had a row that made the previous day\u2019s row look like a light-hearted disagreement over what to have for lunch: the kind of argument where you come off the phone teary and reeling, where things are said that make you wonder whether the next time you communicate it\u2019ll be through lawyers.\n\n\u2018In fact, the next time I heard from David, he had checked himself into a rehab clinic in Malibu. I was pleased he was getting treatment.\u2019\n\nWhen Mr Furnish left rehab, Sir Elton \u2013 who has endured his own well-publicised battle with drink and drugs \u2013 joined him at his Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nBorn in Canada, Mr Furnish met Sir Elton in 1993 \u2013 three years after the star had given up alcohol.\n\nFour years later, the advertising executive and film-maker directed Elton John: Tantrums & Tiaras, a TV documentary about his then boyfriend that was nominated for a Bafta award.\n\nIn his racy new autobiography, Me, Sir Elton writes: \u2018I always thought David had slipped into Elton John World with remarkable ease and confidence, but it turned out that a lot of things I was completely used to living with, that I just saw as a fact of life, made him completely anxious'. Sir Elton is pictured above at the premiere of the film he co-produced, Rocketman\n\nHe also co-produced Rocketman, the hit biographical musical film based on Sir Elton\u2019s life which was released earlier this year.\n\nRecalling his own once-rampant addiction to cocaine, Sir Elton writes in the book: \u2018My appetite for the stuff was unbelievable \u2013 enough to attract comment in the circles I was moving in. Given that I was a rock star spending a lot of time in Seventies Los Angeles, this was a not inconsiderable feat.\n\n\u2018Because I was doing coke, I wasn\u2019t a rational human being any more. You become unreasonable and irresponsible, self-obsessed, a law unto yourself.\u2019", "description": "David Furnish took to drink after struggling to live in the public eye and suffering loneliness because Sir Elton was away on tour so much.
