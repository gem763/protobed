At Columbine, Katrina, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, 9/11, and every life-altering event along the way. I have met leaders, heroes, and victims of all stripes.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"Even in our currently polarized nation, it's my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive.\"\n\nSmith's Fox colleagues appeared stunned by Smith's announcement on Friday.\n\n\"Whoa,\" Neil Cavuto, whose show airs immediately after Smith's, said at the beginning of his program on Friday. \"I'm a little stunned and a little heartbroken. I don't know what to say. Shepard Smith, as I said just a few days ago on this very network, a decent human being ... a better newsman, you probably cannot find ... I'm sorry if I'm a little shell-shocked here, but I'm going to miss my buddy.\"\n\n\"I first worked with Shep on my first assignment at @FoxNews almost 23 years ago,\" Bret Baier, another Fox host, tweeted on Friday. \"It was a total shock today to find out he's leaving. He anchored breaking news -fast-moving events \u2014 better than anyone.\"", "description": "The Fox News host Shep Smith, who has long reported critically on President Donald Trump and his administration, is resigning from Fox after 23 years.", "authors": ["Eliza Relman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0dea94af909246047d802?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
