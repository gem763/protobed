And it revealed late last week that it\u2019s also doubling the damages that it\u2019s seeking to $300 million.\n\n\u201cSince filing this lawsuit we have now discovered more than double the number of songs for which the plaintiffs\u2019 songwriters were never paid by Peloton,\u201d NMPA President and CEO David Israelite said in a statement to Forbes. \u201cThe fact that Peloton has gone this long without proper music licenses is astounding.\u201d\n\nThe Verge reported that the NMPA found these additional tracks through legal discovery. \u201cNewly discovered works include some of the most famous and popular songs ever recorded, such as [Ray Charles\u2019] \u2018Georgia On My Mind,\u2019 \u2018I Can See For Miles,\u2019 and [the Beatles\u2019] \u2018I Saw Her Standing There,\u2019\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nPeloton IPO: 5 things to know about the interactive exercise-machine company\n\nPeloton is countersuing the NMPA for anticompetitive behavior, telling MarketWatch in a statement that, \u201cOn the eve of court-ordered mediation, NMPA sought to alter the optics around its lawsuit by filing exaggerated new claims prior to the mediation while also transparently timing its filing to capitalize on Peloton\u2019s inability to publicly respond in detail during our quiet period. We will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims.\u201d\n\nThe new claims come as Peloton gears up for its initial public offering. Last week it set a target share price of $26 to $29, and revealed it wants to raise more than $1 billion by selling at least 40 million shares.\n\nPeloton has sold more than half a million in-home stationary bikes (around $2,200 apiece) and treadmills ($4,295) that connect to streaming fitness classes, although what CEO John Foley says his company really sells is \u201chappiness.\u201d He described Peloton as a technology company, a media company, a software company, a product-design company, a retail company, an apparel company and \u201ca social connection company\u201d over calling it an exercise company. It\u2019s valued at about $8 billion.\n\nRelated: This is the insane amount millennials are spending on fitness\n\nBut one of its biggest risks, it said in its almost 200-page filing with the SEC, is its pricey workout playlists. Peloton\u2019s virtual sweat sessions have become popular in large part due to the hit songs that spin during workouts. And Peloton revealed that licensing music over the last three years has run up a $50.6 million tab, and that it had three long risk factors related to its ability to properly license music \u2014 which was more risks than it disclosed for cybersecurity and data management, even.\n\n\u201cUnlike music streaming services, where having an exhaustive music catalog is vital to be able to compete for customers, we have control over what music we select for our classes,\u201d it said in its filing. \u201cAs a result, we expect to be able to manage music expense such that, over time, these fees as a percentage of subscription revenue will flatten, or even decrease.\u201d", "description": "Music publishers have doubled claims against the online exercise company for spinning songs without proper licensing.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR379_Peloto_ZG_20190916122155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
