Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2013 in making the case for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump \u2013 falsely claimed on Tuesday that the Mueller report showed that the president obstructed justice, despite that the former special counsel made no such determination.\n\nThe CNN/New York Times debate opened with a question on impeachment, and Warren said her call for an impeachment inquiry began with the results from the Mueller report, which showed no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nShe said she read the entire Mueller report and added, \u201cWhen I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare-thee-well that this president had obstructed justice and had done it repeatedly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that moment, I called for an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn\u2019t happen, and look what happened as a result,\u201d Warren continued, accusing Trump of breaking the law in the summer and the fall:\n\nDonald Trump broke the law again in the summer. Broke it again this fall. You know we took a Constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.\n\nHowever, Mueller made no such determination on obstruction of justice. He made that point clear during his testimony before lawmakers in July.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nHis correction came during his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, in reference to comments he made at an earlier hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee to Lieu. Lieu asked him, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask you, the reason again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?\u201d Mueller responded, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d After Mueller\u2019s response, Democrats latched on to his comment as evidence that Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice and that Mueller would have charged him if it were not a Justice Department legal office opinion.\n\nMueller corrected the record after the fact, reiterating that he did not make a determination on obstruction of justice:\n\n#Mueller correcting his earlier remark to Rep. Ted Lieu that suggested he would have indicted Trump if it weren\u2019t for the OLC opinion: \u201cThat is not the correct way to say it.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tfgcOUGiZf \u2014 Kristina Wong \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@kristina_wong) July 24, 2019\n\nMueller stated:\n\nI want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. [Ted Lieu (D-CA] \u2014 who said, and I quote, \u2018You didn\u2019t charge the president because of the [Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)] opinion.\u2019 That is not the correct way to say it.\n\n\u201cAs we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,\u201d he added.\n\nAttorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that \u201cthe evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
