I\u2019ve been eating cake a lot. But I hope I\u2019ll start to lose it now.\u2019\n\nThe star said she gets \u2018upset\u2019 that so many young people are \u2018obsessed with diets and magic potions\u2019.", "description": "Prue said Li-Da made the move because she felt her own adoption had been 'so successful', prompting the famous cook to feel 'proud'.", "authors": ["Harry Howard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/09/19914134-0-image-a-2_1571472469625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
