Week 1", "language": "en", "text": "In all, Baltimore piled up a franchise record 643 yards of offense, with their 59 points tying the 2012 New England Patriots for the highest score in a game of the past eight seasons, according to Pro Football Reference. The last team to break 60 points was the New Orleans Saints, who did it in a 62-10 win over Indianapolis in 2012.\n\nMarquise Brown, the rookie wide receiver who paced the Ravens with 147 receiving yards and two touchdowns, said he had heard the talk about Jackson\u2019s limitations but never saw anything wrong with the young quarterback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he got here and showed what he can do,\u201d Brown said.\n\nIt would not be wise to draw too many conclusions in a game against the Dolphins, but Baltimore, bolstered by the addition of Mark Ingram II at running back, showed an incredible amount of balance, with 378 yards on the ground and 265 through the air. Only two teams in N.F.L. history \u2014 the 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers and the 1950 Los Angeles Rams \u2014 had ever surpassed 350 passing yards and 250 rushing yards in the same game.\n\nThe Ravens did not commit a turnover, and were able to come away with Jackson fairly unscathed, as he carried the ball as a runner just three times and endured just one sack.\n\nThe Dolphins got one touchdown pass out of the veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick, but had turned to the newly-acquired Josh Rosen by the end of the game. Neither made any sort of dent in Baltimore\u2019s terrific start to the season.", "description": "The Cowboys looked sensational, the Patriots and the Chiefs rolled and the Chargers survived. But the big story was Lamar Jackson leading the Ravens to 59 points. \u201cNot bad for a running back,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/sports/08nfl-live-ingram/08nfl-live-ingram-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
