In the future, we could expect to see the share of \u2018eco active\u2019 shoppers rising in countries that experience growing gross domestic product.\u201d\n\nThe poll of more than 65,000 people showed that consumers in western Europe were most likely to seek to reduce their environmental impact, while a majority of the population in Asia and Latin America has little to no interest in the issue.\n\nChile is the exception in Latin America and the country with the most environmentally engaged consumers in the world, with 37% of those surveyed actively taking trying to make a change.\n\nAustria and Germany have the next most concerned shoppers, with Britain not far behind, Kantar said, predicting that sales of fresh meat in Britain could drop by up to 4% in the next two years if environmentalism keeps spreading.\n\n\u201cOur study shows there is high demand for eco-friendly products that are competitively priced and readily available.\u201d\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last month that global meat consumption must fall to curb global warming and that plant-based foods could contribute to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThere has been an explosion of companies offering alternatives to meat, such as California-based Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, while food giants like Nestle are also launching plant-based burgers.\n\nKantar said 48% of shoppers want consumer goods companies to do more to cut plastic waste.\n\nIt noted that dozens of companies - including giants like Nestle, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Walmart and Carrefour - have signed a pledge to make their packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.", "description": "Consumers worried about the environment are cutting their spending on meat and bottled drinks and trying to reduce plastic waste, and this trend is set to accelerate as climate concerns mount, a global survey showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428313269&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8912Z", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
