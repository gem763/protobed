It didn't matter who,\" Thomas told AP. \"I didn't even have a plan. But I have all this training as a Marine, and all I could think was, 'My city is in need.'\"\n\nAround the same time in Wilton, Connecticut, Dave Karnes was working in his office at Deloitte watching the attack unfold on TV.\n\n\"We're at war,\" the former Marine staff sergeant said to his colleagues, before telling his boss he might not be back for a while, according to Slate. He went and got a haircut, changed into his Marine uniform, and drove toward New York City at 120 miles per hour.\n\nOnce both Marines reached the collapsed towers \u2014 the site now covered in ash and debris \u2014 they began searching for survivors, but first, they found each other. They had little gear with them besides flashlights and a military entrenching tool, AP reported.\n\nAlong with other first responders, the pair climbed over the dangerous field of metal, concrete, and dust, calling out, \"United States Marines! If you can hear us, yell or tap!\"\n\nAccording to Stripes:\n\n\"When they reached a depression in the rubble of what had been the south tower, he said, 'I thought I heard someone. \u2026 So I yelled down and they replied back that they were New York Port Authority police officers. 'They asked us not to leave them.'\" \"Karnes told Thomas to get to a high point to direct rescuers to the site, then called his wife and sister on his cell phone and told them to phone and give the New York police his location.\"\n\nThe two officers, William Jimeno and John McLoughlin, were on the main concourse between the towers when the South Tower began to fall, but made it into a freight elevator before the collapse. They were alive but seriously injured, trapped approximately 20 feet below the surface.\n\nAccording to USA Today, once they heard the voices of the Marines, Jimeno began shouting the code for officer down: \"8-13! 8-13!\" After they were located amid the unstable mountain of debris, it took rescue workers roughly three hours to dig out Jimeno, and another eight to reach McLoughlin, who was buried further down.\n\nAn exhausted Thomas, who never gave his first name, left the site after Jimeno was rescued, but returned to Ground Zero for the next 2 1/12 weeks to help. His identity was a mystery until after Oliver Stone's 2006 film \"World Trade Center\" chronicled the rescue of the officers, and Thomas emerged from the shadows.\n\nKarnes also left after Jimeno came up, but helped at the site for another nine days. After he returned to Connecticut, he went to his reserve center and reenlisted, and later served two tours of duty in Iraq.", "description": "Read the inspiring stories of people who heard the call of duty and went above and beyond to help save lives.", "authors": ["Paul Szoldra", "We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/55f2ea779dd7cc24008b9a42-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2017-09-11"}
