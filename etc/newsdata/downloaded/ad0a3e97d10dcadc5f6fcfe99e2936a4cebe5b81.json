It takes 53min if you haven't done so yet. If you only care about M*.com you could stop in the first 1/3, but to understand where M* is headed, and likely premium, you may want to spend the extra minutes. It is pretty clear the 1-pager pdf isn't coming back to M*.com premium.\n\nThe webinar has examples of mainly what Morningstar Advisor Workstation does for you and that's why I'm saying the 1-pager pdf isn't coming back. The \"FINRA-audited\" examples of the new similar 1-pager is 10 pages long, a lesser, but different first page and 9 pages of compliance, glossary, and the typical YMMV language. The fund vs fund new report shows 1/2 page of 2 funds on page 1 and 2, and then 8 more pages of compliance, glossary, and small print.\n\nI can see the benefit for M* advisor workstation and they dodged a question about cost. From filings we know 180k+ users generate $90M of revenue so it's $500ish. Volume discounts apply and it needs to cost around $2k (guess) to fit below the new $5k Office and $11k M* Direct subscriptions.\n\nThey confirmed that featuers that used to be in M*.com are all in Advisor Workstation. Answers to other questions were fairly half-hearted. The good news is I don't have to ask any more hard questions of them. They've got bigger fish to fry.\n\nI dawned on me that premium members are about as important to them as the apple pie is to McD's. Advisors, Brokers, and Money Managers are the burgers, fries, AND drinks.", "description": "I registered and watched the webinar advertised to take place on Aug 27.
