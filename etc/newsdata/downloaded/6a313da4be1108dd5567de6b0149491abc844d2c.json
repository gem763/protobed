Coal Black Mornings was an anti-rockstar chronicle, dedicated to his eccentric childhood on a housing estate in Haywards Heath in Sussex; his gruff, depressive, Liszt-obsessed father; his arty, stifled mother; his first forays into music and creativity. It detailed the early days of Suede, in the late 1980s and early 90s, the poverty, the failures, the bad decisions and inept songwriting. It ended, with admirable perversity, the day the band got signed.\n\nDistancing devices, and their invitations to read between the lines, imbue this book with an almost novelistic quality\n\nThe book was at times a little unpolished, but it brimmed with emotional authenticity and a kind of studied guilelessness: Anderson above all wanted to avoid a hackneyed inventory of salaciousness and surfeit, the usual tale of \u201ccoke and gold discs\u201d. But he had a problem \u2013 the memoir was a success. And the publishers, presumably, wanted more. Now he has gone back on his word, producing \u201cthe book I said I wouldn\u2019t write\u201d.\n\nAfternoons With the Blinds Drawn follows Anderson through the next decade of triumph and disintegration. It begins with the motley crew-members \u201cblinking from the debris of our rented rooms\u201d into the glare of celebrity. In 1992 Suede were hailed by Melody Maker as the best new band in Britain. They were yet to release their debut single. Some saw them as overhyped poseurs; others lauded their androgynous aesthetic, their David Bowie and Lloyd Cole-influenced blend of leftfield rock, wiry pop and punkish lullaby, their songs of love in the gutter, jealousy and dissipation, trash and glitz.\n\nAnderson developed a distinctive (and easy to parody) lexicon of urban decay and addled ardour, and, following the band\u2019s eponymous first album \u2013 assisted by guitarist and fellow songwriter Bernard Butler \u2013 branched out to produce the gutsily wide-ranging second album Dog Man Star (1995), filled with soaring choruses, virtuosic guitar solos and, at one point, a 40-piece orchestra. Rolling Stone derided it as \u201cpretentious\u201d; fans lapped it up. By this stage Butler had jumped ship. Yet the next album, Coming Up (1996), proved they could do it without him. Further fame, infamy and fractiousness were to come. Not to mention lots and lots of drugs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The band split in 2003 \u2013 where this memoir ends \u2013 only to reform in 2010.\u2019 Brett Anderson at home in Notting Hill, 2002. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\nAnderson writes with a combination of guarded introspection and detachment that will be familiar to readers of the earlier book. In many ways he has stayed true to his promise: this is not a tale of glamour and stardom, of backstage shenanigans and adoring fans. The author is less concerned with the events themselves than with the atmosphere that produced them, what he refers to as \u201cthe machinery that whirrs away, often unseen \u2026 to create the bands that people hear\u201d.\n\nHe is under no illusions about the contract between artist and audience (\u201cany performance is essentially an elitist act\u201d), and writes lucidly about the construction of his persona, the \u201cunholy loop\u201d of reflection and refraction as he posed for a media that fed its portrayal back into him (\u201cI don\u2019t think I was ever particularly in control\u201d). He is very good on the imaginative mechanics of his songwriting, on the relationship between his lyrics and the music, on the way a band can work together, and apart, on the lengths gone to between the spark of inspiration and a piece\u2019s layered construction in a studio.\n\nHe is generally more rueful than celebratory, and is especially self-critical about the curation of his albums. As he acknowledges, several of Suede\u2019s best numbers were B-sides. His \u201clightest\u201d, poppiest hit, \u201cShe\u2019s in Fashion\u201d, was \u201cborn from the ravages of utter despair\u201d; the chart top-fiver \u201cElectricity\u201d is \u201cshouty, pointless, hollow \u2026 signifying absolutely nothing\u201d. His favourite lyric is \u201cAsphalt World\u201d and the song he\u2019d choose to define his work is \u201cThe Wild Ones\u201d. He is sober about his ability: \u201cI\u2019m not an especially talented musician nor an artistic visionary nor even a particularly gifted storyteller \u2026 I simply never give up.\u201d\n\nThere was debauchery, but Anderson does not glory in the details. His overriding mode is euphemism: \u201cInevitably we overdid it.\u201d Crack cocaine and heroin are never mentioned; the philandering remains in the shadows; names are never dropped. He observes himself with a cold eye: \u201cI staggered between bizarre dalliances and sticky, gaudy dramas \u2026 I was trapped in a Futurist painting\u201d.\n\nBrett Anderson: \u2018I had started my musical journey wanting to be the quiet one at the back\u2019 Read more\n\nThese distancing devices, and their invitations to read between the lines, imbue this book with an almost novelistic quality. Afternoons With the Blinds Drawn is most memorable for its mood. Anderson may be no \u201cvisionary\u201d but he is gifted at creating worlds. Here, he conjures a cracked and confused persona, fumbling his way through a bizarre early adulthood, by turns gleefully hedonistic and wantonly self-destructive, hardworking and profligate, egotistical and insecure, a character more likely to be seen shuffling around in a dressing-grown smoking fags and staring out the window than prancing on the stage.\n\nHe achieves his effects with a Suede-ish patterning of recurring words: \u201cenervating\u201d, \u201cvisceral\u201d, \u201cintoxicating\u201d, \u201cartificial\u201d, \u201cscruffy\u201d, \u201cbrittle\u201d. Sometimes he overdoes it; at worst his prolixity carries shades of Russell Brand (\u201cthose denizens of the upper echelons\u201d; \u201cthe Dionysian sagas of glut and madness\u201d). But at its best, Anderson\u2019s writing feels fresh and distinctive. Following their disappointing fourth and fifth albums the band split in 2003 \u2013 where this memoir ends \u2013 only to reform in 2010. Suede\u2019s subsequent three albums have been increasingly impressive. Their live performances have bristled with energy. Afternoons With the Blinds Drawn is another milestone in a flourishing latterday career.\n\n\u2022 Afternoons with the Blinds Drawn by Brett Anderson is published by Little, Brown (RRP \u00a318.99).
