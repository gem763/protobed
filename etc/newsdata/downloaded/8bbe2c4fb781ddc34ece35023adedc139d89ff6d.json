I\u2019m not an extension of the PR department.\u201d He added: \u201cI never partake in the wine or cookies during an intermission. I don\u2019t like to socialize.\u201d\n\nReviewing a televised broadcast of the Three Tenors\u2019 inaugural concert, at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome in 1990, Mr. Bernheimer wrote: \u201cLuciano Pavarotti, waving his trademark white tablecloth, had agreed to a little public celebration of the World Cup in company with a few friends: fellow tenorissimos Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras; a flashy and shameless, ever-accommodating maestro, Zubin Mehta; plus two \u2014 count \u2019em, two \u2014 orchestras, one local and one from Florence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe three pirates of the High Cs seemed to be in a jovial mood for their multizillion dollar reunion,\u201d he added. \u201cThey did a lot of mutual hugging, along with a lot of mutual mugging. Occasionally they pretended to be self-effacing. Mehta and his unwieldy bands followed the varied vocal whims with reasonable respect.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernheimer had a long history with Mehta, who had been named music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1962, three years before Mr. Bernheimer became the music critic at the Times. Looking back on Mr. Bernheimer\u2019s coverage in 2017, Mehta was blunt: \u201cEvery Saturday morning I was crucified.\u201d\n\nIt was a complicated situation. Dorothy Chandler, wife of former Times publisher Norman Chandler, had worked tirelessly to build the Music Center as an appropriate home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. (Its main building was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.) Her son Otis had recently been named the publisher of the Times, and Mr. Bernheimer could find little to praise in Mehta, the young maestro.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMrs. Chandler was depressed beyond reason but for her son, this was all freedom of the press,\u201d Mehta recalled. \u201cShe would talk to the son about it all because you know, her great love was the orchestra.\u201d Otis Chandler stood by his critic and Mr. Bernheimer remained the Times\u2019s music critic until 1996.\n\nAD\n\nIt would be unfair to suggest that Mr. Bernheimer was always negative. At his best, he could combine widely differing opinions in a complicated and delicious prose. Even something so cut and dried as a season announcement from an opera company could come to life.\n\n\u201cVirtually unpredictable . . . \u2014 and all the more beguiling for it \u2014 are the prospects for \u2018Die \u00c4gyptische Helena,\u2019 which is opening on March 15,\u201d he once wrote in the Financial Times. \u201cRichard Strauss wrote this sprawling, convoluted, gloriously glittery, quasi-kitschy and shamelessly rapturous ode to an imaginary Helen of Troy back in 1928. . . . This \u2018\u00c4gyptische Helena\u2019 may be wonderful. It may be awful. Either way, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo those who knew only Mr. Bernheimer\u2019s prose, it came as a surprise to learn that he was a gentle, gracious and tender man to his colleagues. He supported the early careers of many young critics who disagreed entirely with him, simply because he believed in their talents. \u201cOne (major) reason for the love from colleagues was exactly what made him feared: his fearlessness and integrity,\u201d one such critic, Janos Gereben of San Francisco Classical Voice, said in a Facebook post Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernheimer was born in Munich on Sept. 28, 1936. His father was a member of an esteemed family of antique dealers, and his mother was a noted artist in Weimar Germany. \u201cBernheimer\u2019s mother read \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019 in 1933 and urged his father to leave Hitler\u2019s Germany,\u201d Winer recalled by email. \u201cBut his father said, \u2018Oh, no, this is our Germany, the country of great philosophers and artists.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMost of the Bernheimer family was sent to the Dachau concentration camp in the aftermath of Kristallnacht. An uncle traded a family estate in Venezuela to Germany to win the family\u2019s freedom after several months.\n\nAD\n\nMartin and his parents moved to Massachusetts in 1939, where according to Winer the young man was raised on a chicken farm. \u201cHe was probably the only boy . . . listening to the Met Opera broadcasts while plucking chickens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernheimer returned to Germany in 1950 and wrote his first article, a study of the postwar Munich opera scene that he tried to sell to the New York Times. The Times accepted the piece but scrapped it at the last minute, he recalled: \u201cI was just a smart-ass kid, but I started writing these fluke things.\u201d\n\nHe studied music history and musicology at Brown University, graduating in 1958, and then returned to Germany to study at the University of Music and Performing Arts Munich, on a grant from the state of Bavaria. Much of his early writing was published in the Saturday Review, where he was a protege of Irving Kolodin.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernheimer moved to New York in the late 1980s after meeting and falling in love with Winer, who was then the chief theater critic and an arts columnist for New York Newsday. They married in 1992. \u201cWe used to think we\u2019d make a good sitcom,\u201d Winer said Sunday. \u201c \u2018Critics in Love.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to Lucinda Pearson, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, survivors include four children from his first marriage, Mark Bernheimer, Nora Caruso, Erika Bernheimer and Marina Bernheimer; and four grandchildren.\n\nHe was a regular guest on the Metropolitan Opera radio quiz for many years and continued writing criticism, mostly for the Financial Times. But he was not happy by what he saw happening to the world he had adorned for so long.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEssentially, our civilization is tilting towards anti-authoritarian contests,\u201d he wrote in 2008. \u201cAudiences, not judges, select winners. Call it the American Idolization of culture. On TV, contestants get voted off without explanation. Quality is measured by thumbs, up or down. Scholarly analyses have turned into irrelevant extravagances for snobs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMany U.S. papers have abandoned thoughtful, detailed reviews altogether. Publishers, editors and, presumably, readers want instant evaluations and newsbites, preferably with flashy pictures. It is Zagat-think, simplicity for the simple-minded.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nSol Stein, best-selling author who published James Baldwin and Che Guevara, dies at 92\n\nJoseph C.
