The strike, which analysts estimate cost GM about US$2 billion, brought production to a halt across North America given the continent\u2019s intertwined, just-in-time supply chain.\n\nBut workers won\u2019t immediately be back on the job in Canada, where nearly 5,000 employees were temporarily laid off from GM and parts suppliers.\n\nFirst, the UAW national council will decide Thursday whether to recommend the agreement for a ratification vote. But the strike doesn\u2019t automatically end if the council recommends the deal. It must also vote on whether to stop the strike or continue until the collective agreement is ratified.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Canadian GM plants will resume activity upon the UAW\u2019s recommendation \u2013 that could technically put employees back at work as early as Friday \u2013 or if they\u2019ll wait until the deal is ratified by the 48,000 members, a process that will take time depending how the vote is conducted.\n\n\u201cWe will look to resume Canadian operations as quickly as possible, when an agreement is reached, but will confirm those details at an appropriate time,\u201d GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said in an email.\n\nUnifor president Jerry Dias, whose union represents GM\u2019s Canadian auto workers, expects it will take at least a couple of days to resume operations even if the UAW votes to end the strike tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to hit a switch and go to full production overnight,\u201d Dias said.\n\nThey\u2019re not going to hit a switch and go to full production overnight. Jerry Dias, president, Unifor\n\nCanadian workers will have to wait at home longer if their U.S. counterparts stay on the picket line until ratification, which could take a couple of weeks given the size of the membership, said Dias. Ontario plants rely on parts from the U.S.\n\nFor Dias, the length of the strike shows how upset workers were at GM, which announced plans to shut down four plants in the U.S. and one in Canada in November 2018. The UAW railed against the cuts in the U.S. and the shift to production by low-wage workers in Mexico at a time of record profit for GM.\n\n\u201cThis is people responding to the frustration of what\u2019s happened to the auto industry,\u201d Dias said.\n\nStill, ratification is not a sure thing. In 2015, UAW workers voted against a proposed agreement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the third-largest auto manufacturer in the U.S. Based on that recent history, Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association president Flavio Volpe said he\u2019ll wait for the vote to celebrate. But he was pleased to see a tentative deal after a strike that cost the Canadian sector millions.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Volpe said.\n\nStock prices of Canada\u2019s two largest autoparts makers rose on the news of the agreement. Magna International Inc. and Linamar Corp. closed up 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively. Linamar said the strike was costing it $1 million per day.\n\nThe accord between GM and the UAW may bring an end to the union\u2019s first national walkout against the carmaker in a dozen years.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 priority of the national negotiation team has been to secure a strong and fair contract that our members deserve,\u201d UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement. He said the union\u2019s bargaining committee voted to recommend that the GM National Council \u2014 comprised of presidents and chairmen of locals around the country \u2014 vote in favour of putting the deal up for a ratification vote.\n\nGetting the new four-year agreement approved by the rank-and-file could be a challenge. GM outraged union workers last year by threatening four U.S. plants with possible closure, though it\u2019s offered to keep at least one of those factories open.\n\nUAW leaders also have credibility issues: President Gary Jones was implicated last month by federal prosecutors in an indictment of a former confidant who conspired to embezzle member dues and spend the money on stays at luxury villas, golf gear and cigars.\n\nBut investors likely will also react negatively if management is perceived to have caved into labour\u2019s demands and GM\u2019s long-term competitiveness is threatened John Murphy, analyst, Bank of America\n\nA resolution would come none too soon for GM, which analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate has lost about US$2 billion, and its striking workers, who have been getting by on US$250 per week and who could be forgoing about US$2,000 of profit sharing. The strike has also become a political issue, arising in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, which has lost thousands of auto-industry jobs.\n\nThe two sides moved closer to a deal over the weekend after a tense week of publicly exchanging barbs and blame for the strike dragging on. With most of the major issues settled, Barra and GM President Mark Reuss joined the talks Tuesday to try to get a final agreement over the line, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified.\n\nWith plants across the U.S. idled and shutdowns spilling over into Mexico and Canada, the automaker is losing about US$100 million a day in earnings before interest and taxes, John Murphy, a BofA analyst who recommends buying GM shares, wrote in a research report Tuesday. And in addition to the profit-sharing they\u2019ll miss, Murphy estimates UAW members have probably forgone as much as US$4,000 in net take-home pay.\n\n\u201cA prolonged strike could burn significant cash and bring GM to its knees,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cBut investors likely will also react negatively if management is perceived to have caved into labour\u2019s demands and GM\u2019s long-term competitiveness is threatened.\u201d\n\nA GM spokesman declined to comment on the BofA report.\n\nWith files from Reuters", "description": "Company said to have lost US$2 billion over duration of strike, while workers gave up as much as US$4,000", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/aafp_1lh43d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
