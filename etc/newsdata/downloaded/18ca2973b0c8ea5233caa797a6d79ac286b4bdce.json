He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. He\u2019s a terrible general.\u201d\n\nHost Chuck Todd asked, \u201cI understand that, at one point, before the leaders walked out, that Senator Schumer made a point that his first Defense Secretary, Jim Mattis, said doing this is guaranteeing the reemergence of ISIS. How did the president handle that criticism from his former defense secretary?\u201d\n\nSmith responded, \u201cHe insulted the former defense secretary at great length.\u201d\n\nSmith added, \u201cHe attacked the messenger. Basically, he said, and I don\u2019t want to get into specifics, I have an enormous amount of respect for General Mattis. The president does not. And he basically said, consider the source. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. He\u2019s a terrible general. So, that was how he dealt with General Mattis\u2019 concerns.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of MSNBC's \"MTP Daily,\" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-WA) stated that during a meeting at the White | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Smith-1016-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
