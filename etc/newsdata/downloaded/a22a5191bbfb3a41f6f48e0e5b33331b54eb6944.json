Experts told Business Insider that an unstable environment could contribute to thoughts of self-harm.\n\nTwo protesters whom Business Insider spoke with for this article expressed similar feelings of despair and fear for their futures.\n\nTwo others, one teacher and one youth psychologist who both work closely with protesters, told Business Insider that they had encountered students who expressed distress over the state of affairs in the city.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is the last stand for our future and freedom,\u201d a 22-year-old protester told Business Insider. \u201cWe\u2019d rather die in the fight than slowly suffocate to death after we lose the fight.\u201d\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThey\u2019re dressed in an all-black uniform, faces distorted behind gas masks, using umbrellas as shields, and following a sophisticated set of hand motions that act as their form of communication.\n\nFor more than three months, millions of civilians have been protesting the Hong Kong government.\n\ncaption Protesters standing off against riot police in a business district of Tsim Sha Tsui on August 10. source Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images\n\nWhat began as a rally against legislation that would have allowed for the extradition of Hong Kong residents to China to face trial has ballooned into a much more symbolic battle to fight Chinese encroachment in the semiautonomous region.\n\nOne study conducted from June to August found that nearly 60% of protesters were younger than 29, and nearly 75% had some form of higher education. And for many young protesters, weekly demonstrations have become an increasingly more desperate, sometimes violent fight against what they see as a shrinking view of their future.\n\nUnlike the city\u2019s high concentration of superwealthy, the youth of Hong Kong are struggling to afford to live in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities. A recent economic shift hit \u201ceducated, white-collar professionals\u201d particularly hard, The New York Times reported. \u201cWages stalled or declined,\u201d The Times\u2019 Max Fisher wrote. \u201cWhat they made bought far less. Many became less well-off than their parents had been.\u201d\n\nThe average price of a home in Hong Kong in 2019 is $1.2 million. Graffiti near a protest site calls out the average rent for a small room in a shared apartment: \u201c7K for a house like a cell and you really think we out here scared of jail,\u201d referring to 7,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $893.\n\nMany also feel uncertain about their future in the Chinese territory once the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement ends in 2047. The agreement affords Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and separate economic and administrative systems to China.\n\nThe protesters who spoke with Business Insider saw the continued demonstrations as a matter of life and death.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is the last stand for our future and freedom,\u201d Chan, 22, a recent college graduate and protester who requested we use only his last name, told Business Insider over the messaging app Telegram in early August. \u201cWe\u2019d rather die in the fight than slowly suffocate to death after we lose the fight.\u201d\n\ncaption A June 12 protest in Hong Kong. source Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nProtesters have 5 key demands\n\nProtest groups have put forward five key demands, which continue to fuel demonstrations and have become a rallying cry for many protesters:\n\nA full withdrawal of the extradition bill;\n\nRetraction of the characterization of protests as riots;\n\nThe release of protesters arrested by the police unlawfully;\n\nEstablishing an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality and excessive use of force against protesters;\n\nThe introduction of fair and free elections in the city.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, scrapped the incendiary extradition bill on September 4 in a long-awaited concession, promising to formally withdraw the legislation without debate or voting in the next council, which is set to resume in October.\n\nStill, some pro-democracy activists have called the move \u201ctoo little and too late,\u201d and protests, particularly among students, have continued with growing ferocity.\n\nLarge-scale demonstrations took place ahead of two anniversaries: the five-year marker of the Umbrella Movement on September 28 and the 70th anniversary of the formation of the People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1. Clashes between police and protesters erupted across the city \u2013 officers fired tear gas and water cannons at crowds in Wong Tai Sin, while police shot an 18-year-old protester at point-blank range in Tsuen Wan, marking the first time that live fire was used since protests began in June.\n\nPolice say that violent protesters used \u201ccorrosive fluid\u201d in the Tuen Mun area, injuring multiple officers, and also hurled \u201cfirebombs and other objects.\u201d Police commissioner Stephen Lo said at a press conference that over 180 protesters were arrested on October 1.\n\nViolence on the \u2018front lines\u2019\n\nChan considers himself a \u201cfrontline protester,\u201d someone stationed at the forefront of demonstrations directly facing off against the riot police, who are armed with tear gas, batons, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, and live ammunition.\n\n\u201cI believe almost all frontline protesters, including myself, are ready to be arrested or die in protests,\u201d Chan told Business Insider in August.\n\ncaption A protester throwing a brick at the Tseung Kwan O Police Station on August 4. source Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nThough a portion of protests over the past 17 weeks have been peaceful and largely without incident, offshoot groups of protesters \u2013 growing more and more infuriated with government inaction and allegations of police brutality \u2013 have frequently clashed with the police, throwing bricks, umbrellas, and other objects at law enforcement.\n\nHardline activists have been criticized by the police for their violent tactics. In recent months, groups of protesters have stormed and ransacked the city\u2019s Legislative Building, surrounded the city\u2019s police headquarters, and occupied the city\u2019s airport for days, disrupting flights and causing tourism to plummet.\n\nThe police have ramped up their responses to protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets at crowds, infiltrating protest groups using disguises, and arresting people en masse. Protesters have also suggested that the police have turned to organized gangs to carry out attacks on commuters.\n\nOn September 19, Amnesty International released results from a field investigation that revealed instances of severe beatings, arbitrary arrests, and threats of violence toward protesters by the police.\n\nWhile peaceful activism has helped the movement spread their message to the mainstream, many protesters are wary that demonstrations alone will actually achieve results without disrupting the status quo.\n\ncaption Organizers say 2 million people joined protests on June 16. source STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 2014 Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central, saw similar scenes of peaceful protests interlaced with violent clashes. The protests ended after 79 days, but the movement\u2019s core goal, establishing true, universal suffrage, was never actualized. Nine pro-democracy campaigners were convicted for their leadership roles in the protests, with four handed jail sentences this past April.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proven that violence, to some degree, will be useful,\u201d a 30-year-old protester told Reuters in August.\n\nMore than 115 days have passed since protests began. In that time, more than 1,700 people have been arrested, according to Bloomberg, and at least 70 people have been charged with rioting, the South China Morning Post estimates, a criminal offense that carries a jail sentence of up to 10 years.\n\ncaption An anti-government protester threw a Molotov cocktail during a demonstration near Central Government Complex in Hong Kong on September 15. source REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nProtesters are willing to die for freedom\n\nA protester actively working on the frontlines who requested anonymity because of fears for her safety told Business Insider that protesters, including herself, saw the current fight against Chinese influence as an \u201cend game,\u201d and she said she had engaged with protesters who had expressed readiness to die in continued clashes.\n\n\u201cThey say that if Hong Kong has no future, I have no future either,\u201d she told Business Insider. \u201cSo I may as well fight or die for it.\u201d\n\ncaption Mourners on June 16 during a candlelight vigil to commemorate a protester who died during a rally. source Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nShe said she had spoken with several protesters under the age of 20\u2060 \u2013 some as young as 12 \u2060- who turned up to protests anticipating violence. Some carry suicide notes or a last will and testament in their bags.\n\n\u201cThey fight, they\u2019re very ready to die,\u201d she said.\n\nChan said he, too, always had a note addressing his family inside his bag in case confrontations turned violent.\n\nIn July, masked assailants with links to organized crime stormed the Yuen Long metro station in the city\u2019s north and attacked commuters returning from protests.\n\nA few weeks ago, a young female medic was hit in the eye by a beanbag round shot by the police. The police denied the claims and said there was no evidence that officers had caused her injury.\n\ncaption An injured young female medic receiving medical assistance on August 11 after being hit by a pellet round in the right eye during a demonstration in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood. source REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before they eventually kill someone,\u201d Chan said. \u201cThere have been multiple times that riot police claimed that they will hit us to death. We Hong Kong citizens are frightened, every frontline protester is frightened.\u201d\n\nFor Chan, the current climate is a win-or-lose scenario.\n\n\u201cThis time is our last effort to fight for our democracy,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have been shot, beaten, overwhelmed with tear gas. We are risking our life and future. We just wanted to enjoy democracy. We are prepared to die. Because Hong Kong is our home, our beloved home.\u201d\n\nExperts say protests have left people feeling hopeless and helpless\n\nProtests have not only consumed Hong Kong\u2019s physical space, but according to experts, they are taking a mental toll on protesters.\n\nAt least four protesters have died in apparent suicides in the past few months. Several suicide-prevention groups previously shared that they had received more calls since protests began, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\n\u201cThis is a public mental health situation,\u201d Clarence Tsang, the executive director of the suicide-prevention group Samaritan Befrienders, told the Post.\n\nProtesting appears to dominate the daily discourse for Hong Kong\u2019s youth. A teacher and a youth psychologist who work closely with protesters told Business Insider in August that they had encountered students who expressed distress over the state of affairs in the city.\n\ncaption Protesters attempting to smash a glass door at the government headquarters in Hong Kong on July 1, the 22nd anniversary of the city\u2019s handover from Britain to China. source ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHenry Ng, a lecturer at Hong Kong University who is an expert in social psychology, told Business Insider that there had been a \u201cgeneral sense of hopelessness and helplessness\u201d among protesters, many of whom are students or young adults. \u201cThe two feelings may cause people to become numb to the situation,\u201d Ng said.\n\nHe added that in terms of cognitive development, young protesters, particularly teenagers, might be more susceptible to group influences and might be less developed in terms of inhibitory control. Ng says this may explain why the city\u2019s youth have been drawn to more violent means of protest.\n\nAnother lecturer at Hong Kong University, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution at work, told Business Insider in August that the general sentiment among protesters was that violence was \u201cinevitable\u201d because of lack of response by the government to more peaceful methods of protest.\n\nShe added that in her experience, many young protesters felt as if they had \u201cnothing to lose\u201d and that \u201cblood is ready to be shed because there is no future ahead.\u201d\n\ncaption Protesters on June 16. source Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nA youth psychologist who requested to be identified only by his last name, Ching, told Business Insider in August that a combination of feelings \u2013 fury over police use of force, confusion about the government\u2019s lack of response, distrust toward the Hong Kong legal system, and worry over Hong Kong\u2019s future \u2013 dominated the mindset of protesters that he had spoken with.\n\nChing recalled an incident in July during a memorial service for one of the protesters who died by suicide, in which he was on hand to give \u201cpsychological first aid\u201d to those in attendance. He said as the evening wore on, he tended to a 14-year-old protester who expressed concern over retribution toward his family for his activity in protests, which progressed into suicidal ideation.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmed and feeling helpless, Hong Kongers are inexperienced in facing such large-scale protests and desperation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are using different methods and ways to express their anger and frustration.\u201d\n\nNg said steps were being taken to address the mental well-being of young protesters, including the creation of task forces in local universities to address the psychological needs of their students.\n\nChing said those within his organization were conducting psychological first-aid training and had set up public outreach services, like counseling, for teachers and students, as the city\u2019s youth had been most affected by protests.\n\ncaption A protester covering her eyes with a China flag. source Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe as health professionals can help repair the injury and the psychological impact\u201d of protests, he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, only the government is in the position and has power to prevent the movement from further escalation, and stop tragedy from going on and on.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to better understand protesters, Lam in July offered to hold closed-door meetings with university students from across the city to address their concerns. In late September, she held an \u201copen dialogue\u201d town hall, where 150 people in the movement shared their feelings about her leadership. Protesters then blockaded the stadium where the meeting was held.\n\nThough the extradition bill has been withdrawn, protesters are preparing for the long haul\n\nChing told Business Insider on September 11 that protesters would continue to turn out until their five demands were met \u201cand not one less.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal has only made a small difference on the movement from the protester\u2019s point of view,\u201d he said.\n\ncaption Secondary-school students joined a human chain September 9 protesting against what they said was police brutality against protesters. source REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nA protester actively working on the frontlines told Business Insider in September that while protesters had begun to shift their focus onto the other key demands outlined, her mindset on protesting remained the same.\n\n\u201cI think our methods have changed a lot since August,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think one thing that really has shown itself to be more clear is that we do not separate from each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether we are peaceful or whether we are on the frontlines,\u201d she added, the methods \u201care inseparable.\u201d\n\nShe said that while uncertainty lay ahead, the situation in the city for her remained a matter of life and death.\n\n\u201cThe fight,\u201d she said, \u201cis definitely not over yet.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - \"We'd rather die in the fight than slowly suffocate to death after we lose the fight,\" one protester told Business Insider..
