He has led various international initiatives to improve supervision and disclosure.\n\nAs climate impacts - from wildfires to sea-level rise and hurricanes - intensify, investors are increasingly concerned over the risks that extreme weather could pose to assets and companies in their portfolios.\n\nThe valuations of fossil fuel companies could also be at risk if governments act to spur stronger action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the adoption of renewable energy, analysts say.\n\nCarney said that mandatory disclosures of climate risk would be essential in supporting efforts to transition economies to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the rise in average global temperatures.\n\n\u201cThe world won\u2019t get to net zero if the financial sector doesn\u2019t know how companies are responding,\u201d Carney said. \u201cTo watch, you need to be able to see.\u201d", "description": "Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Monday that the financial sector must transform its management of climate risk, warning that global warming would prompt reassessments of the value of every single financial asset.", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433044306&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1Q8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
