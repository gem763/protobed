Photo: Bobby Doherty/New York Magazine\n\nWhen we set out to find the best travel pillow, we were looking for one that would create minimal bulk in a carry-on bag and allow us to sleep on a long flight to Europe. The verdict? This funny contraption that is essentially a padded scarf. Here\u2019s what we had to say about it: \u201cThe Trtl pillow \u2026 takes up about the same amount of space as a couple of magazines. Three interconnected bands hidden inside a hypoallergenic fleece exterior hold your head almost completely upright. To keep the Trtl\u2019s small shape, these bands lend support to only one shoulder at a time, so you\u2019ll have to choose which side you prefer nodding off toward, but the whole piece is easily adjustable and customizable with a simple Velcro strap. The tighter the Velcro, the stronger the support. You can even place it beneath your chin to keep your head from drooping.\u201d Since then, we learned that novelist Celeste Ng is a huge fan (\u201cI usually can\u2019t sleep on planes, but with this, I did and do,\u201d she told us), and it\u2019s been a consistent Strategist best seller. Right now, the classic pillow (as well as a kids version and a deluxe, more adjustable version) is the cheapest we\u2019ve ever seen it.\n\nPhoto: Bobby Doherty/New York Magazine Trtl Pillow $18 (was $40, now 55% off) $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nOther Trtl Pillows on Sale\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
