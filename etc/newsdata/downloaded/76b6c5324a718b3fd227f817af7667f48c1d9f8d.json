Now in an old people\u2019s home under legal guardianship, she said she thought it was just an old religious icon. It was valued at about \u00a35 million after a judge called in an auctioneer to empty her house in June after she was moved to the home.\n\nDominique Le Co\u00ebnt-de-Beaulieu of the Act\u00e9on auction house said the price paid was \u201ca world record\u201d for a painting dating from before 1500. It is thought to have been painted around 1280.\n\nThe experts were wide of the mark, he said, because it was the first time a Cimabue had ever been auctioned.", "description": "A Renaissance masterpiece found hanging in an elderly French woman\u2019s kitchen sold for a record price of \u20ac24 million (\u00a320.", "authors": ["David Chazan", "Benedict Spence", "Michael Gove", "Nick Timothy"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214306789-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDyn_kzCs85o7bFJrmLDpez5113EZRWrbS1qarlgA-v4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
