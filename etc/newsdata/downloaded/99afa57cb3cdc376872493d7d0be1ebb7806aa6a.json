That is to say, in addition to China and the United States of America, there will be Great Britain as well,\u201d Chancellor Merkel said on Sunday in comments reported by POLITICO.\n\nShe continued: \u201cHere Europe must show what the European Union can achieve: That means we must work faster, work more consistently, and the new [European] Commission with Ursula von der Leyen at its head should also become operational as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nIn early September, the German leader raised the issue of the UK becoming an \u201ceconomic competitor at our door\u201d while admitting that the bloc is going to be \u201cweaker with Britain\u2019s exit\u201d.\n\nFrance Frightened of \u2018Tax Haven\u2019 Brexit Britain \u2018at the Gates of Europe\u2019 https://t.co/hHEGTHxooV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 4, 2019\n\nThe EU has demanded that the UK keep close alignment to the bloc in matters of environmental standards, state aid, and regulations for fear that if the UK diverged after Brexit, it could have a competitive edge over its European neighbours. Brussels officials have threatened not to lift tariffs in a future UK-EU deal unless this \u2018level playing field\u2019 is maintained.\n\nIn October, France\u2019s Europe minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin said her country would only accept an alternative to the EU-approved withdrawal treaty if Brussels can \u201cwork fairly\u201d with London post-Brexit. The French minister added: \u201cWe have to look at whether standards are being met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to have a tax haven at the gates of Europe,\u201d Ms de Montchalin said.\n\nNot only does Brussels fear the UK diverging from the EU, but is aware of the country\u2019s possible closer alignment with the USA.\n\nIncoming President of the European Council Charles Michel said last month: \u201cHow do we maintain a close relationship to the United Kingdom, our ally and neighbour? How will we repair the potential damage caused by a hard Brexit? The UK is now looking more and more toward the United States.\u201d", "description": "Angela Merkel has expressed concern that Brexit Britain could be a \"potential competitor\" to the EU like China or the United States.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/Angela-Merkel-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
