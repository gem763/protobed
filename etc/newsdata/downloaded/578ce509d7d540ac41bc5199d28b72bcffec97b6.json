An aide to the French president told reporters there was \"positive momentum\" behind the talks.\n\nDowning Street said Johnson had called Macron and had a \"constructive\" and \"good discussion\".\n\n\"We want to make progress towards securing a deal as soon as possible and we want to make progress ahead of the EU council on Thursday,\" a spokesman said.\n\nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined why EU officials are driving a hard bargain and hoping Britain will commit to a \"level playing field\" in post-Brexit trade and commerce.\n\n\"One thing is clear, Britain will develop into another competitor on the doorstep of Europe,\" she told industrialists. \"And therefore the EU will be challenged to become more competitive and to assume geopolitical responsibility.\"\n\nA European diplomat told AFP the \"goal\" was to get a draft text of a deal ready later in the evening Tuesday, but warned: \"Time is running out.\"\n\nOfficials stressed that EU and UK negotiators would race to agree a draft text by Wednesday morning, but EU sources insisted there was no \"hard deadline\" and talks could go on next week.\n\n- Glimmer of hope -\n\n\"The last moment is always a bit later than you think,\" one German government official told AFP, suggesting that Brexit day would have to be postponed beyond the end of the month if talks are to succeed.\n\n\"I am sceptical that we will have a full agreement tomorrow on a legal text ... the question is whether the work can be done in the next few days or whether it will take another two months.\"\n\nBritish Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay joined Barnier in Luxembourg in what was seen as a positive sign for the talks, and said \"a deal is still very possible.\"\n\nBarclay later tweeted a pictures of himself with Irish, Polish, Greek, Swedish and Portuguese counterparts, saying they shared his desire to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\nMore than three years after Britain's 2016 referendum vote to leave, talks remain stuck on how to avoid customs checks on the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.\n\nThe EU has reservations about London's proposed customs arrangements and the role for Northern Ireland's Stormont assembly in giving consent to the plans.\n\n\"Johnson has modified his original proposals to the effect that he has clearly stated that there will be no customs border on the Irish border,\" a European diplomat told AFP.\n\nIf no deal is reached by Saturday, Johnson will fall foul of a British law demanding he ask the EU to postpone Brexit for a third time rather than risk a potentially disastrous \"no deal\" departure.\n\nburs-pdw/dc/dt", "description": "British and EU negotiators on Tuesday scrambled to put together a draft text for a Brexit deal with just two days to go before a key European summit.
