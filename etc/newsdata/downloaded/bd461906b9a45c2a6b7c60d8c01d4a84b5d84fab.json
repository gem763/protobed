Juan Guaido\u2019s interim government of Venezuela supported the move. They want to eliminate investors\u2019 property rights in CITGO.\n\nAs an immigrant who escaped Venezuela\u2019s corruption, I have seen Venezuela\u2019s failure firsthand. It stems from its lack of property rights and rule of law \u2014 the very traditions that have made the United States great. While the Maduro regime deserves to be replaced, our nation should not support policies from the interim government that would continue the country\u2019s legacy of corruption and poor economic policy.\n\nHundreds of thousands of immigrants like me left Venezuela in the midst of the country\u2019s crisis. If we continue to support lawless policies in Venezuela, that crisis may never end.\n\nIRENE LOBON\n\nBoca Raton, Fla.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
