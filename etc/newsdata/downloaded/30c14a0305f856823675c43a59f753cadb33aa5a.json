(Photo: Ian Gavan, Getty Images)\n\nComic book fans often pit Marvel and DC\u2019s respective properties against one another because the publishers and the live-action movies based on their IP represent two of the largest corporate titans in the larger entertainment industry, but there are few things more exhausting then fans\u2019 desire to \u201cprove\u201d whether DC or Marvel are \u201cbetter\u201d than one another.\n\nMuch of the DC vs. Marvel discourse has been shaped by the box office performance and critical reception of the film franchises tied to the comics publishers\u2019 properties. But oftentimes, conversations about Marvel Studios and Warner Bros. become very hostile and emotional as people\u2019s personal feelings about characters, actors, and even film executives filter into the way they speak about movies like James Gunn\u2019s upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy and Suicide Squad sequels.\n\nOver the weekend, Gunn took to his Twitter account to express his excitement about beginning work on The Suicide Squad and to share images of a care package he received from Marvel executives including Kevin Feige and Mary Livanos.\n\nThe gift, a scrapbook filled with photos of Gunn working on the Guardians sets, was a reflection on Gunn\u2019s time working with Marvel and, presumably, a gesture meant to demonstrate the studio\u2019s desire to maintain a good working relationship with the director \u2014 even though his working for a rival came as the result of his infamous firing (and subsequent rehiring) last summer.\n\nInspired by the Marvel gift, Gunn went on to encourage Marvel and DC fans to accept the fact that whether they\u2019re into the X-Men or the Doom Patrol, comic book (movie) fans are all just fans and liking different things is no really to get into heated arguments with people:\n\nAs I\u2019ve said so many times, at the end of the day, Marvel & DC fans have a lot more in common than they do not. I am now & have been for almost all my life, both. \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) September 29, 2019\n\nI know I & my partners at both Marvel & DC believe what\u2019s good for one studio is generally good for all: spurring each other on daily with heartfelt, spectacular & innovative entertainment that keeps audiences around the world loving movies based on or inspired by sequential art. \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) September 29, 2019\n\nGunn\u2019s statements read very much like those of a director who\u2019s working for two studio because, well, that\u2019s that\u2019s very much the case \u2014 three cheers for being a company man. That said, he\u2019s making a solid point that more fans could stand to bear in mind especially as we all prepare for this year\u2019s New York Comic-Con, where everyone\u2019s going to be talking about all the new cape movies, series, and books we\u2019ll be consuming for the foreseeable future.", "description": "Comic book fans often pit Marvel and DC\u2019s respective properties against one another because the publishers and the live-action movies based on their IP represent two of the largest corporate titans in the larger entertainment industry, but there are few things more exhausting then fans\u2019 desire to \u201cprove\u201d...", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Nathan Grayson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/eugz5oevm0unbfjtdfqo.jpg"}
