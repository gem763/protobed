A lot of people are talking about it, and that\u2019s irrespective of what happened yesterday in Texas.\u201d\n\nMass shootings last month in El Paso; Dayton, Ohio; and Odessa, Tex., have prompted fresh calls from congressional Democrats and the 2020 presidential candidates for stricter regulations on firearms to stem the violence. But in a reflection of the political reality, Trump has been reluctant to endorse any sweeping steps, such as stronger background checks, as the National Rifle Association has privately warned him that it would not be popular with his supporters.\n\nCongressional Republicans, especially those on the ballot next year, also have expressed reservations about new legislation.\n\n[Trump tells NRA chief that universal background checks are off the table]\n\nIn Texas, new gun laws took effect Sunday, hours after the shooting, that loosened restrictions on guns in schools, foster homes and places of worship. The Republican-led state legislature passed the measures earlier this year and Gov. Gregg Abbott (R) signed the NRA-backed legislation into law in June.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, Abbott delivered a forceful appeal for change \u2014 although he made no mention of his role in greenlighting the newly loosened gun laws less than three months ago.\n\n\u201cI am heartbroken by the crying of the people of the state of Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the dying of the people of the state of Texas. . . . The status quo in Texas is unacceptable, and action is needed.\u201d\n\nHe called for lawmakers to pursue solutions that \u201ckeep guns out of the hands of criminals\u201d while protecting Second Amendment rights.\n\nSaturday\u2019s mass shooting as a gunman drove through roads in Odessa and Midland was the second last month in Texas. On Aug. 3, a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso, killing 22 and injuring 24. Hours later, in Dayton, a gunman killed nine and wounded 27 in an entertainment district. Other killings nationwide have pushed the number for the month to a sobering 53, according to figures from the website Mass Shooting Tracker.\n\n\n\nAuthorities cordon off a part of the sidewalk in Odessa, Tex., on Saturday. (Mark Rogers/AP)\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, a Democratic candidate for president, blasted Republicans for inaction and \u201chappy talk\u201d on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lies that the president has told include that he would do something about universal background checks,\u201d Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and housing secretary in the Obama administration, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the public reaction following last month\u2019s mass shooting in Dayton when attendees at a vigil for the victims drowned out Gov. Mike DeWine (R) with calls of, \u201cDo something! Do something!\u201d\n\n\u201cMore and more people here in Texas and across the country want Congress and their politicians to do something,\u201d Castro said.\n\nAnother presidential hopeful, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), said during a campaign stop in Iowa that she held little hope of presidential action.\n\n\u201cWhen a toddler shot with blood all over her in a car doesn\u2019t change the discussion, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to listen,\u201d Klobuchar said, referring to 17-month-old Anderson Davis, who was hit by shrapnel in her right chest. The child is in stable condition, according to Hailey Wilkerson, a friend of the family.\n\n[Texas\u2019s second mass shooting in August kills at least 7]\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) renewed her call for the Senate to take up gun-control legislation that was passed by the House in February, including an expansion of background checks on firearm sales.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d she said in a statement Saturday night. \u201cThe Republican Senate must end its obstruction and finally pass the common-sense, bipartisan, House-passed gun violence prevention legislation that the country is demanding.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed an openness to some kind of gun-safety legislation in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, but has not committed to anything specific and insists any legislation must have strong support from Trump.\n\nA McConnell spokesman declined to comment Sunday, pointing to the statements the Kentucky Republican made on the issue last month.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday morning, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, used a profanity when describing the epidemic of gun violence facing the country and noted that \u201cwe\u2019re averaging about 300 mass shootings a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need an AR-15, an AK-47. That is a weapon of war designed to kill people as efficiently, as effectively, in as great a number as possible,\u201d he said, calling for the government to initiate a buyback program of assault weapons.\n\nTrump touched on the issue of gun legislation in his exchange with reporters outside the White House, as well as at the outset of a briefing on Hurricane Dorian at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where he decried the \u201cwicked\u201d attack in Odessa.\n\n\u201cMy administration is committed to working with Congress to stop the menace of mass attacks,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cour goal must be to identify severely disturbed individuals and disrupt their plans before they strike.\u201d\n\nBut his attention appeared elsewhere much of the day as he sent a string of tweets on a range of other topics.\n\nHe retweeted warnings from FEMA and the National Hurricane Center about Dorian, which was surging over the northwestern Bahamas and moving toward the southeastern United States.\n\nHe shared quotes from Republicans praising his trade war with China and slammed one of his biggest critics, former FBI director James B. Comey.\n\nAnd he took aim at Debra Messing after the actor called for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign and the Republican National Committee to publicly release the names of donors who are set to attend a Beverly Hills fundraiser for Trump\u2019s reelection effort later this month.\n\nTrump has repeatedly embraced tighter gun restrictions in the aftermath of mass shootings, only to abruptly reverse course in the face of warnings from the NRA.\n\nAs they have done after previous mass shootings, several Republicans who made appearances on the Sunday morning news shows pushed back against suggestions that Congress should take action on gun legislation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should step in with false palliatives like red-flag laws,\u201d Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d when asked about the Odessa shooting. Red-flag laws allow for judges to order the removal of guns from individuals who are deemed to pose a threat to themselves or others.\n\nBiggs blamed heated rhetoric and \u201cdeteriorating institutions that actually in some way stoke these fires,\u201d and argued that further bolstering religious institutions would help combat some of the alienation that drives such attacks.\n\nEven the Republicans who have pushed for some action on the issue sounded pessimistic Sunday when asked about the prospects for legislative progress.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who co-wrote a bill in 2013 that would expand background checks for gun purchases, said he has had \u201can ongoing conversation\u201d with Trump about the issue.\n\nIn an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Toomey maintained that he and other background-check proponents \u201care going to take a very serious run at it,\u201d but cautioned, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee an outcome. I\u2019m not sure where this all ends.\u201d\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who penned a Washington Post op-ed last month voicing support for red-flag laws, reiterated his call for Congress to pass such a measure. He pointed to the bill he signed into law last year as Florida governor in the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\n\u201cI want to do things that I think work,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think the red-flag laws work. I think, in a school situation, we have put in mental health counselors and law enforcement.\u201d\n\nHe declined to answer directly, however, when asked whether he supports universal background checks \u2014 even as a Quinnipiac University poll released late last week shows that 93 percent of Americans support such a move.\n\n\u201cNinety-three percent of American voters support universal background checks,\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash told Scott. \u201cNinety-three percent of Americans don\u2019t support anything. I mean, that\u2019s a huge number. Do you?\u201d\n\nScott responded by telling Bash that there are \u201clots of proposals\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to take guns away from law-abiding Americans.\u201d\n\nHe also balked at the idea of an assault-weapons ban, prompting Bash to ask him whether he supports Americans possessing \u201ceven weapons of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, everybody has their definition of things,\u201d he replied.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Saturday\u2019s mass shooting brought to more than 50 the number of people killed in such incidents in August alone.
