This is what I went through. This is why wedding planning was either hard or easy for me, whatever it is.\u2019 And just being a plus-size woman getting married,\u201d McGrady said.\n\n\u201cEveryone always told me my whole life, \u2018You\u2019re a bigger girl, don\u2019t wear anything skintight, we don\u2019t want to show off those curves. Don\u2019t wear anything covered up to here because it doesn\u2019t look great on your bust,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nHUNTER MCGRADY TALKS BODY PAINT PICS\n\n\u201cSo naturally, I\u2019m like, well give me the tightest, sexiest dress for my ceremony and then give me a high neck for my reception.

And whether that be affirmations, whether that be exercise, whether that be therapy. Whatever it is that makes you feel good.\"\n\n\"For me, personally, it took me a few years to really get there and fully embrace myself, my curves, my stretch marks, my cellulite. All the things that just make me who I am,\" she added.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMcGrady regularly practices body positive affirmations in the mirror.\n\n\"For me, it was positive affirmations. Quite literally standing in the mirror and telling myself, 'Hunter, you are worthy. You are enough. Your stretch marks are beautiful. Your cellulite is beautiful. These are the attributes that make you who you are, and there's only one of you, and it's special. You're special in your own skin,'\" she explained.", "description": "Hunter McGrady made headlines being the \"curviest model ever\" featured on Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue and now she's gracing another cover as its first plus-size model.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/05/14/694940094001_6036762241001_6036757734001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
