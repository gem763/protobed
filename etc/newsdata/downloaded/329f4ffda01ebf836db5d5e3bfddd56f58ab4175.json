Four female pilots discuss life on the flightdeck 1/4 Jessica Sundquist: 787 Dreamliner captain at Norwegian Jessica Sundquist, a Swedish 787 Dreamliner captain for Norwegian, has spoken extensively about being a woman in the industry. In the past she\u2019s spoken about the concept of \u201cputting your femininity aside\u201d in order to succeed. Sundquist says today that she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have to do it\u201d, but also wanted to fit into the industry \u201cwithout being known as \u2018the girl\u2019\u201d. Today, times are changing, she says, and more women are joining the industry \u2013 but it\u2019s not all good news. \u201cDespite working hard to get to where I am today as a captain at one of the most modern and exciting airlines, the industry still has a lot more work to do to give women more opportunities,\u201d she says In the future, she\u2019d like the discussion on gender inequality to remain \u201copen and ongoing\u201d, but argues that real action also needs to take place to make any difference. Norwegian 2/4 Joanna Riggs: A380 first officer at British Airways First officer Joanna Riggs says she was never \u201cparticularly exposed to aviation as a career choice\u201d, but became a BA cabin crew member after university in order to see more of the world. She says that entering such a highly male-dominated profession wasn\u2019t daunting, but that she felt \u201clucky to have two other females\u201d on her course. Colleagues have always been supportive in Riggs\u2019 experience as have \u2013 for the most part \u2013 passengers, though some are \u201csurprised\u201d when they see a female pilot. \u201cI hope it will one day be normal to everyone,\u201d she adds. Some passengers give a \u201cthumbs up or a girl power sign\u201d. As for gender differences on the flight deck, Riggs says, \u201cWe are very professional on the flight deck so it doesn\u2019t matter what the gender, race or sexuality of my colleague is. \u201cFlying with a fellow female is always a treat though. My brother is also a British Airways pilot, and although I haven\u2019t flown with him, I get the feeling we would be very similar. British Airways 3/4 Lucy Tardrew: Boeing 747 captain at Virgin Atlantic Lucy Tardrew had always wanted to join the RAF, she says, but it was never allowed to happen \u2013 because \u201dthey weren\u2019t taking girls at the time\u201d. Instead, she travelled to America, where she trained before becoming a flying instructor. After returning to the UK and converting her licences, she began flying night mail \u2013 \u201cliterally all the posts around the country at night\u201d \u2013 before stints flying executive jets, and last-minute jobs including air ambulances and freighting transplant organs, before joining Virgin 23 years ago. Tardrew is enthusiastic about the company, but is saddened that the ratio of women in the industry as a whole remains low. As for challenges in the workplace, she\u2019s never experienced any discrimination. Noting the rare pay equality in the piloting industry, Tardrew feels the reason there aren\u2019t more female pilots is down to the fact that \u201dthere aren\u2019t enough female role models for schoolchildren to think, \u2018I\u2019m going to become an airline pilot\u2019.\u201d Virgin Atlantic 4/4 Kate McWilliams: captain at easyJet At 26, Kate McWilliams became the youngest commercial captain in the world. \u201cI love being a captain for easyJet,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy to be working for an airline that is working hard to increase the number of female pilots.\u201d Flying was always her goal \u2013 but she didn\u2019t realise how far she could take it. \u201cI joined the air cadets at 13-years-old, but it wasn\u2019t until much later that I realised I could become a commercial pilot,\u201d she says. \u201cEasyJet is aiming to inspire young women, with the Amy Johnson Flying Initiative and their sponsorship of the Brownies, giving girls aged seven to 10 the opportunity to earn an Aviation Badge. The work it\u2019s doing is really important.\u201d The Amy Johnson Flying Initiative was launched in October 2015 with the aim of doubling the number of female new entrant pilots, to 12 per cent, over a two-year period. After achieving its aim in the first year, the airline set a target of 20 per cent for new entrant cadet pilots in 2020. easyJet 1/4 Jessica Sundquist: 787 Dreamliner captain at Norwegian Jessica Sundquist, a Swedish 787 Dreamliner captain for Norwegian, has spoken extensively about being a woman in the industry.

The most direct route would take the plane over Denmark, Latvia, western Russia, northeast Kazakhstan, China and the Philippines before making landfall in Australia close to Darwin.\n\nQantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said: \u201cEvery time a new aircraft has allowed us to fly for longer, people naturally ask about the comfort factor. The fact that the longest flight on our network today, Perth to London, also has our highest customer satisfaction rating shows that you can design an ultra-long service that passengers enjoy. Plus it has the added benefit of getting you to your destination several hours faster, door to door.\n\n\u201cProject Sunrise is pushing the boundaries even further. We know we need to think harder about crew and passenger wellbeing when you\u2019re airborne for almost 20 hours, and that\u2019s why this research is so important.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we\u2019ll be doing is world-first. We\u2019ll be fitting pilots with equipment to monitor their brain patterns when they\u2019re on the flight deck and when they\u2019re resting.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cInnovation is part of Qantas\u2019 DNA and these flights are no exception. Regardless of whether Qantas is able to forge ahead with Project Sunrise flights, this data will benefit passengers and crew travelling on existing Qantas long haul flights and we are excited to see what medical science can do to help shape how people fly in the future.\u201d\n\nAhead of the New York-Sydney flight, Qantas released research having surveyed 500 long-haul passengers about how they combat jetlag.\n\nIt found that almost half of travellers (47 per cent) do not make a conscious effort to venture out into the sunshine upon arrival at their destination, despite this being a proven way to overcome jetlag.\n\nSpecialist sleep researcher Dr Yu Sun Bin said that, although passengers say they are keen to mitigate the effects of long-haul flying, they are often not doing the right things.\n\n\u201cWe know that going outdoors for sunlight at the destination is one of the most important strategies for syncing the body clock, but only 47 per cent of passengers made the effort to do it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDrinking more than a few glasses of alcohol will make jetlag worse. It might make us fall asleep faster but beyond a certain point, it also disrupts the quality of sleep and causes dehydration.\u201d\n\nSpeculation over the services that will be onboard the London to Sydney-bound aircraft has been rife, with possible features mentioned including a gym, children\u2019s play area, bar and bunkbeds. Many of these ideas have since been dismissed, but Joyce says that the nearly day-long nonstop flights could feature a wellness space.\n\n\u201cWe are, on the aircraft, looking at a zone that we\u2019re calling the \u2018fourth zone\u2019, for people to stretch and exercise and hydrate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will be part of the product that we use to launch.\u201d", "description": "Qantas launches its first 20-hour test flight today to check how the human body copes with its planned ultra-long-haul routes.
