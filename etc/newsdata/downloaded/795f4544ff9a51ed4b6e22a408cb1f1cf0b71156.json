Pence is Trump\u2019s right hand man when dealing with fellow world leaders. He\u2019s often piped in for phone calls. And the two strategize about it all at their weekly lunches.\n\nIt\u2019s with that pedigree that the president dispatched Pence earlier this month to cover for him in Poland on a trip that included a face-to-face meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. In response to a direct question from a reporter whether they\u2019d discussed Joe Biden, Pence acknowledged that the conversation covered U.S. financial support for the eastern Europe country and \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nTrump is hardly helping the matter. During a Wednesday press conference where the threat of impeachment loomed, the president pretty much tossed his No. 2 directly to the wolves. \u201cI think you should ask for Vice President Pence's conversations, because he had a couple conversations also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI could save you a lot of time. They were all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.\u201c\n\nBill Barr\n\nThe attorney general has seen his reputation savaged since joining the Trump administration at the start of 2019. He ran afoul of his longtime friend Robert Mueller over how he handled the end of the special counsel\u2019s Russia probe. In July, his defiance alongside Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross of congressional subpoenas prompted a House vote to hold them in criminal contempt \u2014 the second time in U.S. history that\u2019s happened to a sitting Cabinet member.\n\nNow there\u2019s the Ukraine mess.\n\nBarr joined the story on Wednesday when the White House released notes from a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky where the president twice named the attorney general as someone who should be part of the country\u2019s effort to investigate Biden. A DOJ spokeswoman said Trump never directly asked Barr to begin a Biden probe, though that hardly quelled the concerns from Democrats. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Barr needs to recuse himself from the issue. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, called the attorney general a \u201cwitness that will be called to testify\u201d in the impeachment investigation.\n\nINTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nMike Pompeo\n\nThe secretary of state has been one of the cabinet secretaries Trump trusts the most. Amid constant chatter about whether Pompeo will pursue a U.S. Senate seat from Kansas, the president seems to side with his top diplomat on major foreign policy matters involving Iran, Venezuela and numerous other hot spots. And Pompeo has been careful to always eliminate any perception of daylight with the president.\n\nSome of his larger trouble could come via the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Giuliani, who says he was tasked by the State Department to engage with Ukrainian officials. It\u2019s not clear what role Pompeo played in it all, though he has been a willing defender of the president on television. House Democrats are likely to seek clarity about his involvement in the coming months.\n\nMick Mulvaney\n\nThe president\u2019s acting chief of staff has spared himself from the ever-present Trump axe in part by letting Trump be Trump. That could become a problem now.\n\nHis role in the West Wing puts him at the center of every major Trump engagement, including with foreign leaders. His continuing role as the president\u2019s budget director puts him at the center of every major spending decision, including the holdup of hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMulvaney maintains relationships with Republicans on Capitol Hill from his time as a House lawmaker. Now, Democrats will be keen to learn his role in empowering Trump and others in the decision to withhold Ukraine aid.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nWhere to even begin? The former New York mayor has relished his role on the Trump personal legal team, where he has served as an attack dog tarring the president\u2019s investigators and a point man to go on friendly cable TV shows to uncork bad news in the best light possible. With the Ukraine-Biden matter, Giuliani has celebrated how he\u2019s managed to get global press attention on a story that he hopes will undercut the current 2020 Democratic front-runner.\n\nBut Giuliani in the process has also made himself a potential witness, or more, over his months-long campaign \u2014 both behind the scenes and very much in the public eye \u2014 to get Ukrainian officials to commit to a Biden investigation. Trump in the phone call with Zelensky made it clear his lawyer was acting as his emissary on the issue.\n\nThree Democratic-led House panels have already launched a probe into Giuliani\u2019s outreach. And on the other end of the Capitol, seven Democratic senators on Wednesday re-upped their own call \u2014 they first did it a year ago \u2014 to have the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division investigate whether Giuliani is in compliance with foreign lobbying laws.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/87/d8/310ce5dc46a88cd19fbdd102067c/190925-pence-trump-pompeo-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
