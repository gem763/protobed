However, not all of the deals are done just yet. We\u2019ve sorted through the remains of Prime Day to see if any deals were left over. There are only a few deals left compared to the hundreds that we originally picked out, but we\u2019ve laid out the best deals below.\n\nYou can still get a Samsung Galaxy S10 for as low as $499 at Best Buy, but only if you activate service in-store through Sprint, Verizon, or AT&T. This discount brings the S10E down to $349.99. Otherwise, unlocked Samsung Galaxy S10 phones can still be found for around $200 off at Amazon and B&H Photo.\n\nWearables\n\nHeadphones\n\nMisc.", "description": "Amazon Prime Day 2019 may have officially ended last night, but several deals are still up for grabs.
