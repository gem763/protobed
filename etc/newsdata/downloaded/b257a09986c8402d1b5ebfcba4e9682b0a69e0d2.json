No, instead my plan is we\u2019re going to get to a table like this,\u201d the Massachusetts senator says in leaked video from an August 23 closed-door meeting with members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board, which was obtained by Mediaite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Medicare for All is all about,\u201d she added.\n\nWarren has by turns embraced Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan and distanced herself from it, calling it a just a \u201cframework.\u201d She has also expressed goals that go beyond Sanders\u2019 plan, including making every doctor and specialist available under the plan and making sure no medical service or prescription is ever refused to a patient.\n\nMany unions have balked at Medicare for All over concerns that the plan could compromise the high-quality private insurance plans unions painstakingly negotiate for their members. Sanders\u2019 plan would virtually eliminate the private health insurance market, forcing union members into the public market.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it is we need to know what the goal is, and that goal has got to be that we\u2019ve got to be in a place where we get coverage for everybody at the lowest possible cost,\u201d Warren said.\n\nWarren added on Sunday in remarks to reporters that, \u201cI\u2019ve been working for a long time on this question about what the cost will be and how to pay for it, and I\u2019m getting close.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s remarks in the leaked video are a departure from her reputation as the Democratic candidate with detailed policy proposals. Her frequent remark that, \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that\u201d has even turned into a catchphrase for her campaign.\n\nThe senator said she plans to release her proposal on how to pay for health insurance reform will be released within the next few weeks.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren was caught on tape saying that she is not committed to all the details of Senator Bernie Sanders'\u00a0Medicare for All plan despite previously calling it \"my plan.\"", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
