My prescribing you a statin, for example, is based on a 10% risk of a cardiovascular incident such as a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. I would be negligent in my duty of care as a doctor if I didn\u2019t identify and act on threats to my patient\u2019s health.\n\nI also know as a doctor that it\u2019s better to intervene early. It\u2019s cheaper for the health service and the patient, and better for overall health, to stop smoking rather than endure the trauma of a cancer diagnosis and treatment down the line.\n\nWhen it comes to the climate crisis, we are in a similar position: we know the risks, are beginning to see the signs, and have a window of opportunity to intervene. Even though it may be uncomfortable \u2013 as anyone giving up smoking will tell you \u2013 action that tackles climate change comes with added benefits, such as improvements in air quality.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s values can be summarised as telling the truth, acting with the urgency the truth requires, and acting democratically. We all need the government to take the evidence base seriously and act with the concerted effort that\u2019s required to prevent tragic outcomes down the line. And as the government has buried its head in the sand on the evidence, we are compelled to resort to nonviolent action to be heard.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t use my annual leave and risk my liberty and license to practice in a profession I love if it weren\u2019t for the seriousness of this diagnosis.\n\nSince Doctors for Extinction Rebellion was founded, other professional groups have emerged, including teachers, lawyers, nurses, farmers, carpenters and scientists. In this time of division we need to pull together across all sections of society, because it\u2019s only by working together that we can respond to this collective threat.\n\nBeing involved in Extinction Rebellion is a wonderful opportunity, and there\u2019s space for everyone. If you\u2019re concerned about the climate crisis, believe the science not the spin, and want to be on the right side of history, I invite you to join us.\n\nDoctors for XR (@DoctorsXR) is a network of doctors and other health professionals concerned about the climate crisis. We are hosting the 'Planetary Health Hub' during the October Rebellion and are currently based in St James\u2019s Park, with talks and workshops exploring issues around health in the context of climate breakdown", "description": "As a doctor, I\u2019m bound by good clinical practice to hold human life with the utmost respect, to practice from a scientific evidence base, and to act promptly when patient safety may be compromised.
