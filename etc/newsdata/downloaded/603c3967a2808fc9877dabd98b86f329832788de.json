He started out doing small clubs in Georgia, dealt with hecklers, built a following and then started touring with big names like Dave Chappelle and Hannibal Buress.\n\nBut what makes Bowers different is what he's talking about onstage. The comedian is using comedy stages to call for openness and honesty around stuff that's hard to talk about. He spoke to q guest host Angeline Tetteh-Wayoe about what it feels like to get personal onstage and why he's choosing comedy to do it.\n\n\"I need that moment and that venue. It just allows for a better dynamic,\" Bowers said about his different approach to comedy. His stand-up features talk of mental health, drug use and personal emotions.\n\nYou can catch Bowers on the show The Chi and the new movie Honey Boy. The comedian is also getting attention for his show at the Just For Laughs festival.\n\n\u2014 Produced by Chris Trowbridge\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Byron Bowers.", "description": "The comedian opens up about why he's using stand-up to call for openness and honesty around hard to talk about topics.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336086.1572033686!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/byron-bowers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
