Mitch McConnell. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congress McConnell warns Pelosi's drug-pricing plan is DOA\n\nSenate Republicans are warning Speaker Nancy Pelosi that her much-anticipated drug pricing plan is dead and will not be considered in the Senate.\n\nIn an interview, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ruled out any action on the bill, which would call for Medicare to negotiate drug prices for a minimum of 25 medicines and target drugs that cost the American health system the most. Pelosi rolled out the plan on Thursday to intense opposition from the drug industry, and McConnell.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSocialist price controls will do a lot of left-wing damage to the healthcare system. And of course we\u2019re not going to be calling up a bill like that,\u201d McConnell said on Thursday afternoon.\n\nSenate committees have passed their own drug pricing legislation, though it does not unite the GOP. Many Republicans are slow to endorse wading into regulating the pharmaceutical industry, which has deep pockets and deep political connections in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday called for a bipartisan solution to high drug prices, tweeting out that he likes \u201cSen. Grassley\u2019s drug pricing bill very much, and it\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill today. Let\u2019s get it done in a bipartisan way!\u201d\n\nThrough a spokesman, Pelosi ripped McConnell as an impediment to one of Trump's top priorities.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

President Trump has said that we should be negotiating prescription drug costs \u2018like crazy,\u2019 and it\u2019s clear that Mitch McConnell is the biggest obstacle in the way,\" said Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi.\n\nMcConnell said the Senate\u2019s path forward is still \u201cunder discussion.\u201d The GOP leader added that the Senate is still \u201clooking at doing something on drug pricing.\"\n\nThe Senate package contains some elements of Pelosi\u2019s plan to bring down drug prices by capping expenses for seniors with Medicare prescription drug coverage and restraining drug increases. But is does not contain negotiating provisions Pelosi is seeking. Many Republicans don\u2019t like that bill to begin with, but they dislike Pelosi\u2019s plan even more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge government intervention in the drug marketplace, with a lot of price-setting. And the government basically pretty much taking over a private industry,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), McConnell\u2019s chief deputy. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad policy and I think it\u2019s dead on arrival over here.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSocialist price controls will do a lot of left-wing damage to the healthcare system,\u201d McConnell said.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/78/8c313ba64600985eb5e9432b85bd/190819-mitch-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
