SUE\u2019s bones (250 of 380, making this specimen the most complete T. rex ever unearthed) have helped researchers understand the creature\u2019s biology and behavior, but the nearby fossils have yielded other insights\u2014among them clues about the foliage that SUE peeked through and trampled each day. \u201cWe\u2019re able to reconstruct this environment in an intense and layered way because the fossil record is so good,\u201d says Meredith Whitfield, an exhibition developer at the Field Museum. As of this month, one of those layers involves a whiff of what the Cretaceous may have smelled like.\n\nWhen the museum set out to reimagine SUE\u2019s display\u2014which reopened in 2018, after relocating from the main hall to a second-floor gallery\u2014the goal was \u201cto make people feel as much as possible as if SUE is in the room with them,\u201d Whitfield says. Accordingly, the new exhibit engages several senses. One interactive display invites visitors to place their elbows on a table and touch their cheekbones as sound waves travel through, mimicking the sensation of the low-frequency rumble of a 40-foot-long predator stamping by. And then there\u2019s the smell. \u201cScent is an unexpected way to bring an environment to life,\u201d Whitfield says.\n\nTake a whiff! Courtesy the Field Museum\n\nTo make the smell of the Cretaceous vivid, the team settled on trying to simulate four smells, from the trees in the forest to the gnarly stench of dinosaur breath. To pull it off, they used paleontological knowledge, modern chemicals, and a whole lot of fiddling. As anyone who has wandered a forest knows, the smell of it all\u2014the nose-prickling pine, the softer scent of flowers in bloom\u2014is a distinct part of the experience. So the team had to first figure out which living plants were most similar to what would have grown around SUE and its fellow dinos.\n\n\u201cEnd-Cretaceous floras are pretty similar to a hardwood-dominated swampland today,\u201d says Az Klymiuk, the museum\u2019s collections manager of paleobotany. On the basis of fossils, scientists know, for example, that there were ponds covered with thick mats of Cobbania, a plant similar to living water lettuce, with floating, rosette-forming leaves. On land there was probably broad-leaved forest stippled with some conifers like cypresses and redwoods. The prehistoric record also includes leaves from the genus of the modern tulip tree, Liriodendron tulipifera. \u201cI think of Hell Creek being similar to [present-day] Northern Florida or South Carolina,\u201d Klymiuk says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an alien landscape at all.\u201d\n\nSo the paleobotanist came on board to help point the team toward modern smell analogues for Cretaceous flora. Chemically, \u201cplant scents don\u2019t change very much,\u201d Klymiuk says. Once the team had some ideas of modern plant scents to work off of, and decided on ginger root, cypress resin, and the flowers of a tulip tree, the detective work and custom tinkering began.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re at the hyena enclosure at the zoo and smell their poop, that\u2019s probably close to what T. rex poop smelled like.\u201d\n\nWhitfield is a Tennessee native, but as far as she can recall, she\u2019d never taken a whiff of the tulip tree, the official state tree, and one of the scents the team had agreed on as a good candidate. So in May 2019, when the Chicago Botanic Garden had one in bloom, she went on what she calls a \u201csniffing expedition.\u201d Compared to other flowering trees, Whitfield says, \u201cit smells a little greener, more like wet cucumbers or grass.\u201d\n\nThe group spent the rest of the summer concocting and fine-tuning. The team wanted scents that were long-lasting and wouldn\u2019t need constant top-offs, but some first attempts were a little too cloying or perfume-y, with too many notes. \u201cOne of the cypress ones smelled a little too vanilla-y, and we said, \u2018We\u2019re looking for straight-up one thing\u2014plain cypress,\u2019\u201d Whitfield recalls.\n\nPinpointing other smells of the period was less like perfumery and more like a test of olfactory endurance. But that\u2019s what you get when you sign up to simulate the smell of a giant predator. They quickly gave up on imitating T. rex poop. Most of the commercially available synthetic feces scents are imitations of human waste, and our generally omnivorous diets stray too far from SUE\u2019s carnivory. Cat poop is slightly better, because they\u2019re obligate carnivores, Whitfield says, but hyena droppings would be ideal, because that includes both chewed-up meat and ground bones, just like SUE\u2019s deuces. Turns out synthetic hyena poop scent is hard to come by, so the team moved on. (But, Whitfield adds, \u201cIf you\u2019re at the hyena enclosure at the zoo and smell their poop, that\u2019s probably close to what T. rex poop smelled like.\u201d)\n\nWhen SUE stomped around, the area now known as the Hell Creek Formation in South Dakota probably looked a lot like parts of Florida, cypresses and all. Ron Clausen/CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nDino breath, on the other hand, was both tempting and feasible. \u201cFrom anatomical studies of SUE\u2019s teeth, we can say, \u2018Well, you have the kind of anatomy that might suggest that you have some nasty raw meat decaying in your mouth,\u2019\u201d Whitfield says. \u201cWhat did that smell like? The answer is: Bad.\u201d\n\nThe team found a service that manufactures a range of prepackaged smells\u2014mainly pleasant air fresheners for hotel lobbies and other benign places, but also stinky ones for police training exercises, so that officers can learn to detect stuff like meth labs, decomposing bodies, and other malodorous things. The one called \u201cdecaying flesh\u201d fit the bill quite nicely\u2014but the challenge for the design team was making sure the smell didn\u2019t clear the exhibit with its foulness or make visitors retch when they caught a whiff. \u201cOne of the variants was so bad that I said, \u2018This is probably really accurate, but I don\u2019t think we can expose visitors to this,\u2019\u201d Whitfield says. The goal was to find \u201cthe line between, \u2018This is gross and I can experience it being gross and then walk away,\u2019 versus \u2018It\u2019s so gross that it\u2019s making me physically sick.\u2019\u201d So they diluted, and diluted some more. Members\u2019 nights gave the team a chance to see how the smells were landing before the galleries reopened to the public, so they could settle on a dilution that \u201cgot it across without whacking you in the face,\u201d Whitfield says.\n\nThe scent stations include sweet smells and one spectacularly stinky one. Courtesy the Field Museum\n\nThe smells are presented as oils stashed in little cylinders. They waft continuously, but are only detectable when visitors open little grilles that sit on top. Some of the final smells may conjure the assemblage under your sink. \u201cCypress is kind of a resin-ness that people would associate with pine\u2014it smells a little like Pine-Sol,\u201d Whitfield says. The ginger root scent evokes Lemon Pledge. The breath, on the other hand, smells like rotting meat, and has Klymiuk\u2019s stamp of authenticity. There\u2019s no reason to think that bacteria\u2019s basic metabolic functions have changed much over time, they say, which means that \u201cI have no doubt that rotting meat today smells like rotting meat in the past.\u201d\n\nChatting with people wandering exhibits or attending public education events, Klymiuk often hears a similar refrain: that the Cretacous seems a little \u201ctoo normal,\u201d as if we might expect a 67-million-year-old forest to look and smell radically different from one today. The similarity can be hard to process. It can be uncomfortable to think about long-vanished creatures existing in a world that\u2019s not so unlike ours. Imagining an otherworldly landscape, instead, \u201cgives us comfort and keeps us at a distance,\u201d Klymiuk says.\n\nKlymiuk doesn\u2019t think this discomfort is a bad thing. By making the past immediate and accessible, they hope that visitors will \u201cthink a little more about the world we\u2019re in and how fragile it is\u201d\u2014how many birds are disappearing, how many tree species are struggling. \u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening to see what is essentially a modern forest that you could walk out into tomorrow and stick a Tyrannosaurus into.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jessica Leigh Hester", "January", "Vittoria Traverso", "December", "Erik Shilling", "April", "July"], "top_image": "https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzUzODZlZDJlMGNkMDcyZDI2ZV9UMEtUWEQuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjYwMHg-Il1d/T0KTXD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
