With Dick\u2019s set to announce its quarterly results on Thursday, it\u2019s possible the company will also release plans to remove hunting products from more of its stores.\n\nDick\u2019s still sells guns at about 600 of its stores.\n\nBut the company has felt pressure to move away from guns in response to mass shootings. After the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, Dick\u2019s stopped selling AR-15-style rifles. Then after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, the company stopped selling \u201chigh-capacity magazines\u201d and AR-15-style rifles at its Field & Stream stores. It also set a minimum age of 21 for gun purchases.\n\nSome shareholders have pressured the company\u2019s leadership to stick by guns. Last summer, a conservative think-tank leader pressed CEO Edward Stack on the subject during a shareholder meeting, saying the company \u201calienated\u201d gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStack said the company saw the move as being \u201cthe best decision for the long-term aspect of our shareholders.\u201d\n\nDick\u2019s said it was already seeing a slump in hunting gear sales when it decided to pull rifles from 10 stores last fall. The stores picked for the test had particularly weak sales for the gear.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 questions about the results of the 125-store test.

More than 120,000 people signed a Walmart employee\u2019s petition protesting the company\u2019s firearm sales since 22 people were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas earlier this month.\n\nWalmart still sells guns at about half its U.S. stores. In 2015, the company stopped selling assault-style rifles. It also set a minimum age of 21 for weapon purchases last year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nDoug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s CEO, said the company would be \u201cthoughtful and deliberate\u201d in its response after the shooting.
