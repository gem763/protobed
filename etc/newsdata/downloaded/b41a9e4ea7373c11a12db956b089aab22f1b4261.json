I open up the room for them to get vulnerable, share and grow,' she wrote.\n\nA client, Brisja, 32, described her body paint experience with Anne-Claire.\n\n'In the past few years, I've found my way into a fairly healthy acceptance of my body as it is. But acceptance is a really quiet feeling.\n\n'When I saw the photos for the first time, I didn't just feel accepting, I felt totally awestruck by what I saw,' she said of the resulting images.\n\nAnother woman, model, dancer and actress Margherita Barbieri spoke candidly about her battle with anorexia.\n\nAppreciation: Model Margherita Barbieri said she felt a new-found appreciation for her body after the session\n\n'I feel free' said Margherita as she posed during her body paint session\n\nHealthy: Margherita celebrating her body after years of disordered eating and no confidence\n\n'From my lowest point of anorexia, today felt amazing and I found appreciation for my now healthy and striving, strong, womanly body - on another level to ever before.'\n\n'When you have a negative body image, it consumes you. You're at war with yourself, it's not logical,' she said.\n\n'I think we put too much focus on the way our bodies look, rather than what they can do. Our bodies can do so many incredible things. Appearance really isn't anything when it's compared to how we function.'\n\n'I could look at myself and just appreciate it, rather than just be consumed with the messy thoughts. I'm sat here naked and I don't feel naked, I feel very free.'\n\nSessions, from $619, can be booked online.\n\nThe artist: Anne-Claire divides her time between London, Los Angeles, Rotterdam - and anywhere else a client may live", "description": "Anne-Claire Fleer, inset, left a career in finance to become an 'empowerment artist', traveling the world to give women body paint makeovers after traumatic ordeals such as cancer, abuse or eating disorders", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/17/19263284-0-image-a-327_1570121918319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
