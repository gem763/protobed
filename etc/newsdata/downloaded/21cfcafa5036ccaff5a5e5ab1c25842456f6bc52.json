Ted Cruz compared Hong Kong protesters\u2019 efforts to defend their freedoms against China to former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s efforts to tear down the Berlin Wall Wednesday.\n\nCruz made the comments during an event the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) hosted in conjunction with a Tuesday congressional hearing on Hong Kong\u2019s summerlong protests against a failed Chinese extradition bill that would have sent criminal suspects in Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.\n\n\u201cTo the people of Hong Kong, America is with you. The people of the world are with you,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cYour freedom matters. Your courage is powerful, and it is inspirational.\u201d\n\nThe Texas senator thanked the host of the event, VOC, for \u201cshedding a light on the darkness, the torture, the murder and the oppression that communist regimes inflict on men, women and children every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the people of Hong Kong \u2026 are engaged over an existential battle over what Hong Kong will look like in the future. Will Hong Kong be forced to submit to communist China\u2019s ever-increasing control over the people of Hong Kong? \u2026 I, for one, believe in freedom,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe mighty Chinese government might appear formidable, but all tyrants \u2014 all dictators \u2014 fear the truth, they fear dissidents, they fear sunlight,\u201d Cruz continued.\n\nThe senator, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, brought up Reagan\u2019s efforts to defeat the Soviet Union\u2019s empire in the 1980s, comparing his activism to that of the Hong Kong protesters fighting to retain the region\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "He compared the Chinese regime to the Berlin Wall.", "authors": ["Audrey Conklin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a_TJ2dtG_vYYmK0YHjPF4Q--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/3ba7eaac2bae8659c8686c830b38f50c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
