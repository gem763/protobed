Stories of half of its audience running for the cinema exit before it finishes, stumbling over each other and shaking at the locked doors, desperate to be let out? Well, for The Painted Bird, those rumours are a reality.\n\nThe Czech-Ukrainian Second World War drama, shot in black-and-white and nearly three hours long, had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival yesterday. According to critics, it appears to have had a rather negative effect on members of the public who came to watch it. But with a series of plot points that sound more like endurance tests, who can blame them?\n\nBased on a 1965 novel, The Painted Bird tells the story of a nameless boy as he\u2019s carted around mainland Europe just as WWII is coming to an end, witnessing all of the grotesque goings-on. The audience, it seems, reacted accordingly. In Xan Brooks five-star review of the film for the Guardian (he called it a \u201csavage, searing three-hour tour of hell\u201d), he took note of all of the crowd\u2019s reactions as well as what was going on screen. There was, apparently, a man who stumbled down a whole set of steps trying to escape, a \u201cwell-dressed woman\u201d who ended up hitting her movie theatre neighbour so she could get out faster, and the incredible mental image of 12 attendees piling up at the exit, crying to be let out of a door that refused to open. It sounds horrendous\u2026 I must see it.\n\nNeedless to say the film, which will probably wind up gathering a cult audience and a few prizes come the festival\u2019s conclusion this weekend, has set the bar high for gross-out movie moments.", "description": "Following mass panic and chaotic walkouts at its first screening in Venice, \u2018The Painted Bird\u2019 has already proven it's not for the faint-hearted.", "authors": ["Meera Navlakha", "Talia Slonim", "Isabelle Daza"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f9258ff764f000860d9a1/lede/1567593481119-The-Painted-Bird-1108x0-c-defaul.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
