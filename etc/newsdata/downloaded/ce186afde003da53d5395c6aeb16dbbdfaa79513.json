Picture taken October 6, 2019. REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nNadia Cohen, 84, said she was hurt by parts of the mini-series \u201cThe Spy\u201d because they bore no relation to the truth, although she hopes the dramatisation might help in recovering her late husband\u2019s remains from Syria.\n\n\u201cThe Spy\u201d depicts Egyptian-born Cohen - played by Sacha Baron Cohen - as an ambitious, Arabic-speaking immigrant to Israel who is recruited by Mossad and, overcoming his fears and the strains on his family, infiltrates the Damascus high command by posing as a rich scion of the Syrian diaspora.\n\nCohen was exposed and executed by Syrian authorities in 1965. Israel credits information he relayed with helping it defeat Syria in a 1967 war.\n\nNadia Cohen said liberties taken in some parts of the script \u201craise my blood pressure\u201d.\n\nShe cited one sub-plot showing her struggling to work as a seamstress for an Israeli socialite while raising the Cohens\u2019 children alone, and another where a Mossad handler takes a romantic interest in her while her husband is away under cover.\n\nNeither happened in reality, Nadia Cohen said.\n\n\u201cSomeone wanted to bring things into the mix that really hurt us,\u201d she told Reuters in the sitting room of her home in the Israeli coastal city of Herzliya, where framed black-and-white pictures of Eli adorn the mantelpiece. \u201c(This) could have been a great, Zionist, educational series (about) love of country, sacrifice and about his life and my life, my children.\u201d\n\nStill, Nadia, who wept during the interview, said the renewed interest in her husband more than a half-century after his death was a good thing.\n\n\u201cIt is possible, that (the family will have) this anger for two or three more weeks and then we will see it as something that revived Eli, gave him a soul so he lives again among this nation,\u201d she said.\n\nIsrael has long sought to repatriate Cohen for burial from Syria, with which it remains technically at war. In April, with Russian intervention, Syria returned the remains of an Israeli soldier killed fighting there in 1982. Last year, Mossad said it had recovered Eli Cohen\u2019s watch as part of its quest for his body.\n\n\u201cI would kiss and hug all of this (Netflix) production if that\u2019s what would bring Eli to me. I would be grateful. It would be the biggest gift and compensation of our lives,\u201d Nadia said.\n\nThe six-part biopic depicts Eli as lavishing money and attention on potential Syrian sources - including at an orgy that he orchestrates at his swanky Damascus apartment to entrap a top military general. He is also shown reluctantly courting the daughter of a key Syrian contact.\n\n\u201cHe was charming and irresistible. So any woman who saw him (would think): \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t he be my husband, or my daughter\u2019s groom?\u2019\u201d Nadia said. \u201cBut Eli was faithful.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe role was an unusual one for Sacha Baron Cohen, who is better known for fictional comic characters such as bumbling Kazakh reporter Borat.\n\nNadia said she was \u201cnot impressed\u201d when she first saw pictures of Sacha Baron Cohen, wearing Borat\u2019s famous man-thong.\n\nHowever, she said the British actor in his role in \u201cThe Spy\u201d tried \u201cvery hard\u201d to get Eli right, \u201cthough it (the portrayal) was not precise\u201d.", "description": "A Netflix drama about Israeli spy Eli Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian government in the 1960s and was later executed, has received a mixed review from his widow.", "authors": ["Lianne Back", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438025246&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960LR", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
