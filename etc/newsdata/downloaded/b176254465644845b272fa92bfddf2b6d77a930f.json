Gay rights group Reading Pride had led a protest campaign against Chick-Fil-A and were joined by local Labour Party councillors in calling for an end to \u201cbigotry and hatred on your high street.\u201d\n\nThe whole UK Pride Organisers Network have a clear message to @ChickfilA and that is \u201cYou are not welcome anywhere in the UK and we will stand up, like we did today quite rightly telling you to Cluck Off if we see you again\u201d #GetTheChickOut@Reading_Pride we all stand with you! pic.twitter.com/FOq6e1oGmU \u2014 UK Pride Network (@UKPrideNetwork) October 19, 2019\n\nGreat turnout for demonstration against the homophobia of Chick-fil-A #GetTheChickOut Next, Brexit! pic.twitter.com/40figzaNQ3 \u2014 Andy Adams (@_AndyAdams_) October 19, 2019\n\nThough Reading Pride stated \u201cwe respect everyone\u2019s freedom to eat wherever they choose,\u201d the group nonetheless celebrated The Oracle\u2019s decision not to extend Chick-Fil-A\u2019s lease.\n\nThis Saturday in #rdguk we will be peacefully protesting @ChickfilA outside the broad street @OracleReading entrance from 11am.\n\n\n\nMeeting at 10am @theblagrave for debrief and breakfast.\n\n\n\nSay NO to bigotry and hatred on your high street#GetTheChickOut#LoveUnites#ReadingPridepic.twitter.com/ob5B0A7PBu \u2014 Reading Pride UK (@Reading_Pride) October 17, 2019\n\nA spokesman for the restaurant stated that the six-month lease was always intended to be temporary, as the company looks to expand internationally.\n\nThough relatively unknown in the UK, Chick-Fil-A is an iconic American institution. Founded in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1967, the company operates more than 2,300 restaurants in 47 states. It has been voted America\u2019s favorite restaurant chain for the last four years in a row, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index.\n\nThe management\u2019s religious beliefs, however, have proven controversial. Founded by a devout Southern Baptist, S. Truett Cathy, Chick-Fil-A doesn\u2019t open on Sundays or Christian holidays, and includes a pledge to \"to glorify God\u201d in its corporate mission statement.\n\nThe company has donated millions of dollars to Christian charities that oppose same-sex marriage and CEO Dan Cathy sparked a boycott in 2012 when he publicly stated his support for the \u201cbiblical definition of the family unit.\u201d Cathy also claimed that gay marriage was \"inviting God's judgment on our nation.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Chick-fil-A sales have more than doubled since LGBT boycott began\n\nWith liberals fuming, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey even apologized for eating Chick-Fil-A last year. However, despite the boycott campaign, Click-Fil-A\u2019s annual sales have more than doubled since 2012.\n\nGay protesters in Reading have claimed victory, but vowed to continue their demonstrations outside the restaurant over the next six months. Meanwhile, the campaign has drawn the ire of some commentators, with some suggesting the critics could simply \"just not eat there.\"\n\nChick-fil-A opened its first UK restaurant eight days ago.\n\n\n\nAnd already it\u2019s been announced that it\u2019ll be closing once its 6 month pilot is over all bcos of unfounded outrage!\n\n\n\nSo for the next 6months I\u2019ll to do my best to eat at this @ChickfilA in Reading https://t.co/C60WQysB8M \u2014 Obianuju Ekeocha (@obianuju) October 19, 2019", "description": "Gay rights campaigners in Reading, England, are celebrating after a protest campaign seemingly led to the closure of the UK\u2019s first and only Chick-Fil-A restaurant, all over its American founder\u2019s supposed anti-LGBT views.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5dac793e85f5402bd413324b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
