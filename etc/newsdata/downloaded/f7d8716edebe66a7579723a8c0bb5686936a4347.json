Both prices beat the recent Amazon Prime Day deal, when the Pixel 3 sold for $539 and the Pixel 3 XL for $639.\n\nTo be eligible for this deal, you\u2019ll need to be a new or current Google Fi subscriber. The fine print states that all you need to do is activate your phone on the Fi service within 30 days of receiving your shipping confirmation e-mail. Since you\u2019re not required to keep the Fi service going after activation, you can snag the deal, then hop back to a different carrier if you choose to do so. The Pixel 3 works on all major US carriers.\n\nGoogle Fi ran a promotion a few months ago that had the Pixel 3 down to $399. This isn\u2019t quite as good, but it\u2019s worth checking out if you missed getting one during Prime Day.\n\nDolby\u2019s Dimension wireless noise-canceling headphones are currently $399 at Amazon. These are usually $599, so while it\u2019s a sizable discount, the sale price is still more expensive than some other well-received models, like Sony\u2019s 1000X M3. According to our review, the Dimension isn\u2019t particularly travel-friendly, but rather meant to be worn around the house. It can easily switch between multiple devices, and offers a cinematic audio experience.\n\nBelieve it or not, a few Amazon Prime Day 2019 deals are still happening. These aren\u2019t the best of the best, as most of those sales came to an end Tuesday night, but there are a few left to check out.", "description": "Google Fi is knocking $300 off of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, amount to a deal that beats Amazon Prime Day 2019\u2019s sale price.
