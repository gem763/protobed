M. Goldman, said the alleged livestreaming would compromise safety by distracting crew members and intrude on the privacy of those using the bathroom.\n\n\u201cThe cockpit of a commercial airliner is not a playground for peeping toms,\u201d Goldman said in a statement.\n\nAn initial version of the suit alleged that both spouses experienced discrimination, harassment and retaliation in connection with Renee Steinaker\u2019s reporting of the in-flight incident.\n\nA later version of the suit didn\u2019t include those allegations but said they would be restored if the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission approved suing on those allegations.\n\nNo trial date has been set for the suit, which seeks specified awards based on various damages claims.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A lawsuit filed against Southwest Airlines by a flight attendant alleges pilots had an iPad streaming video from a hidden camera in a bathroom in one of the airline's jets.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Davenport"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/earns_southwest_airlines_74822_c0-148-3500-2189_s1200x700.jpg?a3701d6ceef56a3731ddac63cea24b3587b143a5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
