Worryingly, several key indicators such as new orders, output and employment all fell further and any improvement in the headline reading can be explained away as a one-off Brexit related quirk rather than any real improvement in the sector .\n\nEarlier, comments from PM Boris Johnson gave the pound a small fleeting lift, but the attention remains very much on his eagerly anticipated speech from the Tory party conference. The PM is expected to reveal his latest Brexit strategy and while it is not quite a binary decision, traders will be watching closely for which side of the dichotomy between pursuing a no-deal Brexit or a solution on the customs arrangement surrounding the Irish border as the primary focus going forward.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by XTB (David Cheetham) covering: .
