Most recently, and perplexingly, the brand called its Glove Boot the \u201cmost flattering\u201d boot for fall. What does \u201cflattering\u201d even mean, in the context of a boot? Why is this shoe described, by one of its Instagram ads, as having a \u201cholds-you-in fit\u201d? What is being held in?\n\nI happen to think this boot, like so many of Everlane\u2019s latest releases, is downright ugly, but that\u2019s not my (main) point. Everlane uses flattering so frequently, almost indiscriminately, that I\u2019m beginning to wonder what it thinks the word means. Well, sort of \u2014 obviously, it means \u201csomething that makes you look smaller\u201d and/or more in line with conventional beauty standards, which is what makes it such a strange and loaded term to use as often as Everlane does.\n\nEverlane brands itself as conscientious and progressive, which aren\u2019t necessarily at odds with wanting to look and feel good in one\u2019s clothing. But flattering doesn\u2019t just mean looking good, or feeling comfortable \u2014 it means looking thinner, which we are all presumed to want. That Everlane has used this word to describe everything from bodysuits to denim skirts to wide-legged jeans to poplin wrap tops, also suggests that, to Everlane, flattering doesn\u2019t mean much except \u201cbuy this.\u201d (I assume it\u2019s working.) This tic also seems characteristic of the brand\u2019s tenuous relationship with size inclusivity.\n\nEverlane recently opened a brick-and-mortar store in Brooklyn, which Instagram commenters were quick to point out lacked any extended sizing. Nicolette Mason, a popular fashion writer and influencer, posted a Story to her 179,000 followers, calling out the brand for not stocking any denim sizes above 31 inches (equivalent to a size 12), though the site includes sizes up to 35 inches. Mason says a sales associate told her they wouldn\u2019t be stocking extended sizes because they wanted to focus on their \u201cbest-selling\u201d sizes. Mason, of course, pointed out that more customers might buy more sizes if they were available in store.\n\nSoon after posting her original videos, Mason added an update, writing that Everlane had been in touch to let her know it\u2019d be integrating its full range of sizes in the coming weeks. Whether it\u2019ll respond equally quickly to my pedantic complaint about its overuse of an adjective remains to be seen.", "description": "Clothing brand Everlane uses \u201cflattering\u201d to describe most of its new releases, including, strangely, the Glove Boot, which it says \u201cholds it in.\u201d", "authors": ["Katie Heaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/18-glove-boot.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
