Sunday's 1-0 defeat to lowly Newcastle means it is just three wins out of 11 this season and their current league points tally of nine from their opening eight games is their worst-ever at this stage of a Premier League campaign, worse even than the 11 managed by David Moyes in the 2013-2014 season.\n\nWhere once fans rejoiced proudly in the fact of 'Ole at the wheel' - he won 32 points in his opening 12 Premier League games, the most of any manager in their first dozen games in the competition at a single club - United's boss now finds that same taunt flipped on its head, the subject of memes and gifs mocking his seemingly directionless team.\n\nOn the pitch, Manchester United's league form since April 2019 has been terrible, with just 14 points from 15 games, which is only more than three other ever-present Premier League clubs in this period: Southampton (13), Brighton (12) and Watford (10). In comparison, rivals Liverpool - who they face next - have won 42 points since the start of April, three times as many as United, despite playing one game less.", "description": "For Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, life at Old Trafford is tough.", "authors": ["Pippa Field", "Jim White", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/07/Solskjaer-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcpoWzwBIzlnewd68KzIvqGbdgWsTRkUQKJHIOaDgAtI.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
