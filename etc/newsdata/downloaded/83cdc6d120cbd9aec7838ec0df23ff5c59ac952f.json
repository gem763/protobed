His wife, journalist Connie Chung, combed through their closets and came up with just the right finishing touch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs an ode to my father, I dressed up the way he used to dress when he\u2019d cover games,\u201d Povich said in a phone interview. \u201cI had a blue shirt, a rep tie and a jacket and a replica of his fedora. I went to Game 3 and it probably was the easiest of the lot because [Stephen] Strasburg pitched a gem.\"\n\nPovich and Chung were longtime Yankees season-ticket holders, forced to find another team after the Senators left Washington. \u201cWhen I first came to New York in \u201986 \u2014 and remember, I had gone without a team since \u201971 \u2014 the Yankees were terrible. I mean they were terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I felt sorry for them, so I became a season-ticket holder. As soon as 2005 came along, I gave up the tickets.\u201d\n\nBecause \u201cWashington baseball is part of our DNA,\u201d he and Chung became instant and bona fide Nats fans, suffering through all the ups and downs of that fledgling fan base. Superstitious? Sure. Ever hopeful? Definitely. Long suffering? Oh, yeah.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe fourth game [of the NLCS] we watched in bed in a clenched embrace, fearful to the end,\u201d Povich said of Chung. \u201cI go all the way back to the incarnation with the first [Senators] and how we suffered for so many years after\u201d the 1933 World Series loss to the New York Giants.\n\nHe has his own superstitious tics, too. \u201cSometimes when the opponent would get men on base in the first two series, I\u2019d turn off the TV,\u201d Povich said, \u201cand Connie would run in [saying], \u2018Why are you turning off the TV? Why are you turning off the TV? What\u2019s happening?\u2019 I just can\u2019t watch. I\u2019ve got to wait three minutes and turn it back on.\u201d\n\nAnd when things heated up in Game 4 of the NLCS, he and Chung \u201cwatched the game in bed, in a clenched embrace, fearful til the end.\u201d He confessed he missed Howie Kendrick\u2019s 10th-inning grand slam in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series because he fell asleep. \u201cI woke up at 5 and looked at the phone and I had all these congratulatory texts from friends of mine. I said, \u2018What?\u2019\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor Povich, seeing the Nationals\u2019 success is somewhat bittersweet because he knows how much this run would have meant to his father, who died in 1998 at the age of 92. \u201cThe worst memories for me are those 27 years that he had to be witnessing a drought, that no team was there,\u201d Povich said. George Solomon, The Post\u2019s former sports editor, \u201ctold me that every year he\u2019d invite my father to go to Opening Day in Baltimore, and as a protest, my father would refuse.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also meaningful because the Poviches have a family history with the Lerners, who own the Nationals.\n\n\u201cMy father and mother went to Ted Lerner\u2019s wedding,\u201d Povich said. \u201cWe feel a kinship there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe has a kinship with the Houston Astros, too. The late Bo Bregman, a Washington native and the great-grandfather of Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, \u201cwas my father\u2019s best friend and lived around the corner from us,\u201d Povich said. \u201cThey would have a drink every night. Bo would come over and was part of our family. When Dad would work and I would play various sports at Landon, Bo would come out and be my surrogate father. I have a great affection for that family.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSo, you see, this business of being a Nats fan is a little complicated.\n\nPovich and Chung can\u2019t get to the Series until Game 5 because of prior commitments in Texas and he admitted to a bit of angst in even rooting for the Series to get to that point. Still, Povich, who covered the Senators\u2019 final game as a reporter at Channel 5 in 1971, hopes to be a part of the city\u2019s first World Series appearance in 86 years, and the accompanying Washington baseball renaissance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I went to the stadium, I really have never heard a crowd with that kind of crescendo since the Redskins\u2019 RFK Stadium days,\u201d Povich said of the NLCS. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a Washington crowd that loud and that celebratory on every pitch. I was just blown away because of how long it\u2019s been \u2014 back to the RFK days.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s like that again during the World Series, Povich might just get swept up in \u201cBaby Shark\u201d mania, the craze that has swept fans ever since outfielder Gerardo Parra used the children\u2019s song as his walk-up music back in June. The Nats introduced a plush baby shark toy in the dugout during the Cardinals series, with Povich as a witness.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I was sitting almost within about 50 feet of Parra and where he sits in the dugout and I saw his little toy baby shark in the netting,\u201d Povich said. \u201cWith every hit, I see the gestures the players [and fans] make. And,\u201d he said with a laugh, \u201cI will do that. I guarantee my friends the Yankees fans will say, \u2018Are you nuts?\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNuts? No, he\u2019s a Nats fan.\n\nRead more World Series coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "From his legendary father to his memories of the Senators to his relationship with the Nationals' owners, Povich's ties with Washington baseball run deep.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_jkQiGWY-9nsGoLhrV0FcWbCIeI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WGC4XS36MNF5BCFGGUA3M6JSUE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
