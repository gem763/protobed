The government supports these language policy movements, however, it does not set the policy at the institutional level.\n\n\"An institution may implement a language policy that allows for dual mediums of instruction in terms of the policy. However, they may not implement policy that results in language being a barrier to access and success for students.\n\n''Private higher education institutions must also uphold the Constitution and implement language policies that do not act as barriers to access and success,\" said Nzimande.\n\nNews24 reported earlier that Stellenbosch University's adoption of its 2016 language policy was \"constitutionally justified\".\n\nThe Constitutional Court handed down judgment in favour of the university on Thursday, with Justice Johan Froneman saying the previous language policy had made people, who did not speak Afrikaans, feel excluded.\n\nThe court said the current policy was more inclusive.", "description": "Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande made the statement in reply to a question from FF Plus MP Wynand Boshoff who asked him whether it was the government\u2019s policy to permit a university campus to be predominantly Afrikaans speaking", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9217/e4e4b53c98c6462b8fa0600ae29a3284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
