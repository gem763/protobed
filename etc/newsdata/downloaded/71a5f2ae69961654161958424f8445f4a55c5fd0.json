The prime minister will resign,\" the minister told the Times.\n\nJohnson's election bid in doubt\n\nJohnson's response to the bill's passage through the Commons earlier was to call again for a general election, with Downing Street insisting that blocking no-deal had wrecked the UK's negotiating position with the EU.\n\nHowever, Labour MPs, who are wary of a trap and of agreeing to a snap poll on Johnson's terms failed to vote in favour of the election motion, meaning it was rejected.\n\nA Downing Street source indicated that the government would ask parliament again next week to approve an October 15 election.\n\n\"If Labour's position is that they're just waiting for the bill to get sent, the most straightforward route is to bring back the FTPA [election vote] next week,\" the source said.\n\nHowever, Labour signaled that it could seek to delay the election until November.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated that he favours an early snap election, but other MPs - including shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer - think Labour should force one after Johnson has been forced to delay Brexit beyond October 31.\n\nFollowing a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday, Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, said it was the \"unanimous view\" of his colleagues that they \"won't vote for a pre-November election.\"\n\nHis stance appears to be backed by Keir Starmer, who told the meeting that \"the bill has to be implemented, not just passed, before a general election,\" according to a PoliticsHome report.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and Corbyn's key ally, also indicated that they may not back an October 15 election, saying that Labour was still considering \"a range of options.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson's plan to win an early election then take Britain out of the EU has been thrown into chaos after a series of parliamentary defeats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9174/d5a69948f52f4fa0ae0e6ad8895acffb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
