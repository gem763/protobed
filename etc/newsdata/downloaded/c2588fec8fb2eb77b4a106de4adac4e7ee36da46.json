REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Intelligence Committee has sent a letter to Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, demanding he testify before the panel on Sept. 25, a committee aide said on Monday.\n\nIn a letter sent on Friday and seen by Reuters, the committee said Flynn had failed to comply with its subpoena, served on June 12, or cooperate with its efforts to secure his compliance.\n\nAttorneys for Flynn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFlynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, resigned as Trump\u2019s national security adviser in February 2017. He pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by President Barack Obama.\n\nThat plea came in connection with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nFlynn was one of the first people in Trump\u2019s inner circle to be charged by Mueller\u2019s prosecutors for lying to investigators. Flynn worked on Trump\u2019s election campaign and the conversations with Kislyak took place between Trump\u2019s November 2016 election victory and his inauguration in January 2017.", "description": "The U.S. House Intelligence Committee has sent a letter to Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, demanding he testify before the panel on Sept. 25, a committee aide said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427997874&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881E2", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
