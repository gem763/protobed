Mosley to big contracts, then drafting defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who some considered the best prospect in the draft, with the fourth overall pick. Combined with growth from second-year quarterback Sam Darnold and rising safety Jamal Adams, many in the NFL world expected the Jets to take a big step forward this season, potentially even challenging for an AFC Wild Card spot.\n\nHowever, Week 1 began with a hiccup when the Jets blew a 16-0 lead to the Buffalo Bills, eventually losing 17-16 in what should have been an easy first win.\n\nSince then, things have only gotten worse.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that starting wide receiver Quincy Enunwa will miss the rest of the season with a neck injury.\n\nJets coach Adam Gase has a tall task to keep the Jets afloat. John Amis/AP On Thursday, the Jets revealed that Darnold is expected to miss several weeks with a case of mono. That will thrust backup Trevor Siemian into the spotlight. Siemian is a solid break-in-case-of-emergency option but has not dazzled as a starter, with a 59% completion, 30 touchdowns to 24 interceptions, and a career 79.9 passer rating.\n\nBell also received an MRI on his shoulder on Thursday, which ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported came back negative. Still, it's concerning that Bell is dealing with an MRI-worthy issue so soon into the season.\n\nMosley and Williams are also both battling injuries, though neither is expected to be serious.\n\n\"We're running out of bodies,\" head coach Adam Gase told reporters on Thursday.\n\nWorsening problems is the Jets face a daunting early schedule, with upcoming games against the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys, and Patriots again before their schedule mellows again.\n\nThe Jets have a Week 4 bye, meaning it's possible that Darnold comes back for Week 5, though it's tough to tell and the team didn't give an official timetable.\n\nWhile anything could happen week to week, it's not unrealistic to think the Jets could begin the season 0-6. By then, any hopes at the playoffs might be far out the window, barring a 10-0 finish.\n\nPerhaps the Jets can surprise and steal a few early games against superior opponents. If not, the season could get out of hand quickly.", "description": "A case of mono for Sam Darnold and injuries to some of the Jets' best players suddenly has the team facing a possible 0-6 start.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7aa8772e22af096128a972-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
