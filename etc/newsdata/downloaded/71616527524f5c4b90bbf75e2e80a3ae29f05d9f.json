In this way the homes resemble protruding \u201cnails\u201d on the landscape that refuse to be hammered down, and demolition workers simply have to work around them. In the end, stubborn residents often find their homes surrounded by parking lots, or roads, but they continue to live there.\n\nPhoto by REUTERS/Paul Yeung.

Choi Chu Cheung, the owner of the villa, and his wife Zhang Lian refused to accept the compensation offered by the developer.\n\n\"These houses have captured China\u2019s imagination because they represent a \u2018David and Goliath\u2019 struggle,\u201d explains Steve Hess, who is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Transylvania University in Kentucky. He\u2019s spent years studying the phenomenon, and in 2010 published a paper titled Nail-Houses, Land Rights, and Frames of Injustice on China's Protest Landscape.\n\n\u201cThey first emerged as a phenomenon in the mid-1990s,\" he explains via email. \u201cThis is when a reform in 1994 shifted many tax revenue sources from local government to the national government.\u201d\n\nWhat this achieved, Steve explained, was the diversion of money to the central government, leaving local authorities strapped for cash. One solution was for regional officials to start selling land to developers, over which they had jurisdiction. And as they wasn\u2019t obliged to pay market rates to displaced residents, they began making a lot of profit as they resold the properties. Over time this loophole became something of an official scam, which is something residents are today only too aware of.\n\nTao Weiren sits in front of his two-story house in Guangfuli neighbourhood in Shanghai in March 2016. On paper, the Guangfuli neighbourhood is a real estate investor's dream: a plot in the middle of one of the world's most expensive and fast-rising property markets. But the reality is more like a developer's nightmare, thanks to hundreds of people living there who have refused to budge from their ramshackle homes.

But they\u2019re also increasingly perceived as local heroes.\n\n\u201cNail house protests really resonate with the Chinese public because of the wide perception that local officials are corrupt and collude with developers,\u201d explains Steve. \u201cThe movement has come to symbolise the growing \u2018rights consciousness\u2019 within China, as citizens stand up against local officials who are misusing their offices.\u201d\n\nOf course, standing up to Chinese state officials is incredibly dangerous, and many people who refuse to go have been thrown in jail. For this reason, protesters often turn to foreign news organisations and social media to use publicity as a kind of protection, according to Steve. This is a rather new technique though, and for most of the 90s and early 2000s protesters adorned their homes with signs and banners, and even chained themselves to properties to stop demolition crews.\n\nA partially-demolished house at a construction site in Hefei, Anhui province in February 2, 2010. The owner of the house was attempting to seek more compensation before agreeing to the demolition of their home. The owner of the nail house reached an agreement with the local authorities and the house was demolished on February 9.

In this case the woman was ungracefully arrested\u2014but online she became something of a local hero.\n\nSo why is it that people are willing to take such incredible risks, only to be rewarded by retaining a home that ultimately becomes a traffic island? The answers are fiscal as well as emotional. Firstly, as mentioned, movement officials usually pay inadequate compensation to buy similar-sized homes in the same area. More importantly, though, people are increasingly aware that protesting can lead to increased compensation.\n\nSteve is quick to clarify that this doesn\u2019t mean nail house protests constitute a movement, but rather that individual Chinese citizens are increasingly aware of other successful protests thanks to Weibo and WeChat. Additionally, another federal law passed in 2007 strengthened rights of citizens to their land, motivating many to engage in \u201crightful resistance.\u201d Thanks to these factors, nail houses are becoming more and more common.\n\nA nail house on the outskirts of Nanjing, Jiangsu province in October 2008.
