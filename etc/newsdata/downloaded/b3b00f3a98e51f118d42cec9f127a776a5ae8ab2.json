Every GOP vote counts. A vote is a vote, whether it comes from a fierce MAGA loyalist, a wavering wanderer or someone driven by uneasiness with Democratic socialists. Doesn\u2019t matter. Get that vote.\n\nAnd now comes an eloquent call to arms, aimed at a very specific demographic: Never Trumpers, who have rejected President Trump for myriad reasons.\n\n\u201cCome back, Never Trumpers. All is forgiven,\u201d writes Frank Miele, a columnist for RealClearPolitics.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of erstwhile Republicans who are on the outside looking in, shivering in exile in a self-imposed gulag of superiority, who may just be ready to do a searching and fearless moral inventory of their fears and resentments about Donald Trump and admit that they were wrong \u2014 sincere but wrong,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou surely know by now that you were dead wrong about him. This is a president for the times we live in,\u201d Mr. Miele continues.\n\n\u201cNow think of the war against the fake news media without Donald Trump to fight it. Think of the Supreme Court without Trump\u2019s conservative appointments to balance it. Think of the economy without the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts or its war on restrictive regulations. Think of the wasted billions of dollars if Trump had not pulled the United States out of the idiotic Paris climate accords. Think of the porous border without at least the promise of a wall. Think of the FBI still being run by corrupt James Comey and Andrew McCabe,\u201d he says.\n\nThe columnist has a message for Never Trumpers \u2014 and a warning that the presidential election is devolving into \u201ctrench warfare\u201d with foes who play without rules.\n\n\u201cThe only person on the national stage who seems to consistently understand that is President Donald Trump. But he can\u2019t do it alone. He needs you. And that means he needs you to stop being a Never Trumper and start being a Republican. Again,\u201d Mr. Miele advises.\n\n\u201cThis is your destiny. This is your calling. This is your chance to make a difference. If any Democrat is elected president instead of Donald Trump, there will be hell to pay \u2014 not just for you, but for the country you love,\u201d he cautions.\n\nTHE END IS NOT NECESSARILY NEAR\n\nMedia coverage of the recent and melodramatic \u201cClimate Strike\u201d actions featured many young and restless marchers eager to share their belief that the world soon will end due to climate change. Their zeal for this belief earned them the name of \u201cclimate brats\u201d in some reports. But that is a different story. What about everybody else?\n\n\u201cOver the next 10-15 years, 29% of all voters believe it is at least somewhat likely that the earth will become uninhabitable and humanity will be wiped out,\u201d says a timely new Scott Rasmussen/HarrisX national survey.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that 71% disagree with this finding and find Armageddon an unlikely prospect.\n\n\u201cThere is a dramatic difference by age on this question. Half (51%) of voters under 35 believe it is at least somewhat likely humanity will be wiped out in the next decade or so. Only 12% of senior citizens agree, and only 4% of senior citizens believe it is very likely,\u201d the survey said.\n\nThe data also reveals a significant geographical divide: 21% of urban voters consider it very likely the earth will quickly become uninhabitable, compared to 6% of rural voters and 5% of suburban voters. The poll of 1,000 registered U.S. voters was conducted Sept. 11-12 and released Monday.\n\nTHE FATE OF THE DAILY PRESS BRIEFING\n\nSome journalists are still squawking about the lack of a daily press briefing at the White House, implying that its absence signifies a lack of transparency by President Trump and his administration. After countless melodramatic, rude or inane incidents by reporters, Mr. Trump ended the briefings in March.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, the briefings had become a lot of theater, and I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous. They\u2019re writing books now. I mean, they\u2019re all getting famous off of this presidency,\u201d White House Press secretary Stephanie Grisham tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great what we\u2019re doing now. I think that it\u2019s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there. I think the president saw that it was not what was happening. It had become, again, theater. And the press was not being good to his people, and he doesn\u2019t like that. He\u2019s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it,\u201d she told the network.\n\nIT\u2019S ALL IN THE GAME\n\nOnly in the nation\u2019s capital, perhaps. On Tuesday, the Mean Machine \u2014 21 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle plus 10 NFL players \u2014 take on The Guards \u2014 25 members of the always heroic U.S. Capitol Police \u2014 in a charity football game to benefit The Capitol Police Memorial Fund, Our Military Kids, and A Advantage 4 Kids.\n\nBehold, it\u2019s the Congressional Football Game, established in 2004 to honor the law enforcement officers, and aid the families of the fallen.\n\nMeanwhile, just how seriously do lawmakers take the showdown? Let\u2019s just say they\u2019re required to do push-ups if they\u2019re late for practice \u2014 or breakfast.\n\nThat was the fate of Republican Reps. Steve Stivers of Ohio and Don Bacon of Nebraska when they arrived ahem late for the start of a breakfast staged by The Ripon Society for players & coaches.\n\nAs their coach, former NFL player John Booty, put it: \u201cWhen you show up late, you have to do push-ups.\u201d\n\nBeing the good teammates that they are, Mr. Bacon and Mr. Stivers did just that: They dropped and did five push-ups for the team \u2014 not to mention good cause. Visit the event at CongressionalFootball.org.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 20% of U.S. voters say they are \u201cvery conservative.\u201d\n\n\u2022 19% say they are \u201csomewhat conservative.\u201d\n\n\u2022 31% are moderate.\n\n\u2022 15% are \u201csomewhat liberal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 12% are \u201cvery liberal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 3% are unsure of their personal ideology.\n\nSource: A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered U.S. voters conducted Sept. 13-16 and released Monday.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
