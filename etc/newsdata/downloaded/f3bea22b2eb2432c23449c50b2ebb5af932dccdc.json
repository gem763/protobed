At 50 years old, she's the oldest new medical intern in her class. But age hasn't slowed her down. In her \"Second Act,\" after she's had kids and retired from her public school teaching days, Carol is determined to follow her dream of becoming a doctor. And it's a hoot to watch.\n\nWe meet Carol on her first day as an intern. At first glance her younger colleagues assume she is the chief resident, before quickly realizing she's too nice and goofy to fill the role. And alas the running joke of the series is born: Carol is old for an intern.\n\nAnd the sitcom doesn't let us forget it. In one scene Carol's colleagues even ask her about her \"bucket list.\" But Carol doesn't take it too personally because she knows by the end of the day they'll realize they need her more than they think. As one of her patients calls her, she's \"Doctor Mary Poppins.\"\n\nCarol is charming, kind hearted, and very very funny. So casting Heaton was a no brainer.\n\nWe've seen our share of medical dramas. But a medical comedy is a breath of fresh air. There's plenty of material to work with, and it's in good hands. It was a pleasure to see that Heaton still knows how to nail that comedic timing she perfected in \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and \"The Middle.\"\n\nYes, \"Carol's Second Act\" follows the same predictable formula we've come to know and expect from a primetime sitcom. But there's just something about Carol. She's more vulnerable and approachable than Debra Barone, but no less hilarious.\n\nIt seems like the show isn't just aiming for laughs, either. Carol uses age to her advantage and her gutsy determination should be an encouragement to middle aged women everywhere - not just in the field of medicine. She wins over her colleagues with charm and grace, and I'm sure she'll do the same with audiences.\n\n\"Guess what, my age is what's going to make me a great doctor!\" Carol wisely declares to her superior.\n\nWatch the trailer below and keep an open mind. If nothing else, Carol will get you to laugh.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Patricia Heaton's Carol Kenney is a self-deprecating joy.
