During that time, he is alleged to have shaken the little girl, before his wife returned home to find the tot 'limp and lifeless on a recliner'.\n\nKylie was rushed to a nearby hospital before being transferred to a medical facility in Memphis, where doctors discovered that she had a fractured collar bone, fractured ribs and injuries to her eyes and brain.\n\nClark was promptly arrested and charged with capital murder. During his first trial, held in 2010, he accepted a deal and plead guilty to depraved heart murder. The father was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAccording to the Daily Journal, the decision was appealed on the grounds of ineffective counsel, with a second trial going to a jury in 2016.\n\nThe jurors found Clark not guilty of capital murder, but guilty of second degree murder. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.\n\nDuring that trial, medical expert Dr. Karen Lakin testified on behalf of the prosecution, claiming that the baby had been violently shaken by Clark.\n\nClark is pictured in prison. He has been behind bars for almost 12 years over the death of his daughter, Kylie\n\nShe claimed that shaking a young child in a violent fashion could be enough to cause a fatal brain injury.\n\nHowever, Clark's defense attorney, Jim Waide, has pointed out that Dr. Lakin offered no medical studies or reports to back up the claim.\n\nHe further cited a 2016 study by the Swedish government which claimed there was 'insufficient scientific evidence on which to base a diagnosis of Shaken Baby Syndrome'.\n\n\u201cIt has now been showed as junk science,' he told the Daily Journal.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday agreed that Dr. Lakin didn't provide support for her claims in relation to Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark remains behind bars for the time being.\n\n'He is not free yet,' Waide told The Daily Journal. 'The state still has 14 days to ask the court for a rehearing. Or they could ask the [state] supreme court to hear it.'", "description": "On Thursday, the state's\u00a0Court of Appeals voted 7-3 to allow a new trial for Joshua Clark, after his defense attorney argued that 'shaken baby syndrome' has been proven to be 'junk science.'", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com", "Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20390018-0-image-a-11_1572459108341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
