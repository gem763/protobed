TikTok, which lets users send short videos set to music to their followers, has become hugely popular with teenagers, and currently has more than four million users in the UK.\n\nThe chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s, Javed Khan, said: \"The fact that violent, extremist propaganda is being posted on a social media network popular with children is deeply alarming.", "description": "Islamic State militants have started using TikTok, the viral video app popular with teenagers, to spread disturbing propaganda, including clips of corpses being carried through streets.", "authors": ["Hannah Boland", "James Titcomb", "Robin Pagnamenta"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000188074398-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
