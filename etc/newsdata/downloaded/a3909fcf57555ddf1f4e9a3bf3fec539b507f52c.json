Bast#rds!'\n\nHitting back: Jeremy Edwards has spent his Sunday on Twitter joking about his X Factor: Celebrity performance the night before - and hitting back at trolls who have attacked him for it\n\nBut some took this literally, swiftly launching onto the former Hollyoaks star, 48, to attack him.\n\nOne angry troll posted: '[You looked] like a complete prick!! Don\u2019t think the show did you any favours!! Guess you could argue it was the edit. But I was surprised to see many tweets from people who\u2019ve met you and clearly have negative experiences with you!!'\n\nAnother remarked nastily: 'Coming across like a right c**t you mate!'\n\nTo these, Jeremy sarcastically replied with 'Oh my gosh, am I?' and 'I had no idea I was such a vile human being, what should I do?'\n\n'Don't you know who I am?' Singing at Simon Cowell's lavish LA mansion, Jeremy winked a lot before looking disgruntled when none of the judges recognised him\n\nThe actor - whose audition alongside pal Brendan Cole at Simon Cowell's lavish LA mansion was shown in the first episode of the new series - took to the micro-blogging site to defend himself\n\nHe was also slammed for throwing a 'tantrum' on the show, too, causing further remarks on Twitter.\n\nHe was seen looking disgruntled as judge Louis Walsh told Brendan: 'I know who you are, you're from Strictly. But I don't know who you are.'\n\nThis caused Jeremy to throw a strop off stage, as he told his fellow celebrities: 'Don't. I'm serious don't. That was horrible. I don't want fake bulls**t! They were really mean, that was upsetting.\n\n'You're just like, \"well we're trying, we're off the TV in England and people know us and they love us\". It was a bit mean and I don't like people being mean.'\n\nHe joked: 'I can\u2019t believe they made me look fat AND sound out of tune! Bast#rds!'\n\nAnd fans were less than impressed by the duo's performance and Jeremy's diva behaviour with dozens taking to Twitter.\n\nOne wrote: 'I had no clue Jeremy Edwards was such an arrogant turnip.'\n\nSomeone else added: 'His reaction cracked me up so much. I can't tell if he is being serious or it's a parody?!'\n\nEdwards and Cole: Professional dancer Brendan, 43, made his debut with Jeremy on Celebrity X Factor on Saturday\n\nReaction: Jeremy posted a tweet later on Sunday afternoon, clearly upset with reaction he'd received\n\nTo which another viewer responded: 'I reckon he was totally serious. His mid-song winks were something else.'\n\nBut Jeremy posted a tweet later on Sunday afternoon, clearly upset with reaction he'd received: 'To all the people calling me names, criticising me. That\u2019s cool. You are entitled to your opinion and I respect that right. Please bear in mind that these comments affect my family, which is not cool. So please think before you type.\u2764\ufe0f'\n\nHe also tweeted: 'I\u2019m actually an ok singer. You can hear the nerves in my voice! I thought we were very entertaining overall!\n\n'I\u2019ve taken a bit of a kicking which I know I should brush off but it\u2019s easier said than done!'\n\nCar crash! Fans were less than impressed by the duo's performance and Jeremy's diva behaviour with dozens taking to Twitter\n\nBrendan also took to Twitter, posting: 'For all of you who watched me and Jem on @TheXFactor tonight.... Sorry we weren\u2019t better. Lost my voice on the day so couldn\u2019t do my harmonies, nerves took over and our soft love song really didn\u2019t work. Eeek #dontgiveupthedayjob'\n\nTo which Jeremy replied: 'What he said!'\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity continues next Saturday on ITV.", "description": "Jeremy Edwards has spent his Sunday on Twitter joking about his X Factor: Celebrity performance the night before - and hitting back at trolls who have attacked him for it.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/17/19660624-0-image-a-7_1570985636776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
