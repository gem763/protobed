The note calls on several gods and demons to hurt Manna and afflict his movements, urging them to: \u201cBind down the eyes, the hands, the feet.\u201d\n\nAttilio Mastrocinque, professor of Roman history at the University of Verona, was the first to crack the inscription, and says the subject of the curse was probably a famous artist. The twin lures of fame and reputation likely prompted their rival to turn to the gods for divine intervention in scuppering Manna\u2019s performance.\n\nA method called \u2018Reflectance Transformation Imaging\u2019 created an enhanced image of the tablet surface, finally allowed experts to read and research the tablet.\n\nWhen the 110-line curse was inscribed on the tablet, the Byzantine Empire controlled the area, and it\u2019s possible that the writer and the dancer named in the curse hailed from rival, even warring, factions.\n\n\u201cThis [tablet] along with many others issued in the late imperial period and in the early Middle Ages, confirms that the Christianization of the Roman Empire did not stop the maleficent magical arts,\u201d according to Mastrocinque, as cited by LiveScience. \u201cOn the contrary, these increasingly spread and became more sophisticated.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Ancient delivery: Divers discover Roman shipwreck packed with perfectly preserved wine, olive oil & KETCHUP jugs\n\nLike this story?
