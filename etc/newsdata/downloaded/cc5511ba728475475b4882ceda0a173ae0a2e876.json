Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Wednesday corrected his initial reaction to House Republicans storming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) secret impeachment lair, calling it \u201cnuts.\u201d\n\nExplaining that he was initially told their actions would be a \u201cGOP version of Occupy Wall Street,\u201d he added, \u201cApparently it was a peaceful protest. Big difference.\u201d\n\nAbout two dozen House Republicans stormed Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment chamber in the basement of the Capitol on Wednesday, where Schiff has been running the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry behind closed doors, out of the view of the general public and most Republican lawmakers. The Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman initially called the move \u201cnuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making a run in the SCIF! That\u2019s not the way to do it. That\u2019s nuts,\u201d Graham said Wednesday, according to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Lindsay Wise:\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC not a fan of the House GOP sit-in protest that has disrupted impeachment depositions today. \u201cThey\u2019re making a run in the SCIF! That\u2019s not the way to do it. That\u2019s nuts\u201d \u2014 Lindsay Wise (@lindsaywise) October 23, 2019\n\nHis remarks came as a surprise to some, as Graham has agreed that Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry has been a farce. Graham this week defended President Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe the Democrats\u2019 handling of the probe, telling reporters that it is akin to a \u201cmob taking over the rule of law\u201d and adding, \u201cthis is a joke, this is a sham, and this is a political lynching.\u201d\n\nGraham quickly backtracked after describing the House GOP members\u2019 actions as \u201cnuts,\u201d claiming he was initially given what appeared to be a faulty description of the Republican lawmakers\u2019 plan.\n\n\u201cCORRECTION: I was initially told House GOP took the SCIF by force \u2013 basically like a GOP version of Occupy Wall Street. Apparently it was a peaceful protest. Big difference,\u201d Graham clarified in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI understand their frustration and they have good reason to be upset,\u201d he added:\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1187106846651207681\n\nGraham is expected to formally introduce a resolution alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) \u201ccondemning the House of Representatives closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry\u201d at a news conference slated for 3 p.m. EST.", "description": "Sen.
