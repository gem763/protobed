You would have the worst poverty problem in America. You would have a homelessness situation that\u2019s completely out of control.\u201d\n\nTrump has taken particular glee in lashing out at Gov. Gavin Newsom, who succeeded Jerry Brown \u2014 another longtime Trump foil \u2014 in the governor\u2019s mansion in Sacramento this past January. Trump had a field day on Twitter when Newsom announced last winter that he was refocusing California\u2019s high-speed rail away from a promised San Francisco-to-Los Angeles leg that had been the target of conservative ire.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/8f/d7/1ba9b9934517a0f82bf050297ee1/trumpadmin-ca.png\" true\n\n\u201cWhen the [Trump] administration repealed the $900 million on the high speed rail, [Trump] was just ecstatic,\u201d said a Trump administration official who added that the president \u201chates\u201d Newsom. \u201cHe thinks most people who are conservatives or agree with him \u2026 [think] that California has gone off the deep end and it should just be broken off and be another country, so it's an easy target for him to direct his ire.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe's not going to win the electoral votes so he obviously doesn't need to cater to them, and he makes other people happy who think that California has strange ideas and values,\u201d the official added. \u201cIt makes sense from a campaign point of view.\"\n\nConflict with California \u2014 both policy-wise and in a more purely political way \u2014 has been a hallmark of Trump\u2019s presidency, which has featured clashes over everything from immigration to health care to environmental protections. But Trump\u2019s biggest provocation against California has been his threat to withdraw the state\u2019s authority under the Clean Air Act to go further than the federal government in setting pollution standards. The move has never before been attempted, although under President George W. Bush, the EPA did refuse to grant California authority for the previous round of tailpipe emissions standards.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, the president argued revoking California's authority would allow automakers to produce more affordable vehicles, leading to \"significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, in what has become a routine display of defiance, California's governor stood beside Attorney General Xavier Becerra to decry the president's latest threat while vowing the state would prevail in court.\n\n\"This was a demonstrable move to assert power and dominance, an aggressive move against the state a few days before U.N. Climate Week to punctuate the point,\" Newsom said.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/1920/1155968404_6087757164001_6087757933001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nBecerra, whose tenure as attorney general has been largely defined by California's much-ballyhooed \"resistance\" to the Trump administration, has filed dozens of lawsuits since January 2017 to defend the state's environmental and immigration policies, among others.\n\n\"Our message to those who claim to support states' rights: Don't trample on ours,\" Becerra said Wednesday in a thinly veiled message to Trump.\n\nIndeed, deregulation, not states' rights, is the common theme of Trump\u2019s environmental rollbacks, said Ann Carlson, co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles law school.\n\n\"Basically, the environmental rollbacks are not about returning power to the states,\" Carlson said. \u201cThe driver is not some serious embrace of federalism, it's really about deregulation.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump\u2019s fixation on California\u2019s worsening homeless epidemic has spurred concerns among elected officials who fear the president is angling to score political points by punishing liberal cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Newsom and mayors have said they would welcome more federal dollars, the most direct ways of dealing with homelessness fall to cities and counties. Reports that Trump is contemplating federal law enforcement action \u2014 bolstered this week by his advisers, who said better policing must play a role \u2014 had state and city officials warning Trump against intervening in their affairs.\n\nMuch of the high-profile legislation advanced in California\u2019s Capitol building over the last few years has been explicitly framed as an effort to protect California\u2019s autonomy on policing, labor rules and the environment against the federal government. Legislative leaders in California\u2019s Democratic supermajority this year backed a \u201cTrump insurance\u201d bill letting California maintain more stringent regulations. Newsom has said he plans to veto it.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to protect California against all threats \u2014 including threats against the quality of our air, our water and our natural resources,\u201d Assemblywoman Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) argued as the bill neared final passage last week.\n\nCalifornia notched a major victory last summer when a federal judge threw out a Trump administration lawsuit challenging the state's new laws limiting the cooperation of state and local law enforcement with federal immigration agents \u2014 an effort to thwart an immigration crackdown.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, before he was fired last year, had actually flown out to Sacramento to announce that lawsuit in person. In a tense speech to hundreds of California police officers, the former Alabama senator went so far as to invoke the Civil War, warning that \"there is no secession.\"\n\nThe warning shot left then-Gov. Brown furious; he said the administration \"was basically going to war against the state of California.\"\n\nSome of the most fiery denunciations of the Trump administration\u2019s clean air rollbacks have come from Brown, who placed climate change at the center of his final term in office.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO on Wednesday, Brown said he does not believe \u201cconservative values play a real role\u201d for Trump, who \u201cis pretty wild in his ranging over political matters\u201d and is influenced by \u201csome of these developers and certain kinds of people he likes to hang out with\u201d who are indifferent to climate change.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re illegitimately asserting power,\u201d Brown said of the Trump administration, because Congress \u201cpassed a law based on evidence giving California a waiver authority. We\u2019ve exercised that in a lawful manner and now on a whim \u2014 I might call it a rhetorical whim, and a tweet \u2014 Trump wants to do undo that. That\u2019s not the way the Clean Air Act works, and I believe we\u2019ll be able to prove that in a court of law.\u201d\n\nTrump may be making pronouncements about California while he's in the state, but he's not talking to Californians, said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego. \"He\u2019s using California as a contrast, as this nanny state that wants to take away your pickup truck and make you drive a Prius, as the state that wants open borders.\n\n\"He\u2019s criticizing the idea and the ideology of California \u2014 this idea of California as a place apart,\" Kousser added. \"That deeply resonates in other parts of the country that don\u2019t like us, and it helps to build his political brand that he\u2019s a courageous straight-talker who\u2019s not afraid of anyone.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman in Washington, DC contributed to this story.", "description": "The president\u2019s latest provocation against the state has been his threat to withdraw the state\u2019s authority to set auto-emissions standards.", "authors": ["Katy Murphy", "Jeremy B.
