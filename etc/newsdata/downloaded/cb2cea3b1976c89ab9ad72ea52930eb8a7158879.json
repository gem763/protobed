Designed by ADDP Architects with landscaping by Tinderbox Landscape Studio the project won the Sustainability Excellence and Top Development (uncompleted) Awards at the EdgeProp Singapore Excellence Awards 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity Developments Ltd\u2019s Alfred Ng, assistant vice president, projects, receiving the award for The Tapestry, which\n\nwon the Sustainability Excellence and Top Development awards (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show flats \u2013 designed by interior designer Cynosure Design \u2013 also scored a Top Interior Design Award for Showflat Design at the same ceremony.\n\nThe 99-year leasehold condo has 861 units in seven 15-storey blocks arranged around a 233,769 sq ft site.

From the entrance, residents or their guests will be dropped at the arrival court, which is landscaped, with a sculpture and a reflective pool.\n\nAccording to ADDP Architects, the fa\u00e7ade of the project was inspired by the history of the place, which was once a forested area with mainly ironwood trees. This is expressed through the \u201cslim and deep fa\u00e7ade\u201d of the blocks, and the woody, brown palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 100m infinity pool is the central feature in the development. Units on the first level of the two blocks closest to the pool will have direct access to the pool from their balcony (Photo: CDL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilities for everyone\n\nMeanwhile, landscape architect Tinderbox Landscape Studio has created a \u201chome within a resort\u201d concept with a pool-centric design. The central feature is a 100m infinity pool interlocked with a 50m lap pool to create an L-shaped central water body. Residents of units on the first level of two blocks that front the infinity pool will also be able to enter the pool directly from their balconies.", "description": "SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Mainboard listed property developer City Developments Ltd (CDL) achieved several firsts when it launched The Tapestry in March 2018.
