They\u2019ll be dropping in every now and again, sharing their expertise on the basics you don\u2019t have time to research and the weird and wonderful things you don\u2019t yet know you need.\n\nWhile applying moisturizer is an obvious part of most people\u2019s skin-care routines, caring for the fragile skin under your eyes is a whole other ball game. \u201cThe skin on our lower eyelids is the thinnest in the entire body,\u201d explains Amanda Doyle, a board-certified dermatologist at Russak Dermatology Clinic. Which is why it is prone to a whole host of problems, including dark circles, bags, and wrinkles. To find the best creams that will actually give you results, we consulted Doyle and five other experts (including one aesthetician). Below, find their picks for the best eye creams to banish dark circles, reduce puffiness, and even ones that brighten and moisturize.\n\nBest overall eye cream\n\nRevision Skincare D.E.J. Eye Cream Three of the dermatologists we spoke with had high praise for the D.E.J. Eye Cream from Revision Skincare for its ability to treat a variety of under-eye concerns. \u201cThis is a favorite in my office,\u201d adds Melissa Doft, founder of Doft Plastic Surgery, who recommends it for patients dealing with wrinkles, sagging skin, puffiness, and dark circles. According to Hadley King, clinical instructor of dermatology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, \u201cThis cream contains dipalmitoyl hydroxyproline and sunflower-seed oil for moisturizing, vitamin C for brightening, and peptides for reducing fine lines and wrinkles.\u201d It also contains goji fruit, which provides additional antioxidant benefits, and cucumber fruit water, which calms the skin, she explains. While it is on the expensive side, it is a multitasking product that will treat just about any problem you may be experiencing. Case in point: Doyle says it can also be used on the upper eyelids \u201cto strengthen the thin skin, and help with crepiness, premature aging, and even hooding.\u201d $97 at Amazon Buy $97 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest eye cream for dark circles\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinCeuticals AOX+ Eye Gel According to King, \u201cThere are many causes of dark circles under the eyes.\u201d Genetics, dehydration, lack of sleep, allergies, nasal congestion, smoking, and anemia can all play a part in contributing to tired-looking eyes. She suggests finding an eye product containing antioxidants, such as SkinCeuticals AOX+ Eye Gel, to treat this particular problem. The AOX+ Eye Gel contains potent vitamin C, which \u201cinterferes with the production of pigment and will therefore brighten dark circles, improve pigmentation, and also prevent free-radical damage from UV-light exposure.\u201d She also has a few lifestyle recommendations that will help, too: \u201cMake sure you are getting enough sleep and that you are well-hydrated. Treat allergies with oral antihistamines. Eat a well-balanced diet and make sure you are not anemic. Stop smoking!\u201d And when all else fails, \u201cconcealers are also helpful for improving the appearance of dark circles.\u201d And if you want all of the powerhouse ingredients but with a creamier texture, Doyle suggests the A.G.E. Complex from SkinCeuticals. $95 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) eye cream for dark circles\n\nOle Henriksen Banana Bright Eye Cr\u00e8me Joshua Zeichner, director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, also loves Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Eye Creme for illuminating the skin under the eyes. The cr\u00e8me contains vitamin C, which \u201cneutralizes free-radical damage, calms inflammation, and blocks the production of abnormal pigmentation to brighten under-eye circles.\u201d This eye cream also works as a primer for concealer and helps makeup apply more smoothly. Rio is a vocal fan as well, and after using the product twice a day for four months, she writes, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a big change in my dark circles (less corpselike, more French), and it\u2019s become my go-to under-eye prep.\u201d $38 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest eye cream for deeper wrinkles\n\n\n\n\n\nRoC Retinol Correxion Anti-Aging Eye Cream According to Zeichner, \u201cRetinol is your go-to ingredient for wrinkles.\u201d Retinol works by stimulating collagen production to strengthen the skin\u2019s foundation and improve the appearance of lines. And since this cream uses a vitamin A derivative that is less strong than prescription-strength retinol, you\u2019re less likely to experience any irritation. Doft agrees and adds, \u201cIt also has hyaluronic acid, which attracts water and locks in moisture.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest eye cream for sensitive skin\n\n\n\n\n\nNEOCUTIS Lumi\u00e8re Bio-restorative Eye Cream \u201cI would swim in this product if I could,\u201d says Dara Liotta. Since many of the Neocutis products developed out of wound-healing research, they work to build collagen and smooth fine lines and wrinkles while hydrating the delicate eye skin, she explains. \u201cI\u2019ve found that regular use of this product around the eyes prevents the fine lines that trap makeup and make the eye skin look cr\u00eapey and dry.\u201d It is also fragrance-free, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. $97 at Amazon Buy $97 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest eye cream for under-eye bags\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinBetter Instant Effect Gel EYE Several of the dermatologists we spoke to were all in agreement that caffeine is the No. 1 ingredient to look out for if you want to tighten bags and reduce puffiness. \u201cThis is a caffeine-based eye serum that is used to instantly tighten the delicate skin around the eyes, reducing bags and puffiness,\u201d says Doyle. $85 at SkinBetter Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) eye cream for under-eye bags\n\nFIRST AID BEAUTY Eye Duty Triple Remedy According to King, \u201cPuffy under-eye bags can either be from fluid or a fat pad.\u201d If you notice that the puffiness is worse in the morning and better by evening, then your eye bags are most likely the result from fluid buildup. In which case, her advice is to \u201cdrink more water, eat less salt, and sleep propped up on a couple of pillows,\u201d so the fluid does not collect in the under-eye area. She also suggests using an eye cream, like First Aid Beauty Eye Duty Triple Remedy, containing caffeine since it constricts blood vessels and can, therefore, keep the fluid from accumulating. Eye bags are also generally caused by the skin losing elasticity over time and sagging. \u201cCold tea-bag compresses can also be helpful because both the caffeine and the cold can constrict blood vessels.\u201d However, she notes that if your eye bags are pretty much constant, it is more likely the result of the fat pads under the eyes drooping as you age. If that is the case, the only permanent solution is surgery. $36 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest eye cream for puffiness\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday Riley Auto Correct Brightening and Depuffing Eye Contour Cream Unlike under-eye bags \u2014 which can be caused by a combination of fluid, drooping fat pads, and skin elasticity \u2014 puffiness is usually just from fluid retention alone. According to Doft, this eye cream is chock-full of caffeine and ginseng, which will reduce puffiness and make eyes look less tired. It also contains lutein, a powerful antioxidant, which adds a glow, as well as cocoa and shea butter to smooth and plump the skin. $65 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) eye cream for puffiness\n\nKIEHL'S SINCE 1851 Eye Fuel If you\u2019re looking for a product with a healthy kick of caffeine at a more palatable price point, Zeichner likes this one from Kiehl\u2019s. It is also formulated with B12 to add radiance and glow to tired eyes. Plus, it\u2019s paraben-, sulfates-, and phthalates-free. $23 at Sephora Buy $23 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest night eye cream\n\nBiopelle Tensage Stem Cell Anti Wrinkle Cream for Eyes \u201cBiopelle Stem Cell Eye Cream is a rich, nourishing night eye cream ideal for the fragile eye area,\u201d says head aesthetician of La Suite Spa x Union Square Laser Dermatology, Rhea Souhleris Grous. It is also formulated with caffeine, peptides, antioxidants, soothing botanical extracts, brightening agents, and retinol to fight puffiness, as well as wrinkles and dark circles. $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest brightening eye cream\n\n\n\n\n\nEve Lom Radiance Antioxidant Eye Cream If you\u2019re looking to add radiance and brightness, Zeichner suggests this eye cream from Eve Lom. \u201cBotanical extracts and antioxidants soothe and brighten under-eye skin, while peptides lighten hyperpigmentation.\u201d $75 at Sephora Buy $75 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest eye cream that also works as makeup primer\n\nTatcha The Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream The Tatcha Silk Peony Eye Cream contains silk and white peony extract to pump skin full of moisture. \u201cSilk extract forms a protective seal over the skin to enhance barrier function, improve hydration, and protect the skin from the environment,\u201d says Zeichner. The Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream also doubles as a primer and helps makeup apply more smoothly and stay put throughout the day. $60 at Sephora Buy $60 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest all-natural eye cream\n\n\n\n\n\nTata Harper Illuminating Eye Cr\u00e8me If you prefer an all-natural skin-care routine, Zeichner loves this eye cream from Tata Harper that \u201ccontains naturally derived emollients and antioxidants from ingredients like olive oil, and mango-seed butter, which hydrate, protect, and brighten under-eye skin.\u201d This product is also vegan and cruelty-free, with recyclable packaging. $115 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest eye cream for dry under eyes\n\nSkinMedica TNS Eye Repair \u201cSkinMedica TNS Eye Repair is great for people with drier skin types who have fine lines around their eyes,\u201d says Grous. The formula contains peptides to deliver a dose of moisture to dry skin, as well as ascorbic acids and low-dose retinol to target wrinkles. $102 at Amazon Buy $102 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) eye cream for dry under eyes\n\nKiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado At a slightly cheaper price point is Kiehl\u2019s Creamy Eye Treatment, which contains avocado and shea butter, which helps to lock in moisture and soothe the skin, says Doft. $48 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest drugstore eye cream\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye $18 (was $20, now 10% off) And if you just need to pick something up at the drugstore, Zeichner loves Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, which contains stabilized retinol along with hyaluronic acid to help strengthen and moisturize the skin. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
