Pittsburgh got a welcome lift after Crick required season-ending finger surgery Tuesday following the scrap with V\u00e1zquez before Monday\u2019s win, which prompted a team meeting.\n\nSince an injury-plagued month of May for manager Clint Hurdle\u2019s club, there have been so many other issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some more miles on the tires since then,\u201d Hurdle said before the game, when Pittsburgh went through extra defensive skill work.\n\nCole Tucker hit an RBI double for a key insurance run in the sixth, and Jose Osuna added a pair of doubles.\n\nTucker\u2019s double marked the Pirates\u2018 majors-best 50th pinch-hit RBI. Those are the kinds of things Hurdle appreciates right now.\n\nA night earlier, the Pirates lost 5-4 after taking the series opener in comeback fashion Monday 6-4.\n\n\u201cMy encouragement was there\u2019s winning and there\u2019s losing, and there\u2019s winning and learning,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cIf you\u2019re losing and not learning you\u2019re wasting your time up here. You\u2019ll get run out of this game. So there\u2019s lessons to be learned and I think we\u2019ve been able to have solid reviews when things haven\u2019t gone our way.\u201d\n\nJaylin Davis singled home a run, Corban Joseph had an RBI groundout and Mauricio Dubon drew a bases-loaded walk as the Giants got on the board in the fifth against starter Dario Agrazal before winner Michael Feliz (3-4) took over.\n\n\u201cBetween walks, errors, we gave up some cheap runs and it came back to haunt us,\u201d Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cOffensively we didn\u2019t do much.\u201d\n\nAdam Frazier and Kevin Kramer hit RBI singles in the second for the Pirates, who are 13-6 over their last 19 in San Francisco. Giants righty Logan Webb (1-2), making his fifth major league start, threw a pair of wild pitches that inning and was done after 4 2/3.\n\nStephen Vogt started a second straight day at catcher for San Francisco after hitting a two-run homer and driving in four runs in Tuesday\u2019s 5-4 win. Bochy had planned to start Buster Posey either Wednesday or Thursday, so he will be behind the plate Thursday afternoon.\n\nPittsburgh rookie Kevin Newman has a 17-game road hitting streak.\n\nVOGEY\u2019S VISIT\n\nFormer Giants and Pirates right-hander Ryan Vogelsong returned to the ballpark and wore his old Giants uniform to observe and work with San Francisco pitching coach Curt Young and the pitching staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see Ryan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Bochy said, noting it\u2019s more about \u201creally just to have him around. He\u2019s good for the players talking baseball. He\u2019s got a great way about him. He provided leadership when he was here.\u201d\n\nVogelsong played 12 major league seasons between the Giants and Pirates from 2000-2016, going 61-75 with a 4.48 ERA in 179 starts and 289 total appearances covering 1,190 innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: RHP Joe Musgrove (9-12, 4.67 ERA) threw on flat ground and the Pirates determined he would be fine to start Thursday against the Giants after he was scratched last Friday because of pain in his right foot. He hasn\u2019t pitched since Aug. 31 at Colorado. \u2026 CF Starling Marte was out of the lineup for a third straight game nursing a tender left wrist. He is limited to pinch running. \u2026 RHP Nick Burdi underwent forearm surgery Wednesday in Dallas performed by Dr. Keith Meister. Burdi is expected to be fully healthy by the start of spring training.\n\nGiants: RHP Reyes Moronta\u2019s shoulder surgery in Los Angeles on Tuesday went better than expected. Doctors repaired his labrum but the capsule didn\u2019t need a fix. \u2026 RHP Johnny Cueto played catch a day after pitching five scoreless innings in his first start since July 28 last year and returning from Tommy John surgery. His next outing is scheduled for Tuesday at Boston. \u2026 3B Evan Longoria had the night off.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMusgrove (9-12, 4.67 ERA) will pitch opposite RHP Jeff Samardzija (10-11, 3.64), who owns a 6-4 career record vs. Pittsburgh over 26 outings and 15 starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Through a long, losing season, the Pittsburgh Pirates have learned to celebrate each other for even the small accomplishments and try to push forward from the times of turmoil - like this week's embarrassing clubhouse fight between a pair of relief pitchers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/pirates_giants_baseball_49439_c0-227-5429-3392_s1770x1032.jpg?f0bd2b2bc6fa5bfd9894978e06c6a4ad60f6788a", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
