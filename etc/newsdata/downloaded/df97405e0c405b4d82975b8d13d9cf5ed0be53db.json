REUTERS/Susana Vera/File Photo\n\nThe U.S. tech giant had come under fire from China over the app, with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper calling the app \u201cpoisonous\u201d and decrying what it said was Apple\u2019s complicity in helping the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nApple rejected the crowdsourcing app, HKmap.live, earlier this month but then reversed course last week.\n\nApple said in a statement that it had began an immediate investigation after \u201cmany concerned customers in Hong Kong\u201d contacted the company about the app and Apple found it had endangered law enforcement and residents.\n\n\u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d the statement said.\n\nApple did not comment beyond its statement, and the app\u2019s developer did not immediately have a comment on the removal. Hong Kong police had no immediate comment.\n\nThe app was removed from Apple\u2019s app store globally but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version was also still viewable on iPhones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the People\u2019s Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple\u2019s Hong Kong App Store at this time was \u201copening the door\u201d to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.\n\nAsked for comment after the People\u2019s Daily piece was published, HKmap.live\u2019s developer, who has not revealed his or her identity, said the app merely consolidated information that was available in the public domain, such as groups on Telegram, another service protestors were using to communicate.\n\n\u201cProtest is part of our freedom of speach (sic) and I don\u2019t think the application is illegal in HK,\u201d the developer told Reuters in a direct message on Tuesday.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.\n\nIn 2011, Apple modified its app store to remove apps that listed locations for drunken driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.\n\nWord of the HKmap.live app\u2019s removal spread quickly in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cDoes the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?\u201d one commentator called Yip Lou Jie said in an online forum, LIHKG, which is used by protestors in Hong Kong.", "description": "Apple Inc on Wednesday removed an app that protestors in Hong Kong have used to track police movements from its app store, saying it violated rules because it was used to ambush police.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439100561&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF99069", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
