Continuing on a theme, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox made light of parliamentary efforts to prevent and reduce domestic violence.\n\nSuch has been the toxicity of the debate on our screens that MPs are now routinely receiving verbal \u2013 and in some instances physical \u2013 threats from incited members of the public. Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats has had threats made against her child and the daughter of former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper has taken to Twitter to describe her daily fear that her mother may, like Jo Cox, not return home from work.\n\nAs terrible as this climate of fear has become for MPs, the toxic atmosphere is also doing a great disservice to us \u2013 the voters.\n\nFaced with the pressure of Brexit, the response to which will resonate for generations to come, the collapse of decorum in Parliament has left a vacuum of serious, detailed and constructive decision-making. In no other workplace, school, college or institution would such behaviour be tolerated.\n\nMuch of this falls within the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\u2019s (ACAS) definition of bullying, namely \u2018offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour\u2019. Yet, the mother of all democracies has somehow allowed it to become normal among those who lead us.\n\nThat is why today More United and Compassion in Politics are launching a new code of conduct for parliamentarians.\n\nThe enthusiasm for this change demonstrates the need and a willingness to defend and promote common values, and to heal a divided Britain.\n\nWe cannot sit idly by while a minority of politicians tear the fibre of our nation to shreds. Humanity pleads that MPs treat each other with respect, but the challenges we face as a country demand that they do so.\n\nThe code of conduct we have drafted may seem quite simple, but that is its beauty. Amid the in-fighting, back-biting, and subterfuge, basic common values have been forgotten. MPs signing up to the pledge will be committing to put country before party, to actively seek out ways to reform debates in parliament to make them more constructive and less combative, and to use the language and behaviour of respect, compassion, and inclusion.\n\nWe have good reason to believe that this pledge can make a difference.\n\nFor one, the current standards of behaviour have hit such a low that MPs across the House of Commons are willing to commit to building a new culture that replaces the rotten one we have become accustomed to. We have recruited over 75 parliamentarians to our networks, representing seven different parties.\n\nSecondly, we know this is something that the public wants.\n\nOver 60,000 people have signed a petition created by four inspiring teens from Manchester and Salford, which calls for MPs to sign up to a new code, pointing out that no child could ever get away with speaking as MPs currently are.\n\nFurthermore, in polling commissioned by Compassion in Politics and carried out by Opinium earlier this year we found that two in three people would like there to be a new code of behaviour for MPs.\n\nThe enthusiasm for this change demonstrates the need and a willingness to defend and promote common values, and to heal a divided Britain.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are inviting MPs to sign up to the pledge and make a personal commitment to putting the country before party interests, bridge divides and speak and act with respect.\n\nWe recognise that wider reforms of Parliament are going to be needed if we are to transform an essentially adversarial institution into one that promotes cooperation, inclusion and compassion.\n\nThis includes, but is in no way limited to, providing pathways for people from under-represented groups to enter Parliament, strengthening the role of bodies which oversee parliamentary practice and creating more opportunities for the public to meaningfully engage with politics and political decision-making.\n\nWe want to leave behind anachronistic, misogynistic and toxic practices \u2013 today is the start of that journey.\n\nNow is the moment to harness the desire for change into a force that can deliver it. There is no more important task.\n\nMORE: Boris Johnson has been spoilt his entire life.
