(Reuters) - None of a dive boat\u2019s 34 passengers survived a fast-moving fire that sunk it off California\u2019s Santa Cruz Island, officials said on Tuesday, as recovery workers prepared to try to retrieve 14 bodies still believed to be on the vessel or in the ocean.\n\nA memorial to the victims of the blaze aboard the 75-foot (23 meter) Conception ship grew, with photographs, notes and flowers on a dock not far from where the ship went down in the early Monday morning blaze and remained under more than 60 feet (18 meters) of water.\n\nScant details about the victims, who range in age from 17 to 60, began to surface as emergency workers planned to use DNA analysis to positively identify the badly-burned remains of the 20 bodies recovered so far.\n\n\u201cSad news: Santa Cruz based trip. Two classmates of my son\u2019s at Pacific Collegiate School and at least two parents on board,\u201d video producer Romney Dunbar said on Facebook.\n\nA trio of tearful young adults hugged one another in front of the memorial, too distraught to speak because of what they said was the death of a dear friend. Behind them a photograph of a smiling young couple included a note, \u201cI love you Allie - and you know I always will! I\u2019ll miss you forever. Rob\u201d\n\nOfficials said DNA was needed for positive identification of the 11 female and 9 male victims recovered so far, most of them residents of the Santa Cruz and San Jose area, authorities said.\n\nThe boat captain was among five members of the six-person crew who were above deck on the bridge and managed to escape in an inflatable boat. The single crew member who did not survive appeared to have been sleeping below deck with the passengers when the fire broke out.\n\nAn investigation was underway to determine the cause of the blaze, as the search for survivors was ended.\n\n\u201cThere were several other victims that were seen by the divers - between four and six - that are still between the wreckage, but due to the position of the boat they were unable to be recovered before nightfall,\u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told a news conference. \u201cToday, efforts will be made to stabilize the boat so that divers can safely enter it, search it and recover additional victims.\u201d\n\nAs the flames engulfed the boat, a man placed a desperate call to the Coast Guard, gasping for help in the smoky fire.\n\n\u201cMayday, mayday, mayday!\u201d he said in a recording of the call.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a distress, this is the Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles on channel 1-6, what is your position ... and number of persons on board? Over,\u201d the dispatcher answered.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine. Twenty-nine POB,\u201d said the man in the somewhat inaudible call. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!... Twenty-nine POB.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher requested the GPS location of the vessel at least two more times but the caller apparently fails to respond.\n\nKristy Finstad, 41, was leading the dive trip on the Conception, according to a Facebook post shared on Monday by her brother, Brett Harmeling. Finstad, a scuba diving instructor and marine biologist, was one of the owners of Worldwide Diving Adventures, the firm that chartered the boat for a three-day excursion to the Channel Islands.", "description": "None of a dive boat's 34 passengers survived a fast-moving fire that sunk it off California's Santa Cruz Island, officials said on Tuesday, as recovery workers prepared to try to retrieve 14 bodies still believed to be on the vessel or in the ocean.", "authors": ["Omar Younis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425863214&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821S4"}
