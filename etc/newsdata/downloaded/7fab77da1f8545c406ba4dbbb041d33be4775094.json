The caps are substantially larger than in previous years. In 2018 and 2019, Fannie Mae FNMA, +5.60% and Freddie FMCC, +5.97% were only allowed to purchase $35 billion in multifamily loans each, however \u201cmission-driven\u201d loans excluded from the caps brought the total volume to $142.5 billion in 2018.\n\nThe FHFA began setting caps on Fannie and Freddie\u2019s multifamily businesses in 2014 in an effort to support liquidity in the multifamily market while also working to prevent private capital from being crowded out.\n\nBeyond expanding the size of the caps, the FHFA also made other revisions to how Fannie and Freddie can conduct their multifamily businesses. In particular, the agency will now require the two firms to have over one third (37.5%) of their multifamily activities be directed toward affordable housing.\n\nRead more: 5 major changes the Trump administration wants to make to housing finance\n\nThis can include loans on properties subsidized by the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, loans on developments created under inclusionary zoning rules, loans on properties covered by a Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment contract. Portions of loans can count on a pro-rata basis toward this requirement if a certain percentage of units within a multifamily development are considered affordable, based on the area\u2019s median income.\n\nFurthermore, the new lending caps eliminate exclusions that allowed Fannie and Freddie to purchase loans in excess of the limits previously in place. Notably, the agency threw out a loophole that allowed Fannie and Freddie to buy green loans that were used to finance certain energy and water efficiency improvements without it counting toward their overall spending limits.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Fannie and Freddie\u2019s share of new multifamily loans increased from 36% in 2015 to 49% in 2017, the FHFA said. Much of that growth was attributable to the green loans exclusion. Around half of the loans both firms purchased in 2017 and 2018 were excluded from the FHFA\u2019s lending caps.\n\nThe FHFA\u2019s choice to expand the lending caps \u2014 while also closing the loopholes that allowed lending activity beyond them \u2014 comes as the Trump administration called on the Treasury Department and the FHFA to consider limiting Freddie and Fannie\u2019s multifamily footprint as part of its broader plan for housing finance reform.", "description": "Over a third of the multifamily loans the two firms purchase must now be directed toward affordable housing.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX913_apartm_ZG_20171108080912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
