Buzz60\u2019s Sean Dowling has more. Buzz60\n\nUber Eats is putting consumers in the driver's seat with a new feature without delivery fees.\n\nThe on-demand food service from ride-hailing company Uber launched a pickup feature nationwide Friday, officials shared exclusively with USA TODAY. The feature was tested in San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas and Austin, Texas, prior to the roll-out.\n\n\u201cThis gives eaters more flexibility in how they access food and provides them the option to order through Uber Eats and collect the food themselves,\u201d said Elspeth Rollert, Uber Eats US head of restaurant brand marketing, noting there\u2019s \u201cno phone calls or delivery fees.\u201d\n\nUber Eats biggest rivals \u2013 DoorDash, Grubhub and Postmates \u2013 already offer the ability to pickup orders along with a growing number of restaurants.\n\nDelivery order short a few fries?: Nearly 30% of food delivery drivers munch on your food in the car, study says\n\nWhere's the beef?: Taco Bell recalls 2.3 million pounds of seasoned beef from restaurants in 21 states\n\nCLOSE Uber Eats has collected the most popular and the weirdest delivery requests it's received for its Cravings Report. USA TODAY\n\nAlong with adding the feature to Uber Eats Friday, the company released Eats Pickup Guides powered by its Jump bike and scooter program for six cities: Miami; Denver; Los Angeles; Sacramento, California; Austin; and Washington D.C.\n\nMatt Wing, Uber New Mobility spokesman, said restaurants typically set prices on the app for items to be same price as what they sell in stores.\n\nWith pickup orders, consumers can use Uber Rewards to earn a point for every eligible dollar spent on rides and Uber Eats. With every 500 points, earn rewards like money off a future ride or meal. Jump is not currently in the loyalty program, Wing said.\n\nDigital orders growth\n\nTo avoid waiting for food and drink orders, restaurants including Starbucks, Dunkin', McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Panera Bread, Chipotle Mexican Grill and pizza chains also already offer pickup options in their apps.\n\nOn Thursday, Chick-fil-A, which first introduced mobile ordering in 2014, announced the addition of dine-in mobile ordering, allowing orders to be placed from the app while sitting at the table and eliminates the need to stand in line to order.\n\nFor national and regional chains with loyalty programs, some consumers may opt to continue using individual restaurant apps to earn rewards and discounts.\n\nAccording to a June report from NPD Group, digital restaurant orders have grown by 23% over the past four years and represent 3.1 billion visits and $26.8 billion, which is more than 3% of the $863 billion industry.\n\nThe market research firm, which defines digital orders as meals or snacks ordered by app, internet or text message, forecasts orders will grow by double digits through 2020 with growth across delivery, on-premises orders and carryout.\n\n\u201cDigital ordering has raised the bar on convenience and with it the customer experience,\u201d David Portalatin, NPD food industry advisor and author of Eating Patterns in America, said in a statement. \u201cDigital ordering overall and apps have provided a path to market to consumers on a one-to-one basis and offer them a restaurant experience customized to their needs.\u201d\n\nUber Eats launched a new pickup feature nationwide. But in six cities, the on demand service made guides for using its Jump scooters and bikes.
