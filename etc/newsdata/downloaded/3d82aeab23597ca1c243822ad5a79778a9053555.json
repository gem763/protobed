That\u2019s as demand for building materials bounces back on industry growth.\n\nThe construction industry is expected to pick up this quarter on infrastructure projects like the East Coast Rail Link, brokerage analyst Abdul Hadi Manaf noted. \u201cAs such, we believe that demand for cement and steel should also recover at a gradual pace.\u201d\n\nCement costs could go up by 10 per cent to RM220 a tonne in the fourth quarter - and rise again to RM250 a tonne in 2020 - as the sector\u2019s price war eases in the wake of infrastructure conglomerate YTL Corp\u2019s take-over of rival cement producer Lafarge.\n\nMeanwhile, the weakness in local steel prices - with bar prices slipping by 3.8 per cent month on month to RM2,103 a tonne in August - is \u201cattributable to weak steel demand and compounded by higher supply from Alliance Steel\u201d, Mr Hadi wrote.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nWhile iron ore prices also fell on a supply recovery in Australia and Brazil mines, a lag of two to three months will funnel the lift towards steel companies\u2019 profit margins, the report suggested.\n\nFitch Macro Solutions had earlier said in mid-August that the completion of key infrastructure projects will boost Malaysia\u2019s construction sector in the long run.\n\n\n\nStill, Fitch also trimmed its expectations for the residential, commercial and industrial building sectors, citing lower planned supply and short-term macroeconomic uncertainties.
