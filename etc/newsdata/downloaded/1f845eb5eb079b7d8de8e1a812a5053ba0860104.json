Specifically, I\u2019m watching a series of scenes clipped from movies and TV shows, all of which have two things in common: The woman beside me, Caren Spruch, had a hand in them, and each one features an abortion.\n\nSpruch and I began our viewing session with her most recent such project, the Hulu series \u201cShrill.\u201d Now, seated at a table in a white-walled conference room, we\u2019re watching the first movie she worked on, 2014\u2019s \u201cObvious Child.\u201d Spruch is petite and animated, with a long face and dark bangs, like a more pixie-ish Anjelica Huston. She calls \u201cObvious Child\u201d \u2014 a romantic comedy about an unemployed 20-something who finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand \u2014 \u201cthe one that changed the world,\u201d setting a new standard for stories about abortion. She has seen it, she estimates, more than 25 times. Still, when she watched it to prepare for our interview, she was overcome yet again by happy disbelief that such a movie could exist. The protagonist, Donna, never questions her decision to have an abortion, nor does she feel bad about it. \u201cIn the middle of watching, I just emailed Jenny\u201d \u2014 the film\u2019s star, Jenny Slate \u2014 \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Spruch says. \u201cI wrote, \u2018You were fantastic. This was such a game-changing moment.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSpruch is the rare person in the abortion rights movement for whom the past few years represent a long-awaited breakthrough in addition to a series of terrifying setbacks. She\u2019s Planned Parenthood\u2019s woman in Hollywood \u2014 or, in official terms, its director of arts and entertainment engagement. She encourages screenwriters to tell stories about abortion and works as a script doctor for those who do (as well as those who write about any other area of Planned Parenthood\u2019s expertise, such as birth control or sexually transmitted infections). It\u2019s a role she slipped into sideways, but one that now seems to be increasingly welcome in Hollywood.\n\nIn the past year or two, word of Spruch\u2019s services has started to filter through the film industry. \u201cNobody used to call me,\u201d she says. \u201cI would be watching TV and going to the movies and figuring out who I thought might be open to including these story lines. Now I have a couple of repeat clients. Now people call me.\u201d She estimates that Planned Parenthood has advised on more than 150 movies and shows since that first effort with \u201cObvious Child.\u201d Writers who have relied on her advice tell me they feel a secret kinship with one another. \u201cWe could see hints of her in all the TV shows coming out, from \u2018Shrill\u2019 to \u2018Jane the Virgin,\u2019 \u201d says Gillian Robespierre, writer-director of \u201cObvious Child.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful. She\u2019s like Planned Parenthood\u2019s secret weapon.\u201d\n\nFor nearly 50 years, it has been legal to have an abortion in America yet stubbornly taboo to show one on television or film. But both those things are now changing: Abortion could soon be outlawed in much of the country, and the impending loss of the right to end a pregnancy in real life seems to be fortifying a new freedom to do so on-screen. With Spruch\u2019s help and encouragement, Hollywood is writing abortion into its story lines, including it as one more possible plot point. \u201cA lot of people learn about sexual and reproductive health care through pop culture and entertainment programs,\u201d says Melanie Roussell Newman, Planned Parenthood\u2019s senior vice president of communications and culture. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen pop culture change views around LGBTQ issues, for example, and pop culture has the power to challenge abortion stigma, too.\u201d\n\nEven antiabortion activists acknowledge that this is a natural tactic. \u201cYou can\u2019t just change laws; you have to change culture, and young people are the drivers of culture,\u201d says president of Students for Life of America Kristan Hawkins, whose organization encompasses more than 1,200 student groups nationwide. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is trying to influence this generation.\u201d At the same time, opponents argue that, as the largest provider of abortions in the nation, Planned Parenthood is an inappropriate source of information for filmmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tobacco industry getting to fact-check how smoking is treated in films,\u201d argues Lila Rose, founder of the antiabortion group Live Action (which is known for releasing sting videos \u2014 criticized for being heavily edited \u2014 that have targeted Planned Parenthood clinics). \u201cThey have no business influencing anyone\u2019s screenwriting. \u2026 It\u2019s a real injustice.\u201d\n\nSpruch\u2019s corner of Planned Parenthood is becoming more important given the current state of the abortion debate. \u201cWe\u2019re in a place where abortion rights advocates don\u2019t have a lot of hope of progress, particularly on the federal level,\u201d says Gretchen Sisson, a sociologist at the University of California at San Francisco who studies abortion in pop culture. \u201cThe potential of popular culture, and particularly television, is that it doesn\u2019t need to wait for policy progress to happen. It\u2019s an area where we can continue to do work, no matter who\u2019s on the Supreme Court.\u201d Facing antiabortion majorities in D.C., Planned Parenthood is pinning some of its hopes on L.A. In the abortion wars, Hollywood is becoming a theater of last resort.\n\nAs Planned Parenthood\u2019s director of arts and entertainment engagement, Caren Spruch encourages screenwriters to tell stories about abortion and works as a script doctor for those who do. (Chris Sorensen for The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s 1972, and a husband and wife are sitting on their bed in pajamas, trying to decide whether to have a baby. She has recently learned that she\u2019s pregnant. Abortion has been made legal in the state of New York \u2014 a development they supported in the abstract, never thinking it would affect them personally. Both nearing 50, they live with her grown daughter from a previous marriage and that daughter\u2019s young son. They enjoy a glass of scotch in the evening and card games with friends; it\u2019s hard to imagine how a baby would fit in. \u201cI love you, and I love my life,\u201d she tells him. Still, she needs reassurance that the choice she wants to make is the right one. \u201cFor you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cFor me. In the privacy of our own lives, you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d Then the credits roll.\n\nThe woman is the eponymous heroine of the Norman Lear sitcom \u201cMaude,\u201d which aired on CBS in the 1970s. Before Maude decided to get an abortion, after a double episode of deliberation (\u201cMaude\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d parts 1 and 2), no character had ever approached the choice so frankly in prime time. Moreover, Maude wasn\u2019t just any character \u2014 she was a protagonist, and Lear had been warned against risking his audience\u2019s regard for the person who kept them coming back to a show. \u201cMaude\u2019s Dilemma\u201d was hugely controversial, flooding CBS with at least 7,000 protest letters the first time it aired (and roughly 17,000 when it was rebroadcast the next year). But the episodes also attracted an estimated 65 million viewers, vaulting \u201cMaude\u201d into the Nielsen top 10. Two months later, the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Maude\u2019s choice seemed to signal the beginning of a new era for abortion, on and off the screen.\n\n\u201cWe could see hints of her in all the TV shows coming out. ... She\u2019s like Planned Parenthood\u2019s secret weapon,\u201d says Gillian Robespierre, writer-director of \u201cObvious Child.\u201d\n\nBut instead, in the decades after Roe v. Wade, the country grew more conservative, and so did the portrayals of abortion on American televisions. In the 1980s, Sisson says, the subject appeared on legal and medical shows, where the main characters were insulated from viewers\u2019 disapproval by their professional distance from patients and clients who had abortions. In the \u201990s and early aughts, secondary characters \u2014 best friends, classmates \u2014 started to have the occasional unwanted pregnancy. By then, the country had elected Bill Clinton, who famously declared that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d: in other words, politically permitted but culturally discouraged. Interviewed in 1992 by the Chicago Tribune, the team behind \u201cMaude\u201d agreed that the abortion episodes would never have aired then.\n\n\u201cThe cultural narrative was one of hesitation and stigma,\u201d Sisson says, and screenwriters\u2019 stories conveyed that ambivalence. On TV, miscarriages became de rigueur twists, as did false-positive pregnancy tests. Some stories were altered to assuage anxious networks: In 2005, \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s\u201d Cristina Yang had an ectopic pregnancy after ABC balked at showrunner Shonda Rhimes\u2019s plan to portray an abortion. (Rhimes has said that she regretted her capitulation for years, and she wrote an abortion into the show in 2011.) In a raft of other stories on TV and film, such as \u201cJuno\u201d (2007) and \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), characters who wanted abortions were struck by last-minute changes of heart.\n\nWhen abortions did happen, they tended to be serious and dramatic, shrouded in regret framed as inevitable. Even on HBO\u2019s staunchly feminist \u201cSex and the City,\u201d when an accidentally pregnant Miranda asked Carrie in 2001 how long it took her to get over an abortion she\u2019d had 13 years earlier, Carrie\u2019s answer was, \u201cAny day now.\u201d Miranda had the baby. In 2010, Fox refused to air an episode of \u201cFamily Guy\u201d that included an abortion, which it deemed inappropriate for a comedy. Forty years passed without a character who had Maude\u2019s sense of certainty.\n\n\u201cMaude,\u201d starring Bea Arthur. (Everett Collection) \u201cSex and the City,\u201d starring, from left, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker. (\u00a9HBO/Everett Collection)\n\nTV series that dealt with abortion include, from left, \u201cMaude,\u201d starring Bea Arthur (Everett Collection); and \u201cSex and the City,\u201d starring, from left, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker (\u00a9HBO/Everett Collection).\n\nWhen Spruch arrived at Planned Parenthood as a senior field organizer in 1989, she wasn\u2019t thinking about the political potential of TV. She was worried about a generational divide. Young people who had grown up in a world where abortion was legal had never had to fight for it. But opposition to abortion had become Republican orthodoxy in the 1980s \u2014 an outcome of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s alliance with white evangelicals \u2014 and a series of Supreme Court decisions were beginning to roll back the right that Roe had established. Part of Spruch\u2019s job was to combat antiabortion legislation, and she started thinking about ways to reach young people who might need Planned Parenthood\u2019s services or support its cause. She began by asking rock musicians like Santana and Dave Matthews Band to allow Planned Parenthood to distribute information at concerts. \u201cThen I thought: Oh, everyone says Hollywood is so liberal,\u201d Spruch recalls, \u201cbut what are we doing with actors?\u201d\n\nIt was slow going at first. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I would put myself where actors were.\u201d She went to screenings, film festivals, fundraisers. \u201cI would do so much homework before I went anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cI would read everything about whoever might be there and think about what I would say to each person.\u201d She remembers pacing rooms packed with wealthy and famous people, mustering the courage to start a conversation. By the mid-\u201990s, her efforts to organize celebrities, a role she\u2019d invented for herself, had ballooned into a full-time job. \u201cThe work with the actors got so big that slowly, we started moving all my other projects out of my supervision because I didn\u2019t have time,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce, Spruch was at the off-Broadway Public Theater with her father when she spotted Maggie Gyllenhaal in the audience at intermission. \u201cSo then, of course, I did not pay attention at all to the second half of the play,\u201d she recalls. At the end, she was torn between waiting to speak to Gyllenhaal, who was talking to the cast, and escorting her father, who was ill and in a wheelchair, onto his Access-A-Ride. Her father told her to wait for the actress. She stalled in the emptying theater for an hour and a half \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude; I will never interrupt a conversation\u201d \u2014 before she saw an opening to talk to Gyllenhaal. \u201cAnd that was it,\u201d Spruch says. \u201cShe\u2019s been a hardcore activist ever since.\u201d Gyllenhaal recalls being introduced to Spruch by Tony Kushner, author of the play showing that night. \u201cI think I said to her, \u2018Just use me however you want,\u2019 \u201d Gyllenhaal says. \u201cShe has asked me to give some speeches that I\u2019m really proud of.\u201d\n\nOver the years, there were some setbacks. In the early 2000s, Spruch recalls, she read the script of \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin.\u201d It included a scene in a health center that had been envisioned as a Planned Parenthood clinic, and Spruch sent posters and books to adorn the set. It would be years before she saw the potential in editing scripts, but she was already dreaming of what it might mean to introduce the Planned Parenthood name in a major movie. Months later, she received a call. \u201cThey said they were having so much fun improvising, and could it still be a Planned Parenthood?\u201d Spruch says. \u201cI stayed up all night thinking, \u2018Oh, my God, this is going to be such a big movie. But I guess I have to say no.\u2019 \u201d She knew that improvisation could introduce inaccuracies. When she later attended a screening, she found herself weeping because the movie \u201cwas clearly a hit,\u201d she says. But the cast\u2019s clowning had indeed departed from the script she\u2019d signed off on. \u201cThrough the tears, I thought, \u2018Okay, I definitely made the right decision.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThen, in 2012, she was put in touch with \u201cObvious Child\u2019s\u201d Robespierre and the movie\u2019s producer, Elisabeth Holm. The women wanted to film at a Planned Parenthood clinic. As they recall, Spruch said she would need to make sure that their scene was entirely accurate, and they were delighted when they realized that she was offering to fact-check it. She ended up working on the script for nearly two years. Holm remembers Spruch offering sample doctor language and pointing out that the patients in the waiting room would be of diverse ages, races and backgrounds. Spruch also noted that one of the laugh lines in their original scene wasn\u2019t accurate because a Planned Parenthood doctor wouldn\u2019t curse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the tobacco industry getting to fact-check how smoking is treated in films,\u201d says Lila Rose, founder of the antiabortion group Live Action.\n\nIn Spruch\u2019s telling, inaccurate scenes are the only ones she won\u2019t endorse. She views movies and shows as an important source of information for people who might not know how to find it elsewhere, but she emphasizes that she doesn\u2019t meddle with characters\u2019 emotions or impose an ideological purity test. \u201cMy job is to correct with facts,\u201d she told me. \u201cThose are the types of issues I address and look for.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s opponents, of course, argue that accuracy is the opposite of the organization\u2019s aim. \u201cI think they\u2019re marketing to a specific demographic,\u201d says Steven Aden, chief legal officer of the antiabortion group Americans United for Life. \u201cI am concerned that people who haven\u2019t experienced much of life, the younger set, may be led into thinking that abortion is normal and glamorous and painless and lacking in consequences, all those things that Hollywood would like them to believe.\u201d Live Action\u2019s Rose is less circumspect. \u201cWhen Planned Parenthood tries to create positive story lines around abortion, it\u2019s not good art, it\u2019s propaganda,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find content coming from Planned Parenthood and friends of Planned Parenthood that is honest about what abortion is.\u201d\n\nSpruch does attempt to ensure that if a script features a Planned Parenthood clinic specifically, the organization isn\u2019t put in an unflattering light. In her conversations with the writers of the Netflix comedy \u201cGLOW,\u201d for example, she suggested casting a receptionist who \u201cdidn\u2019t look forbidding,\u201d says co-creator Liz Flahive. She also suggested \u201cthat the exam or procedure room would probably have a soothing picture on the wall,\u201d Flahive says. \u201cShe put in details that felt specific, like that the posters would probably say things about birth control or getting yourself tested for STDs. It was important that the Planned Parenthood wasn\u2019t cold or mechanical.\u201d\n\nBut watching clips with Spruch in the darkened conference room, it\u2019s clear she works with scripts that approach abortion from a range of angles, sometimes with ambivalence. I find myself glancing at her untroubled expression as we sit through a clip from the soapy drama \u201cThe Fosters,\u201d in which two teenagers are in a clinic waiting room, looking stricken. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that make me a coldhearted b\u2014-, if I don\u2019t feel bad?\u201d one asks in a choked voice. Her friend tells her he knows that in her position, he wouldn\u2019t feel ready to be a parent, but he would still feel sad. When Spruch hits pause, cutting off the mournful piano chords of a pop song, I ask whether she finds this scene a bit overdramatic. \u201cYou know, most of the scene is about the question of, \u2018How should I feel?\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cAnd we know there\u2019s no one way anyone should feel, or does feel. That\u2019s a very important thing to show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect the art,\u201d she adds, after we turn on the lights. \u201cIf it\u2019s not inaccurate, and it\u2019s true to the character, then I don\u2019t change certain things, even if I may have written it differently. Those are the things that I\u2019ve learned along the way that are important to having trusting collaborations.\u201d\n\nSpruch\u2019s popularity with filmmakers may be built on her openness to moments that are open to interpretation. \u201cIf there\u2019s a word or two that isn\u2019t entirely accurate, she helps me drill down on that and make sure that we\u2019re not putting misinformation out there,\u201d says Jennie Snyder Urman, the showrunner of \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d the recently concluded CW show about a religious Venezuelan American family whose members disagree about the morality of abortion. \u201cBut for the feelings of the characters, I rely on the writers in the writers\u2019 room, who have crafted the characters for 100 episodes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaren by no means pressured us to write anything,\u201d says Robespierre. In \u201cObvious Child,\u201d a single tear tracks down Donna\u2019s face as she sits in the recovery room after her abortion. Robespierre and Holm told me that Spruch paused on that page of the script. \u201cWe had a conversation [with Spruch] about, \u2018What is the emotionality behind this, and how does it look and feel and play in the larger whole?\u2019 \u201d Holm says. Robespierre described how she wanted the scene to convey \u201cthat you\u2019re allowed to feel many things at once,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSome of it can be shame and fear and relief and happiness, all of them. \u2026 You can have sadness alongside the feeling that you\u2019ve made the right decision for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaren is thoughtful,\u201d Holm told me. \u201cShe understands that the message, above all, needs to be that [abortion] is a complex human experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cShrill,\u201d with Aidy Bryant.

Since then, abortions have propelled plots on \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cGLOW,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst\u201d and more than a dozen other comedy shows.\n\nSpruch meets many writers through Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual event at the Sundance Film Festival, where she has been pitching attendees on telling abortion stories every winter for the past seven years. Often, when a screenwriter sends her a script, she sets up a call with a medical practitioner, sex educator or policy expert who provides sample doctor spiels or answers questions. When the creators of \u201cGLOW\u201d got in touch about an abortion scene set in the 1980s, she spent weeks tracking down a retired doctor who had worked at a Planned Parenthood clinic in that period. (Among other small fixes, he pointed out that receptionists in those pre-HIPAA days read out first and last names. \u201cThey would never do that now,\u201d she says.)\n\nSpruch has also suggested ideas that eventually worked their way onto the air: \u201cI talked to Lena\u201d \u2014 Dunham, of course \u2014 \u201cabout how you never see people using a condom on television. And then she did a scene where Adam uses a condom on \u2018Girls.\u2019 \u201d In addition, Spruch makes it her business to keep an eye on shows that might provide opportunities. In 2014, after watching the pilot of \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d \u2014 in which the devout Jane, who is saving sex for marriage, gets accidentally inseminated by an ob-gyn and decides to go ahead with the pregnancy \u2014 she wrote to the director to offer her services. Two years later, she helped fine-tune an episode in which Jane\u2019s mother, Xiomara, has an abortion. The stakes felt especially high because Xiomara would be the first Latina to have an abortion on prime-time television, where the preponderance of stories are about young white women.\n\nPerhaps the best measure of the state of the abortion plot is \u201cShrill,\u201d a half-hour comedy based on Lindy West\u2019s essay collection of the same name. In the pilot episode, ending an unwanted pregnancy empowers the lead character to take control of her life, speaking up at work and dumping her puerile boyfriend. West says that she encountered no resistance when she set out to sell the show. \u201cWe pitched it in the Trump era, and people are looking for ways to make a little bit of a difference politically,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s totally possible that [the abortion] helped us.\u201d After the episode aired, the New York Times declared the advent of \u201cthe matter-of-fact abortion\u201d in Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to her well-known feminist writing, West is a co-founder of the activist campaign \u201cShout Your Abortion,\u201d which encourages people who\u2019ve had the procedure to talk about it. Celebrated as a new frontier for abortion rights activism when it launched in 2015, the campaign looks in many ways like the moment when the movement caught up with the argument that Caren Spruch has been making for more than 20 years.\n\nNevertheless, the politics of the issue are mostly moving in the other direction. So far this year, five states have passed laws banning abortion at the sixth week of pregnancy, before most people even know they are pregnant. (In addition, Alabama has passed a law banning the procedure in nearly all cases, and Missouri has passed one banning it at the eighth week of pregnancy.) Republicans hope that these measures will reach the Supreme Court. I asked Spruch if the promise of entertainment is in part that movies and TV will still be available vehicles even if the justices overturn Roe. She paused. \u201cIn my world,\u201d she said, \u201cfocusing on culture would hopefully activate more people and prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nBut do stories about abortion really have the power to change minds? Could there be a \u201cWill & Grace\u201d effect for abortion, reducing prejudice against the procedure, as studies have found that the popular TV show did for LGBT people? Like Spruch, Kate Langrall Folb, director of a program called Hollywood, Health and Society at the University of Southern California, works with screenwriters to make stories about health care, including abortion, more accurate. Her organization also seeks to study how effectively its efforts change minds. Folb says they found that people\u2019s attitudes \u201cbecame softer and more accepting\u201d after viewing an episode of a USA Network show featuring a transgender teenager \u2014 but they have yet to research reactions to an on-screen abortion.\n\nThe fact is that attitudes about abortion have barely budged since the 1970s. And even if movies and TV can change those opinions, it\u2019s not clear who\u2019s winning the battle for the viewing public. Planned Parenthood and its Hollywood allies, after all, aren\u2019t the only ones putting abortion on-screen. For a time this past winter, the DVD of \u201cGosnell\u201d \u2014 a movie about a Philadelphia physician who performed dangerous illegal abortions \u2014 was the No. 1 seller on Amazon, ahead of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) In the spring, conservative Christian filmmakers Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon released \u201cUnplanned,\u201d based on the memoir of a former Planned Parenthood clinic director named Abby Johnson, who became a hero in the antiabortion movement after she renounced her former employer. Extensive reporting by Texas Monthly and Salon has cast doubt on much of Johnson\u2019s story; Planned Parenthood has said that the film, which accuses the nonprofit organization of performing abortions because they are lucrative, \u201cpromotes many falsehoods.\u201d Many theaters refused to show the movie, and major TV networks wouldn\u2019t air the trailer. Still, \u201cUnplanned\u201d was a hit, raking in more than $14 million at the box office in its first two weeks.\n\nThat success didn\u2019t temper the filmmakers\u2019 fury about what they perceive as an effort to silence their side. When I called Konzelman and Solomon, they described Hollywood\u2019s embrace of Planned Parenthood as unfair and unseemly. \u201cIt\u2019s an open secret that there\u2019s a tremendous industry-wide push for more story lines\u201d about abortion, Konzelman told me. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019re pushing for more stories from our side of the fence. \u2026 We knew from the beginning that there would be no studio money for us and that we would have trouble finding distribution.\u201d\n\nSolomon told me that Hollywood\u2019s liberalism, including its positive portrayals of abortion, had forced him into the role of political crusader. \u201cI came to Hollywood to make movies and entertainment \u2014 all I wanted to do was be a filmmaker who told great stories that made people happy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had to go and become someone taking on moral causes. The media is the most powerful tool of evangelization in the history of the world. If Peter and Paul and John and James were around today, they wouldn\u2019t go knocking on doors. They would make a TV show.\u201d\n\nBut the apostles may have been better off with their original method. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to change people\u2019s minds about abortion,\u201d Sisson says. \u201cI think that the potential of storytelling is to bring people who are slightly to one side a bit further. You\u2019re not trying to reach people on the other end of the spectrum; you\u2019re trying to bring your allies closer.\u201d In her view, a movie like \u201cUnplanned\u201d or \u201cGosnell\u201d \u201ctakes people who are already opposed to abortion and makes it a higher priority for them.\u201d\n\nThe majority of Americans believe that abortion should be legal \u2014 but that belief is often complicated. In a July Washington Post-ABC News poll, 60 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in \u201call\u201d or \u201cmost\u201d cases, while 36 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. In the past decade, a wave of new laws \u2014 requirements that abortion clinics be built to the standards of surgical centers, for example, or obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals \u2014 have made abortion harder to access even as it has remained legal, forcing at least a quarter of all American abortion clinics to close, increasing the distance that women must travel to obtain the procedure and the waiting time for an appointment. Though Republican lawmakers argue that these measures are for patient safety, early studies suggest that they cause women to abort later in pregnancy, when the procedure is more expensive and the risk of complication higher. (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists points out that abortion is still a \u201clow-risk procedure\u201d and significantly safer than giving birth.) Though Planned Parenthood and its allies decry these laws \u2014 often referring to them as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP laws \u2014 that hasn\u2019t rallied popular resistance sufficient to prevent their passage.\n\nThe most recent wave of legislation might be another story. Early polling suggests that most Americans oppose the laws that would establish a window of legality so narrow that it is all but impossible to meet. According to a June Gallup poll, 58 percent oppose laws that would ban abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected. So do a majority of voters in Ohio, according to a July Quinnipiac poll, and a plurality in Georgia, according to a spring Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, two states that have passed but not enacted such legislation. Overall, the July Post-ABC poll found that a majority of Americans \u2014 73 percent \u2014 want to see abortion access in their state left as is or made easier.\n\nFor Planned Parenthood, making abortion access a higher-priority issue for those people might mean helping tell stories about the restrictions, and dramatizing impacts that viewers may not have considered. The current wave of abortion stories shows the decision as sometimes emotionally difficult and sometimes simple, but always actionable once made. \u201cPretty much everyone has an abortion provider in their town on TV,\u201d Sisson says. In reality six states, all led by Republicans, have only one functioning clinic. Likewise, though Spruch has worked on a few films about women struggling to pay for procedures (\u201cGrandma\u201d and \u201cLittle Woods\u201d and, to a lesser extent, \u201cObvious Child\u201d), most movies and shows ignore the issue of cost. Nearly half of abortion patients live below the federal poverty level, but the Hyde Amendment bars federal Medicaid funds from covering the procedure (except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the pregnant person).\n\nIn Hollywood, it\u2019s still considered a strong statement to show abortion as a choice that a woman doesn\u2019t have to be ashamed of. But for Spruch, it may be more practical to push viewers to empathize with women who choose to get abortions \u2014 then can\u2019t. In fact, that might be her next project: She\u2019s been nudging her Hollywood contacts to think about the dramas that could unfold around abortion restrictions, or the stories they could tell from abortion providers\u2019 perspectives. \u201cI always talk about the things that I think are missing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they come to be.\u201d\n\nNora Caplan-Bricker is a writer in Boston.
