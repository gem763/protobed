Boelt and the town of Hjoerring also have chipped in to foot the bill.\n\nThe lighthouse ceased operating in 1968 and was briefly turned into a museum, including an exhibit about the structure's struggle against sand drift.\n\nRubjerg Knude lighthouse was put on roller blades and moved around inland through the dunes to a safe position\n\nPreparations being made today to move the 263 feet (80 meters) Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse. When it was built in 1990 it was roughly 656ft from the cliff edge, now it is only about 20ft from the North Sea\n\nIn the end, it was closed because of shifting sands which slowly buried the two buildings adjacent to the lighthouse. The lighthouse, however, still gets more than 250,000 visitors each year.\n\nThe move, broadcast live on major Danish news outlets, depended on the weather, which was currently fair in the region. Thirty minutes into the operation, the lighthouse had been moved 1.4 meters.\n\nThe area is known for constantly shifting sands and an eroding coastline.\n\nIn 2008, a nearby church was dismantled to prevent it from falling into the sea. The Romanesque Maarup Church, built on a cliff around 1250, was picked for scenes in 'Babette's Feast,' which in 1987 became the first Danish film to win the Oscar for best foreign language film.", "description": "When the 76 foot tall Rubjerg Knude lighthouse in Denmark was first lit, in 1900, it was roughly 263 from the coast - now it is only about six meters away.
