Giuliani to promote Ukraine-related conspiracies; as well as signals in meetings at the White House that Trump wanted the new government in Kiev to deliver material that might be politically damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security At-Least-Four-National-Security-Officials-Raised-Alarms-About-Ukraine-Policy-Before-And-After-Trump-Call-With-Ukrainian-President"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
