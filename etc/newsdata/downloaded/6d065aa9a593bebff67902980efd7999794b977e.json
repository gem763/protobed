it\u2019s the creativity of the approach in getting to audiences that feels more the issue to me.\u201d\n\nAfter debuting his \u201cCrypt Sessions\u201d series \u2014 an intimate show held in the crypt of Harlem\u2019s Church of the Intercession \u2014 in 2015, Ousley began curating shows in the National Historic Landmark cemetery, using the 1850s-era catacombs normally closed to the public as a venue.\n\nThe artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein and William \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed, known for his corrupt mid-19th century political reign over New York, are among Green-Wood\u2019s famous residents.\n\nThe spooky haunts offer \u201cextraordinary acoustics\u201d that lend \u201can incredible generosity of sound, that for classical, for acoustic music, for strings, voice, piano, is unbelievably enhancing,\u201d Ousley said.\n\nThe catacomb shows known as the \u201cAngel\u2019s Share\u201d series \u2014 named after a distiller\u2019s term for whiskey that evaporates as the liquor matures \u2014 include tastings of the spirit that encourage concert-goers to mingle.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to surround the music with a larger experience,\u201d Ousley, 36, said.\n\n\u201cEspecially for people who are less familiar with the rituals of classical music or the experience of it, it breaks down nervousness or a worry of, \u2018Am I going to do the right thing, clap at the right time?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unpretentious as possible\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts found that in 2017, 8.6 percent of American adults reported attending a classical music event, down from 11.6 percent in 2002.\n\nA more detailed study that the US agency released in 2012 found a growing decline in stateside classical attendance, with more than one-third of the audience over age 65.\n\nOusley said the crypt and catacomb shows draw in a mixed bag of audience members, ranging in age and expertise, defying the notion that classical music attendees are aging out.\n\n\u201cI try to have music to have integrity and have quality and the level of performance that is high for somebody who\u2019s seen a thousand shows,\u201d Ousley said outside the catacombs as the sun dipped below the tree line.\n\n\u201cBut then also, programming and the presentation of it, and the communication around the experience, and the experience itself that surrounds the music, to be as welcoming and unpretentious as possible for people who have never been.\u201d\n\nFor Eli Spindel, the artistic director of the String Orchestra of Brooklyn that will play this week\u2019s program, major classical music institutions do sometimes \u201ctend to be too conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the things that they\u2019re able to accomplish are amazing and couldn\u2019t be accomplished by people with smaller budgets, smaller venues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do want to have orchestras who are performing Mahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony, in the highest level in a large hall.\u201d\n\nHe sees traditional venues and more eccentric classical performances as essential to maintaining a healthy ecosystem for the genre to thrive.\n\nThis week, the program in Green-Wood aptly centers on the subject of grief and \u201chow we find catharsis and meaning in the loss of life,\u201d Ousley said.\n\nThe showcased piece is \u201cStabat Mater,\u201d a medieval Christian hymn to Mary whose musical score was composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi in 1736.\n\nThe concert also features Samuel Barber\u2019s melancholic \u201cAdagio for Strings\u201d and Arvo Part\u2019s \u201cFratres,\u201d performed as immersive visual projections dance on the catacomb\u2019s arched space.\n\n\u201cThe smallest motion of the bow will just create very beautiful, blooming sound,\u201d said Spindel.\n\n\u201cThis is a very appropriate chamber for this music,\u201d he added with a smirk.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Deep in one of New York\u2019s most prestigious cemeteries, the eerie vibrations of a string concerto ricochet off catacomb walls,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/957fd9_debuting-his-crypt-sessions-series-an-intimate-held-in-crypt-harlem-church-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
