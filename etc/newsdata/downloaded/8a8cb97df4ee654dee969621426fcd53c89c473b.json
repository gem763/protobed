REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nThe Swiss bank\u2019s annual wealth survey released on Monday found 100 million Chinese ranked in the global top 10% as of the middle of this year versus 99 million in the United States.\n\n\u201cDespite the trade tension between the United States and China over the past 12 months, both countries have fared strongly in wealth creation, contributing $3.8 trillion and $1.9 trillion respectively,\u201d said Nannette Hechler-Fayd\u2019herbe, global head of economics and research at Credit Suisse.\n\nThe ranks of the world\u2019s millionaires have risen by 1.1 million to an estimated 46.8 million, collectively owning $158.3 trillion in net assets, 44% of the global total, the study found.\n\nThe United States added more than half of this number \u2013675,000 new millionaires \u2013 to its sizeable stock.\n\nA decline in average wealth in Australia \u2014 largely due to exchange rates \u2014 resulted in 124,000 fewer millionaires there, while Britain lost 27,000 and Turkey 24,000.\n\nThe report estimates that 55,920 adults are worth at least $100 million and 4,830 have net assets above $500 million.\n\nIt forecast global wealth \u2014 which increased 2.6% over the past year \u2014 would rise by 27% over the next five years to $459 trillion by 2024. The number of millionaires would also grow over this period to almost 63 million.\n\nThe share of the world\u2019s bottom 90% accounts for 18% of global wealth, compared to 11% in the 2000.\n\n\u201cWhile it is too early to say wealth inequality is now in a downward phase, the prevailing evidence suggests that 2016 may have been the peak for the near future,\u201d it said.", "description": "The number of rich Chinese has surpassed the count of wealthy Americans for the first time as both countries keep churning out millionaires, a study by Credit Suisse showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443266824&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0FL", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
