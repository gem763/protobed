The discussions appear to be focused on acquiring engineers, according to a source. Coinbase declined to comment.\n\nWhy it matters: Coinbase, which provides a variety of digital token services, previously said that 12% of its product and engineering employees came through acquisitions. Omni's engineering employees already have experience with digital tokens: After cryptocurrency company Ripple invested in the company, Omni later began allowing customers to earn its cryptocurrency, XRP, for renting out their possessions.", "description": "The early acquisition discussions appear to be focused on acquiring Omni's engineers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/iysCW2bcBYzyg_KN2Kn-5UrCZsI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/04/1570225933338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
