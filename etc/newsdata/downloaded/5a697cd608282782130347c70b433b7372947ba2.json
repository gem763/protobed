Orange County, others, mulling the question", "language": "en", "text": "Can rivers have rights? Should they?\n\nOrange County is contemplating those questions, considering a county charter amendment put before voters in 2020 that declares its remarkable, fragile, and threatened Wekiva and Econlockhatchee rivers have fundamental rights to exist, thrive and regenerate.\n\nThe proposal also states that citizens who allege someone is harming those rivers can sue.\n\nOther Florida counties may soon be asking the same questions.\n\nSimilar county charter amendments are being pushed in Lee, Alachua, Brevard, and Osceola counties, though some by petition. Supporting these efforts is the Pennsylvania-based Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, working with various Florida partners \u2014 such as Speak Up Wekiva in Orange County.\n\nActivists also are considering such movements in all 20 of Florida\u2019s charter counties, said Speak Up Wekiva President Chuck O\u2019Neal.\n\nThe strategy is the newest battlefront in environmentalists\u2019 desire to add protections to Florida\u2019s waterways.\n\nThe notion of rivers \u2014 lakes, forests, estuaries, or other natural features \u2014 having rights is a newly-emerging legal concept, yet it has roots in a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in which Justice William O. Douglas proposed it in a dissenting opinion for an environmental dispute.\n\nThe critical battle is being waged right now in Toledo, Ohio. Earlier this year, Toledo voters adopted a \u201cLake Erie Bill of Rights.\u201d The constitutionality of that measure now is under challenge in federal court, with the state of Ohio joining an agribusiness company in fighting the city.\n\nNationwide, more than 40 localities have adopted similar measures, including Pittsburgh, which has one protecting its three major rivers, according to the CELDF.\n\nBack in Florida, the effort is being driven within the Orange County 2020 Charter Review Commission. That quadrennial body is reviewing a possible charter amendment for placement before countywide voters in the 2020 general election.\n\nAt its inception this spring, the Charter Review Commission took up five potential amendment ideas to evaluate, narrowing it down to three. One of the survivors is the Wekiva/Econlockhatchee proposal, which is moving along in a committee and toward a possible formal proposal to be presented to the full commission next month.\n\nThe working proposal \u2014 informally dubbed the \u201cWekiva/Econlockhatchee Bill of Rights\u201d \u2014 was crafted with help from the CELDF and Speak Up Wekiva. It is modeled in part after Toledo\u2019s city charter amendment.\n\nThe current draft of the Orange County proposal begins:\n\n\u201cThe Wekiva River Ecosystem and the Econlockhatchee River Ecosystem possess rights, including but not limited to, rights to naturally exist, flourish, regenerate, evolve and restoration; the right to carry out their natural function; the right to abundant, pure, unpolluted water, the right to natural groundwater recharge and surface water recharge; the right to natural water flow; the right to a healthy, natural, biodiverse environment; and the right to be free of activities or practices, as well as obstructions, that interfere with or infringe upon these rights.\u201d\n\nThe draft also states:\n\n\u201cAny government entity or nonnatural person that violates any provision of this section shall be liable for any damages caused to an ecosystem named in this section as a result of the violation.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal said the notion that natural features that are important to a community can have rights is not far removed from the concept that corporations can have rights of people, as most famously defined in the Citizens United case. That\u2019s the concept that would be tested in Ohio.\n\n\u201cFlorida has a huge problem caused by wastewater and fertilizer in our waterways \u2026 it\u2019s 100 percent legal. It\u2019s all permitted by the state of Florida, or some other entity in the state, allowing this to happen. So how do you put nature on a legal footing with a corporation that has a permit to dump pollution into waterways?\u201d O\u2019Neal said.\n\n\u201cThey always say, \u2018Chuck, you have to have balance.\u2019 Well \u2026 how do you have balance when one entity has rights as a human, and the other has no rights?\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cYou have to have parity between a natural water body and a corporation.\u201d\n\nDouglas apparently thought so in 1972 as well, when he acknowledged that entities such as maritime ships and corporations are considered persons \u201cfor the purposes of adjudicatory processes.\u201d\n\nDouglas offered, in his opinion: \u201cSo it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life.\u201d", "description": "'You have to have parity between a natural water body and a corporation.'", "authors": ["Scott Powers", "Written By"], "top_image": "https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/P1013639-1000x563.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
