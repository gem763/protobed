Indeed, a sweeping critique of U.S. foreign policy, as Anton recognized, was \u201cone of the great themes the president ran and won on in 2016.\u201d\n\nConsonant with a National Security Strategy that emphasized the return of great power competition, Trump recognizes that the world has become a \"much more competitive place,\" Anton explained in late 2017. Washington harbored an \u201cunrealistic view,\u201d said Anton, late of the offices of George W. Bush and Rudolph Giuliani, and now Trump is \u201crealistic about what American power can achieve in the world.\u201d There is \u201ca frank recognition that the president's critique that he gave during the campaign, of the past couple decades of American foreign policy, that it tried to do too much, it overly defined what America's national interests were. \u2026 We have learned through hard experience, were perhaps not achievable with American power.\"\n\nFor foreign policy realists and critics of the U.S. post-Cold War orientation, new comrades-in-arms are always welcome. \u201cIt\u2019s just plain that the 2003 invasion [of Iraq] was a mistake,\u201d Anton told American Greatness shortly after Trump took office. Perhaps only John Bolton, the national security advisor, still defends the invasion. But Bolton shirks\u2014and always has\u2014the label neoconservative; his distaste for the democratizing aspects of American force leads many who have followed his thinking closely to label him an \u201coffensive realist.\u201d It\u2019s possible that only inveterate anti-Trumpists such as William Kristol, late of the Weekly Standard, and Max Boot, the controversial Washington Post columnist, remain open neoconservatives. \u201cMany of us were neocons,\u201d a senior think tank official close to the administration told me this week. In short, to crib from President Nixon, it would seem that we\u2019re all realists now. But does the current moment represent co-option more than it does cooperation? What is the path forward?\n\n\u201cPrincipled realism\u201d is also the favored term of many at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, or FDD, the most effective foreign policy think tank of the Trump era, and as I\u2019ve reported, the de facto shop for the administration on Iran. There are exceptions, but snippy critics have noted that even FDD has partially renounced its namesake. The group\u2019s high-profile CEO, Mark Dubowitz, has extolled the virtues of an \u201cinclusive authoritarianism\u201d in the Middle East in recent months, referring to the partially-liberalizing Sunni autocracies, most prominently Mohammed Bin Salman\u2019s Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of Mohammed bin Zayed.\n\nIndeed, many see an emerging Trump doctrine. Ross Douthat in The New York Times earlier this year saluted \u201ca chaotic administration\u2019s unexpectedly coherent grand strategy.\u201d Lee Smith writes on the broader Middle East in Tablet, an ordinarily hawkish outpost: \u201cThe U.S. public has already answered what constitutes an American victory\u2014get out, now.\u201d So why hasn\u2019t America declared victory and gone home, even under Trump? For some, the rot is marrow-deep. Indeed, fresh research from the Eurasia Group Foundation posits a chasm between elite and lay preferences on foreign policy. \u201cThe results, while somewhat predictable from where I sit, do contradict other studies that are out there and a kind of think-tank industrial complex,\u201d lead Eurasia Group Foundation researcher Mark Hannah told me. But the tide is clearly coming in. Harper\u2019s Magazine, a leading light of American liberalism, attacks the protracted U.S. deployment in Syria this week. And Smith\u2019s article this week got the attention of Ted Cruz, who has flirted\u2014sporadically\u2014with foreign policy realists before. \u201cImportant article by @LeeSmithDC on costs & risks of Middle East intervention,\u201d Cruz tweeted this week. The Texas senator also made note of an address to this effect that he gave at the American Enterprise Institute, once the cerebral cortex of American neoconservatism, earlier this year.\n\nBut it is in the Middle East, more than anywhere else, where this seeming consensus could all break down. \u201cThe Middle East?\u201d a Defense Department official told me. \u201cWe can\u2019t see straight there, man.\u201d Bluntly: among this \u201crealist\u201d cohort, there are those who want to take sides, and those who want fuller extrication. Even the Eurasia Group Foundation research breaks realists\u2014or anti-Wilsonians\u2014into two principal groups, Jacksonians and Jeffersons, a template originally outlined by Wall Street Journal editorial writer Walter Russell Mead, a favorite of many in the White House orbit. Jacksonians believe \u201cthat the most important goal of the U.S. government in both foreign and domestic policy should be the physical security and economic well-being of the American people,\u201d while Jeffersonians \u201chold that American foreign policy should be less concerned about spreading democracy abroad than about safeguarding it at home.\u201d Those views obviously aren\u2019t prima facie contradictory. But it\u2019s a battle of emphasis\u2014with major implications.\n\nEmbracing those Sunni autocracies means streamlining normalization of modern Israel in part of the Middle East; it also means knifing Iran. And with this administration, that\u2019s the view that\u2019s winning out. Some want to go further\u2014to put Turkey on notice. The controversial Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, who recently had an audience with the president, this week saluted U.S. cancellation of F-35 sales to Ankara, and hailed a \u201clong-overdue recalibration\u201d of the relationship with the \u201cSharia-supremacist\u201d Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s president.\n\nCurt Mills is a foreign-affairs reporter at the National Interest .
