I couldn't quite believe the prospect of spending a year there.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"not an appropriate living standard for a human being\". Students are being charged \u00a3150 per week to live in the pods whereas campus accommodation at the university ranges from \u00a3111 to \u00a3183 per week.", "description": "Students have complained that their \u201cpod\u201d accommodation in a university car park is \u201cnot fit for humans\u201d and \u201cnot mentally viable\u201d.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Stephen Pollard", "Michael Deacon", "Benedict Spence", "Tom Harris", "Douglas Carswell", "Joe Armitage", "Asa Bennett", "Daniel Kawczynski"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2018/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000011321301-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqejMVNjZ2Bv6EA7I5e4mELy5twttbUiN55rbZOKJP4mY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
