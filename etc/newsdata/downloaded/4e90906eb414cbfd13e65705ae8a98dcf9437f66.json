The first meeting between Mir and Nelson occurred in May 2011 at UFC 130. That night, Mir won the fight by unanimous decision. Friday night, he did the same.\n\nFormer UFC champion Mir\u2019s main target? The lead leg of Nelson. He peppered \u201cBig Country\u2019s\u201d inside left leg over and over. By the third round, Nelson\u2019s leg was pink becoming red.\n\nVisibly frustrated, Nelson tried swinging for the fences. Few and far between landed, but when they did, Mir ate them. As the crowd booed and the clock approached zero, Nelson secured a massive takedown. But it was too little too late.\n\nThe heavyweight bout was the Bellator 231 main event at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. The main card aired on Paramount and streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 231 results include:", "description": "Frank Mir and Roy Nelson met for a second time inside the cage Friday night at Bellator 231.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/frank-mir-bellator-231-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
