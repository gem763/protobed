He stayed in to finish the drive before jogging to the locker room. When the 37-year-old QB emerged for the second half, he was wearing a white cap while Rudolph, taken in the third round of the 2018 draft, took the first meaningful snaps of his career.\n\nRudolph completed 12 of 19 passes for 112 yards, the two scores and an interception, but couldn\u2019t quite keep pace with Wilson and the Seahawks (2-0).\n\nWilson was 29 of 35 for 300 yards and the three TDs, becoming the fifth-fastest quarterback in league history to reach 200 career touchdown passes (114 games). Wilson also ran four times for 24 yards, most of it coming on Seattle\u2019s final drive as the Seahawks protected a two-point lead.\n\nA week after escaping Cincinnati with a one-point win, a game in which coach Pete Carroll said his team wasn\u2019t particularly crisp, the Seahawks took advantage of a series of mental mistakes by the Steelers (0-2) to win in Pittsburgh for the first time in 20 years.\n\nCOLTS 19, TITANS 17\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Jacoby Brissett became the latest Indianapolis quarterback to top Tennessee, throwing a 4-yard touchdown pass to T.Y. Hilton with 4:38 left. Brissett had come up empty for Indianapolis against Tennessee, losing both games he started against the Titans in 2017. After Andrew Luck retired with a perfect 11-0 record against the Titans, Brissett picked up right where Luck left off. He passed for 146 yards and three TDs.\n\nThe Colts (1-1) also sacked Marcus Mariota four times on a day when Adam Vinatieri, the NFL\u2019s oldest player and career scoring leader but in an early-season slump, missed two extra points. It was Indianapolis\u2019 14th win in its last 16 games against Tennessee overall.\n\nThe Titans (1-1) missed their chance for payback against Indianapolis after losing the 2018 regular-season finale, along with a playoff berth on the line for the winner. They haven\u2019t started 2-0 since 2008 when they won their first 10 games and last won the AFC South.\n\nRAVENS 23, CARDINALS 17\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - Lamar Jackson kept the Cardinals guessing all afternoon, supplementing an effective passing attack with more than an occasional jaunt out of the pocket. Jackson threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 120 yards in a showdown between two of the league\u2019s most exciting young quarterbacks.\n\nAfter achieving a perfect passer rating and throwing five TD passes in a season-opening 59-10 rout of Miami, Jackson wasn\u2019t quite as sharp through the air but far more effective with his legs. He ran 16 times (including two kneel-downs at the end), juking and twisting past defenders for key gains - especially when the Cardinals were dropping back in passing situations.\n\nThe 2016 Heisman Trophy winner outdid the 2018 Heisman winner, Arizona rookie quarterback Kyler Murray, who went 25 for 40 for 349 yards but fell short of carrying the Cardinals to a second straight fourth-quarter comeback.\n\nMurray guided Arizona (0-1-1) on a four-play, 79-yard touchdown drive to make it 20-17 with 12:52 remaining. One week earlier, the former Oklahoma standout erased an 18-point deficit to salvage a tie against Detroit.\n\nTEXANS 13, JAGUARS 12\n\nHOUSTON (AP) - Justin Reid stopped Leonard Fournette on a 2-point conversion attempt with 36 seconds left.\n\nHouston led by 13-6 in the fourth quarter when Jacksonville rookie Gardner Minshew led a long drive that included an 18-yard run on fourth-and-10, and he capped it with a 4-yard TD pass to DJ Chark. Instead of trying to tie it with a kicked extra point, Jaguars coach Doug Marrone opted to go for the potential win. But Fournette was stopped by Reid. The play was upheld by video review, giving the Texans (1-1) the victory.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Whitney Mercilus used a nice spin move to evade a blocker and sacked Minshew to force a fumble, recovered by J.J. Watt on the 11-yard line. Carlos Hyde had an 8-yard run on second down, but was stopped short of a first down on the next play to bring up fourth-and-1. Deshaun Watson then scrambled in from 2 yards for the touchdown to make it 13-3.\n\nMinshew, a sixth-round pick, threw for 213 yards and a touchdown for the Jaguars (0-2) in his first NFL start filling in for Nick Foles, who broke his collarbone last week.\n\nBILLS 28, GIANTS 14\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Somewhat maligned Josh Allen ran for a touchdown, threw for another, and the Bills claimed the bragging rights of New York.\n\nBuffalo has its first 2-0 start since 2014 and only the third in 11 mostly fruitless years.\n\nDevin Singletary scored on a 14-yard run and Frank Gore iced the game with a 1-yard plunge into the end zone with 5:53 to play as the Bills completed the New York/New Jersey sweep at MetLife Stadium. They beat the Jets last weekend.\n\nAllen finished 19 of 30 for 253 yards in becoming Buffalo\u2019s first quarterback to pass for 200 or more yards in seven straight games since Hall of Famer Jim Kelly in 1992. His touchdown pass covered 14 yards to Isaiah McKenzie and his TD run was 6 yards.\n\nGiants coach Pat Shurmur gave Buffalo bulletin-board material earlier in the week when he said he felt Allen had the potential to be an NFL starter coming out of the 2018 draft. The Bills felt it a slight for the No.7 overall pick and posted it.\n\nAllen, who had no turnovers after making four last week, played like a quarterback with something to prove.\n\nSaquon Barkley ran for 107 yards and a game-opening 27-yard touchdown run, but the Giants went to 0-2 for their sixth such start since 2013.\n\nPATRIOTS 43, DOLPHINS 0\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) - Antonio Brown caught a 20-yard touchdown pass in his debut for the Patriots, and they scored twice on interception returns in a two-minute fourth-quarter span.\n\nBrown also made an 18-yard catch on his first play for the Patriots (2-0), who signed him Monday. He finished with 56 yards on four receptions, all in the first half.\n\nThe NFL allowed the four-time All-Pro receiver to play despite a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday by his former trainer accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions.\n\nNew England\u2019s defense outscored Miami (0-2) with interception returns for touchdowns of 54 yards by Stephon Gilmore and 69 yards by Jamie Collins Sr. The Patriots totaled seven sacks and four interceptions and earned their most lopsided win in the 108-game history of the series.\n\n49ERS 41, BENGALS 17\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) - Jimmy Garoppolo tied his career high with three touchdown passes and the 49ers completed a sweet and satisfying week in the Buckeye State.\n\nRather than return to the West Coast after their opening 31-17 win in Tampa Bay, the 49ers headed to Youngstown, Ohio, where they worked out on a soccer field, enjoyed a local ice cream shop and rested at a Holiday Inn. Then they started their trek west with a resounding and notable win.\n\nThe 49ers improved to 2-0 for the first time since 2012. They\u2019ve opened the season with back-to-back road wins for the first time since 1989, when Joe Montana\u2019s crew was coming off its second Super Bowl win over the Bengals.\n\nThe Niners piled up 573 total yards, their highest total in seven years. They\u2019ve topped 30 points in each of their first two games for the first time since 1998. The 41 points were the most allowed by the Bengals (0-2) in a home opener.\n\nPACKERS 21, VIKINGS 16\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Aaron Rodgers threw two early touchdowns on a day when the Packers honored late Hall of Famer Bart Starr at halftime.\n\nRodgers put on quite a show - particularly early. Rodgers completed nine of his first 10 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns and had a perfect 158.3 rating through the first quarter. He finished 22 of 34 for 209 yards.\n\nThe Packers improved to 2-0 under new coach Matt LaFleur after opening the NFL\u2019s 100th season with a victory at rival Chicago. They also beat the Vikings (1-1) for the fifth time in the past seven games at Lambeau Field.\n\nKevin King intercepted Kirk Cousins late in the end zone to preserve the win.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Dalvin Cook had a career-high 154 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. It was the third-year back\u2019s second consecutive game with over 100 yards rushing.\n\nCOWBOYS 31, REDSKINS 21\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) - Dak Prescott carved up the Washington defense with his arm and his legs, completing 26 of 30 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 69 yards.\n\nA week after putting up a perfect 158.3 QB rating, Prescott responded from an interception to lead Dallas (2-0) on consecutive touchdown drives of 97, 83 and 75 yards. He\u2019s the first Cowboys quarterback to compile seven touchdown passes in the first two games of the season since Don Meredith in 1966.\n\nOn the verge of a contract extension that\u2019s expected to guarantee him over $30 million, Prescott connected with three receivers on the touchdowns: Devin Smith, Jason Witten and Amari Cooper. Less than two weeks removed from ending his holdout and agreeing to a $90 million, six-year deal, Ezekiel Elliott had his workload increased to 23 carries for 111 yards and ran for a touchdown.\n\nThe Redskins (0-2) got a rushing touchdown from Adrian Peterson and passing TDs from Case Keenum to Paul Richardson and rookie Terry McLaurin. But their banged-up defense playing without two starters struggled to contain Prescott or cover his receivers.\n\nLIONS 13, CHARGERS 10\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Matthew Stafford threw a go-ahead, 31-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Golladay midway through the fourth quarter and Darius Slay made an interception in the end zone with 1:03 left.\n\nDetroit (1-0-1) overcame Stafford\u2019s two interceptions, Slay giving up a lot of receptions and Matt Prater missing an extra point and a field goal.\n\nThe Chargers (1-1) were in a position to attempt a 45-yard field goal to tie the game, but Philip Rivers tried to force a pass to Keenan Allen and Slay picked it off.\n\nStafford was 22 of 30 for 245 yards with two TDs and two interceptions. Rivers was 21 of 36 for 293 yards and an interception.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russell Wilson threw for three touchdowns, including a 28-yard rainbow to DK Metcalf midway through the fourth quarter, and the Seattle Seahawks held off the Pittsburgh Steelers 28-26 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/seahawks_steelers_football_82897_c0-136-3240-2025_s1770x1032.jpg?5c7a8e19fa71190eb615864fbe8a5ecc3b690a5a", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
