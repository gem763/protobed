Bibi,\" an affectionate nickname often used by his supporters.\n\nRocket sirens are common in communities which border the Gaza Strip, and many public event spaces and private homes in Israel have shelters used during apparent rocket scares.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a tweet on Tuesday night that the rocket had been launched from the Gaza Strip towards the cities of Ashdod and neighboring Ashkelon. It added that the rocket had been intercepted by the Iron Dome, Israel's rocket defence system.\n\nNetanyahu was unharmed. Shortly after the incident, he tweeted photos from the rally, along with the caption: \"Residents of Ashdod, I love you!\"\n\nHours later, the IDF said it responded to the missile launch with airstrikes on 15 targets in the Gaza Strip including what it claimed was a weapons manufacturing site and a Hamas \"terror tunnel.\"\n\nHaaretz reported that Israel also carried out several airstrikes near the city of Deir al Balah in central Gaza, in addition to striking along the northern border.\n\nNetanyahu says Israel will annex parts of the West Bank\n\nClouds hover over the Dead Sea on Dec. 6, 2010. Borya\n\nThe incident follows an announcement made earlier in the day, in which Netanyahu said Israel would annex portions of the West Bank if he is reelected. He failed to form a coalition government in May, forcing Israel into unprecedented snap elections slated for September 17.\n\nRead more: Israel has been plunged into political chaos after Netanyahu failed to form a government \u2014 and experts say this could be the end of the line for him\n\nNetanyahu said at a press conference on Tuesday that he would apply Israeli sovereignty to parts of the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea. The specific portion of land runs along the Jordan River, and would be the first time in decades that Israel has annexed territory in the disputed West Bank region.\n\n\"We haven't had this kind of opportunity since the Six-Day War, and may not have it again for another 50 years,\" he said of the plan.\n\n\"This is our essential safety belt in the east. This is the eastern defensive wall.\"\n\nIsrael captured the Jordan Valley during the Six-Day War in 1967, and has since controlled the area. The area is home to dozens of Israeli settlements, though much of the international community considers the area to be illegally occupied by Israel.\n\nCritics say the move could be damaging to the ongoing peace process in the region.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the move is \"not helpful to the peace process\" and is \"is without international legal effect.\"\n\nArab leaders meeting in Cairo also denounced the plan, calling it \"a dangerous development and a new Israeli aggression.\"\n\n\"The league regards these statements as undermining the chances of any progress in the peace process and will torpedo all its foundations,\" the Arab League said.", "description": "Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu announced that Israel would annex portions of the West Bank if he wins the upcoming snap elections slated for next week.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78a9ee2e22af264c393222-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
