Now, sources tell us that one of more promising startups in the field, the German startup Lilium, wants to put itself into pole position, by ramping up its financial position.\n\nLilium has been talking to investors to raise a big round of funding, between $400 million and $500 million, according to those familiar with its plans. \u201cIt\u2019s a very large round at a very large valuation,\u201d one VC told TechCrunch.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet who is investing in this latest round, or what that valuation might be.\n\nLilium already has some deep-pocketed investors behind it. In addition to WeChat owner and Chinese internet giant Tencent; it counts Atomico, founded by Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, as a repeat investor. Obvious Ventures, the early-stage VC fund co-founded by Twitter\u2019s Ev Williams; LGT, the international private banking and asset management group; and e24, a fund from Christian Reber (co-founder of Wunderlist and now Pitch), have also backed it, among others.\n\nIn all, Lilium has raised over $100 million in financing to date in previous rounds. But given that its plans involve not only building ground-breaking aircraft but then operating them in fleets, that\u2019s not nearly enough to establish its service and have the impact that founder and chief executive, Daniel Wiegand, hopes he can have.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only a benefit in terms of relieving society from transit traffic, but the much, much bigger benefit would be that everyone can use it and that people can get to their destination five times quicker, basically a five times increase of their daily radius of life,\u201d Wiegand said in 2017. \u201cThis connectivity is going to be a huge benefit to society but also economic growth.\u201d\n\nTencent, Atomico and Obvious were among the investors backing Lilium in its most recent $90 million raise. Sources tell us that Tencent is again in this latest round, and the startup has been pitching potential new investors since at least this spring, visiting with firms in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt seems this latest, bigger round has yet to close. The target size implies the involvement of big names, with big funds behind them.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope they get the funds to transform transportation,\u201d one source said.\n\nWhen (if) the round closes, that would make it the biggest fundraising to date for flying taxis, an area that has lots of potential, but is still far from tested \u2014 a fact that one source suggested could contribute to the longer period needed to close the outsized round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a known secret how hard it is to raise growth rounds in this space because it\u2019s such a new and untested market,\u201d an executive from another air-taxi startup noted. \u201cEarly investments were betting on the market vision and the concept of radically new mobility, but now it\u2019s dawning on investors and others that it\u2019s also a regulation play, and more.\u201d That translates potentially to sustained costs, \u201cand that may be one reason why it\u2019s taking some time.\u201d\n\nAdd to that the ambition at hand \u2014 designing completely new transportation hardware, then manufacturing the aircraft at scale, and then finally building a transportation, taxi-style service around them \u2014 and you can start to see why the round might be very large.\n\nLilium, Atomico, Tencent and Obvious all declined to comment for this story. We\u2019ll update the post if that changes.\n\nUp, up and away\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over two years since Lilium and others in the same space such as Volocopter began publicly discussing their visions for the future of mobility alongside incredibly well-funded industry giants like Uber and established aerospace companies like Airbus, Boeing, and others.\n\nLilium raised its first round of funding in December 2016 and only a few months later, Uber convened its first Elevate conference, which included discussions on the transportation industry\u2019s flying future.\n\nSince those initial discussions, the companies developing technologies and services to bring those plans to fruition have made significant strides.\n\nEarlier this year Lilium announced the first successful flight for a new five-seat electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle. Others are readying pilot projects in their first launch cities, with the timeline for first full-launch services currently hovering around the three-year mark from now (note: dates do get pushed back).\n\nFor Lilium and its competitors, the development of completely new, air-borne vehicles are a means to solving a specific problem: roads in and between cities are too congested with traffic; and electric, air-based options can be a way to offset that situation in an environmentally-friendly way.\n\nMany companies building these new craft are considering taxi-style services as the first or primary point of market entry because \u2014 similar to fully-autonomous cars \u2014 the cost per vehicle will likely be too high for most individuals to consider buying for private/sole use, notwithstanding the safety features of being able to manage a full fleet autonomously that would be harder to execute with single users (who would have to be pilots, in the case of flying cars).\n\nLilium\u2019s new vehicle claims to have a top speed of 300 kilometers per hour and a 300 kilometer range, which would make it capable of covering longer distances than its competitors. Lilium says this is partly because it\u2019s designed it in the form of a small jet aircraft instead of mimicking the mechanics and form factor of drones or helicopters (the latter is the approach that Volocopter, another startup out of Germany backed by the likes of Intel and Daimler, is taking). The fixed-wing design of the plane means that it can rely on lift to stay aloft, cutting down on the power demands on the electric 2,000 horsepower engines when it\u2019s aloft.\n\n\u201cThis efficiency, which is comparable to the energy usage of an electric car over the same distance, means the aircraft would not just be capable of connecting suburbs to city centres and airports to main train stations, but would also deliver affordable high-speed connections across entire regions,\u201d Lilium said in a statement at the time.\n\nBut physics is just one part of the complex system of moving pieces that would need to come together to get Lilium (or any of its rivals) off the ground.\n\nFor one, any system will need to integrate with existing air traffic control infrastructure as well \u2014 as local and national regulators grapple with increasingly crowded skies.\n\nAnother involves the logistical components to operate a service. The company also established a software engineering base in London to help build out the fleet management software and mobile phone application that will connect customers to the jets for transit, and it has been hiring.\n\nAlthough we have yet to see any commercial services emerge built on the concept of fleets of providing short/medium-distance, air-based taxi-style transportation, there are a number of hopefuls that have identified the opportunity of both designing aircraft and building services around them.\n\nCompanies like Kitty Hawk, eHang, Joby and Uber all hope to play a role in offering short-range flights as an affordable alternative to road-based transportation. (Blade and SkyRyse, two other air taxi services of sorts, are offering more conventional helicopters and other vessels in limited launches for well-heeled travelers willing to spend the money.)\n\nLast week at San Francisco Disrupt 2019, Kitty Hawk announced its latest vehicle, Heaviside. It\u2019s an electric aircraft designed to be a personalised vehicle, less obtrusive than a helicopter, ableto go anywhere and land anywhere fast and quietly, and as easy to operate as \u201cpushing a button,\u201d according to CEO Sebastian Thrun.", "description": "\u201cFlying cars\u201d \u2014 airborne vehicles designed for urban and other short-distance commutes to replace conventional private automobiles \u2014 are (at best) still years away from being a reality, with significant safety, technology and business model hurdles to clear before they ever hit the sky.
