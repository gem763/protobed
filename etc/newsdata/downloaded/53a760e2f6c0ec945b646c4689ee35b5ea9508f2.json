And even if you've been planning to have the most perfect Thanksgiving dinner this year, unfortunately, sometimes unforeseen circumstances can complicate things. Maybe someone forgot to pick up more butter for the mashed potatoes, or you ran out of sugar for the pecan pie, or all the baking dishes are being used and you have nothing to bake the green bean casserole. Now you need to stop by a place where you can grab everything you need, and one store pops into your head: Whole Foods. But you'll need to know Whole Foods' Thanksgiving hours before you grab your Thanksgiving grocery list, get in the car, and head to the store.\n\nSo, is Whole Foods open on Thanksgiving? As frantic as a last-minute dash to the store can be\u2014especially on a day where you're cooking dozens of dishes and having a bunch of friends and family members over\u2014you can take a deep breath. The grocery chain will in fact be open on November 28, along with a handful of other stores open on Thanksgiving. A spokesperson tells CountryLiving.com that though all stores will be open on Thanksgiving, hours will vary by location. To check your local Whole Foods' holiday hours, simply visit the company's website and look under the store locator.\n\nPhew, what a relief! So even if you forgot an ingredient for the apple pie, green beans, or cranberry sauce, or if you need a stand mixer for one of the side dishes or delicious desserts, you can just stop by your local Whole Foods and pick everything up.\n\nBut a last-minute grocery trip isn't the only reason you might find yourself perusing the aisles of Whole Foods on Thanksgiving. Let us not forget about the vast options of prepared food the store sells. Whole Foods offers many different options to please a variety of palates at its hot bar, salad bar, and of course, the dreamy dessert case. The larger locations even offer sushi, pizza, sandwiches, and more cuisines. Some stores even have local food vendors serving up their specialties. So just in case someone leaves the roasted turkey in the oven too long, or maybe you just don't feel like cooking dinner this year, you can stop by your local Whole Foods\u2014or any other restaurant open on Thanksgiving this year\u2014and get a plate full of all your favorites. (Even if it's not traditional holiday fare).\n\nIt doesn't matter why you need to stop into Whole Foods on Thanksgiving\u2014the important thing is that they'll be keeping their doors open.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Check out the grocery chain's hours on November 28.", "authors": ["Jennifer Aldrich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJe5htfh7n5IGG15.Go4tg--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/18426eff7e460637978aaa08fddd5a90", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
