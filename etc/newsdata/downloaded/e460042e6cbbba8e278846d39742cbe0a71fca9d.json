Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin, the station commander, handed over that role to astronaut Luca Parmitano on Wednesday morning.\n\nOvchinin will board a spaceship back to Earth on Thursday, along with with astronauts Nick Hague and Hazza Al Mansouri. The three are scheduled to parachute into Kazakhstan at 5 p.m. local time.\n\nMeanwhile, Al Mansouri - the first astronaut from the United Arab Emirates - arrived at the ISS on Friday (he's just visiting briefly) with astronaut Jessica Meir and cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka. A shuttle with four tons of supplies followed them the next day.\n\nThe crew that's staying onboard will gear up for a record 10 spacewalks in just three months.\n\nIn the bottom row of the big group photo, Ovchinin sits on the far left, followed by Parmitano (hanging upside-down), Hague, Al Mansouri, Meir, and Skripochka. Up top, astronauts Christina Koch and Andrew Morgan hover, with cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov on the far right.\n\nThe t-shirts they're all wearing commemorate their \"space band,\" called \"Kryk Chayky\" or \"the cry of the seagull,\" Parmitano said in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\nParmitano, Hague, and Ovchinin are all celebrating their birthdays this week, and Koch completed her 200th day in space on Monday. When she leaves the space station in February 2020, she will hold the record for the longest spaceflight by a woman.\n\nThis isn't the largest group of people the space station has ever held - a record 13 people have been onboard together several times during crew changes and shuttle re-supplies, according to Space.com.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "The International Space Station has held up to 13 people in the past.
