All 11 sectors tumbled, led by the industrial and materials segments, which dropped more than 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 291 points, or 1.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.9%.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management said its U.S. manufacturing index fell to 47.8 in September -- the lowest since June 2009 -- from 49.1 in August. Readings below 50 indicate a contraction in manufacturing activity.\n\n\"All of a sudden we got the ISM data and it was below 50, and that whole narrative changed,\" said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. \"Everything now seems to be orbiting around the manufacturing data, which unfortunately reinforced data we had coming out of Europe last week, specifically Germany, kind of pointing to this global slowdown scenario, at least from the manufacturing.\"\n\nInvestors flocked to the safety of U.S. government bonds and gold following the release of the data. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.651%, from above 1.7% earlier in the session. Bond yields fall when prices rise. Gold prices flipped higher, climbing 1.1%\n\nSlowing economic growth has prompted central banks, including the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, to enact stimulus measures, and federal funds futures show traders priced in a higher probability of more interest-rate cuts this year following Tuesday's data release.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Friday's employment report for September to see whether August's hiring slowdown was an anomaly.\n\nAmong Tuesday's big stock movers, online brokers slumped after Charles Schwab said it would eliminate commissions on online stock trades, furthering the e-broker price wars. Shares of Charles Schwab fell 9.7%, while TD Ameritrade Holding plunged 24% and E*Trade Financial sank 17%.\n\nElsewhere, European stocks edged lower, as manufacturing sentiment in the continent fell to the lowest level in nearly seven years.\n\nAdding to the subdued outlook, the eurozone's annual rate of inflation fell to 0.9% in September, its lowest level in almost three years, data published Tuesday showed.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.3%.\n\nEarlier in the day, Australia's benchmark index rose 0.8% after the Australian central bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low 0.75% and left the door open to more cuts.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 15:39 ET (19:39 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
