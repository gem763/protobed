The pound slumped with the U.K. facing a showdown in Parliament over delaying Brexit again.\n\nContracts on the three main U.S. indexes extended their declines after Bloomberg reported the difficulties the two countries were having in arranging the talks, following Washington\u2019s rejection of Beijing\u2019s request to delay tariffs that took effect over the weekend. Stocks in Shanghai rose earlier as authorities vowed to support liquidity and growth. Elsewhere in Asia, equities in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia declined in thin volumes. The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced for a third straight session, led by financial services shares.\n\nCash markets for both U.S. stocks and bonds are closed for the Labor Day holiday. Treasury 10-year futures erased a decline while a gauge of the dollar increased for the sixth consecutive day. In the U.K., the pound headed for its biggest one-day drop in three weeks and gilts rose as Parliament looked set to seek a vote that would delay Brexit by three months unless there\u2019s a new accord with the European Union by mid-October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson today responded that he would not delay under any circumstances. Johnson will tell rebels that if they defy him tomorrow he will on Wednesday ask parliament to call a general election for Oct. 14, according to a senior government official.\n\n\u201cThe risks of an early election and the increasing political uncertainty, I think, is really weighing on investors minds\u201d in the U.K., Jeremy Stretch, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce head of G-10 FX Strategy, said on Bloomberg TV.\n\nInvestors are still reeling from a volatile August that saw a collapse in Treasury yields and declines for equities globally. Crude oil continued slipping after completing its first monthly drop since May amid fears that the fading global economic growth will hurt fuel demand. In China, a drop in the official purchasing managers\u2019 index on Saturday highlighted pressures facing the world\u2019s second-largest economy from escalating trade tensions with the U.S.\n\nElsewhere, Hurricane Dorian, tied in ranking as the most powerful storm to hit land along U.S. Atlantic shores, slowed to a crawl over the Bahamas and while the National Weather Center said it is still \u201cdangerously close\u201d to the Florida shoreline a direct hit seemed less likely.\n\nArgentina\u2019s government is imposing currency controls to halt the flight of dollars out of the country as it teeters on the brink of default. Turkey\u2019s lira jumped after data showed the economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter.\n\nHere are some key events coming up:\n\nAustralia sets monetary policy on Tuesday.Fed speakers include New York Fed\u2019s John Williams on Wednesday and Fed chair Jerome Powell on Friday.The U.S. jobs report on Friday is projected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 158,000 in August, slightly above the month prior.
