The four weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas are the most profitable time of year for US retailers, and in many instances holiday sales are the difference between finishing the year with a profit or a loss.\n\nOne month out from the start of holiday shopping, even the low forecasts are predicting a strong year. The National Retail Federation estimates year-over-year sales growth of 3.8% to 4.2%, indicating total revenues of $727 billion to $730 billion. At the upper end is Deloitte, one of the Big Four accounting firms, which predicts total sales of $1.1 trillion on gains of 4.5% to 5%. To put these numbers in perspective, holiday sales have averaged 3.7% annual growth over the last five years; this year, even the lowball forecasts are higher than that. It would seem, at least for now, that the strong jobs market and rising wages are overbalancing the US-China tariff dispute.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve used the filters on the TipRanks Stock Screener to find three buy-rated consumer/retail stocks that stand to gain from strong holiday shopping season. Let's take a closer look:\n\nDollar General (DG)\n\nWith year-to-date gains of 47%, Dollar General is outpacing the overall market by a good clip. The company\u2019s recent quarterly report, for Q2 ending in August, showed strong results, with an 8.4% gain in year-over-over revenue, and an EPS beat of 10%. The report gave a boost to DG stock, which it still holds. More importantly, the company upgraded its full-year 2019 guidance in the report, raising the year\u2019s adjusted EPS estimate from $6.45 to $6.60.\n\nDollar General's momentum has attracted plenty of attention from Wall Street.\n\nJust recently, 5-star Barclay analyst Karen Short boosted her price target on DG by 27%, to $180. She wrote, \u201cThe company beat a high Q2 bar with a strong beat and raise, underscoring its industry leading execution and positioning in the dollar space. We see several pockets of upside in the model.\u201d Her new price target indicates a potential for a 12% upside. (To watch Short's track record, click here)\n\nMatthew Boss of JPMorgan echoed that sentiment, upping his price target to $183, and wrote, \u201cManagement's tone was increased confidence in its multi-year roadmap and defensive growth model.\u201d Boss sees a possibility for a 14% upside.\n\n\"Our line item builds point to incremental upside opportunity the next 2 years on both the top-line and margins with $1.7B annual free cash flow generation by FY21 holding 3.0x adjusted debt leverage providing capacity to buyback north of $2B of stock annually by FY21 (= 7.5% of the float) or more than double FY19\u2019s $1B guide (& incremental upside to our model),\" Boss concluded.\n\nThe bullishness on DG has resulted in a Strong Buy analyst consensus, based on 17 buys and 3 holds set in the last three months. (See Dollar General stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nDollar General DG price target More\n\nTarget Corporation (TGT)\n\nTarget is a bigger name than Dollar General, and a higher end of merchandise. The company\u2019s stock has performed spectacularly this year, gaining 67% so this year. The 60-day gain is also impressive, at 35%. That gain came mostly at the end of August, when Target reported a strong beat of the Q2 earnings expectations.\n\nTarget\u2019s earnings numbers were impressive. The $1.82 EPS beat the forecast by over 12%, while the $18.4 billion in revenue was $100 million more than had been predicted. The strong earnings stood on a foundation of strong same-store sales growth, 3.4% as opposed to the 3% forecast. Target\u2019s forward guidance for the full year was boosted on the strength of the second quarter numbers. FY2019 EPS is now expected at $6.20, where analysts had set a prediction of $5.94.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The holidays are just around the corner, and that means shopping!
