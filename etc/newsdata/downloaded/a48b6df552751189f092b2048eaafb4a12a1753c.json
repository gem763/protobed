(Christian Petersen/Getty Images)\n\nDarko Milicic is considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history when the Detroit Pistons selected him second overall in the 2003 draft, ahead of Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.\n\nBut the joke is on all those NBA teams, as Milicic has outlasted each of those stars and nearly his entire draft class when he ended his seven-year hiatus from pro basketball on Monday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe 34-year-old signed in September with a team in his home town of Novi Sad, Serbia, which is in the country's Second Men\u2019s Regional League. It\u2019s far from the quality of even the NBA G League, but it\u2019s quite the trip to see Milicic back on the court and so bulked up.\n\nRemember Darko Milcic?

He last appeared with the Boston Celtics in 2012 but requested his release in November after only playing in one game. Milicic hasn\u2019t appeared in any foreign leagues since then either, although he briefly flirted with playing in the Serbian league in 2015.\n\nHow heavy is Darko Milicic?\n\nMilicic was listed at 7-foot, 250 pounds during his NBA days, but he looks like he has put on a bit of weight since then. His Serbian team does not have an easily searchable roster either.\n\nHowever, fans do have some insight as to how his weight has fluctuated since his retirement from the NBA. Milicic took up kickboxing in 2014 and told ESPN\u2019s Sam Borden that he broke a scale during his weigh-in and was later found to be over 300 pounds.\n\nThe NBA may be striving for more exact height measurements, but even they don\u2019t care as much about weight. An exact measurement may never come, but it\u2019s fair to guess that he\u2019s pushing 300 again.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Milicic was over 300 pounds when he took up kickboxing in 2017 and looks to be around that weight again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W57aQeSWKpiWpb3Lyvkmgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTcuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wINczfEeQ99OxMTDM50znA--~B/aD0yMDEwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c10df150-e951-11e9-9d7e-5eea5ad7a123", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
