Located on the service level of the Capitol Visitor Center, three floors underground, the SCIF is a collection of offices and conference rooms cloaked in a double layer of metal sheathing to prevent eavesdropping. The lights inside are kept low, there are no windows, and cell phones and other unsecured electronic devices are forbidden. (Aides who want to communicate with members inside have to call and ask a committee staffer to pass along a message in person.) That morning, around seventy-five House members, from both parties, had visited a relatively small conference room inside for the deposition of William B. Taylor, Jr., the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to Ukraine. Gaetz was not a member of the three inquiry committees, but since early on in the proceedings he had been trying to gain access to the depositions. Earlier that day, Trump, who has been frustrated with the progress of the inquiry\u2014particularly with his inability to stop members of his own Administration from testifying before House investigators\u2014had reportedly told some of Gaetz\u2019s colleagues that it was time to \u201ctake the gloves off.\u201d Although Gaetz was not at the meeting, he has long been one of the President\u2019s most loyal street fighters. After passing through two heavy wooden doors, with matching red signs that read \u201cRestricted Area,\u201d he tried once more to enter the SCIF, and was stopped, as he had been before, by a Capitol Police officer. A few minutes later, half a dozen journalists, who were staking out the SCIF, scrambled to follow Gaetz as he left the service level, going up a broad spiral staircase. When they trickled back down to what one grizzled cameraman had nicknamed \u201cthe pit of despair,\u201d they compared notes: \u201cDid he say, \u2018They keep kicking me out\u2019 or \u2018They keep throwing me out\u2019?\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before one of Gaetz\u2019s aides came down to the stairwell with flyers announcing that a \u201cpress conference demanding transparency in impeachment inquiry\u201d would take place the next morning. Forty House Republicans planned to attend, the flyers said, including Steve Scalise, the Minority Whip; Jim Jordan, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee; and Steve King, the Iowa representative who was stripped of his committee assignments by Republican leaders in January, after he wondered aloud why \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was an offensive term. Meanwhile, during a break in Taylor\u2019s testimony, a Capitol maintenance worker attempted to deliver a wheeled lectern to the unsecured anteroom behind the heavy doors. A Capitol Police officer asked what it was for. (Members of the media are not allowed behind the red signs.) According to Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who sits on the Intelligence Committee, the maintenance worker flipped through his paperwork and said, \u201cI got a Congressman Gaetz says he needs it in the morning.\u201d Swalwell told me about the lectern on Tuesday evening, just as Taylor\u2019s testimony was entering its ninth hour. I asked if he had any idea what Gaetz had planned. He laughed and said, \u201cI half expect tomorrow he\u2019s going to try and stuff himself in his suitcase and have Mark Meadows carry him in.\u201d The next morning, just as Laura Cooper, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, was preparing to testify to the inquiry against her superiors\u2019 orders, Gaetz returned to the service-level stairwell with more than two dozen of his Republican colleagues. His face was lit with a broad conspiratorial smile. A crowd of press, easily three times the size of the regular stakeout crew, was waiting for them\u2014as was a wheeled lectern. Gaetz spoke first, complaining about \u201csecret interviews, selective leaks, and weird theatrical performances of transcripts that never happened.\u201d After some of his colleagues delivered brief harangues about the unfairness of the impeachment inquiry\u2014\u201cPLEASE LIMIT REMARKS TO 1 MINUTE\u201d a sign taped on the face of the lectern implored\u2014Gaetz returned to the microphone. With the blithe insouciance of an expert party crasher, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go and see if we can get inside.\u201d He disappeared with his Republican colleagues behind the heavy doors, and for a few moments it was just possible to hear them chanting, \u201cLet us in! Let us in!\u201d It was lost on no one that the assault on the SCIF came a day after what by many accounts had been one of the most damaging witness testimonies against Trump so far. Taylor had largely corroborated a whistle-blower complaint from August that accused the President of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d In his opening statement, Taylor provided the impeachment investigators with a detailed time line of what looked very much like a quid pro quo. Taylor said that he had learned, via Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the E.U., and others, that Trump was personally threatening to withhold a face-to-face meeting with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, along with three hundred and ninety million dollars in military aid, until Zelensky agreed to investigate an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had meddled in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, as well as a second unfounded (and until then unrelated) conspiracy theory that Joe Biden, while Vice-President, had helped his son Hunter by forcing the government to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor. A few hours into the sit-in, the Republicans ordered Chick-fil-A and pizza. The incursion necessitated an electronic sweep by the Sergeant at Arms to re-secure the SCIF, and delayed Cooper\u2019s testimony by five hours. According to Val Demings, a Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee and a former police chief, the Republicans who came into the conference room started yelling at Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, about the need for transparency. \u201cI felt, O.K., here we go,\u201d Demings said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the presence of gang members and mobs before.\u201d Demings and other members of the Intelligence Committee said that they were particularly saddened that the interruption took place in the SCIF. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sacred space, but it\u2019s danggone sure pretty important,\u201d Demings said. \u201cImagine if there was a group of people who thought someone on trial was being unjustly or unfairly treated, but they decided to just storm the courtroom, overthrow the bench, run the judge out of town, and say, \u2018Nope, he hasn\u2019t been treated fairly, so we\u2019re not gonna let this trial go forward.\u2019 \u201d Sean Maloney, a Democratic congressman from upstate New York who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said that the SCIF is \u201cone of the few areas here where there are adults who act like adults doing serious work.\u201d He noted, with obvious pride, that none of the Republicans yelling inside the SCIF were members of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cWe share a common perspective on a lot of national-security issues, even if we strongly disagree on some other things,\u201d Maloney said, of his Republican colleagues. What happened on Wednesday was \u201cnot purely a red-team-versus-blue-team thing,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think what you saw in that room was a clash between the culture of bipartisanship and serious professionalism that defines the Intelligence Committee space with the tabloid, circus-like atmosphere of the Trump era.\u201d Maloney said that he saw Mike Conaway, a Republican on the Intelligence Committee, collecting iPads, Fitbits, phones, and smart watches after he realized that the intruders had not left their devices in the anteroom. Gaetz\u2019s stunt, Maloney added, signified how far the investigation has come in a short period. \u201cIt was almost like they had decided that there was just too much truth getting out and they had to do something,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cSo they broke the glass, slammed down on the red button, and decided to act like children in there.\u201d\n\nUntil Wednesday, according to both Democrats and Republicans on the three committees, there had been a sense of serious purpose to the over-all impeachment inquiry. On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that some Republicans have used their time in the depositions \u201cto try to link those [witnesses] appearing as part of the impeachment inquiry to other individuals who figured prominently in GOP efforts to discredit previous investigations of Trump\u2019s ties with Russia in 2016,\u201d a claim that I heard from some Democrats as well. \u201cThey\u2019ll make their points up front, for the record, about why they think the impeachment inquiry is one thing or another,\u201d Maloney told me. But he also said that, at the start of each deposition, the Republican staff counsel \u201cspends an hour asking serious questions. Their members then take turns asking questions. There\u2019s no arguing, there\u2019s no raised voices, there\u2019s no theatrics. It\u2019s a very professional process, and they have conducted themselves in a way that none of us have objected to.\u201d Francis Rooney, a Republican of Florida who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed Maloney\u2019s account. \u201cThere\u2019s an occasional demagogue guy on either side, but, by and large, it\u2019s been very civil,\u201d he said. Rooney praised the patient approach and calm demeanor of Schiff, who\u2019s been leading the inquiry day to day for the three House committees, and Daniel Goldman, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s director of investigations. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any attempt to stop people from asking questions. That\u2019s why they\u2019re taking so long. So I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s been an unfair process.\u201d Rooney, a former Ambassador to the Holy See, is the only current House Republican to show unambiguous public sympathy for the impeachment inquiry. When I visited him in his office last week, he was wearing pale khaki pants, a white shirt, and leather-laced moccasins. He acknowledged that what appears to have happened in Ukraine was far outside the bounds of acceptable diplomacy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these people over there conducting diplomacy according to the book, and then you come to find out that your words are being countermanded or ignored because there\u2019s Rudy Giuliani and the three amigos out there going about their business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Rooney is in many ways a doctrinaire Republican: he voted for Trump\u2019s tax cuts, disapproves of DACA, and opposes abortion. In 2017, at the peak of the Russia investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller, he said that he was \u201cvery concerned that the D.O.J. and F.B.I., whether you want to call it \u2018deep state\u2019 or what, are kind of off the rails.\u201d But he has also introduced bills that would establish a carbon tax and ban offshore drilling. Rooney has a large photo of the burning Deepwater Horizon oil rig propped against a wall in his office. \u201cI keep that there for when the industry guys drop in,\u201d he said. Rooney\u2019s district, on the west coast of Florida, went for Trump by twenty-two points in 2016. He said that many of his constituents \u201creally would be for him if he walked down Fifth Avenue and shot somebody. So they\u2019re pretty upset. A lot of them are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t care what he does. You should be for him.\u2019 I tell them, \u2018No, that\u2019s not going to happen with me.\u2019 I haven\u2019t heard anything yet that would make me vote to impeach him, but I owe it to myself and to the oath of office and to the job to get facts.\u201d According to Democratic aides close to the inquiry, the first hint that something was amiss in Ukraine came in April, months before the whistle-blower\u2019s report, when the Ukrainian prosecutor-general began publicly attacking Marie Yovanovitch, who was the American Ambassador at the time. In June, after Giuliani admitted to the Times that he and his associates were \u201cnot meddling in an election\u201d with their work in Ukraine but rather \u201cmeddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d the staffs of the three House committees that are now conducting the inquiry first started working together. (When the Daily Beast reported on the potential for a congressional investigation, Giuliani responded, \u201cDo it! Give me a chance to give a couple speeches about it and hold a press conference. I\u2019d love that. . . . I think it\u2019d be a fun fight.\u201d) The committees\u2019 concerns were heightened in May, when Yovanovitch was unexpectedly recalled from her post, and again in July, when the committees learned that the congressionally approved security assistance had not been delivered. On September 9th, the first working day in Congress after the end of the August recess, the three inquiry committees sent a joint letter demanding documents from the State Department about the July 25th call between Trump and Zelensky. The same day, during a closed-door meeting of the Intelligence Committee, Schiff said that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general had told him that an urgent whistle-blower complaint was being withheld by the acting director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire. Ten days later, the I.C.I.G. briefed Schiff\u2019s committee behind closed doors. He wouldn\u2019t talk about the substance of the complaint, but, Swalwell said, \u201cHe told us the White House, the Department of Justice, and the acting D.N.I. were involved in blocking him, so we knew it was something earth-shattering.\u201d On September 24th, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry; the Times reported on Monday that Democrats will hold a floor vote on October 31st to \u201caffirm\u201d the inquiry\u2019s procedures. When I asked Rooney, who recently announced that he would retire after this term, for his thoughts on the progress of the inquiry so far, he said that impeachment \u201cwould probably be the most serious decision that anybody serving right now would ever make.\u201d He told a story about his father, a construction magnate, whose company Rooney inherited. (In a strange coincidence, Rooney\u2019s family business built the Capitol Visitor Center, including the SCIF.) Rooney recalls his father, a staunch conservative, saying that Watergate was \u201cjust a witch hunt on Nixon. The liberal establishment, the whole bit.\u201d The day after the Saturday Night Massacre, Rooney said, his father had attended church at Holy Trinity, in Georgetown. The priest asked for a moment of silence for the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, and the Attorney General, Elliot Richardson. \u201cMy dad and all these business guys, they all got up and walked out, right in the middle of church. That\u2019s how intense it was. Just like it\u2019s intense now. But it turned out, come that following July, they all realized they\u2019d been had. And so I thought, well, I\u2019m not going to get had.\u201d\n\nIf the subject matter of the impeachment inquiry depends on what has happened in the White House, the State Department, and wherever Giuliani happened to be at any given moment, the politics of the investigation owes much to the hard lessons that many Democrats feel they took away from the Mueller investigation. Swalwell, for example, was hardly alone in believing that the Mueller report revealed impeachable conduct on the part of the President. And yet, however damning Mueller\u2019s conclusions may have been in substance, they were couched in a dense and complicated narrative that made it difficult to motivate the political will to address them. The report, Swalwell said, was too \u201coverwhelming\u201d for anyone who wasn\u2019t following the Russia story closely. \u201cYou needed, like, a Ph.D. in Russian studies to understand it.\u201d The simplicity of the Ukraine story helped Democrats escape what Swalwell called the post-Mueller \u201cimpeachment purgatory.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people know what a shakedown is. This just happens to be three hundred and ninety million dollars that was leveraged.\u201d Many of the House Democrats whom I spoke to seem aware that they\u2019ve been given a rare second chance, although none of them said so explicitly. A staffer working on the inquiry told me that, after the Mueller report was released, Democrats \u201cspent six to eight weeks mired in a circular-firing-squad conversation with ourselves. Like, do we impeach? Do we not impeach? Is it obstruction? Is it not obstruction? It just became less about the substance and more about the process.\u201d This time around, the Democrats involved in the investigation are particularly keen to avoid the sort of legal trench warfare that characterized their previous dealings with the Administration. If Trump threatens people and intimidates witnesses, Swalwell told me, the investigators will treat that as consciousness of guilt. If witnesses refuse to testify, the committees are not going to let themselves get mired in an ever-escalating series of court cases. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to assume that it\u2019s because showing up doesn\u2019t help you, and you\u2019re guilty,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to move on.\u201d What\u2019s more, while the investigation so far has raised serious questions about the involvement of the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo; the Attorney General, William Barr; and even Vice-President Mike Pence in the Ukraine scheme, Democrats said that they plan to stay laser-focussed on Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t go down these crazy rabbit holes about Giuliani and his goons, and who\u2019s paying Giuliani,\u201d one of the aides close to the inquiry told me. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s working at the behest of the President. He\u2019s the President\u2019s henchman. It all is a top-down scheme.\u201d House Democrats have multiple active investigations into Trump\u2019s finances, and they are still pursuing information from the Mueller investigation. (On Friday, a district-court judge in Washington ruled that the Department of Justice must hand over information from Mueller\u2019s grand jury to the House Democrats.) And in July the Ways and Means Committee received its own whistle-blower complaint, which reportedly details an attempt by a Treasury Department political appointee to interfere with an audit of the President or Vice-President\u2019s tax returns. Democrats in the House insist that there has been no decision\u2014or even a time line for a decision\u2014about whether any of these investigations, including the one about Ukraine, will result in articles of impeachment. At least some of this delay appears to be tactical. One congressperson told me that moderate freshmen in the caucus have been saying, \u201cWe want you guys to really emphasize that it\u2019s a fair hearing, and that we\u2019re being deliberative, and we haven\u2019t made up our minds yet.\u201d Meanwhile, one of the aides close to the inquiry said that the most hesitant Democrats have asked that discussions about impeachment be handled with an appropriately solemn tone, and for the time and latitude to help their constituents come to terms with the potential reality of what would be only the third Presidential-impeachment vote in the nation\u2019s history.", "description": "Robert P.
