Hollywood's fastest growing job", "language": "en", "text": "Two years after a sexual harassment scandal roiled Hollywood, one of the fastest growing jobs in the entertainment industry is that of the intimacy director.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The cast of Showtime's \"The Affair\" poses backstage with their award for Best Television Series - Drama during the 72nd Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California January 11, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nFueled by the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, demand is soaring for intimacy directors or coordinators who help choreograph TV and movie scenes involving sex or nudity and ensure that actors are not exploited or made to feel uncomfortable.\n\nInterest in the specialized job is high, but training can take months.\n\n\u201cWe have stunt coordinators. We really take care of people in those kind of scenes. But scenes of intimacy have kind of been left a little too alone,\u201d said Jessica Steinrock, managing director of the non-profit Intimacy Directors International (IDI).\n\nHBO now has an intimacy coordinator on all its shows involving intimate scenes, while Showtime uses one on \u201cThe Affair\u201d and other series.\n\nElsewhere, IDI and groups like Theatrical Intimacy Education and Intimacy on Set run multiple workshops in the United States and the UK that empower actors to speak up.\n\nIDI, founded in 2016, says the number of its intimacy instructors has mushroomed to 29, from just four two years ago. More than 70 people applied for 10 places with IDI earlier this year to train for the role.\n\nTHE POWER OF NO\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely growing at a rapid pace,\u201d said Gabrielle Carteris, president of the U.S. actors union SAG-AFTRA. \u201cThere are a plethora of shows and not enough intimacy coordinators right now.\u201d\n\nIntimacy directors act as a liaison on movie and TV sets between producers or directors and actors to ensure that actors are treated with respect, whether the script calls for a first kiss or a rape scene.\n\nBefore sexual misconduct allegations involving multiple actors, directors and producers swept Hollywood in 2017, actors were often left to fend for themselves in establishing boundaries at work.\n\nSteinrock, who has also worked as an actor, recalled feeling vulnerable one time, when the hand of a fellow actor slipped lower than usual during a scene.\n\n\u201cI found myself thinking, \u2018is it because he likes me? Is it because he is more in the moment today?\u2019 Even though my character might be ok with that, me - the actor - was not. But I found it really difficult to have that conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nSteinrock and Carteris said there has been some resistance from directors who fear shooting of some scenes may be slowed down. But those who have tried it have mostly embraced the practice.\n\nDavid Simon, co-creator of HBO\u2019s porn industry drama \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview last year that he would never work without an intimacy co-ordinator again.\n\nCREATING A BIGGER POOL\n\nFinding the right people for the work takes care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for people that have an interest in sensitivity, consent and mental health but also people that have movement experience,\u201d said Steinrock.\n\nSAG-AFTRA is currently working with several groups to establish common protocols for the work of intimacy coordinators and the training they undergo.\n\n\u201cThere are actors who are older now and who want to pay back, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are qualified. There are dancers who have been talking to us about aging out of their careers and they want to be able to come into the next thing,\u201d said Carteris.\n\n\u201cWe do have to create a bigger pool and then we have to create that training ground so that there is a standardized way of working that we all understand what is expected,\u201d she added.\n\nIndependent actor, writer and educator Heather Maria Acs decided she wants to train as an instructor after taking part in a recent intimacy workshop in Los Angeles with some 20 other people.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nIt\u2019s a career she never could have envisaged three years ago despite her 20 years in show business. \u201cI had no idea and yet it makes so much sense. I\u2019m excited to share it with other people,\u201d she said.\n\nAcs said the skills she had learned in just one afternoon workshop were \u201cnot only skills for performers but they are life skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing I will take away . . . is how powerful a yes can be when there is an option to say no. And how powerful a no can be when we know it\u2019s safe to say yes,\u201d she said.", "description": "Two years after a sexual harassment scandal roiled Hollywood, one of the fastest growing jobs in the entertainment industry is that of the intimacy director.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441544906&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1HC", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
