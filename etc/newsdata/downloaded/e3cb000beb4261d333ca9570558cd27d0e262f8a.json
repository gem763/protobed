REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay said in an interview with several European newspapers published on Monday that the European Union should be open to \u201ccreative and flexible\u201d solutions to the Irish border question.\n\nThe EU\u2019s top negotiator is pessimistic about avoiding a no-deal scenario as the bloc is not budging on Britain\u2019s demand to remove the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d, ensuring an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, from the withdrawal pact.\n\nBarclay insisted in the interview, according to comments published by German newspaper Die Welt, that the EU should be more interested in \u201ccreative and flexible solutions\u201d, adding that its current position was an \u201cabsolutist approach\u201d.\n\nHe rejected EU negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s statement that the backstop provision was not negotiable and questioned the unity of the remaining 27 EU member states on the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is in contrast to the position I have heard in several EU capitals. They are open to creative and flexible solutions and are interested in seeing the details from the UK,\u201d Barclay said, adding: \u201cWe will leave the EU on October 31, whether with or without a deal.\u201d\n\nThe pre-released comments from Barclay did not give hints for what Britain\u2019s proposal might be for a \u201ccreative\u201d solution.", "description": "Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay said in an interview with several European newspapers published on Monday that the European Union should be open to \"creative and flexible\" solutions to the Irish border question.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425519238&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811KZ"}
