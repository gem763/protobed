Not a good look'.\n\nBrave: Jameela Jamil took to Twitter on Monday and wrote she has battled cancer TWICE and feels privileged to get older, after an 'ageist' troll told her she was too old to wear this dress\n\nJameela first wore the dress at the end of September outside Build Studios in New York following the conclusion of the fourth and final series of The Good Place.\n\nThe gown had featured huge puff sleeves and with an off-the-shoulder neckline and was covered in a stunning floral pattern.\n\nHitting back in a series of tweets, Jameela said the 'biggest nonsense' always comes from men and that they were the 'majority of people who say dumb s*** to me.'\n\nShe then revealed that she had suffered from cancer on two occasions.\n\nBright: The striking actress, 33, first wore the dress at the end of last month when chatting with fans at Build Studios in New York following the conclusion of the final series of The Good Place\n\nShe wrote: 'I would just like to say, that as someone who has been chronically ill my whole life, and had cancer twice, I find it EXTREMELY offensive that there is a cultural taboo around aging.\n\n'Those of us who fight for our lives and those who lost that fight young, deserve more respect.'\n\nThe star also suffers from a coeliac disease and severe food allergies and her spine was damaged when she was hit by a car when she was 17.\n\nNasty: When the troll responded with the unkind comments, she wrote: 'The biggest nonsense always comes from men in my mentions'\n\nJameela, who stars as Tahani Al-Jamil on NBC's hit comedy series, had previously revealed in 2015 that she had suffered a breast cancer scare following the discovery of a lump which later turned not to be cancerous.\n\nThe troll had hit out at the star after she posted a clip of her September appearance on Noah's hit show.\n\nIn the video she explained her dislike of 'cancel culture'.\n\nWhen the troll responded with the unkind comments, she wrote: 'The biggest nonsense always comes from men in my mentions.\n\n'I like men. I know wonderful men. I\u2019m not saying all men are like this.\n\nStill angry: The star later added that 'It is a sickness of our society to look at aging as anything other than an achievement/privilege'\n\n'But some men are not doing the rest of you favours on this app. They are currently the vast majority of the people who say dumb s*** to me.'\n\nIn further tweets, the 5ft 11in beauty appeared to respond to another comment, which has since been deleted.\n\nShe wrote: 'That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care if you think I\u2019m 78. Because I think aging is cool and I hope I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to do that.\n\n'Not everyone gets the luxury of getting older. And I think it\u2019s a sacred thing that I cherish every day. My lines are my souvenirs.'\n\nShe later added: 'It is a sickness of our society to look at aging as anything other than an achievement/privilege.'\n\nJameela has long spoken out in support of body confidence, and recently said she is 'thankful' for the physique she has.\n\nShe told InStyle magazine: 'Instead of practising body positivity, I practice body neutrality...I constantly thank my body for what it does for me.\n\n'I think about how it heals and repairs itself, takes me from point A to B, and allows me to do my job, have sex, and just live my life. It\u2019s a finely tuned engine that deserves to be respected, and I\u2019m so grateful for it now\n\n'Stop shaming people about their body, stop shaming people about their age, stop shaming people about their symmetry. Just let a b***h live.'\n\nThe former BBC radio presenter added that celebrities have a responsibility to be good role models and set a good example for young people.\n\nShe told how she feels celebrities have replaced religion for a lot of people and young people sometimes listen to them more than they do their parents or teachers.\n\nJameela is in a relationship with James Blake who she said empowers her and helps teach her to 'stick up for herself'.", "description": "The striking actress, 33, first wore the dress (inset) at the end of last month when chatting with fans at Build Studios in New York following the conclusion of the fourth and final series of The Good Place.", "authors": ["Harry Howard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19393016-0-image-a-75_1570447945471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
