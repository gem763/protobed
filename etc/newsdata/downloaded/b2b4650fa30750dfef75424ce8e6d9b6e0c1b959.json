In the 1970s he would say to audiences: \u201cEnoch Powell says he wants to give me \u00a31,000 to go back to where I came from. Which is great, because it\u2019s only 20 pence on the bus from here to Dudley.\u201d Who could resist? Around the UK, young black teenagers were seen as folk devils, frequently expelled and relocated to \u201ceducationally subnormal\u201d (ESN) schools, stopped and frisked by police for the crime of being out on the street. Henry, who was hardly old enough to take his CSEs when he appeared on the TV talent show New Faces impersonating Stevie Wonder and Frank Spencer, was more reassuring: coltish, eager to please, a mimic rather than a satirist.\n\nBeing cheery was a way to stave off the pains of growing up in a working-class household ruled over by a mother who whacked her children with fists, boots, branches, frying pans. At one point he called his home \u201cthe Ruins\u201d. At night he and his three brothers \u201ctook it in turns to wet the bed \u2013 there were many times when I dreamt I was asleep in a submarine that had just been torpedoed\u201d. At school there were meatheads who made monkey noises and picked fights. \u201cNot this again,\u201d Henry said to one of them. \u201cY\u2019must really fancy me, cos you\u2019re always tryin\u2019 to get to me to roll around on the ground with ya.\u201d \u201cShut y\u2019mouth, coon.\u201d \u201cHere we go,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cYou hit me, I hit you \u2013 we fall on the ground and hug. Why don\u2019t we go and have dinner and a movie first? Cut out all the fighting?\u201d\n\nFor a while, the comic stage offered a safe harbour. So many light entertainers from the 70s have been found guilty of abusing their fame, it\u2019s a relief to read Henry paying tribute to the artistry and friendship of performers such as Bob Monkhouse, Leslie Crowther and Ken Dodd. Crackerjack presenter Don Maclean \u201cwould stalk the stage like a velociraptor \u2013 marking out his territory and spraying jokes at each point of the compass \u2026 I hero-worshipped him\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to smash the oppressor, or kill Whitey. I wanted to smash box office records and buy my Mama a house Lenny Henry\n\nHenry\u2019s accounts of touring in a stage version of The Black and White Minstrel Show are finely recalled. He gets to meet girls, former matinee idols, the sequin-wearing magicians Anna and Maria \u2013 and their outsized parrot, Miggsy. His companions were, he says, \u201cvagabonds, mountebanks and felons \u2013 constantly moving from town to town, wreaking havoc and then skipping town before daybreak to avoid hostile landlords, one-night stands or irate husbands\u201d. That itinerary of broken-down cinemas and working men\u2019s clubs (\u201cwooden taps for the beer and ancient bags of pork scratchings and crisps and nuts pinned to the wall\u201d) ground him down. As did his suspicion that the Minstrels were using him as a \u201cpolitical football\u201d in order to avoid accusations of racism.\n\nPrejudice was up front and proud in those days. West Indian kids yelled \u201cWhite man! Yu is a white man!\u201d at Henry because of his Dudley accent. Later, after he married fellow comedian Dawn French, members of the National Front stuffed burning rags through their letterbox. Yet looking at a photograph of himself from 1978, he notes: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to smash the oppressor, or kill Whitey. I wanted to smash box office records and buy my Mama a house.\u201d And he also admits: \u201cI do wish I stood up more against racism. I wonder if turning one\u2019s back is really the answer.\u201d\n\nBeing a mimic allowed him, for a few minutes each night, to become someone else. And to be applauded for it. But while mimicry can be subversive, a way to cock a snook at authority, it can also be mere parrotry, survival through self-cancellation. For Henry, \u201cit was a pathway \u2013 it was integration writ large\u201d. He says that when he joined Tiswas, the anarchic Saturday morning children\u2019s programme on ITV, he suspected the cast pitied him for having spent so much time in conservative company.\n\nHenry\u2019s instability, his search for a voice of his own, extends to his prose. He can be chatty and colloquial, all banter and bonhomie, recalling teenage high jinks with dizzied abandon. He can also be a bit pompous (\u201cI\u2019ve slowly come to understand the complexities of displacement, loneliness and the need for companionship\u201d) and overly citational (quoting Derek Walcott, Nelson Mandela, CS Lewis). In the final, misguided section of the book he shifts to mentor mode, dispensing advice on microphone technique to would-be comics.\n\nHe suggests he is readying two more volumes of memoir. That seems excessive. Who Am I Again? is raw, touching and all over the place. He says it\u2019s not an autobiography, but a biography (\u201cbecause I\u2019m writing about someone I used to know\u201d). He suspects he\u2019s not black enough, not manly enough. Often he feels adrift, lost, in a \u201cduvet of sadness\u201d. The book ends with the question in its title left unanswered.\n\n\u2022 Who Am I Again? is published by Faber (\u00a320).
