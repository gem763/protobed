He broke all kinds of FBI rules, protocol and laws in his effort to take down President Trump and his administration through the launch of a Special Counsel investigation.\"\n\nIn short, the report said that Comey \"failed to live up to this responsibility. By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees\u2014and the many thousands more former FBI employees\u2014who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information,\" among many other negative descriptions of his questionable behavior.\n\nOn The Ingraham Angle with Laura Ingraham, the host asked Rep. Jordan if he will be giving an apology to Comey.\n\nThe fired FBI director tweeted Thursday, \"DOJ IG 'found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.' I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice.\"\n\nJordan responded, \"Our county had to live through this two and a half year saga because of one guy -- Jim Comey. Jim Comey's guy who opened the investigation in July of 2016....put Peter Sztrok in charge of it, the same guy who said Trump should lose 100 million to zero. That's the guy he put in charge. Jim Comey is the guy who allowed a dossier to be used to get a warrant to spy on the American citizens.\"\n\n\"James Comey is the guy who leaks sensitive Information, broke the rules to the FBI, leaked sensitive information to The New york Times\" through his friend Daniel Richman, for what reason?\" he asked. \"To get the special counsel who put the country through this entire saga that is based on a false accusation.\"\n\n\"Jim Comey owes the country for an apology because he put us through this for 2 1/2 years,\" Rep. Jordan continued. \"And We know he did it. We know he did it because he was Out to get the president based on what happened at the January 6 meeting that you talked about At the trump tower where he Talked about the dossier and it Says on page 17 of the report, They did it to try to get Information, trap the president, all the while, he was telling the president, 'You're not under investigation.'\"\n\n\"He's responsible for the whole darn two and a half year thing,\" he added.\n\nThe entire segment is worth the watch:\n\n\n\n", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:09:32AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/58/d226abde-34ea-46ed-8b22-02fff0ad1ea5.png"}
