USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Stephen Strasburg says the Nationals are excited President Donald Trump is attending Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park on Sunday.\n\n\"Everybody is excited,\" Strasburg said during his pregame news conference. \"It's the President of the United States. So there's obviously beefed up security.\n\n\"Usually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse (during pregame security sweep) are these nice Labs that are super friendly.\n\n\"And today there was a German Shepherd that I didn't really feel comfortable petting.\"\n\nTrump announced Thursday that he planned on attending the game against the Houston Astros.\n\nHowever, the President opted out of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch or make other public appearance \u201cin order to make the fan experience as positive as possible,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Friday.\n\nStephen Strasburg is starting Game 6 of the World Series. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cWe actually had a conversation with him about first pitches,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cHis view was that in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, we were very grateful for that. We thought it was a great decision on the President\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nSecurity was extra tight before Game 5. TSA, Secret Service and security dogs have been canvassing the stadium in the hours leading up to the first pitch.", "description": "Stephhen Strasburg joked about the security dogs sweeping the Nationals Park before President Trumps visit.
