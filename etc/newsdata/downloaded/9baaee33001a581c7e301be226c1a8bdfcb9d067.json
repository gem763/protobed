It was action-packed and I will recommend it to my friends,\" he said, adding that he hopes that actors like Chinese martial arts star Jet Li can be featured in more of such Chinese films in the future.\n\nTo fellow movie-goer and Chinese national Serena Fan, 35, the film offered a rich insight into the behind-the-scenes work and gave her a newfound respect for the aviation industry. \"As passengers, many people have very little knowledge of the process and hard work of the airline crew involved,\" said Fan who has lived in Singapore for the past seven years.\n\nShe said while she knew that Chinese aviation safety standards are relatively high, the film helped further bolster her \"confidence\" in the airline industry.\n\nOn the potential of the Chinese film market, Fan said that China has \"many stories to tell\" and can explore more areas, such as doing more to raise the standards of its science-fiction films or delving into stories about the lives of ordinary Chinese people.\n\nBesides The Captain, the other two Chinese films currently released in Singapore are My People, My Country, a film that draws on historical and classic moments since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and The Climbers, which details the ascent of Chinese mountaineers up Mt. Qomolangma.\n\nNoting that Chinese mainland movie companies have been \"producing high-quality movies\" in the past five years, the Clover Films spokesperson was optimistic that Chinese movies can attract more Singaporeans and Chinese nationals here.\n\nClover Films has previously distributed Chinese action war film Operation Red Sea, by Hong Kong director Dante Lam during the Chinese New Year period in 2018. It also released other movies like Shadow, a Chinese period film directed by Zhang Yimou, as well as fantasy action film Jade Dynasty.\n\nIn general, Singaporeans have \"started to embrace the concept of a China movie blockbuster\" and are not just limited to watching Hollywood movies. The success of The Captain and other Chinese films in the box office is a testament to this trend, said the Clover Films spokesperson.\n\n\"We will continue to bring in more Chinese movies so that audience in Singapore can have the chance to watch these good movies,\" said the spokesperson.", "description": "Chinese disaster film The Captain\u00a0draws crowds in Singapore, with the film opening at number two in the Singapore box office behind Hollywood blockbuster Joker.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5dae68cba310cf3e97a25f9a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
