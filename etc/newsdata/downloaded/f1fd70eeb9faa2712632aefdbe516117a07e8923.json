And that comes from how Tammy has handled himself all season form the early moments when people were questioning him. \u2018The work ethic behind the scenes that gets him in such good nick. I trusted in Tammy at the start of the season.\n\n\u2018He has made the position his own in the short term. Over the season we will need everybody and he deserves a great start to the season. I will keep on him because I want more.\u2019\n\nChelsea head into the international break on the back of four straight wins and have climbed up to fifth in the league.\n\nAbaraham gives Chelsea the lead with a lobbed finish in the first half at St Mary's\n\nLampard said: \u2018If we can keep going with that then yes, we will be challenging right up there I hope.\u2019\n\nLampard, though, was also forced to condemn chants from the away end which included a song about \u2018pikeys\u2019.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t want to have chants and stuff that is discriminatory to anyone,\u2019 Lampard said. \u2018And I think we all need to look at it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a wider problem than Chelsea, without a doubt. But it shouldn\u2019t stop us talking about it.\u2019\n\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s frustration with his side\u2019s defending especially during the first half was clear to see and he pulled no punches in his assessment of their performance which continued their poor form.\n\nThe striker wheels away in celebration after netting his ninth goal of the season\n\nThey have now won just two of their last 13 league games. He said: \u2018If you invite them to score then you don\u2019t have to wonder that they do it.\n\n\u2018We know we have to have a very, very good performance if we want to take something but at the moment we are far away from a good performance. This something very disappointing for me.\n\n\u2018At the moment our work against the ball is not good enough. This game today was a little bit too easy for the opponent.\n\n\u2018In total it\u2019s not enough at the moment and that is why we have two intense weeks in front of us.\u2019", "description": "Frank Lampard praised Tammy Abraham for his emphatic response to his early-season critics but insists he will keep on his in-form striker's case because he wants even more from the youngster", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/18/19366278-0-image-a-8_1570382356122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
