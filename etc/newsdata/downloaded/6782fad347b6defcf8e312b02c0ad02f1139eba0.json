Over that period, the yellow metal has gone from putting in higher highs and higher lows to lower highs and lower lows, creating a textbook \u201chead-and-shoulders\u201d pattern. This pattern shows a shift from a bullish to a bearish trend and is often seen at important tops in the market:\n\nDaily Gold\n\nSource: TradingView, FOREX.com\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI indicator is in a bearish channel, and the MACD is trending lower below its signal line and about to cross the \u201c0\u201d level. In other words, the secondary indicators are confirming the price reversal, suggesting that bears may be taking the upper hand.\n\nIn a mirror image of Matt\u2019s comments last week, the short-term trend has now shifted to bearish as long as gold remains below its head-and-shoulders pattern \u201cneckline\u201d in the $1480-1485 area. To the downside, bears may look to target the Fibonacci retracements of this summer\u2019s rally starting at $1445 (38.2%), $1411 (50%), and $1377 (61.8%), as well as the \u201cmeasured move\u201d projection of the head-and-shoulders pattern at $1400.\n\nOf course, traders must also consider the fundamental outlook for the yellow metal. With global interest rates still at depressed levels and several geopolitical hotspots still at risk of a significant disruption, bears should be cognizant of the risk of a bullish reversal near these key support levels.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
