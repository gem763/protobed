To qualify, each player must be started in fewer than 60 percent of Yahoo! leagues. Speaking as an accountability advocate, I will post results, whether genius or moronic, the following week (Scoring thresholds \u2013 QB: 18 fpts, RB: 12 fpts, WR: 11 fpts: TE: 10 fpts; .5 PPR). If you\u2019re a member of TEAM HUEVOS, reveal your Week 8 Flames in the comments section below.\n\nStream-worthy Tannehill to sink Buccaneers\n\nRyan Tannehill, Ten, QB (5 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $22)\n\nMatchup: vs. TB\n\nVegas Line/Total: Ten -2.5, 46.5\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nForget Freddy Krueger, Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers or the demonic nuns from \u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d the most bone-chilling villain to grace television screens this Halloween season is the injury imp. The insatiable, blood-thirsty beast, a constant menace who terrorizes Fantasyland, has feasted on numerous body parts, leaving nothing but crushed souls in its wake. Just look at the QB position. Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger, Cam Newton and Patrick Mahomes are just a few prominent names who were victimized by the creature\u2019s sinister wrath.\n\nAs a result of the various demises, new value sources have emerged, Gardner Minshew the most notable. Though Tannehill earned his starter stripes for a different reason \u2014 Marcus Mariota\u2019s ineptitude \u2014 he, like Jacksonville\u2019s jorts sensation, is a viable stopgap for those trapped in QB hell. The veteran didn\u2019t light the world on fire last week against the Chargers, but he certainly fanned the flames, completing 23-of-29 passes for 312 yards (10.7 ypa) and two scores.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis week, Tannehill and the Titans are blessed with a divine matchup against Tampa. The Buccaneers, shipwrecked by the pass this season, have given up 7.7 pass yards per attempt, 318.5 pass yards per game, 1.8 passing touchdowns per game and the fifth-most fantasy points to signal-callers. They\u2019ve also allowed the 10th-highest amount of total air yards, even with the bye. Digging deeper, Vernon Hargreaves and M.J. Stewart have surrendered a combined 113.7 passer rating and 1.60 yards per snap.\n\nTally it up and Tannehill should be the chainsaw, not the massacred, in Week 8.\n\nFearless Forecast: 293 passing yards, 2 passing touchdowns, 0 interceptions, 9 rushing yards, 20.6 fantasy points\n\nPackers\u2019 Williams to cut through KC\u2019s Swiss Cheese D\n\nJamaal Williams, RB, WR (24 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $16)\n\nMatchup: at KC\n\nVegas Line/Total: GB -3.5, 48\n\nSloth-like, a belly-dragging Vietnamese pig, Tom Brady pulling a sled through mud \u2014 over the years these are descriptions yours truly applied, probably unfairly, to Williams.\n\nThe twisting thorn in the side of Aaron Jones managers, the Packers\u2019 complement has carved out an expanded role the past two weeks. Against the Lions and Raiders he played on 46.4 percent of Green Bay\u2019s snaps averaging 167 total yards and an impressive 3.65 yards after contact per attempt while scoring twice.\n\n\u201cFleet of foot\u201d is a phrase that doesn\u2019t apply to the rusher, but his versatility, blitz deflection and underrated power are plus attributes. On roughly 40-45 percent of Green Bay\u2019s backfield touches, he should showcase all his wares under the prime-time lights.\n\nConsider KC\u2019s defensive thumping of Denver an aberration. Even with its containment of Philip Lindsay, it\u2019s allowed 5.0 yards per carry, 169.4 total yards per game, six total touchdowns and the seventh-most fantasy points to RBs. At or near the basement in stuffed percentage (No. 31), adjusted line yards (No. 32) and second-level runs (No. 32) conceded, the Chiefs D-line is sure to get manhandled by a Packers front that\u2019s excelled of late. Weigh Williams at RB2 in 12-team leagues.\n\nFearless Forecast: 9 carries, 33 rushing yards, 4 receptions, 35 receiving yards, 1 touchdown, 14.8 fantasy points\n\nJamaal Williams is a solid fantasy start against the Chiefs. (Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\n\nLast stand for Montgomery against Chargers\n\nDavid Montgomery, Chi, RB (44 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $17)\n\nMatchup: vs. LAC\n\nVegas Line/Total: Chi -5.5, 40.5\n\nIs future Tampa Bay Viper Mitchell Trubisky really better than Chase Daniel? What about a random Walmart greeter from Streator, IL? If \u201cearmuffs\u201d Matt Nagy were Alabama\u2019s head coach, could he actually formulate an effective game plan to defeat Rutgers? Speaking as a member of the media, is that too divisive, Matt? Is Montgomery expendable in 12-team leagues?\n\nWhen it comes to the Bears, and their broken offense, these are legitimate questions.\n\nAfter a bye week, typically the time coaches reassess and recalibrate, Nagy drew up a blueprint akin to the Hindenburg. Trubisky missed high-school level throws, the offensive line leaked persistently and Montgomery was given a confounding four touches. Four? Nearly 10 weeks removed from the head coach publicly professing his adoration for the rookie, he was a footnote. When it comes to criminal misuse, Nagy really is \u201cThe Devil in the White City.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, Monty is Royce Freeman 2.0. The intervention has occurred. I have an addiction and have accepted reality. The Bears\u2019 flappable offensive line is to blame, but the rushers 2.16 YAC per attempt leaves much to be desired. His 19.2 missed tackle rate, however, is his lone saving grace.\n\nIf he can\u2019t put it together this week, against a Chargers defense allowing 4.5 yards per carry, 144.9 total yards per game, seven total TDs and the eighth-most fantasy points to RBs, then he deserves a place on the scrapheap. This is Monty\u2019s last chance to gain respectability, if Nagy is willing to get him involved 15-17 times.\n\nFearless Forecast: 15 carries, 66 rushing yards, 2 receptions, 18 receiving yards, 1 touchdown, 15.4 fantasy points\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $250K Baller. $10 entry fee and $25K to first place]\n\nLight the wick? Dynamite Diontae potential vs. Miami\n\nDiontae Johnson, Pit, WR (3 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $15)\n\nMatchup: vs. Mia\n\nVegas Line/Total: Pit -14.5, 43\n\nBefore arsenic poisoned the QB well, the story of the fantasy football season was the impact of several rookie wide receivers. Marquise Brown, Terry McLaurin and A.J. Brown each blazed a fiery trail early. Overlooked, the newbie from Toledo also made his name known. After Ben Roesthlisberger added his name to the primary theme, promoted backup Mason Rudolph established an instant chemistry with Johnson, spurning those who believed his former college buddy, James Washington, was going to be that guy.\n\nBallyhooed for his quick twitch, playmaking explosion and knifing cuts, Johnson drew comps to Emmanuel Sanders during the draft process. He isn\u2019t the biggest (5-foot-10, 183 pounds) or the fastest (4.53 40-yard) guy around, but his route savvy and reliable hands (66.7 catch%) have overcome any physical limitations. He\u2019s caught just seven passes for 41 yards in his past two games, but with Rudolph supplanting Devlin Hodges under center, he should return to the WR3 ranks.\n\nHis opponent, Miami, has yielded the sixth-most fantasy points and third-highest average depth of target (9.5) to wide receivers. Overall, seven wideouts have eclipsed 10.0 fantasy points against them. Projected to line up against CB Ken Webster (117.7 passer rating, 1.43 yards per snap allowed) most often, the former Rocket is in a spot to launch to starter-level numbers in 12-team formats. Give yourself an excuse to watch Monday Night Football.\n\nFearless Forecast: 4 receptions, 64 receiving yards, 1 touchdown, 14.4 fantasy points\n\nStills far from stationary against Oakland\n\nKenny Stills, Hou, WR (4 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $17)\n\nMatchup: vs. Oak\n\nVegas Line/Total: Hou -6.5, 50.5\n\nPulled hamstrings might be the most common soft tissue issue to fell NFL players. They\u2019re sapping, slow-healing, prone to re-injury and generally costly. Will Fuller, a man who would find a way to randomly combust making smores, is the latest wide receiver to suffer from the setback. His expected weeks long absence is unfortunate. Houston\u2019s Week 8 matchup, home against Oakland\u2019s skewered secondary, is an ideal blow up spot.\n\nEnter Stills.\n\nThe former Saint/Dolphin, limited by physical derailments of his own this season, could shred harder than Sturgill Simpson on \u201cThe Fastest Horse in Town.\u201d His long-range speed, budding relationship with Deshaun Watson and usability whether in the slot (66.2% of snaps) or outside labels him a matchup problem for the Raiders. Similar to what Marquez Valdes-Scantling achieved last week against Oakland, Stills, who is No. 1 among all WRs in yards per target (15.4), could catch a bomb or three. Slot corner Lamarcus Joyner and peripheral DB Daryl Worley have allowed a combined 103.8 passer rating and 1.33 yards per snap to receivers. Cherry on top, Oakland, as a whole, has given up the fourth-highest aDOT (9.2) to WRs.\n\nFearless Forecast: 4 receptions, 83 receiving yards, 1 touchdown, 16.3 fantasy points\n\nSHOCKER SPECIAL (Under 10% started in Yahoo leagues)\n\nAlexander Mattison, Min, RB (2 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $16)\n\nMatchup: vs. Was\n\nVegas Line/Total: Min -16, 41\n\nIn a place appropriately named Treasure Valley, a prolific football factory lies. It\u2019s steadily churned out NFL ready running backs in recent years \u2014 Doug Martin and Jay Ajayi most notably. Mattison is the latest professionally engineered rusher from Boise to graduate to the next level.\n\nThe sidekick to stud Dalvin Cook, the rookie has performed admirably underneath the incumbent\u2019s shadow. He hasn\u2019t exactly boomed in the box score, but his secondary analytics suggest he possesses ample spark. On 56 grips, he\u2019s blasted his way to 3.16 yards after contact per attempt, forcing a missed tackle on 17.9 percent of those touches. However, he\u2019s notched a lowly 38 percent success rate according to Sharp Football Stats.\n\nThis is the week the Mattison posts princely numbers. Pay attention, bargain shoppers. Yes, it\u2019s #TequilaThursday, a night when the unexpected usually becomes reality, but Washington, which has allowed 4.1 yards per carry, 153.0 total yards per game, six total TDs and the ninth-most fantasy points to RBs, is a predictable opponent. Against a forgiving front that ranks dead last in power-run defense, Mattison and his bruising style should rack chunk gains. He\u2019s FLEX-y sexy at a minimum in 12-team leagues.\n\nFearless Forecast: 9 carries, 56 rushing yards, 1 reception, 7 receiving yards, 1 touchdown, 12.8 fantasy points\n\nBONUS FLAMES (Under 60% started)\n\nQB: Matthew Stafford, Det (Det -7; $32) \u2013 Clearly the best beer chugger among NFC North QBs, Stafford is hardly foamy for fantasy purposes. Quietly QB12 in fantasy points per game, he\u2019s on pace to establish new career benchmarks in pass yards per attempt (8.0) and air yards per attempt (8.6). Many shied away from the passer due to Matt Patricia\u2019s conservative lean, but with Kerryon Johnson very iffy for this week\u2019s matchup, Stafford is a strong candidate to log his fifth multi-TD performance of the season. His opponent, the Giants, have shown improvement defending the pass in recent battles, but, for the most part, they\u2019re an undisciplined army. They\u2019ve surrendered 8.9 pass yards per attempt, 275.1 pass yards per game, 10 total passing TDs and the 11th-most fantasy points to the position. Adding fuel to the Stafford fire, New York slots inside the bottom-eight in aDOT allowed (8.8). Toss the Lion a steak. (FF: 279-3-0-7, 23.9 fpts)\n\nRB: Chase Edmonds, Ari (NO -9.5; $16) \u2013 In hindsight, what Kliff Kingsbury pulled with David Johnson last week in New Jersey was a Richard move, one pulled from the Bill Belichick playbook. Admitting post game DJ was \u201cneed-based\u201d only, Kingsbury dialed up work for Edmonds who delivered sensational numbers \u2014 150 total yards and three scores on an exhaustive 29 touches. As witnessed against the Giants, don\u2019t let the backup\u2019s 5-foot-9, 210-pound fool you. He packs quite the wallop (3.25 YAC/att) despite his diminutive frame. It\u2019s conceivable even if Johnson returns to the lead role, Edmonds has earned more opportunities. New Orleans has stiffened on defense in recent weeks, conceding 3.9 yards per carry and the fourth-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Still, in a game with a healthy total (48) and knowing the Saints have given up 6.1 receptions per contest to rushers, the dynamo oozes with FLEX-y sexiness. (FF: 6-29-4-38-1, 14.7 fpts)\n\nRB: Austin Ekeler, LAC (Chi -4.5; $19) \u2013 On social media channels, outspoken Ekeler proponents have stated their stance clearly \u2014 he\u2019s better than Melvin Gordon. The supportive evidence is mounting. Gordon, still in preseason mode, has lumbered, dragging his way to an uncomfortable amount of minimal gains. On 27 touches he\u2019s managed an embarrassing 2.0 yards after contact per attempt. LA\u2019s No. 26 run-blocking line has exacerbated the situation, but, as it stands, Ekeler is the more explosive RB. In a role reminiscent of Larry Centers, he\u2019s flourished. Operating exclusively as a receiver late against Tennessee, he was nearly un-coverable whether in the slot or outside. He\u2019s a major matchup headache for a dismayed Bears defense, down Akiem Hicks, which has allowed 7.5 receptions and 58 receiving yards per game to RBs. On another 7-9 targets, Ekeler finds the end zone for the fourth time in five games. (FF: 5-18-0, 5-52-1,15.5 fpts)\n\nWR: A.J. Brown, Ten (Ten -2.5; $16) \u2013 Stacking Titans ratchets up the risk on par with consuming a dairy product well past its expiration date, but when your matchup is against Tampa, it\u2019s well worth the possible indigestion. As discussed above, Tanny performed terrifically the past two weeks, taking shots downfield while displaying composure in the pocket. Brown, who reminds one of an unrefined Andre Johnson, is big-bodied target who\u2019s made occasional noise. Among wideouts with at least 20 targets, he ranks top-10 in yards per catch (19.5), RAC per reception (8.57) and yards per target (11.9). In a ripe matchup against Tampa, he could set Hargreaves (120.8 passer rating, 1.64 yards/snap allowed) ablaze. Tampa, as a whole, has coughed up the third-most fantasy points to WRs. (FF: 4-72-1, 15.2 fpts)\n\nTE: Jimmy Graham, GB (GB -4.5; $14) \u2013 Once viewed as an indispensable starter, Graham now has fantasy managers hemming and hawing week-to-week. The accumulated nicks and scrapes may have diminished his dominance, but in these lean TE times, believe it or not, Graham is still a back-end TE1. He\u2019s No. 7 in overall target separation and continues to be a sore thumb for Aaron Rodgers inside the red zone. With the QB playing at a superhuman level, the goal-post dunker is worth plugging in against Kansas City. T.J. Hockenson is the only tight end to cross the chalk versus the Chiefs this year, but the AFC West reps rank inside the top-five in total receptions and yards allowed to the position. With or without Davante Adams in uniform, odds are substantial Rodgers locks, loads and fires at Graham some 5-7 times. (FF: 4-39-1, 11.9 fpts)\n\nDST: Pittsburgh Steelers (Pit -14.5; $21) \u2013 Straight from the \u201cNo (expletive) Sherlock\u201d handbook, the Steelers are this week\u2019s ultimate stream defense. Surging before the bye, they\u2019ve yielded a bumper crop of fantasy points, ranking No. 4 in points per game. In six contests, they accumulated 20 sacks and forced 15 turnovers. Miami surprised last week with Ryan Fitzpatrick back at the helm, but against a team he actually hasn\u2019t played for, the REVENGE GAME! narrative doesn\u2019t apply. Dolphins passers have been sacked 4.0 times per game this season. As a unit, Miami has gifted defenses 13 total turnovers while netting a mere 10.5 points per game. Pittsburgh is pricey, but it\u2019s worth the wallet slap.
