Based on the facts of this case, the primary line defies reality and common sense,\u201d Beard said.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple\u2019s profits outside the Americas.\u201d\n\nBeard dismissed criticism of the 0.005% tax rate paid by Apple\u2019s main Irish unit in 2014, which was cited by the Commission in its decision, saying the regulator was just seeking \u201cheadlines by quoting tiny numbers\u201d.\n\nPaying an average global tax rate of 26%, Apple has said it is the largest taxpayer worldwide and is now paying around 20 billion euros in U.S. taxes on the same profits that the Commission said should have been taxed in Ireland.\n\nIn its current financial quarter, Apple expects revenue of $61-64 billion and a gross margin of 37.5-38.5%.\n\nIreland, whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates, is also challenging the Commission\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cAs Ireland has already emphasized, it undermines legal certainty if state aid measures are used to retrofit changes to national law ... and legal certainty is a key principle of EU law; one upon which businesses depend,\u201d Beard said.\n\n\u201cSome may want to change the international tax system; but that is a tax law issue \u2013 not state aid,\u201d he said.\n\nIreland said it had been the subject of entirely unjustified criticism and that the Apple tax case was due to a mismatch between the Irish and U.S. tax systems.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is displayed at an event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s decision is fundamentally flawed,\u201d Paul Gallagher, lawyer for Ireland, told the court.\n\nLawyers for the Commission will also make their case on Tuesday. The court is expected to rule in the coming months, with the losing party likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years.\n\nThe joint Apple cases are T-778/16 Ireland v Commission and T-892/16 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v Commission.", "description": "The European Union's order for Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14 billion) in back taxes to Ireland \"defies reality and common sense,\" the U.S. company said on Tuesday, as it launched a legal challenge against the 2016 ruling.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430441295&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0QT", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
