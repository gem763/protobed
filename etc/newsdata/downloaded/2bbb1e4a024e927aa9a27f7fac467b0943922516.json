Ben Cardin, second in seniority among Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin always presents himself as tough against the terrorist state of Iran, having been one of only four Democratic senators who voted against the resolution supporting Obama\u2019s deeply flawed 2015 Iran nuclear deal. He loves to lash out at \u201cone of the most nefarious actors on the world stage, playing a destabilizing role across the Middle East and proudly carrying the mantle of the greatest nation-state threat to Israel today.\u201d\n\nBut by the time two years ago that Trump pulled out of the deal, which released $100 billion to Tehran with which to go on a terrorism spree, Cardin had fallen in love with it. He said, \u201cI did not support the agreement, but we want to make sure the agreement is enforced. We don\u2019t want the United States to be the one who walks away from preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon state.\u201d\n\nAnd asked last month on Fox News if there should be a U.S. military response in the event of another attack by Iran on American ally Saudi Arabia, Cardin replied, \u201cThere\u2019s really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but \u2026 It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s like your security guard leaving his gun home because he plans on negotiating with the burglars. Diplomacy can\u2019t work when you rule out the use of force before you even begin bargaining.\n\nEven worse than faux hawk Cardin is his foreign relations committee colleague from Connecticut, Sen. Chris Murphy, who\u2019s been using foreign policy to try to be a star for years. It\u2019s apropos that the website Murphy launched in early 2015 seeking the public\u2019s ideas for the specifics of a progressive foreign policy, ChanceForPeace.org, is now a dead link.\n\nIt must have brought Murphy some online feedback though, since he was in the pages of The Atlantic earlier this month explaining \u201cHow To Make A Progressive Foreign Policy Work.\u201d (We already know how to make a conservative foreign policy work, since it won the Cold War and has prevented Islamist attacks on the homeland since 9/11.)\n\nFaint Faith In Force\n\nThe senator\u2019s theorizing is all about taking options away and weakening America\u2019s hand. \u201cMilitary power can, at most, help set the stage for the necessary political work that must be done, but U.S. military actions have too often become ends in themselves.\u201d Apply this logic to 1930s Nazi Germany; it\u2019s doubtful Murphy would have been on the side of the isolationists as Hitler\u2019s preparations for European conquest kept building.\n\n\u201cAny progressive call for military intervention must be paired with a plan for what comes next,\u201d according to Murphy. But this sounds distinctly Neocon. What comes next is going to be nation building of one kind or another, and isn\u2019t that the left\u2019s rap on the Iraq war, that Bush and Cheney foolishly thought democracy can take instant root in alien soil?\n\nMurphy performs acrobatics when it comes to President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy failures. \u201cThe 2011 American airstrikes in Libya, which led to the toppling of the Gaddafi regime, are a stark example of a well-intended military intervention turning into a massive failure,\u201d he charges, but he twice points the finger at \u201cObama officials,\u201d absolving the judgment of the man we were so often told was the smartest president ever.\n\nLater, we find his party\u2019s 2016 nominee in Murphy\u2019s sights. \u201cSecretary of State Hillary Clinton talked boldly about smart power projection, but by the time she left Foggy Bottom, she was still stuck deploying the same meager smart power tools that she inherited.\u201d\n\nThrough the progressive lens, to \u201claunch a strike,\u201d as in Libya, \u201cin order to prevent mass civilian casualties\u201d is laudable. But then Murphy argues: \u201cSometimes, military restraint, though it may feel unsavory in the face of evil, is still the best policy.\u201d He\u2019s embracing the principle of exercising U.S. force for human rights reasons, removed from defending U.S. interests. But then blaming failure of this misguided approach on the decision to use force in itself. To Murphy, \u201cconfrontations based upon contested values are fights we can be proud of\u201d \u2013 as opposed to, say, fighting specifically to protect the lifeblood of the world\u2019s economies, oil.\n\nInitial U.S. success in Iraq allowed force-backed diplomacy to convince Gaddafi to abandon Libya\u2019s nuclear weapons program, because he worried he\u2019d be next. Obama and Hillary undid a remarkable Bush administration foreign policy achievement \u2013 perhaps because it was exactly that. In other words, out of spite. As Murphy points out, Libya today, eight years later, \u201clies in ruins, thousands are dead, and there is no end in sight for the state of near anarchy wrought by our intervention.\u201d\n\nThe senator might also have pointed out that Libya ended up, and continues to be, an ISIS stronghold that the U.S. continues to have to clean up. But then, incomprehensibly, Murphy\u2019s grand manifesto on a future U.S. foreign policy never mentions ISIS \u2013 or Jihad, or Islam, or the Arabs, or Israel.\n\nMurphy wants more multilateralism, and the extension of U.S. security guarantees to more countries. \u201cWhy spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the world\u2019s largest military if you aren\u2019t willing to extend its security protection when circumstances merit?\u201d But this is like asking: Why should a high-crime city spend a lot to have the country\u2019s largest police force if it isn\u2019t willing to extend its security protection beyond the city limits to other municipalities?\n\nMany Democratic politicians and their expert advisers have never understood deterrence. Because we never fired any of our thousands of atomic weapons during the Cold War does not mean we wasted all those billions of dollars building and deploying nuclear missiles for four decades. They performed their task by being able to annihilate cities on the other side of the world. The same applies to our non-nuclear military abilities today.\n\nLimiting America\u2019s Vital Alliances\n\n\u201cDefense alliances should only include nations that share both our interests and values,\u201d Murphy contends. \u201cThus, progressives should reject any suggestion to extend our security guarantees to nations like Saudi Arabia, and focus instead on countries that have made a full commitment to democracy and rule of law.\u201d Presumably the senator thinks it would be better to let the Saudi royal family be replaced by what a democratic vote in Saudi Arabia would produce: a jihadist regime bent on exporting terrorism to the free world. That will happen if the U.S. turns its back on our severely flawed but vital Saudi ally.\n\nTo Murphy it doesn\u2019t matter because Saudi has crossed \u201ca line so bright (kidnapping and dismembering a journalist under American protection, for instance) that we need to reassess the entire nature of our bilateral relationship.\u201d\n\nLike others on the left, Murphy wants the ways of the Big Government domestic state to replace the Pentagon, with a benevolent, globetrotting bureaucratic army carrying out elected politicians\u2019 schemes. We \u201cmust radically upscale the non-military capabilities of the U.S. national-security apparatus, and employ them aggressively around the world.\u201d And \u201ca national-security budget where we spend 20 times as much money on the military and intelligence agencies as we do on diplomacy, democracy promotion, and smart power\u201d simply won\u2019t do that. According to Murphy, \u201cbuilding up non-military means to project strength is a sound strategy.\u201d\n\nVisiting Afghanistan in 2011, Murphy found U.S. soldiers protecting farmers from the Taliban. Their crop was poppy that they were selling to the Taliban. \u201cWhat those farmers really needed were agricultural advisers to help them grow another crop, and Afghan-speaking political advisers to help them negotiate a d\u00e9tente with the Taliban once the poppy supply disappeared.\u201d Does diplomacy work with terrorists? It\u2019s doubtful Murphy thinks d\u00e9tente should have been our course against the Taliban after 9/11, instead of all-out military force.\n\nHe complains that \u201cWe haven\u2019t developed a hybrid class of diplomat/warriors, despite the general failure of soldiers to do effective diplomacy. That can change, and progressives should lead the effort.\u201d In fact, soldiers are great at diplomacy when they\u2019re victors, or have superior force with authorization to fight standing with them. Ask Sun Tzu.\n\nWe already have our cadets playing \u201cModel United Nations,\u201d inflict lectures from State Department officials on them, and even send them off to work for NGOs in the Third World and to various U.S. embassies before they graduate. It\u2019s truly remarkable how we\u2019ve been doing it all wrong all these centuries and need hybrids to replace soldiers. Somehow the feeble minds of George Washington, Wellington and Churchill didn\u2019t realize this. It took Chris Murphy.\n\nMurphy believes he\u2019s filling a policy vacuum on the eve of an election year. \u201cCritics are not incorrect to point out that the 2020 candidates have not yet sufficiently fleshed out their views of America\u2019s role in a post-Trump world,\u201d he contends.\n\nTranslation: Democrats running for president have no foreign policy. Is Sen. Chris Murphy right? In fact, the \u201cprogressive foreign policy\u201d many of the candidates propose, along with others better known than him on the party\u2019s left, is even more dangerous than his.\n\n\u2014 Written by Thomas McArdle\n\nRead Part 2 of The Empty Absurdity of The Democrats\u2019 Dangerous Foreign Policy Saturday.\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
