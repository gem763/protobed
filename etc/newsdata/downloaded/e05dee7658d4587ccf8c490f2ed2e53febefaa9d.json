Tobagonians love curry crab with dumplings, along with steel pan music, beach picnics, goat racing and partying. At Christmas all the resorts join in the festive fun, while the Bago Carnival' in February is a spirited celebration with calypso music, costumed dancers and yacht races.\n\nBeautiful bays\n\nClose to the main resorts, Pigeon Point and Store Bay present a classic scene of glossy palms, powdery sands and happy families playing in turquoise waters. For something wilder, seek out the tranquil Mount Irvine, Stonehaven or Grand Courlan Bays, where nesting turtles can be seen from March onwards, or head to the quieter Englishman\u2019s bay for a more deserted Robinson Crusoe-style experience. Nearby crescent-shaped Parlatuvier Bay is home to a picturesque fishing village, while on the Atlantic coast at Batteaux Bay you can take a boat trip to see the impressive seabird sanctuary island of Little Tobago.\n\nThe real love island\n\nWith its luxuriant nature, balmy climate and laid-back lifestyle, Tobago is perfect for a romantic winter holiday, be it a honeymoon, renewal of vows, a toes-in-the sand dream wedding or just the chance to grab some quality downtime with your loved one. The island has many enchanting places to stay, such as the beachfront Coco Reef Resort & Spa and the hillside Villas at Stonehaven, while venues for a memorable ceremony include panoramic viewpoints, heritage sites and secluded beaches.\n\nBook by November 12 to secure flights and 7 nights' hotel from \u00a3679pp*, in the British Airways London Gatwick Winter Sun Sale.
