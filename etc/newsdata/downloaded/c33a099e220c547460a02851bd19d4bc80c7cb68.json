Each time he shatters the standard rules of behavior and persists, Trump resets what\u2019s considered acceptable. This makes him a bigger villain to his foes. But he also makes him a bigger hero to his fans.\n\nAs Brian Bennett wrote in Time last spring, Trump\u2019s dexterity at squeezing out of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s trap had the weird effect of inoculating the president from future probes. Like the brassy villain in a movie, Trump has taken everything the established rules of order could throw at him and has not just survived but thrived. If Mueller and his $32 million investigation and saturation press coverage couldn\u2019t bring Trump down, can we really expect a Trump telephone conversation with a foreign president in which he urges the investigation of his political rival\u2019s clan to break the hold he has on his supporters?\u2026\n\nIf Democrats hope to evict Trump from the White House, they\u2019ll have to do better than bang their impeachment pots and pans outside his bedroom window. They\u2019ll have go after his positives and his 2016 campaign promises. Has he made the economy stronger, as he claims? Maybe not. The Federal Reserve Bank just dropped rates to goose an economy feared to be entering a recession. Has he made America safer? More respected? Has he brought China to heel? Built the wall? Locked up Hillary Clinton?", "description": "", "authors": ["Jack Shafer"], "top_image": ""}
