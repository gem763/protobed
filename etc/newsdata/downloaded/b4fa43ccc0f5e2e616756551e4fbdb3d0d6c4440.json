Sometimes you need new management ... to breathe new life into things,\u201d Senard, who was brought in earlier this year from tyre maker Michelin, told a news conference in Paris.\n\nHe said three members of Renault\u2019s 18-strong board abstained in the vote to remove Bollore, who hit out at his looming dismissal in a newspaper interview the night before, calling it a coup.\n\nFollowing Ghosn\u2019s arrest, a feeling of stagnation around joint Renault-Nissan projects, including on issues such as advancing on cost savings, had begun to set in, people at Renault have said. These would now be the first priority, according to a source close to the carmaker.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of concrete matters that have already been identified, including on the industrial front: working on batteries, electric vehicles, connectivity, purchasing and self-driving cars,\u201d the source said.\n\nShares in Renault closed up 5.1%.\n\nNewly-appointed interim Deputy Managing Directors Olivier Murguet and Jose-Vicente de los Mozos, interim CEO Clotilde Delbos and Chairman of Renault SA Jean-Dominique Senart pose before a news conference at French carmaker Renault headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France, October 11, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\n\u2018COUP DE FORCE\u2019\n\nTensions between Renault and Nissan were further inflamed this year, including during various spats over governance reforms, and after a failed deal to pair Renault up with Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), which withdrew a merger offer.\n\nSenard reiterated on Friday that a tie-up with Fiat, which was abandoned in June, was not at present on the agenda.\n\nThe chairman denied there had been pressure from Nissan or from the French state - which has a 15% stake in Renault - to remove Bollore in a kind of quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cIt so happens that Nissan\u2019s governance has shifted. There is no link between the two,\u201d Senard said. \u201cAt no time did anyone from Nissan put the question of Mr Bollore on the table.\u201d\n\nRenault, the dominant partner in the alliance with a 43% stake in Nissan, named two deputies to back up Delbos - top sales executive Olivier Murguet and a senior manufacturing and supply chain chief, Jose-Vicente de los Mozos.\n\nThe triumvirate has echoes of the new top team announced on Tuesday by Nissan.\n\nThe Japanese firm picked Makoto Uchida, previously the head of its Chinese business, to replace Hiroto Saikawa, who stepped down as CEO in September after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.\n\nUchida is known for close ties to Renault, which could help mend fences in the alliance.\n\nSaikawa and Bollore barely spoke and were seen as clear irritants to the relationship between the two companies, French official and company sources told Reuters in June.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nBefore his ouster, Ghosn had been working on a plan for a full merger of Renault and Nissan, but had met resistance in Japan, which is concerned about French government influence in the alliance.\n\nBollore said he had only found out his job could be on the line in a French press report on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe brutality and the totally unexpected character of what is happening are stupefying ... This coup de force is very worrying,\u201d he told Les Echos newspaper on Thursday evening.", "description": "Renault ousted chief executive Thierry Bollore on Friday, as the French carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan <7201.T> seek to rekindle their alliance following the scandal-hit tenure of former alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn.", "authors": ["Gilles Guillaume", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439656684&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0YH", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
