Many Israelis vote for him blindly: \u201cOnly Bibi\u201d is a constant Likud slogan.\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking why he inspires unwavering loyalty, almost addiction. Israeli journalist Matti Friedman opined in The New York Times that Bibi\u2019s success is largely based on the fact that the 1990s wave of Hamas suicide bombings stopped while he was in power:\n\n\u201cWhatever credit the prime minister really deserves for the change, for many voters it\u2019s a good enough reason to keep him in power,\u201d he writes. [\u2026] \u201cThe attacks, which killed hundreds of Israeli civilians, ended hopes for a negotiated peace and destroyed the left, which was in power when the wave began. Any sympathy that the Israeli majority had toward Palestinians evaporated.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

They took place in a climate of toxic right-wing incitement deliberately nurtured by Netanyahu, who participated in a notorious Zion Square rally, or Ra\u2019anana Junction protest against the Oslo Accords where he marched under a coffin bearing the name of former Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin. The protest preceded the murder of Rabin (z\u201dl) by a right-wing fanatic, and Likud\u2019s ascent to power.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Listed third on the Knesset list for Kach (Meir Kahane\u2019s political party, banned in Israel as a terrorist group), and a resident of Kiryat Arba \u2013 a hard-line Hebron settlement \u2013 he determined to end the Oslo peace process, even at the cost of his own life. Yigal Amir, Rabin\u2019s assassin, was similarly motivated, while Binyamin Netanyahu is on record proudly claiming to have deliberately terminated the Oslo Accords.\n\nGoldstein was beaten to death by survivors. His widow would later affirm that he was not crazy, he knew exactly what he was doing: derailing the peace process. That trio of Goldstein, Amir and Bibi succeeded, using extremist, terrorist means, to prevent peace to this day.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Because if over the years the Israeli public had been more fully exposed to their subversion of peace, we might have learned what Dr Abdel Aziz Al-Rantisi, then Hamas\u2019 deputy to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, told Chris Hedges, heading the New York Times Middle East bureau: Hamas was so outraged by the 1994 Hebron massacre that it changed its strategy. It started targeting Israeli civilians.\n\n\u201cWhen Israel stops killing Palestinian civilians, we will stop killing Israeli civilians,\u201d he told [Hedges]. \u201cLook at the numbers. It is we who suffer most. But it is only by striking back, by making Israel feel what we feel, that we will have any hope of protecting our people.\u201d\n\nSo in April 1994, Hamas started targeting civilians, just as Goldstein had. Was it a wise strategy? No. It espoused war crimes, which caused a traumatised deadening of Israeli empathy, making mainstream Israel even less willing to consider peace, co-existence or strategic sacrifice.\n\nHaving watched a bus I almost boarded go up in smoke with multiple deaths recorded, and witnessed at least two other lethal attacks first-hand, one is familiar with boarding a bus and not knowing if it will be the last one. Yet, until we Israelis shift from our comfort zone of blaming others (while claiming unique victimhood), or denial of our share of responsibility or blind faith in those who have subverted peace, we\u2019ll continue to confuse the chicken with the egg.\n\nOnly by delving deeper, questioning that blind adulation of a leader who has led us into the wilderness, shall we better see why \u2013 contrary to populist theses \u2013 voting for Netanyahu does not herald peace, or even long-term quiet.\n\nThat demonic trio \u2013 Goldstein, Amir and Netanyahu, not the Palestinians \u2013 deliberately derailed peace, while Bibi continues to deny Israel and Palestine a viable, democratic future.\n\nNetanyahu may well be indicted in the coming weeks for financial corruption. Yet his political corruption may be his historical legacy, if he continues to bring down The Third Temple that is Israel on all of us. That trajectory cold continue a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and suffering, cultural genocide, land-grab, revenge attacks, de facto annexation and the ghettoisation of Gaza.\n\nAngela Godfrey-Goldstein is an Israeli peace activist and directs Jahalin Solidarity, a non-profit which supports Jahalin Bedouin refugees", "description": "While we Israelis wait to learn if a government is finally forming, or a third election is imminent, it\u2019s timely to reflect on Netanyahu\u2019s populism.
