Following in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President's misconduct.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThe statement was issued by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel and acting Oversight Committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney.\n\nThe White House quickly criticized the resolution, saying it confirms that the inquiry is a \"scam.\" A statement released by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham reads in part, \"The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven't been written. This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration.\"\n\nThough GOP lawmakers had pressed for a vote, they too immediately criticized the measure. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., called it a \"wasted opportunity\" that does not protect due process for the president and does not guarantee the minority party can call witnesses.\n\nDemocrats unveiled the impeachment resolution as an Army lieutenant colonel who listened in on the phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine in July testified behind closed doors.\n\nIn his opening statement, Andrew Vindman stated that he \"did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn the call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's dealings in Ukraine.\n\nBut the top House Republican said Vindman \"is wrong.\"\n\n\"Nothing in that phone call is impeachable,\" Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said. McCarthy said he did not question Vindman's service, but said, \"People have different philosophical beliefs.\"\n\nTrump was also pressing for an investigation into the 2016 election, and McCarthy said that was fine.\n\n\"The president has a right,\" the Republican leader said. \"It's an open case. It wasn't about something in the future. It was about something that transpired.\"\n\nBy a 68% to 28% margin, though, Americans said it is not acceptable for a president to ask a foreign country's leader to help investigate a potential political opponent, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nMcCarthy reiterated his criticism of the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats, as Republicans indicated they are likely to vote to oppose the resolution when it comes to the floor Thursday.\n\n\"You can't put the genie back in the bottle,\" McCarthy said. \"Due process starts from the beginning.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Trump contended that his polls show the impeachment inquiry will lead to the loss of \"many seats in 2020.\"\n\nBut public polls indicate a majority of Americans support the probe, almost two dozen incumbent Republicans have announced they will not run for reelection and GOP allies are voicing concern that 2020 could be a wipeout for Republicans.\n\nThe GOP conference chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said Democrats are \"attempting to put a cloak of legitimacy around this process. It won't work.\"\n\nBut Cheney did speak out against some GOP critics who have questioned the patriotism of Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient who was born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union, and others who have testified.\n\n\"It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation,\" she said, \"and we should not be involved in that process.\"\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., who sits on the Oversight and Intelligence committees, wouldn't comment on specifics of Vindman's testimony. But he said, \"It's no secret that folks on the other side are trying to figure out who the whistleblower is. From my opinion, it seems to be in service of the president's wanting to identify who that person is,and potentially retaliate against him or her. I think that's absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nAsked about Democratic concerns that Republicans are trying to \"out\" the whistleblower through Vindman's testimony, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said, \"We're just trying to get information that we're entitled to.\"\n\nJordan, who is on the Oversight Committee, suggested that Schiff, D-Calif., instructed Vindman not to answer questions about whom he had spoken with. Jordan said knowing whom Vindman communicated with is important information and reiterated: \"I want to get to the truth. I already know the main facts about this, that there was no quid pro quo in the call.\"\n\nThe call, based on the record released by the White House, shows the president asking Zelenskiy if he would \"do us a favor though\" right after Zelenskiy asked about military aid.\n\nAnd diplomat William Taylor said in his deposition last week that Trump ordered a withholding of military aid and a White House meeting until Ukraine's president agreed to publicly state that his government would look into conspiracy theories about the 2016 election and the Bidens.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., would not comment on the substance of Vindman's testimony, but noted that, based on Vindman's opening statement, \"there are some inconsistencies\" between Vindman's statement and the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a major Trump donor.\n\nLynch, a member of the Oversight Committee, said he \"would be surprised if we didn't revisit Mr. Sondland's testimony.\"\n\nLynch called Vindman a \"consummate professional, very honorable, very believable, very precise with his remarks,\" adding that his sympathies lie \"with the United States and with democracy.\"\n\nNPR's Lexie Schapitl and Susan Davis contributed to this story.", "description": "The resolution calls for public hearings and allows President Trump or his lawyers to cross-examine witnesses.
