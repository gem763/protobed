Three committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform \u2013 are focusing their portion of the investigation on Trump\u2019s call July 25 in which he urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden while withholding military aid to that country.\n\nThe committees demanded documents from Giuliani dealing with \"the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression.\"\n\nBut Giuliani's lawyer, Jon Sale, notified Congress by letter that he won't comply. Sale called the inquiry \"unconstitutional, baseless and illegitimate,\" and said the documents are protected by attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, despite the fact that Giuliani doesn't work for the government.\n\n\u201cIf they enforce it, then we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Giuliani told ABC News.\n\nGiuliani tweeted Tuesday that Sale was a lifelong friend, but that he hired him solely to deal with the document request. \"At this time, I do not need a lawyer,\" Giuliani said.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 1, 2018 file photo, Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump, addresses a gathering during a campaign event in Portsmouth, N.H.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said he would comply.\n\nBut White House counsel Pat Cipollone notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Oct. 8 that the administration would refuse to cooperate for lack of a House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. A senior administration official said the Office of Management and Budget will not comply, pursuant to the White House letter.\n\nTrump has described the call with Zelensky as \u201cperfect\u201d and said he is absolutely justified in calling for the investigation of corruption. He has also defended Giuliani. The White House notified Pelosi on Oct. 8 that the administration would refuse to comply with the House investigation that Trump contends is partisan and unconstitutional, for lack of a House vote to authorize the inquiry.\n\nThe subpoena deadline coincided with a private deposition for George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of State. Giuliani had criticized Kent in May during an interview with a Ukrainian news website by claiming without evidence that the diplomat was working with liberal philanthropist George Soros to find \u201cdirty information\u201d on Trump campaign officials. Kent previously served as deputy chief of mission in Kyiv and spent years working on anti-corruption efforts across Europe.\n\nGiuliani had told a Ukrainian journalist that Trump removed Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, \"because she was part of the efforts against the president.\" Giuliani further targeted Yovanovitch in a packet of \"disinformation\" that he gave to State Department officials earlier this year. The dossier was full of debunked allegations and political smears targeting the president\u2019s perceived enemies, and it eventually made its way to lawmakers leading the impeachment probe. Giuliani tweeted Monday that Yovanovitch was \"a real problem.\"\n\nYovanovitch testified privately to the three committees Friday.\n\nThe deadline came nearly a week after the Oct. 9 arrest of two Giuliani associates, Ukrainian-born Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman of Belarus, business partners who were charged with campaign-finance violations. Parnas and Fruman were charged with showering contributions on Republican campaign committees, including $325,000 in May 2018 for a political-action committee that supports Trump\u2019s re-election, while allegedly hiding the source of the money.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, defied a congressional subpoena Tuesday in the impeachment inquiry dealing with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3YC7pn1ij4b226w5H5ilgw--~B/aD0xODQzO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/e6ce12087342e57e2ca9407966ad8448", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
