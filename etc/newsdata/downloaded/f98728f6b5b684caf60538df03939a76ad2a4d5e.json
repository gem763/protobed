It is unclear how many prisoners Trump was referring to or where those prisoners were being placed.\n\nOfficials told the Times that only two British detainees from the cell known as \"The Beatles\" were taken into US custody.\n\nAccording to the Times, hundreds of Islamic State sympathisers were also able to escape a low-security detention camp in the region as Kurdish forces guarding the facility pivoted to fend off the Turkish attack, marking a concerning shift in the region.\n\nOne camp in Ain Issa, a town located in the former ISIS stronghold of Raqqa just 20 miles from the Turkish border, was left completely unguarded on Sunday as Turkish forces pounded Kurdish positions with airstrikes and ground advances, an administrator of the camp told the Times.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Sunday that the remaining 1,000 US troops in northern Syria would be withdrawn, but US officials told The Daily Beast they will just be moved further away from the advancing Turkish forces. A Turkish airstrike nearly hit a small group of US soldiers stationed in Syria on Friday.\n\nObservers have noted that the US withdrawal may pave the way for an ISIS resurgence in the region. A US official told CNN on Sunday that the chaos on the ground in Syria means the US campaign to defeat the Islamic State in the country is \"over for now,\" as ISIS was revived and \"with nearly 100,000 [people] who will rejoin their jihad.\"\n\nThe official said, in their opinion, that \"US policy has failed.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has turned hawkish as the US has retreated, overseeing key military captures along the border that have taken some Kurdish control.\n\nTrump on Sunday night claimed again that the US had taken custody of \"the worst of the ISIS prisoners.\"\n\n\"Turkey and the Kurds must not let them escape. Europe should have taken them back after numerous requests. They should do it now. They will never come to, or be allowed in, the United States!\" he said in a tweet.\n\nKat Tenbarge contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump last week claimed that the US had moved some of the \"most dangerous\" ISIS prisoners but US officials told The New York Times that wasn't true.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2838/e2a3be9f4879441ca75e659b3288a6ca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
