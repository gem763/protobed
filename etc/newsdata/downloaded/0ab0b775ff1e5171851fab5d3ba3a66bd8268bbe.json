Organizers have cancelled Saturday's demonstration after failing to secure a permit.\n\nLau, who is also a former member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, spoke to As It Happens guest host Helen Mann about the arrests. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on hearing Joshua Wong's [comments after he was released from jail]?\n\nThis cannot go on. We need to de-escalate. But instead what you've seen happening in the last few hours was more arrests. So far, three legislators have been arrested, apart from all the younger people earlier in the day. So what is [Hong Kong Chief Executive] Carrie Lam trying to do? Is she really trying to blow up Hong Kong?\n\nHong Kong activist Joshua Wong said he will not surrender even after he was arrested, charged with organizing an illegal protest and later released on bail. 0:44\n\nActivists have been arrested [in Hong Kong] before. What is different today?\n\nThey have arrested three legislators ... and maybe more as we speak.\n\nSo it seems like the government's going crazy. Instead of going down the road of trying to have reconciliation dialogue, they just want to arrest more and more people and to make the community more and more tense and want to fight. And that is so crazy.\n\nDon't provoke the Hong Kong people like that. They don't like it.\n\nYou are a former legislator yourself. It's one thing, I suppose, for them to be arresting activists \u2014 but for the rest of the legislators, what do you think is going on?\n\nI think it is serious. Of course, you look at the weeks of unrest \u2014 many people did many things. And if they really want to, they can go in and arrest thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people. But is that the way to help Hong Kong out of the current crisis?\n\nMany people want to march to mark the 31st of August \u2014 five years [since] Beijing made this stupid decision not allowing us to have democratic reforms. And the police have already banned \u2026 the marches.\n\n[But] even the religious groups, they are threatening to march tomorrow. And so are they going to arrest the priests, and the nuns, and so on? This is unbearable.\n\nProtesters shout at police in Sham Shui Po on Friday in Hong Kong. (Billy H.C.

And, of course, they are also looking at the Oct. 1 celebration of the foundation of 70 years of the People's Republic of China, when President Xi Jinping will have a big show in Beijing. And he certainly does not want anything happening in Hong Kong to overshadow his show.\n\nSo Carrie Lam is under pressure to try to quiet things down, but she's doing exactly the opposite. What she did [Friday] is completely counterproductive.\n\nBut doesn't Carrie Lam require the support of Beijing to carry out any really meaningful dialogue? If they don't want to effect any change, if they don't want to actually put anything on the table with these demonstrators, is there any point in sitting down with them?\n\nYou may say, \"Oh, Beijing is very tough.\" Which is true. But she is Hong Kong's chief executive. She has to stand up and tell Beijing, \"Now, this is good for Beijing. Let's have a dialogue.\"\n\nAnd if she can't do it, then she should threaten to resign and just leave. She can just walk out.\n\nBut Carrie Lam is seen as is hand selected by Beijing. Has she ever in the past shown any indication that she's willing to stand up to the government?\n\nYou're absolutely right.\n\nSo we are really in a bind, and I think the Hong Kong people \u2026 can't stand it anymore.\n\nArresting people preemptively before sensitive dates is not uncommon in Mainland China. We see that yearly before the anniversary of Tiananmen Square in June. But how common is this kind of arrest [before a sensitive date] that we're seeing with Joshua Wong, with Agnes Chow, and others in Hong Kong?\n\nIt's not common at all. It's not something we know of. That's why it's terrible. That's why people say \"one country, two systems\" is finished. We are one country, one system.\n\nWill you be on the street on Saturday?\n\nYeah. Many of my friends, we are all messaging each other. We are going to be there. And let's see how many thousands or hundreds of thousands they are going to arrest.\n\nWritten by Allie Jayne with files from Reuters. Interview produced by Allie Jaynes and Jeanne Armstrong.
