Mr Feuerherdt's ascension to the role was revealed by The Australian Financial Review late on Monday.\n\nMr Feuerherdt will own about 2.6 per cent of the enlarged SeaLink after the transaction is finalised.\n\nMr Ellison said he had known Mr Feuerherdt for four years and he was an ideal person to take over.\n\n\"I've got enormous respect for him and he is an absolute gun,'' Mr Ellison said.\n\nThe two had come into close contact in 2015 when SeaLink bought Transit Systems Marine, which operates passenger ferry and barge services in south-east Queensland and Gladstone for $125 million.\n\nMr Ellison said the duo at that time had thought about the future potential of putting SeaLink and Transit Systems together, but that that point it was more of an idea than anything concrete.\n\nThe bus services operated by Transit Systems in Australia provided solid and consistent income. The overall business generated revenue of $895 million in 2018-19 and earnings before interets and tax of $61 million on a pro-forma basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransit Systems chairman Neil Smith will join the SeaLink board after the acquisition is completed.\n\nSeaLink is buying Transit Systems for an enterprise value of $635 million, plus an earn-out component of up to $63 million.\n\nIt is raising $154 million in a placement and rights issue, while $269 million of SeaLink scrip will be issued to the vendors of Transit Systems as part of the deal.\n\nSeaLink expects to pull out between $4 million to $4.6 million in synergies by combining the two companies.\n\nTransit Systems expanded into London in 2013 with the acquisition of the London operations of FirstGroup Plc, and then headed to Singapore in 2015 by winning a tender for the Bulim bus contract, and became the first international operator of public bus services in Sinagpore.\n\nMr Feuerherdt said there was ''significant opportunity'' for the combined group to target integrated multi-modal passenger transport contracts across the public and private sectors.\n\nSeaLink runs Captain Cook Cruises on Sydney Harbour and commuter ferry services on the waterways of Sydney, ferries to tourism hot spot Kangaroo Island off South Australia, and a range of ferry services and tourism operations in Queensland, including Kingfisher Bay Resort on Fraser Island.\n\nSealink stock last traded at $3.91 on Friday before a trading halt ahead of the deal.\n\nIt has drifted lower from $4.29 a year ago because of softer trading conditions in some of its tourist ferry operations and a slowdown in the number of Chinese tourists arriving in Australia.\n\nBut the company has generated almost a fourfold increase in share price value since listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2013 with an issue price of $1.10.\n\nTransit Systems operates brands including Swan Transit in Perth and Torrens Transit in Adelaide. Torrens Tansit runs about 700 buses and has a staff of 1200 people after the South Australian government privatised a large portion of Adelaide's bus services in 2000.", "description": "The $635m acquisition of bus group Transit Systems gives SeaLink a springboard for international expansion, and delivers bigger scale locally.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3154%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_14%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b1c7316396a8d3bca7126d4e8b1c735e595fb922", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
