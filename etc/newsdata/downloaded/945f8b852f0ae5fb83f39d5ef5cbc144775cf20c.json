However, the market left off on Friday in a precarious spot and is likely to continue to move lower when it resumes on Monday. The S&P 500 trend has changed and has shifted lower, and that means the index may continue to decline towards 2965 or as low as 2940 to start this week.\n\nS&P 500 Index Chart\n\nNASDAQ ( )\n\nWe can see the NASDAQ also struggled to regain positive momentum on Friday, failing at resistance around 8,110.\n\nNASDAQ Composite Index Chart\n\nStocks\n\nBoeing (NYSE: )\n\nBoeing fell apart on Friday, and it will put additional pressure on the company when they report results this week. The chart looks broken, and as I said to a subscriber mid-week, the stock looks like it could fall to $320. That was before Friday\u2019s sell-off.\n\nBoeing Co Chart\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: )\n\nJohnson and Johnson has a ton headline risk now, and if the stock falls below $ 126.50, a move to $122 seems likely. But after $122 could mean a drop to $111.\n\nJohnson and Johnson Daily Chart\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: )\n\nTesla has been rising steadily, but it has been unable to rise above $267 so far. It needs to rise above that level to push towards $300. I think this week it breaks out and that big push higher begins.\n\nTesla Inc Daily Chart\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE: )\n\nVerizon closed at its highest price since the year 2000, and now maybe heading to a record high at not seen since 1999.\n\nVerizon Weekly Chart\n\nApple (NASDAQ: )\n\nSo much for Apple falling as I thought. Now it seems to be getting ready for its push to $242.\n\nApple Daily Chart\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: )\n\nNetflix tested and is holding the break out at $273, the trend higher continues with the stock pushing back to $320 this week.\n\nNetflix Daily Chart\n\nRoku (NASDAQ: )\n\nRoku got back to and failed at resistance around $143. I think the stock continues to fall, dropping back to $122.\n\nRoku Inc Daily Chart\n\nOkta (NASDAQ: )\n\nThe chart for OKTA does not look good, with a chance to push even lower towards $87.25.\n\nOKTA Daily Chart\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ: )\n\nZscaler has to hold $42.70, or else $34.75 seems possible.\n\nZscaler Daily Chart\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Michael Kramer covering: Boeing Co, SPDR S&P 500, Invesco QQQ Trust, Apple Inc.
