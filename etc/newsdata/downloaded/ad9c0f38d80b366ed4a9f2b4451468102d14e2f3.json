And there could be tensions between a nominee and senators who do not back their proposals.\n\nAnother factor is the race for the Senate. Some Democrats think it will be easier to win races in conservative-leaning states such as Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia if Biden is their nominee and not Warren or Sanders.", "description": "", "authors": ["The Hill", "Thehill.Com Homenews Senate"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
