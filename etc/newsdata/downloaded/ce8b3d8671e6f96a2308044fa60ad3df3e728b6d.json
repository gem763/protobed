(Image via News on 6)\n\nAlexis Wilson was working an afternoon shift at the local Pizza Inn in McAlester, Okla., on Sunday, when she pulled a co-worker aside to boast about her new gun.\n\nThe slight 18-year-old with large brown eyes clutched her iPhone and pressed play on a video of her shooting a newly purchased AK-47, according to an incident report. Then Wilson told the other teenage waitress how much she resented the people at her old school \u2014 allegedly adding that she wanted to \u201cshoot 400 people for fun.\u201d\n\nThe chilling conversation shook Wilson\u2019s co-worker. She reported it to a manager, who called the McAlester police.\n\nOn Monday, the Pittsburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Wilson was charged with a felony for making a terrorist threat against McAlester High School.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s times, you can\u2019t say stuff like that,\u201d Pittsburg County Sheriff Chris Morris told KTUL. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it serious and investigate it to the fullest extent and make an arrest if possible because we do not want any of our schools getting shot up \u2014 nobody does.\u201d\n\nWilson has pleaded not guilty. Her lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe 5-foot-7, baby-faced teenager is an anomaly as a female suspect allegedly plotting a mass shooting, but police described her as a serious threat.\n\nThe high school she allegedly targeted had suspended her once for bringing a knife to school and again for displaying swastikas on her personal belongings, a school resource officer told the sheriff\u2019s office. Her booking photo shows Wilson wearing a T-shirt referencing \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook,\u201d a 1971 book advocating for violent civil disobedience that has been found among the belongings of school shooters. On Facebook, Wilson had liked a documentary about the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.\n\n\u201cA female can pull the trigger just as easily as a male,\u201d Morris told KTUL Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s rare, it\u2019s different. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s been a female accused of this.\u201d\n\n\n\nPittsburg County Sheriff Chris Morris said Alexis Wilson was arrested Monday after investigators saw a video of her shooting an AK-47 and her co-workers reported she had said she would \"shoot up\" a high school. (Pittsburg County Sheriff's Office via AP)\n\nFemale school shooters are far more rare than their male counterparts, but not unheard of. One of the most well-known was 16-year-old Brenda Spencer, who opened fire on an elementary school in 1979 through the window of her home, killing two adults and injuring eight children and one police officer. Spencer became infamous for the motive she offered a reporter who phoned her during the attack: \u201cI don\u2019t like Mondays,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cThis livens up the day.\u201d\n\nAfter Wilson\u2019s shift at the pizza shop ended on Monday, Sergeant Micah Stites and Deputy Matthew Jordan knocked on Wilson\u2019s front door. Wilson agreed to talk, police said.\n\nShe denied showing her co-worker a video of her shooting the AK-47, but admitted she had talked about the gun and had showed off photos of her posing with it. She played videos of her shooting the rifle for Stites and Jordan, police said. During the interview, Wilson appeared nervous to the sheriff\u2019s officers. Her voice shook and she jumped from topic to topic mid-sentence, they said.\n\nThe young woman told Jordan she had \u201cdisturbing and criminal-like things\u201d on the phone. She said she was bullied at McAlester High School.\n\nAfter she had been suspended in her freshman year, she said she completed a program at Thunderbird, a military academy in Oklahoma that advertises itself as an alternative option to public school. She said she tried to re-enroll at McAlester High afterward, but she hadn\u2019t been allowed to start classes this fall. Wilson explained the alleged threat by saying she had been trying to convince her co-worker that \u201cnot everyone that owns a gun is a bad person,\u201d the police report said.\n\n\u201cShe said that she would never shoot up a school or people,\u201d Jordan wrote in his report, \u201cand that her co-worker must have taken what she said wrong.\u201d\n\nStites and Jordan collected an iPhone with a purple case, an AK-47 with six magazines and a 12-gauge shotgun with a stock sleeve for extra shells from Wilson\u2019s bedroom.\n\nAt the end of the police interview, Wilson told the officers that she used to feel \u201csuicidal and borderline homicidal\u201d toward her classmates at McAlester High because of the bullying she faced. Jordan asked her if she thought about hurting anyone at the school.\n\n\u201cNot recently, but she has in the past,\u201d the report says.\n\nWilson\u2019s mother, Sonya Smith, said her daughter is innocent at Monday afternoon\u2019s arraignment hearing, the McAlester News-Capital reported. She told sheriff\u2019s deputies that she knew about her daughter\u2019s guns, but \u201cdidn\u2019t think anything of it\u201d because Wilson had long been a marksman and hunter.\n\nThe school district\u2019s superintendent, Randy Hughes, said McAlester High would be open on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in scary times when we have to worry about the safety of our children in school,\u201d Hughes said in a statement.", "description": "Police found an AK-47 with six magazines and a 12-gauge shotgun with a stock sleeve filled with extra shells in Alexis Wilson's bedroom.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
