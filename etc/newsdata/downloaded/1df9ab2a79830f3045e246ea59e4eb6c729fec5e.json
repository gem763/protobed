Especially without replacing him and Serge Aurier is struggling.'\n\nTrippier is clearly pleased they did decide to part ways, saying earlier this month that he really didn't even have to think twice when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nTrippier is relishing the chance to work with Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone\n\nMeanwhile Mauricio Pochettino has been watching his side struggle this season\n\n'Obviously I was very excited when I first signed here,' he told BT Sport.\n\n'I know a lot about Atletico through watching them over the years. Obviously, the coaching staff; Cholo (Simeone), the way he sets his team up and you can just see from the outside that the players work so hard for the manger. And I wanted to be a part of this.\n\n'I've always wanted to play abroad just to experience something different, and the time was now. It was a great opportunity for me to come to such a big club. Champions League football, the players that I've got here. It's just an amazing club and I've seen how close everybody is at Atletico and I'm happy to be a part of it.\n\n'To be honest, when Atletico were interested, I didn't have to think twice. I spoke to a few people back at Tottenham about the opportunity to play in Spain, in La Liga, and to come to Atletico, I jumped straight at it.'\n\nThe right back's good form has seen him recalled to the England side this season\n\nThe full back couldn't have hoped for a better start, his performances also his earning him an England recall at the expense of Kyle Walker.\n\nHe started both games of the international break just gone, Gareth Southgate picking him ahead of even the in-form Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTrippier's former club, meanwhile, sit ninth in the Premier League and have won just three of their opening 10 games in all competitions.\n\nPochettino insisted he has no regrets over losing the player last month.\n\n'In football, decisions happen and players move from one club to another,' he said. 'We need to move on.'\n\nBut with Trippier flourishing in Spain while Spurs flounder back at home, it is hard not to look back.", "description": "Kieran Trippier made a low-profile exit after playing the full 90 minutes of June's Champions League final defeat, the club happy to let him go and fans largely indifferent about the decision.", "authors": ["Spencer Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19792356-0-image-a-4_1571236733757.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
