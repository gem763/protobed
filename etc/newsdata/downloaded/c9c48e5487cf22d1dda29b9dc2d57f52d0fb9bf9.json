And she realized she can\u2019t count on Screen Time to keep her kids off their phones. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t work, and that\u2019s really frustrating.\"\n\nKids are outsmarting an army of engineers from Cupertino, Apple\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley. And Apple, which introduced Screen Time a year ago in response to pressure to address phone overuse by kids, has been slow to make fixes to its software that would close these loopholes. It\u2019s causing some parents to raise questions about Apple\u2019s commitment to safeguarding kids from harmful content and smartphone addiction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Screen Time blocks an app from working, it becomes grayed out, and clicking on it does nothing unless parents approve a request for more time. Or at least it\u2019s supposed to work that way.\n\nEverywhere from Reddit to YouTube, kids are sharing tips and tricks that allow them to circumvent Screen Time. They download special software that can exploit Apple security flaws, disabling Screen Time or cracking their parents\u2019 passwords. They search for bugs that make it easy to keep using their phones, unbeknown to parents, like changing the time to trick the system, or using iMessage to watch YouTube videos.\n\n\u201cThese are not rocket science, backdoor, dark web sort of hacks,\u201d says Chris McKenna, founder of the Internet safety group Protect Young Eyes. \u201cIt blows me away that Apple hasn\u2019t thought through the fact that a persistent middle school boy or girl can bang around and find them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcKenna said he\u2019s miffed that Apple doesn\u2019t fix the loopholes faster, despite its size, its massive hoard of cash and its copious profits. \u201cIn one day, I\u2019m confident Apple could clean up all these loopholes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recently posted a list of loopholes, which he informed Apple of when Screen Time first launched, that he has been compiling in an effort to warn parents and help them close them when possible.\n\nApple spokeswoman Michele Wyman, in an emailed statement, said the company is \u201ccommitted to providing our users with powerful tools to manage their iOS devices and are always working to make them even better.\u201d Wyman did not comment on specific bugs and workarounds in Screen Time or the speed with which Apple addresses them.\n\nAD\n\nThe problem has bedeviled parents who have struggled to strike a balance between allowing smartphone access for school work and basic social interaction and protecting their kids from the pitfalls of the mobile world.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think there will always be ways that really innovative, critical-thinking children get around the controls,\u201d said Christine Elgersma, senior editor of parent education for Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization focused on how kids use media and technology. \u201cThey\u2019re usually ahead of us technologically.\u201d\n\nCompanies with wildly popular and profitable consumer products don\u2019t usually offer tools to help people use them less.\n\nBut in early 2018, a pair of major shareholders urged Apple\u2019s board of directors to do something about youth screen addiction, arguing that addressing the issue would be good for Apple\u2019s bottom line in the long run.\n\nAD\n\nNine months later, Apple launched Screen Time as part of iOS 12. It gave parents the ability to lock down their kids\u2019 iPhones and iPads, limiting the amount of time kids could spend using the device overall as well as in individual apps. Google offers a suite of similar \u201cDigital Wellbeing\u201d tools, and Amazon has a kids-only subscription service called FreeTime that comes pre-installed on its kids edition tablets. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nAlmost immediately, kids started finding ways to get around the controls, the same way they might look for a way to sneak out of the house while the parents are sleeping.\n\nAnd parents started reporting their kids were circumventing the newly added Screen Time restrictions. A widely publicized Reddit post, \u201cMy kid managed to pass Screen time limit,\u201d accumulated more than 400 comments. On that post, parents reported their kids deleting and reinstalling apps and changing the clock to avoid time restrictions, and using the iMessage app to watch prohibited YouTube videos. And on Apple\u2019s own discussion board, there were titles such as \u201cChild \u2018hacked\u2019 screen time limits on iOS12. Will Apple fix?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut more than six months later, some parents were still reporting their kids using the same bugs, such as the time change workaround. Some weren\u2019t fixed until the new operating system, iOS 13, was launched a year later. Others, like the ability to watch YouTube videos inside iMessage, still work on the latest Apple phones and the most recent updates.\n\nAD\n\nOn forums hosted on Apple\u2019s website, parents can be seen complaining for months about the same issues and the lack of response from Apple. After the community was unable to help them with their Screen Time glitches, at least two parents were offered a nontechnical solution: punishing their kids for exploiting the bug.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are ways, such as enforcing consequences, to manage my children\u2019s usage without software help,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cHowever I am not seeking parenting advice, but reporting a limitation of the software which claims to perform a function that it does not.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome parents struggle because the Screen Time controls aren\u2019t intuitive, tucked several layers deep into menus under Apple\u2019s settings. And the default settings are often permissive, such as allowing adult websites unless a parent specifically blocks them.\n\nAD\n\nThe problem has turned Brian Walker, a 41-year-old sales engineer for an automotive supplier in Michigan, into a part-time detective. Walker has seven kids, three of whom have cellphones. To keep track of what they\u2019re up to, he and his wife use myriad tools to monitor them. But despite his vigilance, the recidivism in his household is high.\n\nA few weeks ago, Walker noticed his 13-year-old son sitting quietly on the couch in the basement for hours, a long time for a kid who is \u201ckind of X-Gamish\u201d and likes to be outside. \u201cI was suspicious because there\u2019s a handful of apps where he will literally just melt his brain,\u201d Walker said. When he walked over to check, he saw his son using TikTok, an app he thought was blocked.\n\nAD\n\nIt turns out that because the phone was a hand-me-down from an older sister who was allowed to use that app, the 13-year-old was also able to download it and use it, despite the Screen Time restrictions. \u201cEven with an electrical engineering background, there are still things I don\u2019t understand about how the software works,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAD\n\nAdam Pletter, a child psychologist who specializes in screen addiction, said the danger for parents who use Apple\u2019s service is that it can lull them into a false sense of security.\n\nParents can use alternative apps to control their kids\u2019 smartphone usage, but those services don\u2019t have the same access to Apple\u2019s operating system that Screen Time enjoys, and Apple has been criticized for limiting their functionality.\n\nAD\n\nApple\u2019s treatment of third-party screen time apps has come under scrutiny from congressional antitrust investigators, who last month requested information from Apple on the subject.\n\nWhen Helen Glaze, vacationing with her kids in New York, discovered they had hacked their phone, she confiscated it, and they confessed to their methods: While Screen Time blocked YouTube videos in Safari, the kids found that if they expanded the video to full screen before the Screen Time limit kicked in, they could watch videos continuously.\n\nAD\n\nShe eventually gave them back their phone, and Glaze is still using Screen Time. But she\u2019s stopped thinking she has any way to truly control her kids\u2019 smartphone usage. \u201cI\u2019m not going to engage in the cat-and-mouse game,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to trust them to use their best judgment to know what we expect from them as kids and as people.\u201d\n\nRebecca Shelp, a stay-at-home mom in Littleton, Col., bought her 14-year-old son a used iPhone 7 in April and set up Screen Time to limit his use of social media and other apps. But her son figured out workarounds almost immediately. By Memorial Day, he simply reset the phone, set up a new Apple ID and used whatever he wanted for as long as he wanted.\n\nShelp found out when she inspected his phone. She hadn\u2019t realized that Screen Time didn\u2019t block kids from simply resetting the phone.\n\nBut the subterfuge didn\u2019t end there. She says her son figured out how to make Screen Time glitch out by turning the phone off and on constantly until it stopped working properly. Her son even coined a term for this: \u201ccolliding the system.\u201d\n\nLast month, while her son was at a sleepover, Shelp was monitoring his usage on her phone. The timer kept jumping wildly, from two hours to seven hours and back. Her conclusion: He must be \u201ccolliding the system\u201d again.", "description": "Apple\u2019s Screen Time is meant to give customers a way to control their kids\u2019 devices, but intrepid youngsters have exploited bugs and workarounds.", "authors": ["Reed Albergotti", "Reporter Covering Consumer Electronics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6im3SY2w7qCpfN8Tj7AFbwkrJfY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AM4WUDXOUMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
