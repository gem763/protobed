This summer, Age UK warned that a record number of over 65s are not getting the care they need as increasing numbers are \u201cat far greater risk of not eating enough and of falling and hurting themselves\u201d. The charity warned that the care system was on the brink of \u201ccollapse\u201d.\n\nHowever in response to the latest NHS Digital figures, elderly care charities said that this problem would only get worse.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said: \u201cThe fact that the numbers of older people are increasing but 40,000 fewer are receiving long term care means that the system is becoming even meaner and leaving more in need to fend for themselves.", "description": "Elderly people are being left to \u201cfend for themselves\u201d, a charity has warned, as 40,000 fewer pensioners are receiving council care despite rising demand.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Charlotte Runcie", "Jan Etherington", "Philip Johnston", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/05/26/care-home_2492567b-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpJliwavx4coWFCaEkEsb3kvxIt-lGGWCWqwLa_RXJU8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
