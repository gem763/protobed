[JOINT PRESS CORPS]\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in rallied support for an expansionary fiscal policy, calling for more spending in areas like construction as Korea struggles to deal with a slowing economy.\u201cThe government has so far focused on preventing the economy from rapidly shrinking through an active fiscal policy and creating conditions for a rebound,\u201d said Moon, presiding over a senior government meeting on the economy on Thursday at the Central Government Complex in Seoul. \u201cThese efforts need to increase.\u201dMoon\u2019s comments lend support to the government\u2019s proposal for an expansionary budget next year of 513.5 trillion won ($433.5 billion), a 9.3 percent rise from this year.\u201cThe government has focused on construction investment that improves people\u2019s living conditions,\u201d said Moon, highlighting more spending next year toward the so-called social overhead capital (SOC) projects such as public infrastructure. \u201cWe will continue this direction and expand needed construction investment.\u201dThe government plans to spend 22.3 trillion won on SOC projects next year, a 12.9 percent hike from this year.Moon asked for support from the legislative body, which has recently ground to a halt due to a disagreement over reforms to the prosecution.\u201cWe desperately need the cooperation from the National Assembly,\u201d said Moon. \u201cIt would be great help if the National Assembly passes legislation to improve the people\u2019s lives and provide support in vitalizing the private sector.\u201dThe remarks came as Moon attended the government meeting for the first time this year.The meeting is usually presided over by Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki, who is currently in the United States for the Group of 20, World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings.Moon\u2019s unexpected appearance highlighted the urgency of the economic situation.Exports last month fell 11.7 percent from the previous year, a 10th consecutive month of on-year declines, affected by the U.S.-China trade conflict.Korea also faces challenges on the domestic front as it recorded negative inflation for the first time ever in September, heightening worries of deflation.Overseas institutions have downgraded Korea\u2019s economic growth for this year far below the government target range of 2.4 and 2.5 percent.The IMF recently revised Korea\u2019s growth forecast this year to 2.0 percent from its earlier forecast of 2.6 percent, while downgrading global economic growth by 0.3 percentage points to 3 percent.\u201cThe global economy is expected to record the lowest growth rate since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009,\u201d explained Moon. \u201cCountries that have a high overseas reliance [\u2026] like Korea can only be greatly impacted by such a situation.\u201dThe president asked for patience on government policies, highlighting recent improvements in job figures.\u201cTime is needed for government policies to take effect,\u201d said Moon. \u201cThere were difficulties to the jobs policy, however, after the government\u2019s consistence effort [\u2026] employment improvements are becoming clearer.\u201dLast month\u2019s employment rate was the highest for the month since data began to be recorded in its current form, at 61.5 percent, while the unemployment rate dropped 0.5 percentage points down to 3.1 percent from the previous year.Moon recognized the limitations to job market improvements such as losses to the manufacturing sector and said the government should focus its efforts on such areas.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/17203547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
