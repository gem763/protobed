The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% has seen its sharpest rise since 2013.\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75%-2%. That will be the second rate cut of the summer.\n\nTalk of an emergency half a percentage point cut has died down given signs U.S. economic growth is stable and inflation picking up.\n\nThe quarter-point cut will be a \u201cyawner.\u201d What will be more interesting is if the Fed gives clues about what comes next, said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe market has priced in another quarter-point cut at the Fed\u2019s December meeting, according the the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what economists and investors will be watching for when the Fed concludes the two -day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nWill there be a clear signal of another rate cut this year?\n\nEconomists are divided on this. The best place for a signal of another cut would be in the \u201cdot plot\u201d where Fed officials give their own individual estimates for where the benchmark rate should be.\n\nBut for the median dot to show another rate cut, many Fed officials will have to dramatically lower their own rate projections. That\u2019s a big ask as eight Fed officials didn\u2019t even project one rate cut in June.\n\nScott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, said he expects the dot plot to project another quarter point cut in 2019.\n\nIf the dot plot doesn\u2019t project more easing, the task might fall to Powell to leave the door open for another cut when he talks to reporters.\n\nPress conference\n\nIn general, Powell is expected to stick to his July message that the Fed is on a \u201cmoderate\u201d easing path, said David Wilcox, a former top Fed staffer and now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Powell used the phrase \u201cmid-course correction\u201d in July but might scrap it. Whatever words he chooses, the Fed chairman is trying to communicate the economy isn\u2019t in the throes of a recession where the central bank has to use \u201cevery piece of artillery in its arsenal,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nHow many dissenters will there be?\n\nThe good economic data and the rising bond yields may make only a small majority in favor of a rate hike. Four regional Fed presidents objected to the cut in rates in July. Two presidents - Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, were voters and dissented. They will do so again in September, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Economists don\u2019t think there will be a dissent in favor of a half-point cut, although St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had urged the committee to cut aggressively.", "description": "Here are 3 things to watch at next week\u2019s Fed interest-rate committee meeting.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR285_powell_ZG_20190913124635.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
