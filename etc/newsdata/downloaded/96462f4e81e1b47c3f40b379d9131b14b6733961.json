In May, he underwent surgery after breaking his hip while preparing to go turkey hunting at his home.\n\nCarter commented on the fall at the Habitat for Humanity event, explaining, \"First of all, I want to explain my black eye. I got up this morning at home in Plains, getting ready to go to church, 'cause right after that we had a family reunion, and then we were coming to Nashville. And I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge, and had to go to the hospital.\"\n\n\"They put 14 stitches in my forehead and my eye is black as you noticed,\" he added.\n\nScott Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nHe said he had no plans to miss the charity event, though: \"I had a No. 1 priority, and that was to come to Nashville to build houses.\"\n\nCarter was also diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in his liver in 2015 that had spread to his brain. Carter announced about six months after the diagnosis that he no longer needed cancer treatment.\n\nHe turned 95 on Monday. He has already lived longer than any other president in U.S. history.\n\nCarter served as governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and then defeated Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election. He would serve just one term, however, losing to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 race. He also faced a tough fight from the left in the form of Ted Kennedy.\n\nHe was defeated in a landslide, 489-49 in the electoral college, and carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe former president left politics after losing his reelection bid and threw himself into charity work. He started the Carter Center in that pursuit and has been the leading face of Habitat for Humanity for decades.\n\nHe has been married to wife Rosalynn for 73 years,", "description": "Former President Jimmy Carter fell at his Georgia home on Sunday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jimmy-carter-gty-er-191006_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
