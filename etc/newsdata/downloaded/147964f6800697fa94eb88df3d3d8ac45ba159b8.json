Giuliani\u2019s machinations and opposed halting aid to Ukraine. That was a telltale sign that Bolton, an adept government infighter with strong media ties, was likely behind some of the revelations.\n\nFast forward to Monday\u2019s testimony before House lawmakers from Fiona Hill, formerly the National Security Council\u2019s top Russia expert who reported to Bolton. The Post reports:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a closed-door session that lasted roughly 10 hours, Hill told lawmakers that she confronted Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, about Giuliani\u2019s activities which, she testified, were not coordinated with the officials responsible for carrying out U.S. foreign policy, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of her deposition.\n\nIn what surely will be long-remembered phrases, she reportedly testified that Bolton had called Giuliani a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d and had declared \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and [acting chief of staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d Aside from adding some colorful commentary to the Giuliani-Trump skullduggery, Bolton\u2019s reported statements confirm that pressure on Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was not part of official U.S. policy (i.e. was a personal/partisan matter Trump delegated to his fix-it guy) and that Bolton recognized it was inappropriate, if not illegal.\n\nBolton very likely will be called to testify. As other witnesses have done, he might be able to substantiate that the decision to hold up aid (was this the \u201cdrug deal\u201d to which he reportedly referred?), once again, contradicted U.S. policy that sought to encourage anti-corruption measures, and not to encourage the current government to manufacture dirt on Trump\u2019s political opponent nor to cooperate in Trump\u2019s delusional conspiracy theory that Russia had not really interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nBolton also might be able to testify, as Hill apparently did, to a critical meeting. The Post recounts:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBolton and Sondland met in early July with then-special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, Hill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. During the meeting, Sondland\u2019s agenda for Ukraine began to become clear, when he blurted out to the other officials present that there were \u201cinvestigations that were dropped that need to be started up again,\u201d according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden \u2014 something that made Bolton go \u201cballistic\u201d after the meeting, the official said.\n\nThe willingness of former Trump aides (Kurt Volker, Bolton, Hill, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s former senior aide Michael McKinley) to testify to key events over the objections of bogus White House claims of executive privilege allow the impeachment investigators to begin piecing together a consistent, well-documented account of Trump\u2019s efforts to go around government officials to act in ways contrary to U.S. interests (e.g., holding up aid that Ukraine needed to protect itself from Russia) to serve his own political ends. Once a couple of aides came forward to testify, others have felt emboldened to speak out as well.\n\nNow, let\u2019s not treat Bolton as a hero. He did not direct Hill (nor go himself) to the FBI to report on Giuliani\u2019s conduct. He did not leave his post until weeks later. He has not publicly accused Trump of wrongdoing nor attested to his temperamental and intellectual unfitness. However, all of that may yet happen.\n\nBolton has the rare opportunity to settle personal scores with Trump, Giuliani and the White House partisans; clear himself of legal wrongdoing; and save the country from a president who is the pawn of sweet-talking dictators who can appeal to Trump\u2019s overweening vanity. A chance like that doesn\u2019t come around more than once in a career.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The ex-national security adviser is no hero, but he could be a heck of a witness.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0aPTN-Ol9M24VVzKArIkLTNR2Vk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G7YAVHHKAYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
