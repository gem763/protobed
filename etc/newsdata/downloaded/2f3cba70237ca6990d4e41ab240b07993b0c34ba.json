All three of the major U.S. averages turned lower on the news.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nEarlier Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office exempted several big-ticket items produced in China from tariffs, a development that may boost the odds of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing.\n\nThe exemptions on more than 400 Chinese goods -- including large items such as motorcycles, parts for rail cars and certain solar panels as well as smaller merchandise from dog leashes and harnesses to electrical tape and power tools -- are seen as a way of gutting the tariffs without completely removing them, and have boosted spirits for the deputy-level talks that are underway in Washington before higher-level discussions.\n\n\u201cThe big show is when Liu He, the chief negotiator for China, sits down with Bob Lightheizer sometime in the next couple weeks,\u201d Peter Navarro, assistant to President Trump, told \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d\n\nThe two sides had moved closer to a deal in the spring when negotiations collapsed and the White House blamed China for backing away from key provisions.\n\n\u201cI think the issue is going to be where the negotiations will start from,\" Navarro said. \"Will they start from where they left off when China reneged on the 150-page deal or not?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeither the U.S. Trade Representative nor industry trade groups immediately responded to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe three sets of exclusions from 25 percent tariffs include:\n\n310 items from List 1, which covered $34 billion worth of goods\n\n89 items from List 2, which covered $16 billion worth of goods\n\n38 items from List 3, which covered $200 billion worth of goods\n\nFriday morning's announcement was the latest de-escalation of the trade war that has seen the U.S. and China slap tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of one another\u2019s goods, and comes as the two sides have returned to the negotiating table.\n\nLast week, President Trump announced that tariff increases scheduled to hit $250 billion worth of Chinese goods on Oct. 1 will be delayed until Oct. 15 out of respect for 70th-anniversary celebrations in the People's Republic of China.\n\nBeijing reciprocated the goodwill gesture by exempting U.S. soybeans and pork from additional tariffs.\n\nLast month, Trump said the U.S. would delay tariffs on some goods until Dec. 15 as to not disrupt the holiday shopping season.\n\nFOX Business' Edward Lawrence contributed to this report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Trade talks between the U.S. and China are progressing.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/Trump20Xi20Jinping20in20China20201720AP20FBN-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
