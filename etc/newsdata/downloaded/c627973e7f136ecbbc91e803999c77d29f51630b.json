Others got plasma from similarly lazy mice.\n\nResults showed the former group performed better on tests of memory and learning, had more new brain cells and less inflammation.\n\nFurther experiments pinpointed a specific protein that the academics believe could be responsible \u2013 at least, partly \u2013 for the benefits.\n\nA follow-up study on 20 people with mild cognitive impairment found their endurance levels rose in line with a spike in clusterin.\n\nHowever, experts in the field warned it is too early to speculate about an 'exercise-in-a-pill' therapy based on the findings.\n\nProfessor Richard Farragher, of the University of Brighton, told the New Scientist it 'might be hoping for too much' for such a drug.\n\nHowever, he joked: 'I love the idea personally, because I've always hated running, and now I can get somebody to do it for me.'\n\nAnd Professor Farragher said a treatment based on clusterin could still offer benefits to people who struggle to exercise, such as arthritis patients.\n\nThe findings have yet to be published in a journal. They appear on bioRxiv, a database for pre-prints of studies.\n\nThe NHS recommends people get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity such as running or playing sports, every week.\n\nA major study published in the British Medical Journal in March this year estimated inactivity is killing 70,000 people in the UK every year.\n\nExperts warn Britain runs on a 'sitting-based economy' in which the vast majority of working adults spend their days bound to a desk.", "description": "Scientists at Stanford University in California gave one group of rodents run access to a running wheel in their cage for a month.
