Clashes erupted in the city centre with Mayor Felipe Alessandri describing the situation as chaotic.\n\nMore than 300 people have been arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, police said.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Demonstrators clashed with security forces in the capital, Santiago\n\nSpeaking on television, Mr Pi\u00f1era, whose response to the protests has been criticised, said he had listened \"with humility\" to \"the voice of my compatriots\" and to discontent over the cost of living.\n\nGen Javier Iturriaga del Campo, who is in charge of security in Santiago under the state of emergency, said a curfew would be enforced between 22:00 and 07:00 (01:00-10:00 GMT) in the city and outlying areas.\n\nThe military is due to help police patrol the streets during a declared 15-day state of emergency that allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly.\n\nEarlier, cultural and sporting events were cancelled and shops remained closed. The city's underground system will remain shut down until Monday, with 41 of 136 stations vandalised.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Protesters continued on Saturday despite the military deployment\n\nProtests were also reported in the cities of Concepci\u00f3n, Rancagua, Punta Arenas, Valpara\u00edso, Iquique, Antofagasta, Quillota and Talca, according to El Mercurio newspaper.\n\nMeanwhile, a picture of President Pi\u00f1era in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed in Santiago was heavily criticised on social media.\n\nCritics said the image, reportedly during a birthday celebration for the president's grandson, were emblematic of a leader out of touch with ordinary Chileans.", "description": "Security forces and demonstrators clash in Santiago where a curfew will be enforced overnight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rjqxs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
