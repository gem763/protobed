Her sentence could range from five years to life in prison under Texas law.\n\nThe jury took a matter of hours to convict Guyger, 31, after six days of testimony.\n\nCheers erupted in the courthouse as the verdict was announced, and someone yelled \"Thank you, Jesus!\" In the hallway outside the courtroom, a crowd celebrated and chanted \"black lives matter.\" When the prosecutors walked into the hall, they broke into cheers.\n\nAfter the verdict was read, Guyger sat alone, weeping, at the defense table.\n\nJean's friends and family later testified to explain how his death has affected them. First on the stand was Allison Jean, who said her son was killed just before he was due to turn 27.\n\n\"My life has not been the same. It's just been like a roller coaster. I can't sleep, I cannot eat. It's just been the most terrible time for me,\" she said.\n\nBotham Jean's sister, Allisa Findley, told the jury that she and her mother cry a lot, her formerly \"bubbly\" younger brother has retreated as if into a shell, and that her father is \"not the same.\"\n\n\"It's like the light behind his eyes is off,\" Findley said.\n\nShe said her children are now afraid of police.\n\nProsecutors also submitted text messages \u2014 accepted as evidence over defense objections \u2014 that indicated Guyger lacks sensitivity toward black people. In one, she suggests participants at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Dallas could be persuaded to go home with the use of physical violence and pepper spray. In a message sent to Guyger's phone, the messenger suggests she would like a German shepherd because the dog is racist. Guyger declares that she hates \"everything and everyone but y'all.\"\n\nGuyger's defense attorneys can argue that she deserves a light sentence because she acted out of sudden fear and confusion. The judge is expected to provide guidance on sentencing law.\n\nIt is unclear how long the punishment phase of the trial will last. Testimony will resume Wednesday.\n\nThe basic facts of the unusual shooting were not in dispute throughout the trial. After a long shift at work and still in uniform, Guyger walked up to Jean's apartment \u2014 which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third \u2014 and found the door unlocked. Thinking the apartment was her own, she drew her service weapon and entered.\n\nJean, an accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, had been eating a bowl of ice cream when Guyger entered his home and shot him.\n\nThe shooting drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\n\"This is a huge victory, not only for the family of Botham Jean, but this is a victory for black people in America,\" said Lee Merritt, one of the lawyers for Jean's family. \"It's a signal that the tide is going to change here. Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions, and we believe that will begin to change policing culture around the world.\"\n\nThe jury that convicted Guyger was largely made up of women and people of color.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, also representing the family, credited the makeup of the jury for Tuesday's conviction, and said he expects them to deliver a weighty sentence.\n\n\"I look at this jury. And I look at the diversity of this jury,\" he said. \"They will see past all the technical, intellectual justifications for an unjustifiable killing. And I believe they will do the right thing.\"\n\nDallas Police Association President Mike Mata declined to comment Tuesday afternoon, saying Guyger's lawyers asked him to wait until after sentencing. The group, which represents city police officers, has paid for Guyger's legal defense and security.\n\nThe verdict may have defused tensions that began simmering Monday when jurors were told they could consider whether Guyger had a right to use deadly force under a Texas law known as the castle doctrine \u2014 even though she wasn't in her own home.", "description": "A white former Dallas police officer who shot her black unarmed neighbor to death after, she said, mistaking his apartment for her own was convicted of murder Tuesday in a verdict that prompted tears of relief from his family and chants of \"Black Lives Matter\" from a crowd outside the courtroom", "authors": ["Jake Bleiberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MhoXqyGGyODu7n.ZNsviZg--~B/aD00MjE4O3c9NjE4MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/c414b004fb27ff1750316ac52c2dc7be", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
