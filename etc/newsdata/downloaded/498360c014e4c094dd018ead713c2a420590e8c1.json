Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cI was awake the whole time. I was never unconscious, I just couldn\u2019t move, but I was still talking and everything,\u201d said Bausby, who was put on a backboard and taken off by a cart after a collision with linebacker Alexander Johnson in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe doc said I would be fine, and I just trusted him. After 30 minutes, I was able to wiggle my toes, and after a couple hours I gained full mobility. So I was straight, I was fine.\u201d\n\nBausby was taken to the Los Angeles Trauma Center, but after several tests, he was cleared and allowed to fly home with the team Sunday evening. KUSA-TV in Denver reported that the team will place Bausby on injured reserve and will sign veteran cornerback Coty Sensabaugh.\n\n\u2014New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold will start Sunday against the visiting Dallas Cowboys. Team doctors cleared the second-year signal-caller to return to action following a month-long bout with mononucleosis.\n\nDarnold, 22, passed for 175 yards and a touchdown in the season-opening 17-16 loss to Buffalo, but missed the last three games.\n\n\u2014Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton won\u2019t make the trip to London for Sunday\u2019s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nCoach Ron Rivera confirmed that Newton will remain inactive for the fourth straight weekend with a Lisfranc injury in his left foot. The Panthers have a bye in Week 7, delaying the former MVP\u2019s earliest potential return date to Oct. 27 at San Francisco.\n\n\u2014Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jaylen Samuels will be sidelined for a month following arthroscopic surgery on his knee, coach Mike Tomlin announced.\n\nSamuels, 23, underwent the procedure on Monday and was seen on crutches at the team\u2019s practice facility on Tuesday. In five games this season, Samuels has rushed for 50 yards and a touchdown, caught 13 passes for 83 yards and completed 4 of 5 passes for 35 yards and a pick.\n\n\u2014Tomlin told reporters he\u2019s not concerned with rumors about the Washington Redskins\u2019 interest in hiring him as their next head coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that, to be quite honest with you,\u201d Tomlin said at his press conference. \u201cYou were the first person to mention it to me in a public setting.\u201d\n\n\u2014New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley is unlikely to play Thursday night against the New England Patriots, ESPN reported. Barkley later said that no decision has been made.\n\nBarkley missed the past two games with a right high ankle sprain, but returned to practice last week.\n\n\u2014Indianapolis Colts linebacker Darius Leonard announced on Instagram he\u2019s been cleared from concussion protocol. Leonard won\u2019t play this week because the Colts have a bye, but he is expected to suit up for a Week 7 home game against the Houston Texans.\n\n\u2014Veteran safety Johnathan Cyprien\u2019s tenure with the Atlanta Falcons lasted just one game, as the team placed him on injured reserve due to an undisclosed injury. Cyprien, who missed all of 2018 with a torn ACL, was acquired from Philadelphia on Sept. 30 in a trade that sent linebacker Duke Riley to the Eagles.\n\nThe Falcons also signed cornerback D.J. White off the Eagles\u2019 practice squad and signed offensive lineman John Wetzel to the active roster.\n\n\u2014Denver Broncos quarterback Drew Lock shed the brace on his right thumb and is throwing again as he recovers from a preseason sprain that landed him on injured reserve.\n\n\u2014The Oakland Raiders officially acquired Buffalo Bills wide receiver Zay Jones for a 2021 fifth-round draft pick.\n\n\u2014Raiders defensive end Arden Key is expected to miss significant time after sustaining a patellar tendon strain Sunday.\n\n\u2014The 49ers reportedly will be without fullback Kyle Juszczyk for several weeks due to a sprained left MCL sustained Monday night.\n\n\u2014The Tennessee Titans signed kicker Cody Parkey and running backs Rod Smith and Dalyn Dawkins. Parkey replaces Cairo Santos, who was released after missing four field-goal attempts Sunday.\n\n\u2014The Kansas City Chiefs agreed to terms with veteran defensive tackle Terrell McClain, multiple media outlets reported. ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported Kansas City also will sign veteran offensive lineman Stefan Wisniewski.\n\n\u2014Rob Gronkowski came out of retirement Tuesday, sort of. The former Patriots tight end will put on a headset instead of a helmet as he joins the FOX Sports roster as an NFL analyst, beginning with an appearance on the Thursday night pregame show before New England faces the New York Giants.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Denver Broncos cornerback De'Vante Bausby told reporters Tuesday he couldn't move for 30 minutes after a collision with a teammate Sunday during a road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438656913&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9801R-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
