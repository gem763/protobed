He was noncommittal on whether he would order U.S. military retaliation.\n\nAt a news conference, Saudi military spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki said the attack Saturday that did heavy damage to the heart of the Saudi oil industry was \"launched from the north and was unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\" Yemen is south of Saudi Arabia, while Iran and Iraq lie to the north.\n\nAl-Malki stopped short of accusing Iran of actually firing the weapons itself or launching them from Iranian territory.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to the Saudi-led war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nAt the news conference, the Saudis displayed broken and burned drones and pieces of a cruise missile that Al-Malki identified as Iranian weapons collected after the attack. He also played surveillance video that he said showed a drone coming in from the north.\n\nEighteen drones and seven cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Al-Malki said, with three missiles failing to make their targets. He said the cruise missiles had a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), meaning they could not have been fired from inside Yemen.\n\n\"This is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian object and facilities infrastructure,\" Al-Malki said, referring to Iran's Revolutionary Guard. He added: \"This attack did not originate from Yemen, despite Iran's best effort to make it appear so.\"\n\nPompeo, who landed in Saudi Arabia shortly after the news conference, took a harder line, telling reporters: \"The Saudis were the nation that was attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly.\"\n\nHe said en route to Saudi Arabia that \"it doesn't matter\" whether the Houthis claim they were behind the attack. \"This was an Iranian attack,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't change the fingerprints of the ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply,\" Pompeo said, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe attack came after a summer of heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. over Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nIran sent a note to the U.S. via Swiss diplomats Monday, reiterating that Tehran denies involvement in the aerial attack, the country's state-run IRNA news agency reported. The Swiss have looked after American interests in Iran for decades.\n\n\"If any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran's answer immediately,\" IRNA quoted the note as saying. It added that Iran's response wouldn't be limited to the source of the threat.\n\nThe U.S. State Department had no comment on the warning.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, tweeted: \"I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!\"\n\nHe did not elaborate, and it was not immediately clear what further means are available since he has already cut deeply into Iran's oil market. National Security Council officials declined to comment.\n\nIRNA also reported that Iran's delegation to the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting has yet to receive the necessary U.S. visas. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to travel to New York on Friday, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani following on Monday.\n\nThe U.N. meeting had been considered as an opportunity for direct talks between Rouhani and Trump.\n\nAsked in Los Angeles whether Rouhani will come to New York, Trump said, \"I really don't know. If it was up to me, I'd let them come.\"\n\n\"I've always felt the United Nations is very important,\" he added. \"I think it's got tremendous potential. I don't think it's ever lived up to the potential it has. But I would certainly not want to keep people out if they want to come.\"", "description": "Iran, which has denied involvement in the attack, warned the U.S. it will retaliate immediately if it is targeted.
