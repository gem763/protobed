That same year, she starred in her famous Calvin Klein jeans campaign, which was shot and directed by photographer Richard Avedon.\n\nAlthough she has always been lauded for her beauty, she admitted she has only recently started to embrace her looks.\n\n'What's interesting about it now as a 54-year-old, I'm now starting to celebrate my body in a way that I never felt free to do it as a kid,' she said.\n\n'I think that when there's such scrutiny, and there's so much attention paid to the physical, I just shut down. So instead I kind of avoided it and threw myself into my studies.'\n\nTeen model: Brooke is still known for her controversial Calvin Klein jeans campaign, which was shot and directed by photographer Richard Avedon in 1980 when she was just a teenager\n\nIn 1983, she famously put her modeling career on hold to attend Princeton University, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in romance languages.\n\nBrooke has since overcome the body issues that plagued her as a child, and her Instagram page is filled with a mix of fresh-faced selfies, swimsuit shots, and throwback photos from her early modeling days.\n\nAs someone who has grown up in the spotlight, she knows a thing or two about beauty, and later on in the interview, she showed Dr. Oz how she uses healing balm such as petroleum jelly to keep her skin and hair moisturized.\n\n'Always, from the time I was a little girl, would just put on my eyebrows, so it keeps them sculpted,' she said as she rubbed the balm on her brows.\n\nHealthy diet: Brooke walked Dr. Oz through her anti-aging tips and tricks during the segment\n\nDrugstore find: The actress demonstrated how she uses drugstore healing balm to keep her face dewy, the ends of her hair moisturized, and her brows in place\n\n'Where would you put it on me?' the host asked. 'Fix this face. This face needs help.'\n\nGeneric tub: Brooke didn't specify what brand she uses, but there are plenty of inexpensive balms on the market\n\nBrooke patted some balm under his eyes, explaining: 'It's good for moisture, especially if you have to fly. I would do a little here.'\n\nShe went on to demonstrate how she will sometimes rub the balm in her hands and run it through her long locks.\n\n'I'll get the ends because I get dead ends. But it's not greasy as much as it's a balm that is multi-purpose,' she said, adding that it is good for conditioning your eyelashes as well.\n\nAlthough she didn't specify what brand she uses, there are plenty of inexpensive balms on the market. A 13-ounce tub of Vaseline costs less than $5 while a 3.5-ounce jar of Aquaphor Healing Ointment retails for $7.\n\nConfident: Brooke, who turned 54 in May, said she has just started celebrating her body in a way that she never felt free to do when she was younger\n\nProud: Brooke showed off her incredible figure this summer by posing a few swimsuit photos of herself\n\nCandid: The star said she has never had any work done to her face, but she has gotten into a fat-eliminating procedure called 'warm sculpting'\n\n'What a nice little hack,' Dr. Oz said.\n\n'Yes, it's just a good little conditioner,' his guest agreed.\n\nDuring an appearance on Watch What Happens Live last month, Brooke denied ever getting work done on her famous face, though she admitted she isn't opposed to the idea.\n\n'I'm afraid of it, but I also want to do everything I can to just look my best and feel my best,' she explained, noting that she'd gotten into a fat-eliminating procedure called 'warm sculpting.'\n\n'It's like, I work out so much, and yet I still have little s**t from my babies,' she confessed, referring to her daughters Grier, 13, and Rowan, 16. 'My babies ruined everything.'\n\nThe mother-of-two revealed her daughters have actually encouraged her to undergo a procedure or two.\n\nBrooke said her kids told her, 'You really need a little something here,' while gesturing at her face. 'I'm like, 'Goddamnit, no, I'm an icon, damn it.'", "description": "Brooke appeared\u00a0on The Dr. Oz Show on Monday, where she shared her secret weapons for looking and feeling young.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19409938-0-image-a-28_1570474452970.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
