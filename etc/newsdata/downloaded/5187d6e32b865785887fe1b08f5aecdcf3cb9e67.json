The GOP is defending a single-seat majority in the 40-member Senate and a three-seat margin in the 100-member House of Delegates. Both chambers have one vacant seat.\n\nA Democratic sweep would put Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s recent gun-control proposals back in play, while putting his party in charge ahead of political redistricting after the 2020 census. Republicans are trying to retain divided government in the state to block Democrats\u2019 efforts on firearms and other issues.\n\nRelated A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading the 2020 candidate field, but when it comes to voter enthusiasm, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is on top. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why that difference illustrates the big question for the Democratic race.

The GOP candidate is focused on issues he says are key to a growing region\u2014including transportation and school funding\u2014but also worries about a Democratic majority passing legislation that he says would boost business regulations and hurt the state economically.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the local issues are paramount in importance, but you have to look beyond that,\u201d Mr. Higgins said. \u201cAnd definitely I am concerned about the Senate rolling over to the Democrats.\u201d\n\nRepublican candidate Geary Higgins canvassed with staffers and volunteers in Chantilly, Va., on Thursday.

Breaking through in November would hand the party a new trifecta state\u2014meaning control of both branches of the Legislature and governor\u2019s office\u2014while further chipping away at the GOP\u2019s sizable advantage in statehouses around the U.S.\n\nVirginia has turned increasingly Democratic, driven by population growth near Washington. Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the state in 2016 by 5.3 percentage points. Last year, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine coasted to re-election, and Democrats picked up a majority of the 11 U.S. House seats.\n\nDemocrats are competing for more seats in both Virginia chambers this fall, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. They are getting help from a 2018 federal court ruling that found boundaries in 11 House districts were racially gerrymandered, causing more than two dozen to be redrawn, said Christopher Newport University political scientist Quentin Kidd.\n\nTurnout will be key. \u201cI see an uptick in Republican engagement. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s enough to counteract that level of Democratic enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Kidd said.\n\nDemocrats promise swift policy changes if they prevail. \u201cDay One, we\u2019re going to pass common-sense gun restrictions, we\u2019re going to raise the minimum wage,\u201d said Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic former governor who has assumed a high profile on the campaign trail, months after Mr. Northam faced calls to resign when a racist photo from his medical-school yearbook page surfaced in February.\n\nThe state Republican Party is warning about the consequences of a Democratic takeover in the state capital, Richmond. \u201cRight away, taxes would go up, right-to-work law would probably become history nearly instantaneously, abortion laws would basically go to New York or California levels,\u201d said state GOP Executive Director John Findlay. \u201cAnd then gun rights would also be severely curtailed.\u201d\n\nMr. Northam proposed several new gun laws, including universal background checks and bans on high-capacity magazines, after the Virginia Beach shooting. He called a special session, but Republican majorities in both chambers quickly adjourned without considering any measures, opting instead to direct the Virginia State Crime Commission to conduct a review.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think Virginians will vote in the coming election? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe gun debate has galvanized national players on both sides. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group backed by Michael Bloomberg, said it plans to spend $2.5 million to help Democrats such as Mr. Bell flip the General Assembly. The Virginia-based National Rifle Association donated $200,000 to a GOP political-action committee, and the group says it is working to mobilize members to oppose gun-control measures.\n\nRepublicans are focused on many of the freshmen Democrats who rode the 2017 wave into office. \u201cThere\u2019s still a clear path to majority in the House on the Republican side,\u201d said Mr. Findlay.\n\nIn the state Senate, Democratic incumbents are defending just four seats against GOP opponents, compared with 15 Republican-held districts where Democrats are running. A departing Republican in Northern Virginia created the open Senate race in that district, which stretches from semirural farmland to dense suburbs west of Washington.\n\nRepublican voter Bryan Elliott, 60, told Higgins campaign staffer Rob Middleton he could count on his support because he shares the candidate\u2019s conservative views. But independent Bruce McMillan, 64, an information security engineer, said he would probably vote for Mr. Bell as a protest against President Trump.\n\nMike Ruttle, 49, an IT project manager, said he backs Mr. Higgins because he hopes divided power will push both parties toward nuanced solutions. \u201cWhere do we find reasonable approaches to solving real problems?\u201d he asked.\n\nWrite to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com and Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com", "description": "Democrats are making a push to win control of both houses of Virginia\u2019s legislature in this fall\u2019s election, reviving the governor\u2019s gun-control efforts and positioning them for the next wave of redistricting.", "authors": ["Scott Calvert", "Jon Kamp", "Jon.Kamp Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109024/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
