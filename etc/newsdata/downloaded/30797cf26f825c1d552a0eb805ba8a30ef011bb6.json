A federal appeals court previously ruled the appointments were not constitutional because the Senate didn't confirm them.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued the lower court's ruling \u201csimultaneously imperiled Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery from the worst fiscal crisis in its history and cast substantial doubt on the constitutionality of territorial self-governance.\u201d\n\nMexico border shooting: The Supreme Court will in the fall decide whether families of Mexican teenagers who were fatally shot by American border agents in Texas and Arizona can sue in U.S. courts for damages, per the AP.\n\nSCOTUS heard arguments Hernandez v. Mesa in February 2017, sending the case back to a lower court for further proceedings. At the time, the Trump administration argued the teenager's location of death \u2014 in Mexico \u2014 should result in the dismissal of the case, saying the right to sue \u201cshould not be extended to aliens injured abroad.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act: Legal challenges by Republicans against the ACA, which the court upheld in 2012 and 2015, are likely to reach the high court again.\n\nLast year, a Texas federal judge struck down the entire ACA. The case is playing out at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\nResults of this year's other major cases\n\n2020 citizenship question: The court temporarily froze the Trump administration's decision to add a controversial citizenship question to the 2020 census in June, causing the administration to print the census without the question.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross defended his decision to add the question, saying he acted solely at the request of the Justice Department to enhance the Voting Rights Act.\n\n2 federal judges who ruled against Ross in January said his reasoning lacks a factual basis and would unconstitutionally suppress census responses from non-citizens.\n\nApple iPhone app pricing: The court allowed a massive antitrust lawsuit against Apple to move forward in May.\n\nThe suit alleges the company has built an illegal monopoly on the sale of applications for the smartphone, by being the sole distributor of iPhone apps and taking a 30% cut.\n\n\"The ruling could impact a broad range of digital marketplaces, not just Apple's,\" Axios' Ina Fried notes. Those marketplaces could possibly be exposed to monopoly concerns brought by the people who buy products on them.\n\nPartisan gerrymandering: In a move that will allow gerrymandering to get even more aggressive, the court said in June that cases about partisan gerrymandering are \"beyond the reach of the federal courts\" \u2014 a blow to voting-rights activists and Democrats.\n\nThe ruling will make it harder for minority parties to retake the reins of power \u2014 even in wave elections.\n\nDouble jeopardy: The court decided in June not to overrule its long-standing decision that sometimes allows criminal defendants to be prosecuted twice for the same crimes \u2014 by allowing them to be prosecuted in state and federal court.\n\nThis case, unrelated to Trump, ultimately affects his ability to pardon people like former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was sentenced to 7.5 years in March for crimes uncovered in the Mueller probe.\n\nGo deeper: In the Supreme Court, it's all been building to this", "description": "Abortion law, LGBTQ workplace discrimination and DACA are on the docket.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/JgZLbIwtrQvuBV-IOSXXsfXceB8=/0x0:6720x3780/1920x1080/2019/10/05/1570306467616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-23"}
