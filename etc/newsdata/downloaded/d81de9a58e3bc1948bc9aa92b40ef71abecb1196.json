French President Emmanuel Macron. Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, the federalist femme fatale. Even Luxembourg\u2019s Xavier Bettel, that doughy ball of puppy fat who had rudely blanked the PM only last month.\n\nThe very people who only recently were insisting no new Brexit deal was available, were now queuing to touch Johnson\u2019s cloak as if he was a latter-day prophet.\n\nAnd what a love-in it was.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, center, is greeted by Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels. There were smiles all round as Mr Johnson worked towards a Brexit deal\n\nMr Johnson (second from right) salutes French President Emmanuel Macron (right) upon their arrival for a round table meeting as part of a European Union summit at European Union Headquarters in Brussels\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson (centre) reacts to a greeting from Hungarian President Viktor Orban as Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar (right) looks on\n\nMr Johnson, pictured with Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel to the left of him, insisted 'now is the moment to get Brexit done' after he signed off the blueprint, which deletes the Irish backstop\n\nMr Johnson chatted happily with Angela Merkel (right) and Leo Varadkar (second from right) as they gathered to start the summit at the council HQ\n\nImages of Mr Johnson on Thursday were in stark contrast to Mrs May at an EU summit in 2016 (pictured). May appeared to have been given the cold shoulder by fellow leaders at the event in Brussels\n\nSo brimming with testosterone was the European Commission, we could have been peering into the communal showers at a local rugby club.\n\nIn the centre of this congratulatory melee: Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, revelling in the scene of his greatest triumph.\n\nHe\u2019d done it. Don\u2019t ask how, but he\u2019d done it. Amid the sycophantic melee, Boris shot a toothy grin. \u2018Victoire,\u2019 it seemed to say, \u2018est \u00e0 moi!\u2019\n\nThe honour of formally announcing a deal was afforded to Jean-Claude Juncker, who for once actually appeared statesmanlike.\n\nThe Luxembourger, so often the unwelcome court jester in these situations, shuffled toward the podium inside the European Commission and produced from his inside pocket a sheet of paper. Carefully unfolding it, he eyeballed his audience, smacked his lips and announced in that Gauloises-tinged croak: \u2018We \u2019ave a deal.\u2019 Johnson stood beside him, apple-cheeked, smiling awkwardly, shifting his weight excitedly from foot to foot.\n\nHe resembled a bashful schoolboy on prize-giving day waiting to be crowned victor ludorum.\n\nDid those slightly startled eyes shield a certain smugness? Certainement.\n\nBut then think of all those naysayers who told him this could never be done.\n\nThink of those white-flag wavers who insisted Brussels would never even re-open Theresa May\u2019s original withdrawal agreement let alone change it. What utter drips they now look.\n\nAll is forgiven: Luxembourg's prime minister Xavier Bettel mocked Boris Johnson by 'empty chairing' the PM at a joint press conference last month (left), but the pair seemed to have buried the hatchet as they laughed together yesterday (right)\n\nBoris Johnson poses with French President Emmanuel Macron, who appears to give a thumbs up during the crunch EU summit\n\nBoris Johnson and Mr Macron shaking hands and appearing in good spirits at the crunch EU summit on Thursday\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured centre) arrives at a summit of European Union leaders, with German chancellor Angela Merkel with her back to camera on the right\n\nA smiling Boris Johnson (pictured centre) speaks with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (left) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel\n\nThe PM next to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel at a very successful summit for Mr Johnson who has secured a new deal\n\nA buoyed Mr Johnson speaks with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured centre right, and other European leaders on Thursday\n\nJuncker rhapsodised for a while about the deal. \u2018A testament to our commitment to finding solutions,\u2019 was how he described it. No barbs, no smart alec remarks.\n\nPerhaps I am looking at Monsieur Juncker in a more a generous light now a deal\u2019s seemingly in the bag but he looked in better nick than he had in recent months.\n\nHis gait was steadier than normal and his suiting hung baggily around the shoulders. It is possible he has shed a few pounds \u2013 sorry, kilos \u2013 in recent weeks. Perhaps his colleague Donald Tusk decided to padlock the drinks cabinet during negotiations.\n\nWhat was clear from Juncker\u2019s behaviour was that he had enjoyed jousting with the British Prime Minister whom he repeatedly referred to as \u2018Boris\u2019.\n\nHe almost seemed sad the wrangling was all over. I assure you he was never like this around Theresa May.\n\nWhen Johnson spoke, he did so generously. The only steel in Boris\u2019s speech was a pointed reference to how decisions about Britain\u2019s future \u2013 \u2018our laws, our borders, our money and how we want to run the UK\u2019 \u2013 would be \u2018taken in the UK by elected representatives of the people in the UK\u2019.\n\nI don\u2019t know what sort of wine they\u2019ve been laying down in the EU Commission cellars over the years but as this convivial pair tottered off, I hope they went and uncorked something decent.\n\nAcross the North Sea in the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg was doing a little victory strut.\n\nWell, not quite. The mere thought of Jacob giving attitude is eminently preposterous. It was more a cocky, Gene Kelly twirl of the umbrella.\n\nThe Leader of the House, who was laying out the future business of the House, was in unctuous form. Schadenfreude oozed from every pore.\n\nBoris\u2019s deal, Moggster informed MPs, was a negotiating triumph.\n\nPictured left to right: Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel speak prior to an European Union Summit\n\nMr Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez attend a round table meeting at the European Union leaders summit\n\nThe dramatic intervention came as Mr Johnson (pictured with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday) insisted 'now is the moment to get Brexit done' after he signed off the blueprint, which deletes the hated Irish backstop\n\nPresident of the European Comission Jean-Claude Juncker (second-from-right), British Prime Minister Boris Johnson (second-from-left) and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (left) and European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (right) during a press conference on the Brexit deal in Brussels\n\nBoris Johnson would not be drawn on whether his deal could secure a majority of support in the House of Commons as he addressed reporters in Brussels\n\nMr Johnson leaves the podium after addressing a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels\n\nBoris Johnson said this morning that he had secured a 'great new deal' with the European Union\n\nThe opposition benches, meanwhile, swirled with vinegar. For them, this deal was not what was supposed to have happened. Barnier et al were meant to have told bungling Boris to naff off.\n\nAnna Soubry (Change UK, Broxtowe) looked like she\u2019d spent the morning sucking crab apples, yapping away like a speaking doll. Dominic Grieve (Ind, Beaconsfield) twiddled his thumbs indignantly. Hilary Benn (Lab, Leeds Central) had a jaw clasped so tight it might have been bound with bell wire.\n\nRees-Mogg wasn\u2019t the one who broached the issue of Brexit. In fact, he had been politely announcing forthcoming debates when Pete Wishart (SNP, Perth and North Perthshire) expressed surprise he hadn\u2019t gloated yet about the PM\u2019s deal.\n\nAt that point, Mogg unsheathed a copy of the deal from his folder which he proudly held aloft. \u2018I have had a chance to peruse it in detail,\u2019 he cooed.\n\nLabour\u2019s trade spokesman Barry Gardiner screamed: \u2018You haven\u2019t even read it!\u2019\n\n\u2018Does the Hon. Gentleman think that I have understood it through extra-sensory perception?\u2019 Mogg asked mockingly. \u2018I tell him he is wrong. It has not come to me through the ether. I have looked at the words on the page, of which the normal definition is reading.\u2019 The chamber went bananas. \u2018Outrageous!\u2019 hollered Soubry. Mogg could have informed them he\u2019d consumed slivers of hoisin-roast puffin and lightly scrambled avocet eggs for breakfast that morning off the back of a freshly-thrashed slave and there would have been less uproar.\n\nChris Leslie (Change UK, Nottingham East) was cross that Rees-Mogg was already in possession of a copy of the deal.\n\n\u2018I am slightly puzzled that the Hon. Gentleman thinks it is odd that members of the Cabinet receive Government documents, this is the normal process of Government in this country,\u2019 Jacob shrugged nonchalantly.\n\nHilary Benn was desperate to talk about the economic implications of the deal. Rees-Mogg waved his query away, describing it as an irrelevance. He explained there would be ample opportunity to debate it when the House sits tomorrow.\n\nJacob\u2019s loftiness was really getting to them. Ian Murray (Lab, Edinburgh South) accused him of \u2018sheer arrogance\u2019. Barry Sheerman (Lab, Huddersfield) said he was patronising.\n\nJoanna Cherry (SNP, Edinburgh SW), gobbling like a trapped turkey, jabbered about the benefits the supremacy of EU law had brought to the UK. Ugh, it was an appalling court, Mogg remarked, whose supremacy once Britain left the EU would \u2018fade like the morning mist.\u2019\n\nSomeone yanked the chord on Soubry\u2019s back one final time. \u2018A shocking sense of entitlement!\u2019 she croaked. She was right of course. But this was Mogg\u2019s moment and he was determined to milk it.\n\nNext up for Boris: A tricky Commons vote tomorrow.
