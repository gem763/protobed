A film on the character is reportedly in the works. When the news was announced that Marvel is planning to make a standalone movie on the character, fans, particularly Indians, expressed their desire to see our Desi Girl Priyanka Chopra play the role.\n\nAt the New York Comic Con recently, a game based on the character of Ms Marvel alias Kamala Khan was introduced in which she is a playable character. She will attempt to put the Avengers team back together. Marvel fans were happy to see her in the game.
