The new Facebook trial, which begins on Friday, will also kick off in Australia.\n\nFacebook Australia\u2019s director of policy Mia Garlick said the change was based on wellbeing research and feedback from mental health professionals that the number of likes can cause social comparison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had really positive feedback from a lot of the anti-bullying groups and mental health organisations that we work with,\u201d Garlick said.\n\n\u201cIt really is just taking that number out of the equation, so that people can focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.\u201d\n\nMay I have a word about\u2026 Facebook claiming the word \u2018book\u2019 | Jonathan Bouquet Read more\n\nIt\u2019s hoped that people will be more comfortable with sharing on the platform rather than feeling like it\u2019s a competition, she said.\n\nGarlick assured businesses who rely on Facebook they will still receive all the same metrics and insights they previously accessed.\n\nShe said it was too early to say if the test would roll out to other countries like Instagram\u2019s trial has in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.\n\nAs with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication of when the trial will end or if the change will be made permanent.\n\n\u201cWe have had some initial positive feedback from the public about the experience [on Instagram], but we\u2019re still just learning and listening to feedback at this stage,\u201d she said.\n\nOn being the world\u2019s training ground Garlick said Australia has very active \u201ctech-savvy\u201d users of Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\u201cWe think this is a great country where we can get some really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people on our services or not.\u201d", "description": "Social media giant said the move was backed by anti-bullying and mental health groups", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e689cc02058627e4109089f5114534ce21675005/3_0_5572_3346/master/5572.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=58571facb4285329f910b5cf91559b31", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
