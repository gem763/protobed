Ensuring a large enough spectrum supply as well as maintaining a competent design structure are critical to maximizing the output of a scarce resource, according to a written by Martin Cave, Department of Law, London School of Economics, and Ericsson\u2019s Gabriel Solomon. The authors warn that poorly designed auctions will have adverse effects on coverage, quality and price, which in turn lowers the take-up of services, restricts connectivity, and stunts economic growth and the higher government tax receipts that go with it.\n\nThey stress that the design of the 5G spectrum auctions taking place around the world today will have a material impact on the version of 5G that will be realized. If the goal is a limited version, in which 5G is simply a quicker and more efficient version of 4G, spectrum policy and license terms could continue largely unchanged. But such a goal would disregard the potential of 5G to transform industries, drive economic development and improve people\u2019s lives. For an expansive version of 5G, where fast and low latency connectivity is available to connect everything and everyone anytime, digitizing industry verticals, spectrum policy needs to change course.\n\nThe design of the 5G spectrum auctions taking place around the world today will have a material impact on the version of 5G that will be realized.\n\nAuctions that incorporate coverage obligations, leading to wider and denser deployment of networks at the cost of some of the government revenues raised, could help countries benefit from the expansive version of 5G. Given that 5G is designed to connect billions of things, as well as people, granular coverage obligations should be traded off for lower spectrum fees. Some regulators are also considering obligations that include consistent levels of quality and experience, encompassing minimum speeds and potentially latency.\n\nAn American flood and a European trickle\n\nAs the first wave of 5G auctions continues to play out in Europe and the U.S., a discernible gap in the amount of spectrum becoming available has emerged. With the U.S. president\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe race to 5G is a race that America must win\u201d, the market is being flooded with spectrum, resulting in a vast amount of licenses being sold at historically low prices. In contrast, the spectrum supply in Europe is more limited. As the table shows below, the average price paid per MHz varies greatly and correlates closely to the amount of spectrum made available.\n\nBest practice auctions can beat \u2018beauty contests\u2019\n\nThe paper argues that applying well-designed spectrum auctions is likely to be a better course of action than adopting administrative processes \u2014 \u201cbeauty contests\u201d \u2014 in which governments simply award spectrum to those applicants with the most attractive proposals. These \u201ccommand-and-control\u201d assignment mechanisms rely on judgments made by spectrum regulators that may be subjective and can be gamed by the operators concerned.\n\nThe authors do note, however, that when conducted in a well-structured manner, positive outcomes can be generated from this method. Neither China nor Japan charges upfront fees, but instead both demand coverage and capacity commitments in return for spectrum, and both countries currently enjoy more dense and expansive connectivity with four times as many base stations per capita as larger European countries.\n\nThe U.S. has been flooding the market with spectrum and consequently spectrum licenses are being sold at historically low prices.\n\nAlthough network densification may be attributed to multiple factors \u2014 speedy permits and low site costs certainly among them \u2014 having an operator\u2019s balance sheet not stretched due to excessive spectrum payments will play a key role. As a critical contributor to the successful realization of expansive 5G, network densification should be an increasingly important consideration for all spectrum assignment policy objectives and be reflected in how spectrum auctions are designed.\n\nCave and Solomon conclude that to maximize the reach, availability and quality of 5G connectivity, the following best practices should be implemented in the design of current spectrum auctions:\n\nFor the telecommunications industry to thrive, a degree of predictability is needed to allow for budget planning, for example by having a clear roadmap of spectrum assignment over the medium to long term. In addition, appropriate consideration must also be given to the secondary trading of licenses along with the ability to sublease amounts of spectrum to third parties.\n\nAuthors:\n\nThe above column is sponsor-generated content.
