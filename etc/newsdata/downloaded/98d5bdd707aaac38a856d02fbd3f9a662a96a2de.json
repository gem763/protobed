Tardigrades can be exposed to these particles when their mossy, wet habitats dry out.\n\nProfessor Kadonaga and his team believe that Dsup may not have been developed to resist radiation, but that such is a side-benefit from evolving to survive in dried-out environments.\n\nThe Dsup protein was first discovered in 2016, when it was found that it could suppress X-ray induced DNA damage in human cells by around 40 per cent.\n\n'We were really surprised,' author of that study and Professor Takuma Hashimoto of the University of Tokyo had told the AFP at that time.\n\n'It is striking that a single gene is enough to improve the radiation tolerance of human cultured cells.'\n\nUnderstanding how the tardigrades manage to shield themselves may one day allow us to adapt the trick for our own ends.\n\n'In theory, it seems possible that optimised versions of Dsup could be designed for the protection of DNA in many different types of cells,' said Professor Kadonaga.\n\n'Dsup might thus be used in a range of applications, such as cell-based therapies and diagnostic kits in which increased cell survival is beneficial.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal eLife.", "description": "Molecular biologists at the University of California, San Diego developed three different methods to purify the Dsup protein from tardigrades to study how it works at the molecular level.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19297682-0-image-a-56_1570195009587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
