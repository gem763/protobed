The Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is now focused squarely on that episode, fueled by allegations from a government whistleblower that Trump had dangled almost $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky failed to open the investigations Trump sought.\n\nIn text message conversations with several other diplomats, including Sondland, Taylor last month had warned against the \u201ccrazy\u201d strategy of withholding U.S. aid \u201cfor help with a political campaign.\" At one point he threatened to quit the State Department in protest.\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotel magnate and Trump donor with no previous diplomatic experience, pushed back, saying Taylor was \"incorrect\" in surmising Trump's intentions.\n\n\"The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind,\" Sondland wrote.\n\nSondland had testified last week before the three House committees leading the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry: Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs. But based on Taylor\u2019s testimony Tuesday, some Democrats are already suggesting Sondland will be called back to explain apparent discrepancies.\n\n\u201cI walk away with the impression Mr. Sondland will have some explaining to do,\u201d said Rep.
