One called asked about the consulting firm Korn Ferry ( KFY ) : \"It's shocking that (this) stock is down so much,\" was Cramer's response. Let's check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of KFY, below, we can see that prices have worked lower the past 12 months. Prices are testing the declining 50-day moving average line and are about $6 below the declining 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line mostly shows that sellers have been more aggressive but the line is showing some improvement the past two months or so.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to a cover shorts signal in July and is now close to the zero line for a potential go long message.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of KFY, below, we can see that prices have nearly been cut in half from their 2018 peak. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line but the weekly OBV line has been steady the past twelve months, which I find \"odd\" considering the big price decline.\n\nThe weekly MACD oscillator has narrowed and is close to a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of KFY, below, we can see an upside price target of $42.\n\nBottom-line strategy: With KFY showing a rising OBV line since July and the Point and Figure chart showing an upside price target, aggressive traders could probe the long side of KFY for a bounce. Investors need to see a better base before becoming involved.", "description": "Korn Ferry technical analysis and strategy on trading the stock...KFY", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Korn Ferry Could Make A Trading Bounce But Investors Shouldn'T Be Moved To Buy", "Prices Have Worked Lower The Past Months.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/3b3f7b4d-a395-11e7-be5b-519df76d4c4b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
