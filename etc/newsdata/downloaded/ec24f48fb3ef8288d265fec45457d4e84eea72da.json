There is no British Embassy in London for British citizens.\n\nShe was eventually forced to borrow \u00a3150 from a colleague to buy a train ticket back to Scotland.\n\nHaving contacted customer services again once she\u2019d returned home, Dr Ruxton was eventually offered a \u00a350 voucher, but was chastised for not having followed the airline\u2019s advice and visited \u201cher embassy\u201d in London.\n\nDr Ruxton said she had refused the voucher, and that what she really wanted was an apology and money to cover the cost of the train ticket.\n\nShe said the airline\u2019s erroneous advice \u201cdisplays a worrying lack of understanding about the nature of the United Kingdom and a lack of care for customers\".\n\nEasyJet said in a statement: \u201cWe are sorry that Mrs Ruxton and her daughter were unable to travel on their flight on 4 July and were incorrectly informed, as a UK citizen, to contact the embassy.\n\n\u201cIt was correct however that photo ID is required as they had hold luggage and so this is required for safety reasons. This meant the documentation she had was not sufficient to be able to travel.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry for their experience and have already provided a voucher as a goodwill gesture and we will refund the cost of the return flight to apologise for the inconvenience.\n\n\u201cThe safety and security of our passengers and crew is easyJet\u2019s highest priority.\u201d", "description": "A Scottish women who had her ID stolen in London was left baffled after easyJet told her she could not fly home and should \u201cvisit her embassy\u201d.
