Kylie Jenner is facing some backlash after dressing her daughter Stormi as herself for Halloween\n\nMini-me: Kylie, 22, had a miniature version of her own 2019 Met Gala dress made for the 21-month-old toddler\n\nThe original: Stormi's version was nearly identical to her mom's Versace gown, though it showed less skin\n\nStormi's mini-me dress was made up of glitzy netting with a dip down the chest, just like moms, and embellished with lilac feathers along the bottom.\n\nUnhappy? Some people said that Stormi looked 'miserable' in Kylie's photos\n\nLike mom's Versace gown, Stormi's was also paired with a matching purple boa and a purple wig.\n\nIn a video Kylie shared, Stormi at first seems a little bewildered in the elaborate getup, but she soon smiles while her mom continues to film.\n\nAt the Met Gala, which Kylie attended with then-boyfriend (and Stormi's father) Travis Scott, the young billionaire showcased her ample cleavage in the pale purple number, which was a much more adult version of what Stormi wore over the weekend.\n\nThe post earned plenty of enthusiastic feedback: Many comments were some variation of 'OMG' and 'dead,' with celebs including Paris Hilton, Vanessa Hudgens, Cassie, Vera Wang, Chanel Iman, Jaclyn Hill, Corey Gamble, and Sodia Richei chiming in.\n\nBut critics also had something to say, bashing Kylie's ego and her parenting choices.\n\nNot fans: Though the post earned over 10 million likes, plenty of critics chimed in to call Kylie 'vain' and say the costume was 'creepy,' 'weird,' and 'inappropriate'\n\n'She is a young toddler who shoudl be playing with Lego and Play-Doh... not dressing up like an adult. This has been specifically made for her... let her be a child ffs,' wrote one.\n\n'I want to say this is beyond weird/bad/inappropriate... But then do we expect anything other than that from this family? Those children are going to be in therapy from the age of ten!' commented another.\n\n'Wtf why are you putting her into that, just give her normal nice clothes,' one commenter chided.\n\n'She looks like she will be pregnant by 13. Nice Halloween costume mom. Very comfortable,' shamed someone else.\n\n'This is... really weird and vain and a little creepy,' added another, while one more told Kylie to 'get a grip.'\n\n'You can tell how uncomfortable she is and wants to cry... she is a child and that's what she should be. You are stealing her youth!' another commenter wrote dramatically.\n\nMoods: They insisted that Kylie looked uncomfortable in the dress since she wasn't smiling in the photos, though she did flash a happy grin in a video that Kylie included\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Like mother like daughter: Critics said Kylie should let her daughter be a kid and insisted she would have been happier as Elsa from Frozen\n\nMom's turn: Kylie also uploaded footage of herself dressed up for Halloween, rocking a look inspired by Madonna's all-black ensemble at the 2003 VMAs\n\nMwah! Her friend Anastasia Karanikolaou was dressed as Britney\n\n'Bruh she's soooo cute but she doesn't look very happy not gonna lie. i feel like she's feeling tortured... there's a lot going on there and I don't think she feels comfortable,' said a more gentle critic.\n\nOne person, whose comment only received five likes, complained. 'Am I the only one who thinks that this is abuse?'\n\n'That poor baby. All she wanted to be for Halloween was Elsa,' said another commenter, who seems to have an inside source in the family. 'Her face says it all.'\n\nKylie has ignored her critics, and only commented with her own adoring caption.\n\n'My baby!!!!!!!! i cant handle this!!!!' she wrote, along with a string of heart emojis.\n\nKylie also uploaded footage of herself dressed up for Halloween, rocking a look inspired by Madonna's all-black ensemble at the 2003 VMAs, when she famously kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.\n\nHer friend Anastasia Karanikolaou was dressed as Britney.\n\nDone up: Kim Kardashian posted a photo of her and Kanye West 's daughter North in a one-shoulder dress that looked fit for a fully grown movie star\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Kardashian posted a photo of her and Kanye West 's daughter North in a one-shoulder dress that looked fit for a fully grown movie star.\n\nNorth paired the Prada number with black tights and feathered shoes, as well as a cast.\n\nShe posed alongside two equally done-up friends.\n\nIt does however look like Kim is taking her husband's opinion into account, as the little girl appeared to be makeup-free.\n\nIt's unclear if this was just a regular game of dress-up or if it was meant for Halloween; if it's the latter, it's not obvious what North's costume is.\n\nThe girls' dresses are, though, by high-end fashion labels, which Kim tagged in the photo: Givenchy, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nKim K captioned the picture, 'Styled by North * fake cast included'.", "description": "Many praised the costume as 'cute' and 'adorable,' but some hit out at Kylie, 22,, saying Stormi is too young to be wearing such an outfit. They pointed out how 'uncomfortable' the toddler looked in pictures.", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/20283388-0-image-a-9_1572273186879.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
