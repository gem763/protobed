But now another fast food company has jumped on this curiously specific bandwagon: Wendy\u2019s is making its own tabletop RPG called Feast of Legends.\n\nYou play a hero of Freshtovia, a nation of peaceful beef-eaters, ruled by the red-headed Queen Wendy, the \u201cClapback Queen\u2026 first of her name, breaker of fast food chains, defender of all things fresh, never frozen.\u201d Your opposition is the \u201cIce Jester,\u201d which I\u2019m assuming is a thinly-veiled jab at McDonald\u2019s, and their forces of frozen meat products.\n\nNon-frozen this, non-frozen that \u2014 not to be overly critical, but Wendy\u2019s really does have one string to its bow, doesn\u2019t it? But whatever, I\u2019ve played games with flimsier premises (*ahem* such as the opportunity to get under the Colonel\u2019s apron).\n\nDon\u2019t mistake me, though: this is a full-on RPG with a massive rule book, character sheets, and a campaign to follow. I downloaded the PDF thinking it was a joke, but it\u2019s dead serious despite the humorous trappings \u2014 the darned thing is 97 pages long and the campaign has five chapters to it. We could get a good game going with these materials.\n\nThe game map also includes nods to Wendy\u2019s other competition, including \u201cLake John Silver,\u201d \u201cTemple of Panda,\u201d and \u201cTwin Cities of Carl\u201d (dare I surmise one of them is called \u201cJunior?\u201d). I\u2019m curious if \u201cCreepingvale\u201d is intended to be a reference to Burger King, since it fights alongside the \u201cUnited Clown Nations\u201d as Freshtovia\u2019s opponents. Cthulhu help me, but I can almost imagine a shared universe Horde/Alliance-style faction war between the different nations. And now I\u2019ve just given them all ideas, haven\u2019t I?\n\nYes, it\u2019s a marketing tactic \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes it so fascinating. There\u2019s not much I would put past the canny brainstorming of a marketing executive for a fast food company, and even I think this is bizarre. Not bizarre in a bad way \u2014 it\u2019s just weird to google \u201cTabletop RPG\u201d and have anything related to Wendy\u2019s come up.\n\nBut heck, I\u2019ll play it.
