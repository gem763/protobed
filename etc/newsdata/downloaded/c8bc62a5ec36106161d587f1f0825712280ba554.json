Thousands of people have reportedly been detained, and access to mobile or internet services has been severed for millions of people in a communications blackout, part of a security clampdown in the wake of Delhi\u2019s decision.\n\nTrump and Modi are the mainstream faces of the global far right | Cas Mudde Read more\n\nThe rally, on Sunday, marked the first time Modi had discussed the decision to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status on a world stage, and followed months of fierce rhetoric from Pakistan, which also claims the disputed region and has sought to raise the issue with the UN.\n\nWithout directly naming Pakistan, Modi accused the country of \u201chatred towards India\u201d and of supporting terrorism.\n\n\u201cWhether it is the 9/11 attack in America or the 26/11 attack in Mumbai, where are its conspirators found?\n\n\u201cThe time has come for a decisive fight against terrorism and those who support terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to stress here that President Trump is standing firmly against this.\u201d\n\nTrump, who was given a rapturous welcome at the event, said he was committed to protecting \u201cinnocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism\u201d.\n\nAbout 50,000 Indian Americans attended the \u201cHowdy Modi!\u201d rally, where crowds chanted \u201cModi! Modi! Modi!\u201d as he took to the stage, following a 90-minute cultural program featuring 400 dancers.\n\nTrump, introduced by Modi as \u201cmy friend, a friend of India, a great American president\u201d, was given a standing ovation at the event in Houston, a Democratic stronghold in Republican-dominated Texas. Houston is expected to be a critical battleground in Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid.\n\nModi, who was re-elected this year with a thumping majority, enjoys wide support among Indians both at home and abroad, especially among the middle classes, said Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based thinktank. \u201cHe is extremely popular, particularly when it comes to the Indian diaspora in the US where there is a lot of Gujarati diaspora, from his home state,\u201d he said.\n\nPlay Video 4:13 'We will fight to the last drop of blood': embattled Kashmiris target freedom \u2013 video\n\nThe rally was held as Kashmir remains under a security crackdown, apparently to prevent unrest. Outside the stadium, protesters accused Modi\u2019s government of human rights abuses against Kashmiris.\n\nIltija Mufti, the daughter of the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, said on Twitter: \u201cWhile people in Kashmir have been gagged, mass hysteria is orchestrated elsewhere to justify this decision.\u201d Her mother was among thousands reportedly detained as part of a crackdown by security services.\n\nModi\u2019s speech came just days before the UN general assembly\u2019s meeting in New York, where the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, is expected to accuse Modi of being complicit in torture and mass detention in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a south Asia expert at the Wilson Center, in Washington DC, said while Modi generally prefered to keep quiet about Kashmir with global audiences, it was unsurprising that he had raised the issue in Texas.\n\n\u201cI think he wanted to try to blunt international criticism by demonstrating just how popular the move [to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status] was among Indians \u2014 including Indian Americans in the US,\u201d said Kugelman. \u201cAnd indeed his comment got louder applause than just about anything he or Trump said during the whole event.\u201d\n\nThough the scrapping of Kashmir\u2019s special status faces major opposition within the region, it is widely supported elsewhere in India.\n\nIt was unsurprising an Indian leader would criticise Pakistan in a political speech, said Kugelman, but he added: \u201cIt is significant that Modi did so with Trump seated right in front of him, and at a moment when the US-Pakistan relationship has enjoyed a renaissance thanks to Islamabad\u2019s help with Taliban talks in Afghanistan.\u201d", "description": "Narendra Modi defends actions in Kashmir and accuses Pakistan of \u2018hatred towards India\u2019", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2c1ae4abc5fd47c8958ed1621635d8db7f1da65/159_243_2928_1756/master/2928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a10dd8ab9ed49d74161d135078f6d077", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
