He will be on high alert next week at Antwerp\u2019s European Open in case he has to return to the UK in time for the birth.\n\nThe new arrival will join Murray\u2019s two daughters, three-year-old Sophia and one-year-old Edie. He said that he had prioritised Antwerp next week over the rival ATP event in Stockholm because it leaves him with a faster return trip if necessary.\n\nFrom there, he would take four weeks away from the tour before returning in time for the inaugural Davis Cup finals event in Madrid from Nov 18 to 25.\n\nSpeaking to the Times, Murray said \u201cObviously the baby can come any time from pretty much next week. I would adjust my schedule if I couldn\u2019t go to Antwerp. My plan is to play Antwerp and then I am done through to the Davis Cup. If the baby came early, I would miss Antwerp and then maybe play at the Paris Masters [at the end of this month].\u201d\n\nMurray also suggested that he expected other sportspeople to follow his example by having a metal ball-and-socket joint implanted to solve hip trauma.", "description": "Andy Murray has confirmed that his wife Kim is expecting their third child in the coming days.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000053225002-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7G-K8tjZ061e2DMMXh_LDrM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
