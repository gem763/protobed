We understand that he did leave the White House under stressful circumstances, but I think he had a good read on what was going on in Ukraine and his testimony would be very desirable as far as the committee goes,\u201d Lynch added.\n\nOthers also echoed this position, arguing that Bolton\u2019s conservative bona fides make him a potentially more politically potent witness \u2014 a Republican who could challenge the narrative of Trump\u2019s GOP defenders on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as big a hawk as you\u2019re going to find,\u201d said Rep.

And George Kent, who remains at the State Department as a deputy assistant secretary, testified Tuesday even after the agency tried to prevent his appearance.\n\nWhile multiple members on the Intelligence Committee said they were not sure whether the panel has been in touch with Bolton about securing a deposition, Democrats say they are racing the clock to collect as much evidence as they can about Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukraine.\n\nMembers on the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees for the most part remained mum as they left the closed-door hearing with Kent on whether they wanted to hear from Bolton.\n\nSome also dodged questions about whether they had been instructed to stay quiet about future witnesses, deferring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffEx-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump to slap sanctions on Turkey for Syria offensive | Trump calls on Turkey to broker ceasefire | Pelosi, Graham seek deal on sanctions | Ex-Trump aide testifies in impeachment probe GOP rep says he was kicked out of Trump aide's deposition MORE (D-Calif.), who is leading the investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.\n\nBolton, now a Republican operative, clashed with Trump on major policy issues such as North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan, with the president viewing the longtime hawk as too militant in his approaches. He is reportedly working on a book about his time in the administration.\n\nStill, at the onset of his departure, Bolton showed he was willing to fight back with the administration, disputing Trump\u2019s claims that he had been fired, rather than offering to submit a letter of resignation a day prior.", "description": "Democrats are eyeing John Bolton as a potential witness in their impeachment case amid increasing scrutiny of President Trump and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/johnbolton_09242018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
