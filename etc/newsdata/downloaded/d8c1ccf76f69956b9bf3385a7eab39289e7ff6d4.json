The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Southeast Asia Properties & Finance Limited (HKG:252).\n\nDo Insider Transactions Matter?\n\nIt is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.\n\nInsider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.'\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Southeast Asia Properties & Finance\n\nSoutheast Asia Properties & Finance Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Non-Executive Director, Tiong Siy, sold HK$17m worth of shares at a price of HK$3.42 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of HK$3.40. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\n\nHappily, we note that in the last year insiders paid HK$9.7m for 2.9m shares. On the other hand they divested 7.1m shares, for HK$24m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Southeast Asia Properties & Finance than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

We can see that Non-Executive Director Tiong Siy paid HK$4.9m for shares in the company. On the other hand, insider Nai King Chua netted HK$2.5m by selling. We think insiders may be optimistic about the future, since insiders have been net buyers of shares.\n\nDoes Southeast Asia Properties & Finance Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 13% of Southeast Asia Properties & Finance shares, worth about HK$102m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Southeast Asia Properties & Finance Insiders?\n\nIt's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, Southeast Asia Properties & Finance insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future.
