How much do y\u2019all think these cost, #Roomies?\"\n\n(Image: BPO)\n\nNot holding back, Snoop, real name Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, took to the comments to rip the open-toed shoes to shreds because their likeness to shoes issued to prisoners in America.\n\nHe commented, in reference to Kim's recent work in petitioning for prison reform: \"She been getting dudes out of jail now he gone sell jail slippers . W. T. F. None of my bidness.\"\n\nHe finished the caption with a frog emoji.\n\n(Image: @theshaderoom/Instagram)\n\nIt is not the first time that Kanye's shoe designs have come under fire.\n\nIn September, his new Yeezy Foam Runners - which look vaguely like his trainers but made of foam and with loads of holes in - sent the internet into a frenzy.\n\nThe quirky shoes were compared to the most divisive shoes of all time - Crocs after the launch was announced on the Yeezy Mafia Twitter account with a picture of two models wearing the shoes on the back of a motorbike.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for THR)\n\nThe account wrote: \"YEEZY FOAM RUNNER LANDING IN 2020.\"\n\nAnd the post instantly went viral, with hundreds of Twitter users mocking the shoes.\n\nOne tweeted: \"I'd rather eat a pineapple pizza with a side of raisins than wear these.\"\n\n\"No one. Seriously NO ONE asked for Yeezy Crocs,\" another posted.\n\nA third said: \"Kanye: You know what\u2019d be dope? We take Crocs. Aight. And we turn them into Yeezy's...And then we sell \u2018em for $300.\"\n\n\"Kanye's making Yeezy Crocs now.
