I worked for all of it. Even off the back of being in a very public relationship, with someone who is very fortunate in their bank balance or their profile, people forget that. You can love someone for them not their assets,\" she insists.\n\nSelf-sufficient Summer says she has her 'fingers in a lot of pies' and lists horse whisperer and laser practitioner on her varied CV.\n\n(Image: Dan Wooller/REX)\n\nThe redhead is now hoping to venture into acting and has been spotted networking at celeb parties in the hope of widening in her circle.\n\nAnd it seems her hard work is paying off.\n\nShe admits: \"I've been offered several opportunities in the film and TV industry and it's crazy because I never thought I'd go down this path.\n\n\"A lot of doors have opened and I'm just taking every opportunity as it comes. I'd love to do something like Game of Thrones or Vikings, mainly so I could work with horses.\"\n\nSummer had also been linked to I'm A Celebrity but shot down the rumours last month saying producers hadn't even approached her.", "description": "The 24-year-old ex barmaid said she looks only to herself for support", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Summermonteysfullam Instagram", "Dan Wooller Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18997359.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Summer-Monteys-Fullam.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
