Dana has said its share would produce around 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at peak production.\n\nEarlier this month, Premier announced that its drilling in the Tolmount East section, targeting a further 220 billion cubic feet of gas, was successful.\n\nKNOC bought Aberdeen-based Dana, an exploration and production company with operations across the North Sea, the Netherlands and Egypt, in 2010 for $2.9 billion, including debt. KNOC had hired Canada\u2019s Scotia Bank to market the corporate stake.\n\nWith average 2018 production of 65,000 barrels of oil and gas per day and revenue of $1.27 billion, Dana Petroleum has 70% of its operations in the North Sea. Earlier this year it was fined for releasing more than 80 tonnes of chemicals onto the seabed during a drilling operation in 2016.", "description": "State-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) has scaled back efforts to pull out of the British North Sea, focusing on the sale of its stake in the Tolmount gas project, three industry sources said.", "authors": ["Shadia Nasralla", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
