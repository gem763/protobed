Elizabeth Warren rising in the polls and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s lead narrowing since late spring, Warren's message is igniting progressives. | Mario Tama/Getty Images 2020 Elections \u2018The rock star\u2019 vs. \u2018The rock\u2019: Warren and Biden hurtle toward collision A clash of opposites was on full display on the campaign trail the past week.\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 Elizabeth Warren has the crowds. Joe Biden has the lead.\n\nThe split-screen story of one of the most intriguing matchups of the Democratic presidential primary is unfolding in a glaring contrast of style and substance.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Sunday, Warren stood on the biggest stage of her presidential campaign for a rally here that drew an estimated 15,000 people \u2014 eclipsing an estimated 12,000-person event she held in Minnesota earlier in the week, according to her campaign. Across the country, Biden presided over a series of intimate, subdued events in New Hampshire and Iowa, hosting crowds that numbered in the low hundreds.\n\nWarren roused her supporters with calls for \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d and the crowd roared with chants of \u201cTwo cents! Two cents\u201d while waving two fingers in the air as Warren discussed her 2 percent \"wealth tax.\u201d Biden pounded away at President Donald Trump, his campaign subtly and overtly reminding voters that polls consistently show him as the party's best general election candidate and the primary\u2019s front-runner.\n\nThe parallel displays by two of the three leading Democratic candidates offered a possible preview of the collision course looming if Biden and Warren maintain their current trajectory. It would be a clash of opposites: the progressive firebrand against the establishment favorite; the cerebral candidate of big, bold plans vs. the elder statesman offering himself as a safe haven for people who simply want a return to pre-Trump normalcy.\n\nWith Warren rising in the polls and Biden\u2019s lead narrowing since late spring, her message is igniting progressives.\n\n\u201cWarren is on fire,\u201d said Howard Dean, who in 2004 ran a Warren-like campaign as the unapologetic progressive outsider.\n\nBut Dean flamed out against John Kerry 15 years ago, reflecting the penchant of primary voters to nominate the safe choice to challenge the president of the opposition party running for reelection. And Dean, who is neutral in the race, acknowledged that Biden could benefit from similar circumstances in this cycle.\n\nThe primary, he said, will come down to \u201cthe element in the party that wants real change and the element that just wants to beat Trump.\u201d Right now, Democrats are more focused on beating Trump, and those voters favor Biden most.\n\nBut today\u2019s Democratic Party is far more progressive and Warren is far better organized than he was in 2004, he added.\n\n\u201cThere has been a huge sea change,\u201d Dean said. Democratic voters are \u201cmuch more [people] of color and they\u2019re much more female and they\u2019re young.\u201d And Biden is no Kerry, he said: \u201cBiden is the old establishment, but he has cred because he was Obama\u2019s vice president.\u201d\n\nAlong the bucolic shores of Loon Lake in New Hampshire after a Biden speech Friday, former state House candidate John Streeter summed up the contrast between the two candidates.\n\n\u201cWarren is a rock star,\u201d Streeter said.\n\nAnd Biden?\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is a rock,\u201d Streeter said. \u201cWe know him.\u201d\n\nIn light of Biden\u2019s standing atop the polls and the number of endorsements of influential Democrats, his campaign has grown weary as reporters and critics \u2014 including Trump \u2014 use crowd size as a metric to judge him.\n\n\u201cAre we worried about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s crowd size? No, we\u2019re not. I get it and I understand that it\u2019s an easy metric to measure or to view,\u201d said Pete Kavanaugh, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and point man in the early states.\n\n\u201cSome people \u2014 not local press but national press \u2014 are wondering, \u2018Why did you have only 130 people on Wednesday in Prole [in Iowa].\u2019 Well, it\u2019s a town of 900 people,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cWe think it has strategic importance in the caucus. We\u2019re not going to Cedar Rapids and Des Moines every trip. I get it. It would be lovely to have a crowd of 1,000 people every day. But it does not matter on Feb. 3,\u201d the date of the state's caucuses.\n\nStill, Biden\u2019s advisers are taking Warren seriously, and others on the team have privately acknowledged they see Warren as his strongest challenger of the nearly two dozen Democratic candidates.\n\nWhere Biden is dominating with traditional campaign donors, Warren is building a small-dollar money machine that makes her more of a financial threat than many had anticipated.\n\nIn June, Warren raised $7.8 million from 320,000 donations, compared with Biden\u2019s $2.2 million from 111,000 donations, according to data from ActBlue, the online fundraising tool. (That is the most recent information available from the site.) Their small-dollar performances have been going in opposite directions, with Biden\u2019s best days coming the week of his launch and Warren gaining steam over time.\n\nBut while Biden, for now, has the centrist, establishment path largely to himself, Warren still has Bernie Sanders in her progressive lane. Sanders has an even bigger small-dollar army, and also drew big crowds this week in Sacramento, Calif. and Louisville, Ky. The two are projecting similar messages, railing against the ultra-wealthy, asking people to join a broader movement, and subtly hitting Biden by warning against incrementalism.\n\nSanders isn\u2019t viewed by Biden\u2019s campaign as having as much room to grow as Warren. But Biden\u2019s camp does see the continued strength of Warren and Sanders as an advantage, each limiting the other\u2019s ability to expand their own base of support. Sanders\u2019 campaign thinks he can eat into Biden\u2019s support because of demographic overlap between their voters.\n\nThe two African-American candidates in the race, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, have so far been unable to chip away at Biden\u2019s solid lead among black voters, who give Biden a huge advantage especially in South Carolina and other Southern states.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also thinks his core message \u2014 prioritizing beating Trump and referring nostalgically to President Obama \u2014 resonates powerfully across the Democratic electorate.\n\n\u201cWe have to reach beyond our party. We have to unify the country. We have to restore the soul of the nation,\u201d Biden said Saturday to a crowd of about 300 at Keene State College in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe have to be a nation that values honesty and decency, treating everyone with respect and dignity, giving everyone a fair shot and leaving no one behind, giving hate no safe harbor.\u201d\n\nIn response to an audience question about how she\u2019d take on Trump, Warren said, \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna win this by just saying, \u2018not Trump.\u2019\u201d She added that \u201c[w]hat is ugly, we can call it out. But that\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s not enough to be \u2018not Trump.\u2019\u201d\n\nWarren and Biden also diverge on style.\n\nHe meanders off-message and sometimes flubs his facts. At his first stop at Dartmouth College over the weekend, Biden veered into a discussion about the instability of the 1960s and early 1970s. But he mistakenly gave the wrong number of fatalities during the Kent State shootings, unexpectedly wondered aloud about what would have happened if Obama had been assassinated and confused being in New Hampshire with being in Vermont.\n\nOn the stump, Warren is resolutely on message. Where Biden is running as an extension of Obama\u2019s presidency, Warren seldom mentions the last Democratic president. Her campaign markets her as the leader of a movement, selling \u201cI\u2019m a Warren Democrat\u201d T-shirts. Some of her organizers invoke the Hamilton musical lyric, \u201cThis is not a moment, it\u2019s the movement.\u201d\n\nLiberal hot spots like Seattle guarantee big, attention-drawing crowds as well. As at her other speeches, Warren on Sunday framed her campaign as an opportunity for Democrats to advance a cause, invoking the earlier efforts of suffragettes, union organizers, and civil rights foot soldiers.\n\n\u201cBut they didn\u2019t quit. They got organized. They built a grass-roots movement, they persisted, and they changed the course of American history,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our moment in American history. Dream big. Fight hard. Let\u2019s win.\u201d\n\nMarc Caputo reported from New Hampshire and Alex Thompson from Seattle.
