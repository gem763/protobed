If Johnson's Conservative Party fails to gain a ruling majority in the election, Britain could find themselves stuck in a vicious loop of indecisiveness.\n\nIf the minority Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is able to turn the tide and obtain a ruling majority, then Johnson would be ousted from 10 Downing Street and another national referendum on whether or not the country should leave the E.U. could be invoked.\n\nFor the election to be finalized, a vote must get through the House of Lords, which could delay the election.", "description": "British Parliament\u00a0voted Tuesday to hold a general election on Dec. 12,\u00a0the latest curveball in\u00a0the U.K.'s tumultuous bid to leave the European Union.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/brexit_2019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
