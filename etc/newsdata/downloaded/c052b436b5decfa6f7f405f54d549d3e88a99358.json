Most recently, for August, the closely watched University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index posted its biggest monthly decline in almost seven years.\n\nTo show that drops this big are good news, I measured the correlations between monthly changes in the University of Michigan index since 1979 and the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, -1.56% subsequent performance. The findings show that whenever the Michigan index dropped by at least as much as it did in August (8.6 points), the S&P 500 over the subsequent six months produced an average gain of 5.6%. That contrasts with a 2.8% average return subsequent to months in which the index rose by at least 8.6 points. (See chart below.)\n\nThis result is consistent with the conclusions of a study several years ago conducted by Meir Statman, a finance professor at California\u2019s Santa Clara University, and Ken Fisher, the well-known money manager. In addition to focusing on the University of Michigan index, they also analyzed the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index. They report that \u201cinvestors need not fear that declines in consumer confidence would be followed by low stock returns. Low consumer confidence is followed by high stock returns more often than it is followed by low stock returns.\u201d\n\nIn any case, as I\u2019ve pointed out before, the strongest statistical correlations in the data are between the S&P 500\u2019s trailing performance and changes in consumer sentiment. That is, consumer sentiment and the S&P 500 are coincident indicators \u2014 rising and falling more or less in unison. So it\u2019s not a big surprise that, given the stock market\u2019s recent turmoil, the University of Michigan index should also have fallen.\n\nFor investment purposes, furthermore, it matters little which of these coincident indicators caused the other. The important point is that, because consumer sentiment is a contrarian indicator, you should not react to falling consumer sentiment by selling your stocks.\n\nWatch what consumers do \u2014 not what they say\n\nA reality check when analyzing consumer sentiment is to focus on actual consumer behavior \u2014 specifically total consumer expenditures. Since such expenditures represent an estimated 70% of GDP, it would be worrisome indeed if consumers stopped spending.\n\nFortunately there is no evidence of that, despite the recent plunge in consumer sentiment. The federal government reported last week that personal consumption expenditures (PCE) surged in the most recent reporting month. Furthermore, the latest month\u2019s PCE is 4.1% higher than the year-ago level. That\u2019s higher than the average 12-month gain over the past decade of 3.5%.\n\nSo it\u2019s important to watch what consumers do in addition to what they are saying. The last time PCE 12-month rate of change was negative was during the Great Recession, more than a decade ago. We\u2019re seeing nothing like that now.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch. His Hulbert Ratings tracks investment newsletters that pay a flat fee to be audited.
