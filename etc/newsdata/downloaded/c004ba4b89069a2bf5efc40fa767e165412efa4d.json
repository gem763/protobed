We need an impeachment.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn another sexist slant, Conway said that Trump wasn\u2019t angry but \u201camused\u201d by an impeachment inquiry launched by the woman who runs the House of Representatives.\n\n.@KellyannePolls on @SpeakerPelosi: \"She does the worse thing a woman in power can do, which is she just changes her mind because the men around her said, 'change your mind. We need an impeachment.' She did that without seeing the transcript\u2026\" pic.twitter.com/Ef1nALWW0z \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) September 27, 2019\n\nPelosi was asked Friday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d about her response to an earlier comment by Conway attacking her for changing her mind in a \u201cmatter of hours.\u201d Pelosi responded dismissively: \u201cWhy would I have to comment on something she said?\u201d Host Joe Scarborough responded: \u201cThat is the correct answer, by the way.\u201d\n\nPelosi had been reluctant to launch a full impeachment inquiry into Trump. But then a bombshell report was released this week about a whistleblower complaint over a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. At the time, Trump was withholding nearly $400 million in military funds that had been appropriated for Ukraine.\n\nArmed with the new information, Pelosi announced the start of an official impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of betrayal of his oath of office and betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said on national TV. \u201cTherefore ... I\u2019m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get more serious than this. It is a betrayal of his oath of office for President Trump to pressure a foreign country to interfere in our elections. And yet that is exactly what @realDonaldTrump did. #TruthExposed pic.twitter.com/MnB5ARJR35 \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) September 27, 2019\n\nTwitter followers skewered Conway.\n\nSo KellyAnne Conway says Nancy Pelosi was intimidated by men to move on impeachment. Right. The most powerful woman in our country , 79 years old, is intimidated by men. #cluelessKAC \u2014 Martina Navratilova (@Martina) September 28, 2019\n\nWhat Kellyanne Conway fails to recognize here is that men didn\u2019t really lead the charge on impeachment. It was mostly women. Maxine Waters, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, AOC, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Ilhan Omar, etc. https://t.co/QklExz6qAI \u2014 Adam Best (@adamcbest) September 27, 2019\n\nClearly @KellyannePolls needs to meet some more strong women.\n\n\n\nFunny how she feeds the misogynistic trope that women are always controlled by men. Just because that's your relationship with your boss doesn't mean it's true for all of us, Kellyanne. \ud83e\udd26 https://t.co/wMXk8qt1JX \u2014 Jess Phoenix \ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd20 (@jessphoenix2018) September 27, 2019\n\nKellyanne isn\u2019t fit to hold Nancy Pelosi\u2018s coat, let alone criticize her. pic.twitter.com/2AJWI2G0Vx \u2014 Rusty Jones III (@RustyJonesIII) September 27, 2019\n\nKellyanne need to stop projecting her fear and appeasement of men onto other women.\n\n\n\nPelosi is the Speaker of the House. She\u2019s afraid of no one. \u2014 Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) September 27, 2019\n\n.@KellyannePolls is an embarrassment to all American women. @SpeakerPelosi runs the House. Kellyanne just runs her mouth.\n\n\n\nYou picked the wrong horse, Kellyanne. Just admit it already and save whatever shred of dignity you have left. \u2014 Melissa Quinn Amour (@MelissaAmour72) September 27, 2019\n\nIn an unusual pool report of Conway\u2019s answers outside the White House, only some of remarks were transcribed, with an audio recording attached. \u201cA lot of digression and insults to the press,\u201d wrote pool reporter Chris Johnson of The Washington Blade. \u201cI won\u2019t transcribe any further unless there\u2019s a demand.\u201d\n\nFrom a retired journalist comes admiration for the stand you took at end of copy.\n\nEnough of their press-bashing!\n\nThank you to the whole pool for putting up with this caca day after day. \u2014 SAKalinich (@SAKalinich) September 27, 2019", "description": "\u201cShe does the worst thing a woman in power can do ... she just changes her mind because the men around her said, \u2019Change your mind,'\" Trump's aide claimed.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8ebade2100003700fc8e0b.jpeg?cache=88cniyd4y7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
