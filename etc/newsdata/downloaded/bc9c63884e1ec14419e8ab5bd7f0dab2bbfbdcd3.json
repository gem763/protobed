However, as nearly three-quarters of respondents actually held less than this amount, the median amount \u2014 the value separating the higher part \u2014 of cryptocurrency owned by U.S. people stands at $360.\n\nMore than half of American crypto holders are considered as \u201ccrypto polygamists\u201d as 55.4% of Bitcoin (BTC) owners surveyed by Finder claimed that they also own another form of cryptocurrency. Similarly to other surveys, Finder\u2019s survey says that men own crypto at nearly twice the rate of women, with 19% of men surveyed claiming they hold some type of crypto versus just 10% of women.\n\n3 Reasons to own and not own crypto\n\nAccording to Finder, the majority of Americans are owning some form of cryptocurrency because they consider it a type of investment. As such, 61% of respondents claimed that own crypto for investment purposes, while just 29.3% said they use it for transaction purposes. Meanwhile, as much as 25.6% of U.S. people hold crypto because they want to store their money outside traditional financial institutions.\n\nOn the other hand, lack of ease of use apparently remains the main reason why Americans preferred to stay away from crypto in 2019. According to Finder, 47.9% responded that crypto is \u201ctoo complicated or difficult to understand\u201d as a reason not to invest in it. That category is followed by 45% of people who simply are not interested in crypto and 23% who believes that crypto is too risky to deal with.\n\nThe results of the new research slightly alters from another crypto-related research that was held earlier this year. On April 30, venture capital firm Blockchain Capital released a survey claiming that 11% of the American population owns Bitcoin.\n\nIn late September, another survey showed that 32% of Europeans believe that crypto is the future of online payments.", "description": "Based on Finder\u2019s survey of 2,068 Americans, 36.5 million people in the United States own some form of crypto to date", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9mNzNkNjVhYjU3NjgwOTAzMzMxY2E3M2ZlYTNjNDZhOC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
