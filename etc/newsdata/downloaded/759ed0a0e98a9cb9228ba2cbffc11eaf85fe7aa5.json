There is a reason President Donald Trump enjoys over 90% approval among Republicans: He is doing exactly what he said he would.\n\n\u201cIn America, the people rule again,\u201d President Trump said recently. It\u2019s about time.\n\nOur votes in 2016 rejected career politicians who gave lip service to our concerns but, once in office, forgot who put them there. The president is doing something novel in politics: keeping his promises. Whether it\u2019s securing our border, holding China accountable, rebuilding our military, negotiating great trade deals or ushering in the best economy in the world, he is delivering.\n\nThese unprecedented victories for all Americans come despite hostile Democratic obstructionists working with swamp saboteurs in futile attempts to overturn our votes.\n\nIt took an outsider unbeholden to the political class to bring real change. President Trump has confidence not only to fight an establishment resistant to change, but confidence in America.\n\nAmerica is no longer to be apologized for, where elites who never created a single job told us our jobs were gone. What we had? We \u201cdidn\u2019t build that.\u201d It was always what we can\u2019t do. Now, it\u2019s what can\u2019t we do. A \u201climitless frontier.\u201d\n\nOUR VIEW: Forget Donald Trump, Republicans. Save the GOP for the sake of your party's future.\n\nA rally on Oct. 9, 2019, in West Jordan, Utah.

Over 150 originalist judges on the federal bench and a historically low unemployment rate are a good start.\n\nThe future for Republicans, and America, has never looked brighter.\n\nLiz Harrington is national spokesperson for the Republican National Committee.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/10/17/rnc-future-and-america-has-never-looked-brighter-editorials-debates/4013283002/", "description": "While Republicans are reviving, Democrats are rebranding as the party of socialists, radicals and rioters, writes Liz Harrington, RNC spokesperson", "authors": ["Liz Harrington", "Opinion Contributor", "Published P.M.
