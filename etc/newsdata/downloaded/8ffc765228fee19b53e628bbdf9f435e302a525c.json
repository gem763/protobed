I was desperate. You will do anything to try to get your son back. Especially when the accused is the last person seen with your son.\"\n\nNaidoo also pointed out that the mother visited Ebrahim in prison on September 2, 2018, but that Ebrahim had been in custody since July 20, 2018.\n\n\"You said the reason for seeing the accused to find out about your son was because [you're] desperate. You say you did this out of desperation. Did your desperation not push you to speak to him earlier than September 2?\"\n\n\"You let the whole of August go without going to ask these questions, and then you go to prison after his bail has been fixed. I put it to you that you wanted to pay his bail for some other reason.\"\n\nLouw denied this.\n\n\"I just wanted to see his face and get answers.\"\n\nRelationship with brother\n\nNaidoo also said that Louw had been involved in a relationship with her former husband's brother and said the brother-in-law couldn't be contacted days after Miguel went missing.\n\n\"Is it not true that no one could find him? Did you look for him? What exactly happened to [him] during that period of time?\"\n\nLouw said she didn't know his whereabouts.\n\n\"I was in a very difficult state of mind. I was not paying attention to where he was.\"\n\nHer son went missing on July 17, 2018 and his badly decomposed remains were found a stone's throw away from Ebrahim's home in Longbury Drive, Phoenix. He was also the last person seen with the boy.\n\nThe matter continues.", "description": "The defence lawyer in the Miguel Louw murder trial has put the murdered boy's mother under the spotlight after she admitted visiting the accused, Mohamed Ebrahim, in jail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9538/712340d82a244c64b19093b9e3cb741d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
