Having traveled to the Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution from Atlanta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida, Russian state TV stringers were stranded for hours filming traffic, building exits and geese on the lawn. Meanwhile, Butina was quietly whisked out of the facility and transferred to the custody of ICE for a speedy deportation back to Russia.\n\nDuring her flight from Miami to Moscow, the crew of Aeroflot transferred Butina from an economy seat at the back of the plane to business-class. Someone offered a traditional Russian gingerbread cookie (pryanik) to sugarcoat Maria\u2019s bitter-sweet voyage. \u201cOnce this plane takes off, it\u2019s all over,\u201d Butina remarked. Aboard the plane, the Russian state media blitz was already underway. RT reporters booked seats on the same flight, documenting Butina\u2019s return to Russia. \u201cI would not make it without my people, citizens of my country,\" Butina told the Russian state media outlet, Sputnik.\n\nAppearing on 60 Minutes\u2014the most popular news talk show in Russia\u2014the correspondent of Russia\u2019s state-TV channel Rossiya-24 Valentin Bogdanov pointed out that the Western media no longer dares to call Butina a spy. \u201cThey\u2019re being careful,\u201d Bogdanov said, speculating that media outlets are afraid of being sued for using the wrong language. In the Kremlin-controlled Russian media, Butina is being described mainly in glowing terms.\n\nThe Motherland welcomed Butina with a mighty bear hug. The host of 60 Minutes , Evgeny Popov, told The Daily Beast: \u201cShe is a hero! You are not.\u201d He could not specify the nature of Butina\u2019s alleged heroic deeds but Popov predicted that Viktor Bout and Konstantin Yaroshenko would soon follow suit and also be released from U.S. custody. Bout is an international arms dealer, convicted of conspiring to sell weapons to a foreign terrorist group and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Yaroshenko was sentenced to 20 years for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s show, Popov exclaimed: \u201cGood news from the United States, which rarely happens! Nonetheless, our compatriot Maria Butina is being released early. Motherland awaits!\u201d Popov\u2019s wife and co-host of 60 Minutes , Olga Skabeeva, claimed that Butina\u2019s confessions and her guilty plea should be disregarded, since they were allegedly extracted by \u201ctorture\u201d in U.S. custody. Popov lamented: \u201cThis person is just a victim! A political prisoner! A victim of the elections! A victim of attacks against Trump and imaginary Russian interference.\u201d Skabeeva added: \u201cThey suddenly let her go, because the scandal with election interference has ended.\u201d\n\nRussian government officials took credit for Butina\u2019s early release. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, \u201cWe\u2019re glad that finally, after very long delays, the American justice system made the decision that we sought.\u201d In reality, Butina was simply released and deported after serving her term.\n\nWorking at the direction of a Russian government official, Alexander Torshin, Butina infiltrated Republican political circles and the National Rifle Association around the time of the 2016 election in order to promote Russian interests. In September of 2019, an investigation by Senate Democrats determined that the NRA has acted as a \u201cforeign asset\u201d in providing Russian officials access to US political organizations.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors argued that Butina\u2019s efforts had the hallmarks of a Russian espionage operation, suggesting that she was acting as a \"spotter\" by identifying people who have the ability to influence policy in Russia\u2019s favor, as a set of targets Russian spies could potentially cultivate. Investigators from special counsel Robert Mueller's team questioned Butina on only one occasion for approximately an hour. Her name was left out of the final version of the Special Counsel\u2019s redacted report. Many questions about the full scope of Maria Butina\u2019s activities in the United States remain unanswered.\n\nRussian government officials have sought to minimize Butina\u2019s role\u2014but so do some of the Republicans. Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie complained that Maria Butina \u201cserved a ridiculously long sentence essentially for not filing the right paperwork.\u201d Massie blamed \u201cthe rampant Russophobia\u201d for the criminal prosecution of a convicted Russian agent. The Russian media immediately re-published and broadcast Massie\u2019s commentary, since it\u2019s in perfect alignment with the version of events supported by the Kremlin. In August, Massie also defended Butina and claimed that James Comey and Peter Strzok, formerly of the FBI, should be imprisoned instead of her.\n\nFor her part, Butina started to condemn U.S. authorities even from prison, having described her conviction and imprisonment as a \u201cterrible shame\u201d upon the American justice system. Butina\u2019s attorneys claimed that Attorney General William Barr\u2019s newly announced criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation would include fact-finding in Butina\u2019s case as well.\n\nDuring her interviews on the plane to Moscow, Butina said: \u201cI would have preferred to be famous for some other reason, but since this is the way it happened\u2014I believe that the world has the right to know the truth about it. I believe that justice will be restored... I\u2019m ready to continue this fight.\u201d Butina told Russian state media that the American rule of law is \u201cjust an illusion.\u201d She also threatened to commence an unspecified legal action to \u201crestore her reputation.\u201d\n\nArriving to Moscow Saturday morning, Maria Butina was greeted with smiles and flowers by Russian government officials\u2014including Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, along with family members, well-wishers and hordes of reporters. Butina said, \u201cI would like to thank the Russian Foreign Ministry and every diplomat who fought hard for me... I did not give up because I knew I could not do that... As I said in one of my videos: the Russians never give up.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt that Maria Butina will be actively used by Russian state media for anti-American propaganda. Butina also has other plans. In April, she told CNN that she might start tutoring Russian students who want to study in America.", "description": "Maria Butina is out of jail and Moscow is celebrating the convicted \u201cspotter\u201d for Russian intelligence.", "authors": ["Julia Davis"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2643,w_4700,x_0,y_225/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572088327/RTS2SW3L_mg3apv", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
