According to hotel data company STR, less than 40% of US hotels are independently owned and operated today. That's down from 60% of hotels three decades ago, Weed wrote.\n\nOne reason for this trend is that operating independently is often more expensive for hotels than operating as part of chain \u2014 especially when it comes to partnering with online booking agencies such as Expedia, according to Weed. \"Hotels generally pay a 15 to 30 percent commission when a traveler uses the online booking agency to reserve a room,\" she wrote. \"But larger companies like Marriott use their market power to negotiate lower booking rates.\"\n\nWhat do modern travelers want?\n\nFor hotel chains, the draw of acquiring boutique hotels includes gaining access to a new set of customers.\n\nTing Phonsanam, cofounder of Momentum Hospitality Management, which helps independent hotels develop their brands, told Weed that hotel chains are expanding their collections of boutique hotels to cater to travelers looking for \"unique, boutique or historic\" accommodations.\n\nHotelier Ian Schrager, whose brands include EDITION and PUBLIC, affirmed this demand for one-of-a-kind hotel stays in conversation with Business Insider's Katie Warren earlier this year. Luxury in hospitality is \"not about wearing a big brand on your sweater,\" he told Warren. \"It's really about being involved in a unique experience and one that makes you feel really good about yourself and really comfortable.\"\n\nSense of place is also important to today's travelers.\n\nIn September, Warren spent three days in Lexington, Kentucky, at a thoroughbred sale. While there, she visited one of the only four-star hotels in the area, a palace on the side of the highway, and found that, while her stay was comfortable, it ultimately lacked a sense of place. \"I was put off by the fact that the hotel didn't feel particularly tied to its Kentucky location,\" she wrote, adding: \"I felt more like I was at Disneyland than at a luxury hotel in Kentucky.\"\n\nMaintaining identity while becoming part of a larger network\n\nThe new challenge that boutique hotels acquired by larger brands face is how to continue delivering one-of-a-kind, memorable experiences\u2060. To do so, these hotels are employing a range of strategies.\n\nKimpton Hotels, a network of 65 boutique hotels acquired by IHG in 2014, asks guests who qualify for their Inner Circle benefit to provide food and newspaper preferences before arrival. Hotel staff use these details to deliver customized welcome packages, Lina Batarags previously reported for Business Insider.\n\nHotelTonight, an online service that allows travelers to book hotels at the last minute at discounted rates, also pays attention to details. Founder Sam Shank told Batarags that \"the best boutique hotels are appealing to people's nostalgia.\" Shank explained further: \"Things like cookies and milk offered before bed, the pillow fight kit one hotel sells, games in the lobby. Hotels need to have things that are memorable and different.\"\n\nIncorporating local, regional goods into hotel stores is another trend employed by boutique brands, Samantha Shankman recently reported for Skift.\n\n\"In the lean toward local, luxury and lifestyle hotels are adding small retail spaces that serve as a tasting menu of regional designers and products,\" she wrote. \"The strategy allows guests to sample the local zeitgeist and take a piece of it home with them.\"\n\nSimilarly, SLS Beverly Hills general manager Christophe Thomas recently told Business Insider's Taylor Borden that incorporating local produce into its restaurant helps tie the global hotel brand to the region.\n\nThese initiatives appear to be paying off, hotel real-estate investor Stephan Chan told Weed. Chan, who helps organize the Independent Lodging Congress, has gathered from attendees that the distinctions between hotel chains and independent hotels are blurring. To travelers, chain-affiliated boutique hotels now appear \"boutique enough,\" he said.", "description": "Hotel chains are acquiring boutique hotels; independent hotels must figure out how to maintain their identities as part of a larger network.", "authors": ["Melissa Wiley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db751a5dee01956d625b6b5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
