And Republicans who want to nationalize the race are crossing their fingers that the incumbent will fall short of 50 percent and give either Abraham or Rispone a one-on-one shot next month against Edwards, who ran a scorched-earth campaign in 2015 and defeated scandal-tarred Republican David Vitter.\n\n\u201cLook, some of the positions that I always held \u2014 and I\u2019ve been clear and consistent about this from the beginning \u2014 are not consistent with the mainstream of the national party,\u201d Edwards said in an interview at the governor\u2019s mansion here last week. \u201cBut they are consistent with an awful lot of Democrats in Louisiana. I\u2019m talking about being pro-life and my Second Amendment views.\u201d\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Rispone launched a negative ad targeting Abraham last month, and Abraham struck back on Monday with a new spot calling Rispone \u201cdesperate,\u201d telling voters, \u201cEddie Rispone is lying to you.\u201d\n\nOf the three off-year gubernatorial elections this fall \u2014 Louisiana, Mississippi, and Kentucky \u2014 the Democratic Governors Association considers holding Louisiana its biggest priority, according to two Democrats with knowledge of national party strategy. And while Republicans, including both Abraham and Rispone, have repeatedly said they are confident they will force a runoff, Democrats have privately begun to entertain the possibility that Edwards could clinch reelection outright on Oct. 12.\n\nDemocrats say Edwards, if he falls just short of 50 percent in the primary, would still be well-positioned for a runoff \u2014 and they see the race as a potential blueprint for how other candidates could win in deep red states during an era of extreme national partisanship.\n\n\u201cFor too long, I feel like our national party has not put enough emphasis on building political infrastructure in rural areas. We\u2019ve seen the cost of that in 2016. We saw some improvement of that in 2018. But that\u2019s a blue wave, not a sea change. And if we want a sea change, not just a wave, then we have to build long-term standing infrastructure in rural communities,\u201d Isaac Wright, a veteran Democratic strategist with extensive experience running southern races, said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re at the precipice. I think there is a chance that for the first time we may recognize that.\u201d\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, said for candidates running in deep red states like Louisiana or Mississippi, avoiding \u201cclose alliance with the national party or national issues\u201d is an effective strategy to localize their races.\n\n\u201cI think John Bel Edwards has focused relentlessly on not trying to get gummed up on some of the issues of the national Democrats and stay relentlessly focused on issues like the economy, Medicaid expansion \u2026 education \u2014 those bread-and-butter issues,\" Hodges said, calling them the \u201csuccessful recipe for Democrats running in Deep South states.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have had little success across the Deep South over the past decade, but there have been some bright spots since Edwards\u2019 2015 victory. In 2017, Alabama Democrat Doug Jones avoided national policy stances and clung closely to health care and education in defeating another controversial Republican, Roy Moore, in a special election for Senate. And while Republicans are favored to hold the governorship in Mississippi next month, Democratic Lt. Gov. Jim Hood is considered Democrats\u2019 strongest candidate in decades.\n\nFaced with Edwards\u2019 profile, Republicans have attacked his record on jobs and health care, rather than just pegging him as a liberal Democrat in line with the party\u2019s unpopular national figures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only state, regardless of what the governor said, that has not created jobs in the last 12 months,\u201d Abraham said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re at the bottom of the barrel in health care and education, fiscal responsibility, job opportunity. Good Lord \u2014 what other issues do you need? I mean this is where we are, and we are better than that.\u201d\n\nEddie Rispone (left), Gov. John Bel Edwards and Rep. Ralph Abraham (right) after a gubernatorial debate this month. | Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP Photos\n\nOn health care, neither Republican supports rolling back Edwards\u2019 Medicaid expansion, but both say the Democrat has bungled the program.\n\n\u201cThe way it\u2019s done is unsustainable,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go broke if we don\u2019t do something. Medicaid is for the people who cannot help themselves \u2014 and we keep expanding and expanding and expanding to more than that.\u201d\n\nBut while both Republicans spend plenty of time hitting Edwards, they have increasingly taken aim at each other in recent weeks. Some public polls have showed Rispone, who has spent more than $11 million of his own money on the campaign, inching in front of Abraham.\n\nAbraham countered last week with internal polling data showing him just two points ahead of Rispone. But the survey showed Edwards at 47 percent \u2014 dangerously close to 50 percent, with Abraham (22 percent) and Rispone (20 percent) well behind the incumbent.\n\nIn a televised debate last week in Lafayette, each GOP candidate worked to peg the other as a political insider. Rispone repeatedly attacked Abraham as a phony Trump supporter while framing himself as the real \u201coutsider and a conservative.\u201d Abraham shot back, saying he\u2019s been a \u201ca doctor, a farmer ... [and] owned three separate businesses\u201d \u2014 while Rispone, a long-time GOP donor, \u201chas been in politics a long time.\u201d\n\nNational Republicans have sought to provide cover while Abraham and Rispone duke it out \u2014 and try to hold Edwards under 50 percent. A group funded by the Republican Governors Association has aired ads attacking Edwards on taxes and Louisiana\u2019s jobs numbers during Edwards\u2019 tenure.\n\nRepublicans also expect Trump to get involved in the race if there's a runoff. But Trump allies, including Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump reelection campaign manager Brad Parscale, have all slammed Edwards on Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile, a pro-Edwards outside group, Gumbo PAC, has continued to air ads bashing the two Republicans. Its latest ad mocks one of the GOP candidates as \"phony Eddie Rispone.\"\n\nDespite Louisiana\u2019s Democratic tradition, no Democratic governor has won a second consecutive term since Edwin Edwards (no relation) won reelection in the mid 1970s. But the current incumbent is confident.\n\n\u201cIf the election were held today, there would not be [a runoff],\u201d John Bel Edwards said in the interview last week. \u201cBut it\u2019s not today. It\u2019s still October the 12th.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the movement I have seen in the last week or so in the polls,\u201d added Edwards. \u201cAnd either we\u2019re going to win on October 12th, or we\u2019re going to come extremely close.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/80/65/f3a0632042d1a767fb6c19fa939d/20190930-john-bel-edwards-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
