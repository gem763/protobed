Here\u2019s What Investors Need to Know.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nMonths after Levi Strauss & Co. returned to the public markets, another denim brand intends to join in. Madewell said this month that it plans its own initial public offering.\n\nThat would make 2019 a busy year for jeans. The March Levi Strauss (ticker: LEVI) IPO was followed in May by the separation of Kontoor Brands (KTB)\u2014owner of Wrangler and Lee, among other things\u2014from VF Corp. (VFC).\n\nWhat can investors expect from Madewell? Read on.\n\nFirst, what is it?\n\nMadewell is a clothing brand that sells in stores and online. Some of its current offerings include women\u2018s skinny jeans for $138, a men\u2019s corduroy long-sleeve shirt for $88, and nylon backpacks for $118.\n\n\u201cOur motto is \u2018Good Days Start with Great Jeans\u2019 because it\u2019s what we truly believe: that stepping into the right pair of jeans is empowering, it makes you feel like the best version of yourself,\u201d wrote CEO Libby Wadle, a former J.Crew and Gap (GPS) executive, in a letter contained in a Sept. 13 pre-IPO filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe brand name itself was acquired in 2005. There were 132 Madewell stores as of Aug. 3, 10 more than a year earlier.\n\nIn the filing, the company listed Gap, American Eagle Outfitters (AEOS), and Urban Outfitters (URBN) among its competitors.\n\nHow will the offering work?\n\nMadewell, part of privately owned J.Crew Group, is currently known as Chinos Holdings. As part of the IPO, Chinos will be renamed Madewell Group and spun off.\n\nStuff like the price, timing, exchange for the listing, and ticker symbol hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The company hasn\u2019t said how many shares will be sold or how much money it expects to raise.\n\nBut Madewell has said some of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt, while some will go toward general corporate purposes.\n\nAnd in separate filings last week, J.Crew suggested an enterprise value\u2014combining the value of the stock with its debt and cash\u2014of between $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion. The company, those filings said, could raise $970 million in the deal. (The fillings said some of the \u201cpotential values\u201d mentioned were for illustrative purposes only.)\n\nSo is Madewell growing?\n\nOn Sept. 13, J.Crew said Madewell\u2019s second-quarter revenues rose 15% year over year, to $139.7 million, as sales at stores open at least a year rose 10%. (J.Crew, by comparison, saw sales fall 7% to $399.1 million as same-store sales fell 4%.)\n\nRevenues for the full year ended Feb. 2 were $613.7 million, up from $463.5 million a year earlier. Gross margins were 48%, down from about 50% the previous year.\n\n\u201cWe intend to grow our business by, among other things, increasing brand awareness and the size and value of our active customer base, growing e-commerce penetration, expanding our store network and product categories and growing our wholesale business, both domestically and internationally,\u201d the company\u2019s pre-IPO filing said.\n\nMadewell expects to open 10 to 15 stores a year. Meanwhile, it wants to drive \u201coutsize growth in e-commerce,\u201d according to its filling. Digital sales represented about 36% of the company\u2019s total revenue in the first half of the current fiscal year.\n\nRetail is a rough business these days, as both Madewell\u2019s growth and the pitfalls that have beset many of its competitors illustrate. Tastes change abruptly, letting new entrants grow quickly. Established brands can fall out of favor, but they also have resources that can help them push back.\n\nDoes Madewell make money?\n\nIn Madewell\u2019s pre-IPO filing, it reported first-half net income of $36 million, up from $28 million a year earlier. Net margins were roughly 11% in both cases. In the last full fiscal year, net income was $60 million, up from about $44 million, while net margins were just below 10%.\n\nSome apparel companies sell a lot of foreign-made goods. What about Madewell?\n\nThe company said 60% of its merchandise came form China in fiscal 2018, with another 20% coming from either Vietnam or Indonesia. The U.S. accounted for 1%. That could pose challenges for Madewell if trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate.\n\nEmail David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.
