I\u2019m a survivor of both childhood sexual abuse, and sexual assault in adulthood.\n\nI decided to build my own life raft\n\nI was abused by someone close to me when I was young, but I only opened up about what had happened to me when I was 17 years old. I then had a breakdown soon after.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted in adulthood. Twice when I was travelling abroad, and again when I was on a date a few years ago.\n\nI went to therapy, I\u2019m on medication, and I have great friends. But about a year ago, I realised that there was still something missing. I felt like I was stranded in an ocean, with only a punctured life raft, and no rescue in sight.\n\nSo I decided to build my own life raft. I began with my website, Life Continues After. Everything I had found online up to that point was quite like standard therapy that you see, whereas I wanted somewhere for people who wanted more general life advice.", "description": "Host Catriona Morton tells the story behind the podcast After: Surviving sexual assault", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07ktzdw.jpg"}
