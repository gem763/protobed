Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, email, Snapchat and WhatsApp group chat notifications never seem to stop, meaning we spend much of our time either trying to shut our phones up, or keeping on top of the endless conversations they draw us into. Unsurprisingly, the constant feedback loop is stressing us out.\n\nStudies conducted in schools in America point to an epidemic of notification-based anxiety for teenagers today. One teacher in South Carolina reported that one of her pupils received almost 150 Snapchat notifications in the space of an hour. It\u2019s no wonder people get addicted to them, though. A Harvard study into the relationship between dopamine and smartphone use: \u201cSmartphones have provided us with a virtually unlimited supply of social stimuli, both positive and negative,\u201d its author Trevor Haynes says. \u201cEvery notification, whether it\u2019s a text message, a 'like' on Instagram or a Facebook notification, has the potential to be a positive social stimulus and dopamine influx.\u201d\n\nWithout fine-tuning which of these notifications make it to our lock screens or not (FOMO has taught us that\u2019s a bad idea anyway), we\u2019re yet to find a proper way of establishing the difference in urgency of a friend in need from the mundanity of a Snapchat selfie -- everything seems to get the same two-buzz treatment. So where does it stop? And how do we find a way to ensure our phones don\u2019t stage a full-blown assault on our senses forever by coercively giving us a dose of dopamine every time they go off?\n\nMore and more of us are -- by necessity -- embracing Do Not Disturb, the feature that rejects all phone calls and turns all notifications to silent, essentially reducing the pang of anxiety that stems from those buzzes. It was originally introduced by Apple on the iPhone back in 2012 as part of an update for iOS 6. Its intended use is for nighttimes only: a way of keeping your phone on without a call or text message waking you up. But an increasing number of young people are starting to keep it on throughout the day as a way of weaning themselves off of technology, spending more time in the real world.\n\n\"The frequent pings and vibrations from our phones cause disruptions by demanding our attention. This can interfere with our ability to focus on getting our work done, and also disrupt our ability to interact in a social situation. This can make us less productive and more stressed.\u201d\n\n23-year-old Liz has been an on-and-off DND user for much of 2019, but a few weeks ago she officially switched it on for good. \u201cSeeing the little crescent moon in the top right of my phone screen is so normal now that it\u2019d be really weird if it turned off,\u201d she tells i-D. \u201cIt was the bombardment of notifications [that got to me].\u201d In some cases, she\u2019s turned off notifications altogether. \u201cBeing in lots of group chats -- especially the work ones -- gave me so much anxiety. Even when I was at home after finishing work, I\u2019d still receive 30+ WhatsApp messages for hours. It just made it hard to switch off.\u201d\n\n24-year-old Scott from Larkhall, just outside Glasgow, has had the same experience with his phone. He decided to turn his phone onto Do Not Disturb and hasn\u2019t looked back since. \u201cI was in quite a bad place mentally,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I needed to take control of many areas of my life and my phone was a big part. It demands you to look at it.\u201d\n\nThe issues with us obsessing over notifications is, right now, two-fold: \u201cThe frequent pings and vibrations from our phones cause disruptions by demanding our attention,\u201d Anna Cox, a professor of Human-Computer Interaction at UCL tells i-D. \u201cThis can interfere with our ability to focus on getting our work done, and also disrupt our ability to interact in a social situation. This can make us less productive and more stressed.\u201d Anna also points out something interesting: that our addiction to interaction through our phones means that, even with notifications turned off, we\u2019re still struggling to wean ourselves off of our phones. \u201cEven when we turn off notifications, people frequently self-interrupt their work,\u201d she says. \u201cSwitching off your notifications can reduce the number of times you pick up your phone and disrupt your work.\u201d\n\nStill, as a temporary solution or a stepping stone to lowering your screen time, young people we\u2019ve spoken to can testify to DND\u2019s mind-calming powers. \u201cI have anxiety and it\u2019s really helped me,\u201d Liz insists, \u201cespecially when your mind\u2019s already working so fast all the time. I can control what I can respond to.\u201d Scott, who's still in the early stages of using it, agrees. \u201c[Our phones have] become such integral parts of our lives nowadays, people aren\u2019t aware that you can actually switch off from it all, and do what you want,\u201d he says. \u201cI would always reply instantly because I was told I had something to reply to, whereas now, I can be doing something and forget about my phone because it doesn\u2019t light up or vibrate, and then I go to it in my own time. That\u2019s had quite a profound effect on my mental health.\u201d\n\nEven in small doses it helps. Jason is a DJ in New York City. He\u2019s opted to keep his Do Not Disturb function on from the moment he goes to sleep until he leaves home the next day. Instead of being bombarded by texts and emails in his downtime, he starts the day in a calmer space. \u201cI\u2019m typically an over-thinker and get wrapped up in random or negative thoughts based on social media,\u201d he says. \u201cThat potentially affects my anxiety -- especially right before bed or when waking up to start the day.\u201d\n\nThe biggest thing stopping us from all plunging into the world of Do Not Disturb full-time is a fear of missing something important, but if you try it out -- say, for 24-hours or so -- you\u2019ll soon realise that the things you once considered unmissable can pass you by with few real life repercussions. Our relationships hinge on being accessible and open, and with read receipts and little green dots confirming that we\u2019re \u2018online\u2019 hanging over us, it almost feels like we have an obligation to respond to anyone who makes contact within a specific and tight timeframe. But the power of shutting off your phone\u2019s flashy attention-seeking traits is underrated, and we wholeheartedly recommend that you try it. When that double buzz disappears, the dopamine rush is attached to something more meaningful instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "By cutting off the constant buzz, many are creating healthier relationships with their phones.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da094ba663430000a943aed/lede/1571042546788-GettyImages-112440320.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.3747xh;0xw,0.0513xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
