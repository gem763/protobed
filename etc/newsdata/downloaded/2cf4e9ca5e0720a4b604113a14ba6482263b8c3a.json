And finally, finally, a fast-charger included in the box, at least for the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nAs for other features I was hoping for, like a universal USB-C port and a super-fast and smooth display, the iPhone 11 didn't quite deliver.\n\nI can fully understand why Apple didn't include most of the features below. Many of them might not be ready for Apple's adoption yet. When Apple feels comfortable enough to add these features, the iPhone will be totally different than it is today. That's why the iPhone 11 feels a bit more like a placeholder while the company works on adding some key, modern smartphone features to its iPhone.\n\nCheck out the features that some may have expected on Apple's iPhone 11, but ultimately didn't make an appearance:", "description": "The iPhone 11 is holding the door for a future iPhone that will likely have some of the modern features from other smartphones.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7bd80e2e22af21741d2783-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
