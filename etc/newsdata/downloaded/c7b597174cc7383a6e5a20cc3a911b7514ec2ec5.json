In fact, it\u2019s getting worse \u2013 even the east coast, an area normally lush and green year-round, is being affected now.\n\nBut the Instagram account The West Is Waiting is trying to get the Morrison government to wake the fuck up and do something about the dire situation our farmers are in right now.\n\nThey\u2019ve started a national movement for farmers and those in drought-stricken areas to put a sign out with the hastag #ScottMorrisonWhereAreYou, in a bid to garner the attention of the Coalition and see some proper plans put in place to assist those suffering.\n\nThe stories of farmers suffering through the drought are harrowing \u2013 recently, SBS News interviewed Kerry Brett, a farmer from Rimbanda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically got no feed on the ground, the paddocks we\u2019re pulling cows out are turning to dust. A few donated bales are fantastic but it doesn\u2019t go far.\u201d \u201cAustralia\u2019s a country of drought. We got through some every few years and the policy around it should have been worked out years ago. There\u2019s no use getting into the middle of the worst drought ever and then saying \u2018what are we going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nIf you want to throw your support behind The West Is Waiting, chuck them a follow \u2013 and if you live rurally in a drought-affected area, make your own sign, put it out, snap a pic and use the hashtag #ScottMorrisonWhereAreYou to join the movement.", "description": "The West Is Waiting is an Instagram account aiming to get Scott Morrison's government's attention, with a push for signs out on properties on Sept 23rd.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-18-at-12.15.54-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
