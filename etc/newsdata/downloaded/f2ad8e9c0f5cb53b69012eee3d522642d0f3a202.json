Sales there declined less than 3%.\n\nOn a call with investors, Mr Cook predicted additional growth in the region and expressed confidence that the US and China would reach an agreement that would avoid additional tariffs.\n\n\"The tone, I think, has changed significantly,\" he said.\n\nApple shares gained almost 2% in after-hours trade.", "description": "Sales of the iPhone fell about 10% from the same period in 2018.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/089F/production/_109470220_gettyimages-1173632510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
