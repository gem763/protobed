The Solomon Islands severed ties with Taiwan when it established them with Beijing.\n\n\"I am pleased to recognise the one China policy ... We are pleased to be on the right side of history and normalise relations with the People's Republic of China,\" Sogavare said ahead of a meeting with Li and a Chinese delegation.\n\nChina has in recent years been expanding its influence in the Pacific to the alarm of the United States and its main regional ally, Australia.\n\nChina and the Solomon Islands signed an agreement to work together on President Xi Jinping's flagship foreign policy initiative, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as well as others on economic and education strategies.\n\nAfter the Solomon Islands recognised Beijing, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence declined a request from the Solomon Islands leader to meet to discuss cooperation.\n\nTaiwan President Tsai Ing Wen said last month the end of its diplomatic relations with the Solomon Islands was further evidence of Chinese efforts to meddle in Taiwan's January elections.
