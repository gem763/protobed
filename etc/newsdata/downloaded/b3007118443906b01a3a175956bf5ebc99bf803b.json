We pool our money, and buy America back from Donald Trump,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf America truly is a Trump property, eventually it\u2019s gonna plummet in value, and we can buy it back for pennies on the dollar.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile earlier this month, Brennan also suggested that Trump\u2019s voters may eventually turn their back on him\n\n\u201cTrump treats his voters like the dude at the club who talks crazy shit expecting his boys to back him up in a fight,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Eventually they\u2019ll be like \u2018It\u2019s on you dude.'\u201d\n\nTrump treats his voters like the dude at the club who talks crazy shit expecting his boys to back him up in a fight. Eventually they'll be like \"It's on you dude.\" \u2014 Neal Brennan (@nealbrennan) October 1, 2019\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com", "description": "\"Chappelle's Show\"\u00a0co-creator\u00a0Neal Brennan proposed a crowdfunding campaign to \"buy America back\" from President Trump, because he thinks he owns the country.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nealbrennan1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
