And bring it to the world stage, let the world see it.\"\n\nNewman, 25, of London, Ont., also reached new heights this season, securing a national record in women's pole vault with a 4.82-metre jump in Paris last month.\n\nWATCH | Alysha Newman: 'I'm ready to come out with a medal':\n\nCanadian pole vault record holder Alysha Newman has beaten some of the world's best this season and is looking to end her season on a high note. 2:06\n\n\"I'm really excited. I mean 4.82 was definitely the goal, but that was the goal for last year,\" Newman said. \"So I feel like I just conquered last year's goal. So I know there's another bar under my belt. I'm ready to jump high. I'm ready to come out with a medal.\"\n\nDe Grasse, who broke out at the Rio Olympics in 2016 with three medals, has experienced ups and downs this season. But after switching coaches in December, De Grasse feels like he is easing back into form.\n\nWATCH | Andre De Grasse: 'I'm back, I'm healthy':\n\nTriple Olympic medallist Andre De Grasse discusses his new attitude heading into the world championships. 1:46\n\n\"I think change is good sometimes. When things weren't going right, I try to just do something new,\" the 24-year-old said of working with Rana Reider. \"So far it's been going good. The season has been going great with my new coach and new environment. So I'm pretty happy about it and I'm running back to quick times [like] when I was running in 2016.\"\n\nDe Grasse strained his right hamstring during a training run days before the start of the 2017 worlds. So the two-time 2015 medallist seems especially motivated this year.\n\n\"I'm back. I'm healthy. I'm feeling pretty good. I'm looking forward to my second world championship. So I'm looking to have some great success here and try to get back on the podium.\"\n\nCBC Sports has exclusive live coverage of the 2019 World Track & Field Championships from Sept. 27-Oct. 6.
