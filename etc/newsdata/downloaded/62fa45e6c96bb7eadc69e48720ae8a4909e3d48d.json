It ultimately won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement, but NBC\u2019s objection to the bombshell has been a mystery ever since.\n\nNBC NEWS LABELED AN \u2018UNREPENTANT BOYS CLUB\u2019 AMID LATEST SORDID ALLEGATIONS\n\n\u201cOne year ago, I resigned from NBC News because they ordered me to stop reporting on Harvey Weinstein,\u201d McHugh wrote to kick off the lengthy Vanity Fair piece that directly blames embattled NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim.\n\n\u201cLack and Oppenheim were the ones who were lying,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey not only personally intervened to shut down our investigation of Weinstein, they even refused to allow me to follow up on our work after Weinstein\u2019s history of sexual assault became front-page news.\u201d\n\nMcHugh said Lack and Oppenheim \u201cbehaved more like members of Weinstein\u2019s PR team than the journalists they claim to be\u201d and NBC has suffered as a direct result of their action.\n\n\u201cThanks to them, a leading national news organization, in broad daylight and with zero remorse, abdicated its single greatest responsibility\u2014to relentlessly pursue and tell the truth,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER\n\nOne year ago, I resigned from NBC News because they ordered me to stop reporting on Harvey Weinstein \u2014 Former NBC News producer Rich McHugh\n\nMcHugh explained that Oppenheim initially ordered the Weinstein investigation, which resulted in \u201cnow-infamous audio from an NYPD sting operation in which Weinstein admitted to sexually assaulting a model.\u201d Rich Greenberg, the head of the investigative unit at NBC News, told McHugh and Farrow that Weinstein would be \u201ctoast\u201d if the recording aired, according to the op-ed.\n\n\u201cBut the more reporting we gathered, the more nervous the network got,\u201d McHugh wrote. \u201cThey began raising a range of strange and convoluted concerns about our work. Maybe Ronan had a conflict of interest, they argued, because his father, Woody Allen, had helped Weinstein\u2019s career nearly 30 years earlier. Or maybe we were engaging in what is known as \u2018tortious interference\u2019 by speaking to women who had signed nondisclosure agreements with Weinstein.\u201d\n\nThe former NBC News producer said that he was repeatedly told to \u201cpause\u201d the Weinstein investigation despite the fact that it had been \u201cvetted and cleared\u201d by NBC\u2019s lawyers. After spending eight months digging into Weinstein\u2019s past, McHugh said that Greenberg gave him a message directly from Oppenheim.\n\nMATT LAUER BREAKS SILENCE ON RAPE ACCUSATION: READ HIS LETTER HERE\n\n\u201cNoah was very, very clear,\u201d Greenberg told McHugh, according to the op-ed. \u201cNo further calls. You are to stand down.\u201d\n\nMcHugh said he was furious and documented the situation in an email he sent to himself, along with Farrow. McHugh indicated that a separate Weinstein-relate scoop, unrelated to sexual misconduct, was also mysteriously shut down by NBC News. Not long after, McHugh said Farrow was \u201cdisinvited\u201d from a scheduled appearance on the \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\n[T]he more reporting we gathered, the more nervous the network got \u2014 Former NBC News producer Rich McHugh\n\nMcHugh said he then learned that Farrow\u2019s agent heard from Weinstein directly.\n\n\u201c[Weinstein] is saying that NBC promised him yesterday that the story was killed and they would not pursue any stories about him\u2026 he said he doesn\u2019t want to threaten me but is prepared to \u2018come after\u2019 me legally,\u201d Farrow reportedly texted McHugh.\n\nAccording to McHugh, Farrow then explained that NBC\u2019s in-house legal team assured him that \u201call stories about him were dead and all reporting on him was halted\u201d and that \u201cno one is allowed to use NBC while reporting on him.\u201d\n\nLAUER\u2019S OFFICE SEXCAPADES KNOWN TO MEDIA ELITES, WHO ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OVER LEWD JOKES AT 2008 \u2018ROAST\u2019\n\nMcHugh said that shortly afterwards his phone was hacked and the culprit also wanted access to his emails. He said that two different intelligence firms \u2013 including one \u201ccomprised largely of former Mossad members\u201d-- were to blame.\n\n\u201cI felt in my gut I was being watched,\" he wrote. \"It\u2019s hard to describe, but it\u2019s as if some animal instinct kicks in, and renders you alert. A former Weinstein Company executive we interviewed had explicitly warned us, in fact, about what was going to happen to us. Regular emails about us went to Harvey\u2019s inbox, letting him know precisely which sources were \u2018working with Ronan Farrow and Rich McHugh on the HW report.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcHugh said that his home was also broken into around the same time and he warned his wife and four young daughters to proceed with extreme caution.\n\n\u201cWhat I faced from my bosses at NBC, though, felt worse than being spied on by Weinstein\u2019s paid thugs,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a reporter, you expect the powerful people you\u2019re investigating to play rough. What\u2019s harder to experience is the stress and anxiety of being attacked from the inside, by the people who are supposed to have your back.\u201d\n\nNBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM\n\nMcHugh then detailed how NBC downplayed the Weinstein story once it became public via The New York Times.\n\n\u201cSix weeks after NBC News halted our investigation, Ronan published our Weinstein reporting in the New Yorker. I was sitting at my desk when it was posted online, and an audible buzz quickly spread through the newsroom,\u201d McHugh wrote. \u201cStressed-looking executives began hustling in and out of closed-door meetings.\u201d\n\nMcHugh then revisited Farrow\u2019s infamous appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show,\u201d when he said NBC News was \u201cnot accurate\u201d when it claims his reporting was not fit to print. McHugh then called Lack\u2019s defense of NBC\u2019s decision an \u201coutright lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmily Nestor, one of the women who agreed to go on the record in our story, rightfully hammered Lack and NBC News. The network, she made clear, had simply decided that it was no longer interested in what she and so many other women had to say,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet in a statement to Vanity Fair for this story, NBC continues to portray Nestor as \u2018unwilling to be outed.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat I faced from my bosses at NBC, though, felt worse than being spied on by Weinstein\u2019s paid thugs \u2014 Former NBC News producer Rich McHugh\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK\u2019S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES\n\nMcHugh then lists a series of other statements by Lack, Oppenheim and other NBC executives that he considers lies and mischaracterizations.\n\n\u201cThey had not only killed our investigation\u2014they continued to bury our reporting, even after it became a national news story,\u201d he wrote before detailing a tense meeting he eventually had with Oppenheim.\n\n\u201cOppenheim walked a tightrope with his responses, and we all left with even more questions than we started with. If his intention was to get everyone on board with the official narrative, he had completely failed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOppenheim told me that NBC was severing its remaining ties with Ronan\u2014he would no longer have any affiliation with the network. He also insisted that there was a \u2018consensus\u2019 across the organization that Ronan and I never had enough reporting to support a story that Weinstein was a serial predator\u2014a laughable claim, given that it had taken Ronan only six weeks to finish our investigation and publish it in the New Yorker, where it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize.\u201d\n\nThe former NBC News producer went on to detail a series of angry outbursts by Oppenheim.\n\n\u201cOppenheim blamed me and Ronan, perversely insisting that we were the ones who had killed the story,\u201d McHugh wrote. \u201cIn Oppenheim\u2019s mind, he was somehow the victim here. He had launched an amazing and important investigation, only to be saddled with two journalists who just didn\u2019t live up to his exceptional standards. Never mind that the New Yorker found a way to publish the same investigation he had killed. Never mind that he was continuing to sit on the results of that investigation while every other news outlet in the country pursued it. He, Noah Oppenheim, was the hero of the tale.\u201d\n\nCNN, MSNBC IGNORE MATT LAUER RAPE ALLEGATIONS, NBC SCANDAL DURING PRIME TIME\n\nMcHugh said he was being \u201cgaslighted\u201d by NBC News and Farrow\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d reveals that Oppenheim was lying all along about both Weinstein and then-NBC anchor Matt Lauer, who was fired for sexual misconduct weeks later.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMcHugh \u2013 who now works for Al Gore\u2019s climate change company -- said he was \u201cprevented from doing my job simply because I told the truth\u2014at a news organization, no less\u201d but left a gift for his former NBC colleagues.\n\n\u201cI left all of the interviews that Ronan and I had done during our Weinstein investigation in an unlocked drawer, for anyone to read or watch, should they too have a need to look for the truth,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "Former NBC News producer Rich McHugh penned a scathing firsthand account of the \u201cmassive breach of journalistic integrity\u201d that resulted in the Peacock Network refusing to expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Former Nbc News Producer Rich Mchugh", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
