(Image: G. Poinar et al., 2019)\n\nAn analysis of 30-million-year-old amber has resulted in the discovery of a previously unknown microscopic creature from the Cenozoic period. Bearing a resemblance to tardigrades (aka water bears), these now-extinct \u201cmould pigs,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed, are unlike anything seen before.\n\nIntroducing Sialomorpha dominicana, a newly discovered microinvertebrate found locked in amber from the Dominican Republic. Its discoverers, paleobiologist George Poinar Jr. from Oregon State University and invertebrate zoologist Diane Nelson from East Tennessee State University, have dubbed the creature a \u201cmould pig\u201d in honour of its portly, porcine appearance and its diet, which consisted primarily of fungi. Details of the discovery were recently published in Invertebrate Biology.\n\nThe 83-year-old Poinar is no stranger to working with fossils trapped in amber. His 1982 research paper gave sci-fi author Michael Crichton the idea of extracting dinosaur DNA from insects trapped in amber, as portrayed in the film Jurassic Park.\n\nPoinar has made a career working with amber, finding fossilised flies, bees, bats and ancient flowers.\n\nThis time around, however, Poinar, along with Nelson, discovered a creature that\u2019s invisible to the human eye \u2014 a microinvertebrate measuring no more than 100 micrometres long.\n\nAdult mould pigs in amber.

Poinar et al., 2019)\n\n\u201cIt took me many days, weeks, and months to examine [the specimens], and then under the compound microscope, \u201c Poinar wrote in an email to Gizmodo. \u201cThey are as small as the smallest tardigrades, and they have eight legs like tardigrades. However they possess mandibles but no claws, whereas tardigrades have claws and stylet mouthparts,\u201d meaning a sharp, piercing mouthpiece.\n\nThe amber fossil analysed by Poinar and Nelson contained literally hundreds of mould pig specimens, allowing them to study a host of different biological aspects, including their anatomy, reproductive behaviour, growth, development, and diet. For example, the mould pigs featured flexible heads and they grew by molting their exoskeleton.\n\nThe researchers also discovered other creatures locked inside the amber, including pseudoscorpions, nematode worms, fungi and various protozoa. The mould pigs preferred warm, moist environments, where they fed on fungi and sometimes other small invertebrates, the researchers found.\n\nBecause nothing comparable exists in the scientific record, whether extinct or extant, the mould pigs were assigned to an entirely new family, genus, and species. The \u201cfossil shares characteristics with both tardigrades and mites, but clearly belongs to neither group,\u201d wrote the authors in their paper. Its major distinguishing features \u201care its mouthparts in combination with the lack of claws, four pairs of legs, terminal anus, and reproductive openings,\u201d Poinar told Gizmodo.\n\nThe researchers don\u2019t know when this family of invertebrates originated, how long it lasted, or if any descendants are still around today. The discovery shows that extremely tiny animals were able to live in Cenozoic microhabitats, and that these creatures could use fungi as a food source, according to Poinar.\n\nTardigrades, nicknamed water bears, are known for their extreme resiliency, as they\u2019re able to survive long-term deep-freezing and the vacuum of space. We can only guess as to whether these mould pigs would have possessed similar powers.", "description": "An analysis of 30-million-year-old amber has resulted in the discovery of a previously unknown microscopic creature from the Cenozoic period.
