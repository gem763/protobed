She\u2019s doing really well and I know she\u2019s a good mum.\n\n'But you can imagine how hard it was for me. Some 20-year-old being called dad in her last relationship.

People need to believe that you can change.\n\n'A leopard never changes his spots isn't true \u2013 I have proven that I have rehabilitated. I hope over a two year period I've shown that. I was an embarrassment to myself. I acted like a f**king d**khead.'\n\nThe former Celebrity Big Brother star suffered the devastating loss of his mother, brother and sister within months of each other when he was a teenager and his dad lost his battle with cancer in 2017.\n\nTough: The ex-model said he struggled to see Caben spend time with Stephanie's ex Owen Warner and found the 'whole thing really distastful' (pictured earlier this year)\n\nMoving on: Jeremy says he's living proof a leopard can change its spots and going to prison in 2017 was a massive 'wake up call' (pictured in 2017)\n\nHe said his 'bad boy' image was just a persona he adopted as he fell down a dangerous path of drink and drug taking.\n\nJeremy continued: 'My dad always told me where there's drink, there's trouble.\n\n'People don\u2019t realise when you have depression and a mental illness that you don\u2019t like yourself as a person.\n\n'Especially when you don\u2019t have your parents around saying what's right or wrong. But I can't change the past.\n\nStraight and narrow: The businessman said coming out of prison and starting afresh was' hard because in this country people don\u2019t accept rehabilitation' (pictured in August 2017)\n\n'I was trying to be a bad boy but really I'm not. I was a virgin until I was 18!
