But Juul insiders agree that the move could help curb underage vaping and avert an even bigger threat to the market-leading e-cigarette maker: the possibility that the Food and Drug Administration could take Juul off the market altogether.\n\nThough the company has decided to support a ban on most flavors, there remains a point of disagreement around menthol and mint. Some inside the company want to lobby the Trump administration to make an exception for one or both of those flavors, arguing that if Juul\u2019s goal is to convert cigarette smokers, it should offer an option for smokers of menthols, according to one of the people.\n\nFDA officials in the past had expressed reluctance to restrict sales of menthol-flavored vaping products, saying that they represent a less-harmful alternative for smokers of combustible menthol cigarettes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Alex Azar, the secretary for Health and Human Services, cited preliminary data from a federal survey showing that the popularity of mint and menthol e-cigarettes had surged this year among teens. Nearly 28% of high-school students surveyed this year reported vaping at least once in the past 30 days, up from 21% last year, according to the data.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s plan is to pull every vaping product off the market, except for those formulated to taste like tobacco. Juul\u2019s tobacco-flavored pods represent less than 20% of the company\u2019s U.S. sales, according to people familiar with the matter. The brand\u2019s most popular flavors are mint and mango. Some Juul users could switch to a tobacco flavor if no other were available. But some vapers could go back to smoking traditional cigarettes, analysts say.\n\nBlamed for the rise in teen vaping in the U.S. and under investigation by the FDA, Federal Trade Commission, congressional committees and several state attorneys general, Juul has been pushing to expand overseas. The startup recently issued $785 million in convertible debt, in part to fund that expansion. It launched this week in China, its 19th country.\n\nIn the first half of 2019, Juul had $1.27 billion in global revenue, including more than $100 million outside the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nJuul last year voluntarily stopped selling its sweet and fruity flavors in bricks-and-mortar stores, but continued selling flavors like mango and cucumber on its website, which has age controls. Since then, it has called on regulators to crack down on a proliferation of Juul knockoffs and other competitors who have crowded the market with fruity-flavored products that health officials say are appealing to young people. Several Juul investors said this week they welcomed tighter oversight of the industry because it could clear out counterfeit, kid-friendly and potentially hazardous products and allow regulated products to remain.\n\nThe landscape will change in May 2020, when e-cigarette manufacturers must apply for an FDA review of any vaping product they want to sell beyond that point. They can also apply to bring flavored products back on the market.\n\nJuul is preparing application materials for four flavors\u2014mint, menthol, mango and Virginia tobacco\u2014in two nicotine strengths, 5% and 3%, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nJuul also has had internal discussions on renaming its popular mint-flavored pods to a menthol variant as part of that application, the people said. A Juul spokesman said Thursday that the company would make its submissions to the agency by May but hasn\u2019t made a final decision on which products to submit.\n\n\u2014Juliet Chung contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "description": "Juul is debating internally whether to embrace or push back on part of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to pull most e-cigarettes from the market, according to people familiar with the matter.", "authors": ["Jennifer Maloney", "Jennifer.Maloney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106763/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
