Lowering the blood pressure of pacifists everywhere, Trump reportedly isn\u2019t interested in a strike on Iran following an attack on a Saudi oil facility that may still potentially put a major dent in the market. (U.S. officials believe Tehran is behind the drone strike.) Bringing that same blood pressure back to Cheney-ian levels of hypertension, NBC News reports that the administration is preparing possible sites for retaliatory strikes or cyberattacks, just in case the president leans toward action:\n\nIn a national security meeting on Monday, U.S. military leaders provided President Donald Trump with a menu of possible actions against Iran. But the president, seeking a narrowly focused response that wouldn\u2019t draw the U.S. into broader military conflict with Iran, asked for more options, people briefed on the meeting said \u2026\n\nIn the wake of Sunday\u2019s attack, U.S. military planners have revisited a long-identified list of potential Iranian targets that could constitute a proportional response. Those include a strike on Iran\u2019s Abadan oil refinery, one of the world\u2019s largest, or Kharg Island, Iran\u2019s biggest oil export facility. Attacks on either location would significantly impede Iran\u2019s ability to process and sell oil, which the Trump administration has already been working to restrict after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nOther possibilities include hitting missile launch sites, bases or other assets belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite Iranian military unit blamed for much of Iran\u2019s paramilitary operations against adversaries outside of the country.\n\nUnlike the president\u2019s claim on Monday that the U.S. military is essentially a mercenary force sold to the highest bidder on the Arabian peninsula, NBC reports that the administration is considering a plan in which the Saudi military would strike Iran, with U.S. forces staying at a proxy distance. To be clear, the report indicates that military action is not imminent and that \u201cno decision has been made.\u201d And even if the president decides to target Iran, he could revoke his decision, as he did in June, when Trump called off a retaliatory strike following the downing of an American drone while planes were in the air.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s \u201clocked and loaded\u201d posturing, it appears that he is still reluctant to directly engage Iran. In a report from Politico on Tuesday, Trump does not want military action, as it conflicts with his \u201ccampaign vows to reduce foreign entanglements.\u201d But a campaign pledge has never stopped the president before; a more pressing matter he is considering involves a possible recession caused by an Iran conflict hurting his chances at reelection.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Trump mused: \u201cDo I want war? I don\u2019t want war with anybody. I\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war.\u201d Thankfully, most Americans agree: In a Gallup poll from August, 78 percent of citizens prefer \u201ceconomic/diplomatic\u201d measures to military ones. At the same time, Trump \u2014 ever the mixed messenger \u2014 said Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
