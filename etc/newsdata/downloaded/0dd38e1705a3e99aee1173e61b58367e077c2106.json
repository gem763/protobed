Some of them are Draconian.\n\nThis is one of those times.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSaints\u2019 Demario Davis fined for headband\n\nEarlier this week, New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis posted a photo to Instagram of a black headband that had \u201cMan of God\u201d written on it.\n\nUnder the picture, Davis told his followers that the NFL had fined him $7,000 for wearing the headband during the Saints\u2019 Week 3 game.\n\nNew Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis was fined by the NFL for wearing this 'Man of God' headband. (Getty Images)\n\nHe asked if he should continue wearing it, but perhaps knowing that a second fine for the same infraction is doubled, he didn\u2019t end up wearing it for last week\u2019s game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nDavis was fined because the headband violated the \u201cpersonal message\u201d rule under uniform violations. Based on photos, it was not the first time Davis wore the headband.\n\nFour years ago, then-Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams was fined for the same violation, after wearing eye black with a pink breast cancer awareness ribbon - during breast cancer awareness month.\n\nDavis\u2019 exact fine was $7,017 for the first offense; the fine for a second offense is $14,037.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t even fully aware of it\u2019\n\nDavis\u2019 Instagram post got 11,000 likes and over 3,800 comments, with many encouraging Davis to continue wearing the headband and others in disbelief that he was fined for expressing his faith.\n\nThe veteran linebacker said he wasn\u2019t expecting the reaction the photo got.\n\n\u201cI don't think a lot of people were aware of the policy that was in place - I wasn't even fully aware of it,\u201d Davis told the Times-Picayune. \u201cI just wanted to put it out and just kind of help fans who care about the game understand a more intricate part of the game.\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t like losing money, but saw a silver lining in some of the discussion that came with it.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOf course you don't want to be fined,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to lose money but I think any time that the conversation about God is brought up, especially in these times, I think it's always a positive or silver lining. If he can get glory from it, I think he can get glory from it whether I personally wear the headband or don't wear the headband. He's always gonna be in control of the whole situation. We're still all good.\u201d\n\nDavis has 28 total tackles, two tackles for loss and a quarterback hit in four starts this season, his second with the Saints.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Davis violated the rule against \"personal messages.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SgPGv5kHljrOi5SHl1jwyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eLP5NzOAs43URlGkhDOpvw--~B/aD0zMjE2O3c9NDgyNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/b147e280-e6b8-11e9-be9c-8c5f54737732", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
