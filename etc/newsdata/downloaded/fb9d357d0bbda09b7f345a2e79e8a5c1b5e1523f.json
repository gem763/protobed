Currently, if students who have taken the test more than once want colleges to see their best subscores, they have to send in multiple test results.\n\n\u201cThey might think, \u2018Why do I have to sit through and take all these tests again if I only need to improve my math score?\u201d Ed Colby, an ACT spokesman, said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to save them time. We\u2019re trying to save them money.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear whether colleges would evaluate applicants with the same test score differently if one acquired the score in a single sitting and one had a superscore. Some colleges already do their own superscoring, combining a student\u2019s highest section scores across multiple test dates. But until now, the ACT had not provided an official superscore.\n\nStudents can take the test up to 12 times, though most take it only once or twice. According to the ACT, research shows that students who take the test more than once have slightly higher first-year college grades than those who take the test a single time. The organization\u2019s theory is that those students are motivated to succeed, which translates into better academic performance.\n\nTaking the whole test costs $52 without the optional writing section, and $68 with it. ACT officials said taking an individual section would be cheaper, but they had not yet decided on a price.", "description": "Starting next September, high schoolers won\u2019t need to repeat the entire ACT exam to improve their score.", "authors": ["Anemona Hartocollis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/us/08ACT/08ACT-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
