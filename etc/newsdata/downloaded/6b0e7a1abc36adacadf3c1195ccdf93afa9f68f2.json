It's something we've had to get used to pretty quickly and I think coming out three weeks prior to the tournament starting definitely gave us a chance to practice in those conditions a bit more,\" he said.\n\n\"With a closed roof it should be an increased humidity level, but I think our game plan and structure should stay the same. With the roof open or closed, it is slippery most of the time.\n\n\"We'll put an emphasis on ball carrying and at the breakdown providing a good platform for our halfbacks. I think it's more just an attitude to looking after the ball.\"\n\nLouw will start the match at No 8 and kick-off will be at 12:15 (SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Damian Willemse, 14 Warrick Gelant, 13 Damian de Allende, 12 Frans Steyn, 11 Sbu Nkosi, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Cobus Reinach, 8 Francois Louw, 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Schalk Brits, 1 Thomas du Toit\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Eben Etzebeth, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Herschel Jantjies, 22 Handre Pollard, 23 Willie le Roux\n\nCanada\n\n15 Andrew Coe; 14 Jeff Hassler, 13 Conor Trainor, 12 Ciaran Hearn, 11 DTH van der Merwe; 10 Peter Nelson, 9 Phil Mack; 8 Tyler Ardron (captain), 7 Matt Heaton, 6 Lucas Rumball; 5 Kyle Baillie, 4 Evan Olmstead; 3 Jake Ilnicki, 2 Andrew Quattrin, 1 Hubert Buydens\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Benoit Piffero, 17 Djustice Sears-Duru, 18 Matt Tierney, 19 Josh Larsen, 20 Michael Sheppard, 21 Jamie Mackenzie, 22 Shane O'Leary, 23 Guiseppe du Toit\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "When the Springboks meet Canada in their final Pool B match at the Rugby World Cup on Tuesday, they will do so under a closed roof at the Kobe Misaki Stadium.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7896/34175fa1346540b890ef245caa8eef24.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
