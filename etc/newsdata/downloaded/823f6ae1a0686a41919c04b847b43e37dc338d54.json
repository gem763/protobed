We cut taxes for hard-working Americans. We passed the most comprehensive response to combat the opioid crisis. We slashed regulations. And we reinvested in our military to make our country stronger.\u201cThe President also spoke about the ongoing fight to stop human trafficking while proactively supporting the survivors of these despicable traumas. \u201cThis scourge is part of the central challenge facing our nation: securing the southern border. The President reaffirmed his determination to prevent crime and drugs from flowing across the border and threatening the stability and security of our communities. The challenge is also a humanitarian crisis, affecting not only those who seek to enter the United States but also the American families devastated by destructive drugs and crime. We must solve this crisis. \u201cPresident Trump is moving our country forward and I remain committed to working with him and my colleagues in Congress to secure our borders and ensure continued prosperity through higher wages and stronger economic opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Townhall.com features Political Blogs, Conservative Blogging, the Republican Blogspot, Write your own Blog, Post Comments, over one million Bloggers\" /><meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Political, Conservative, Republican, Blogs, Blogging, Bloggers, Blogspot, Townhall.com, Townhall, Town Hall, Write your own blog, post comments.09/02/2019 3:07:56AM EST.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/37/d1363c2c-6e77-4e25-9cc4-3f6249b39546.jpg"}
