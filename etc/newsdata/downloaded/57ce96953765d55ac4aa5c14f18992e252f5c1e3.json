It reports his latest plans were thrown into chaos after MPs voted to withhold their approval, and says the prime minister will call on EU leaders to reject any Brexit extension.\n\nThe Observer (@ObserverUK) Tomorrow\u2019s front page pic.twitter.com/YNnY4oi8c7\n\nThe Mirror takes a similar tack, with the one-word headline: \u201cHumiliated.\u201d It says \u201cBlustering Boris was beaten again\u201d and notes his multiple, contradictory letters to EU leaders. It says MPs could now vote on the deal on Monday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Mirror\n\nThe Sunday Times headline is: \u201cBoris fights \u2018Brexit wreckers\u2019 with three defiant letters to the EU.\u201d Using combative language, it reports Johnson \u201copened a new front in his battle for Brexit\u201d and says the three letters were an effort to circumvent a plot that he branded \u201cdeeply corrosive\u201d.\n\nThe Sunday Times (@thesundaytimes) The Sunday Times reveals Boris Johnson's audacious response to the 'Brexit wreckers' #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/HsFqSMklIf\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph makes a virtue of Johnson\u2019s refusal to sign the Brexit extension request mandated by the Benn Act. In bullet points below, it quotes Johnson as saying the letter \u201cis not from me\u201d. It carries a comment piece by Juliet Samuel, below, in which she speaks of the likely public frustration after \u201cMPs found another ruse to prolong the nation\u2019s agony and postpone, yet again, their own reckoning with reality\u201d.\n\nThe Telegraph (@Telegraph) The front page of tomorrow's Sunday Telegraph: 'Johnson refuses to sign Brexit delay letter' #TomorrowsPapersToday #brexit pic.twitter.com/viMo7iuQ1y\n\nOther papers focus more on Commons MPs than Johnson. The Daily Mail says simply in its headline: \u201cThe house of fools.\u201d It carries pictures of Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Oliver Letwin, John Bercow and Philip Hammond and reports the \u201cnation let out a collective howl of frustration\u201d after the Letwin amendment was passed.\n\nPhotograph: MAIL ON SUNDAY\n\nThe Sunday Express asks, on a very dark, poster-style front page: \u201cWhy won\u2019t they let us leave?\u201d It reports that Parliament has voted to obstruct \u201cBoris\u2019s breakthrough Brexit deal\u201d.", "description": "Newspapers cast prime minister as either a fighter or a loser, with plenty of anger directed at Parliament, too", "authors": ["Graham Russell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e6f51c962cfc7f7e2cad558a4c652c406c3647/0_0_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4819467c24bd27ac3a32318702894b8f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
