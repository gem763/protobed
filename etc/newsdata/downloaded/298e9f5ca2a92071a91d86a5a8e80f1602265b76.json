I\u2019m a worthless, Jewish rodent. I\u2019m vermin.\u2019\n\nShe said he was also called a \u2018dirty Jew\u2019 and \u2018Jewish cockroach.\u2019\n\nThe mother said: \u2018I grew up with Holocaust survivors, I used to go to synagogue with my uncle who was a Holocaust survivor and those were the words, literally, he was taunted with when he was five.\u2019\n\nHe was picked on by a group of other boys around a similar age and the victim\u2019s mother has spoken to the parents of the boy whose feet he kissed, who she says is Muslim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told The Age: \u2018We sat down, his parents, the two boys and myself, around the table and explained the velocity of [the bullying] and what it meant to us as parents as far as building bridges between Jews and Muslims in society and not creating division like that photo does.\n\nHowever, when she reported the incident to the boys\u2019 school she was told that because it did not happen on school grounds it was not their responsibility.\n\nThe mother said: \u2018I took such offence with the Education Department, because there was nothing they did to protect my son at all, at any point in time \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s cut me up.\u2019\n\nShe said that he had also been bullied in the bathroom at school but was told he should just use another bathroom instead.\n\n\u2018They refused to accept there was anti-Semitic issue. \u201dIt\u2019s not anti-Semitism, it\u2019s just bullying\u201d. The principal said, \u201dI don\u2019t want to make other students feel uncomfortable.\u201d,\u2019 the mother said.\n\nPolice robot told woman to go away after she tried to report crime - then sang a song\n\nIn another incident, a five-year-old boy was mocked so much for being circumcised that he wet himself rather than use the toilet.\n\nThe school said in a statement after the incident: \u2018While school staff were not able to substantiate that any negative interactions were anti-Semitic in nature, on the basis of those investigations, school staff identified an incident that involved children laughing at [the boy].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This was not acceptable and would have been an unpleasant experience for [the boy]. I am sorry that this occurred.\u2019\n\nChairman of Australia\u2019s Anti-Defamation Commission Dr Dvir Abramovich told MailOnline: \u2018This is stain on Victoria\u2019s education system that will long endure. Bullying and harassment of Jewish students at public schools is a deeply embedded virus that is reaching pitch-fever and should alarm us all. We are gradually reaching a point of no return.\n\n\u2018To think that in 2019 Jewish pupils are subjected to violence, verbal insults and taunts, bigoted jokes, social exclusion, demeaning text messages and malicious Facebook posts is heartbreaking.\n\n\u2018The kids are shaken and traumatised. Too often, parents are concerned that the antisemitic abuse will escalate if they notify the school since their child will become even a bigger target.\n\n\u2018The ADC stands ready and willing to work with the Victorian government to deal with this sad phenomenon.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
