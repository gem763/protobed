Or, erm, on her leg.\n\nEmblazoned with a sequinned \u2018100%\u2019 symbol on the leg and \u2018that b****\u2019 on the back, the detailing was a thinly veiled reference to Truth Hurts\u2019 iconic opening line, \u2018I just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that b****,\u2019 which is at the centre of the scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this week Lizzo\u2019s 2017 single \u2013 which became a sleeper hit after re-entering the charts this year \u2013 was the subject of scandal after songwriter and producer Justin Raisen claimed to have written the lyric.\n\nIssa look (Picture: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for RADIO.COM )\n\nWe\u2019re obsessed (Picture: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for RADIO.COM)\n\nWith her dance group The Big Grrrls (Picture: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for RADIO.COM)\n\nJustin took to Instagram to post a comparison video of the start of Truth Hurts and a song he and others co-wrote with Lizzo called Healthy, with both songs featuring the lyric and a similar tune.\n\n\u2018In April 11th, 2017, we wrote a song called Healthy w/ Lizzo, Jesse St John, and Yves Rothman at our studio,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u2018\u201cI just took a DNA test turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch\u201d was taken from Healthy and used in Truth Hurts.\n\n\u2018We were never contacted about being credited for the use of the parts of Healthy (melody, lyrics, and chords) that appear in Truth Hurts.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she\u2019s preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she\u2019d understand.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, Lizzo\u2019s lawyer denied their claims, saying: \u2018The Raisens are not writers of Truth Hurts.\n\n\u2018They did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
