Like many in the country right now, and especially people from Hispanic backgrounds, I was a little nervous as he approached the stage. And it turns out that my nerves were justified.\n\nI followed along with reports from New Mexico that came in from CNN political reporter and fact-checker Daniel Dale, during which the president had a number of exchanges with Dale's CNN colleague Steve Cortes, who sits on Trump\u2019s Hispanic Advisory Council.\n\nDale reported that Trump said of Cortes: \"He happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do, so I haven't figured that one out.\u201d Trump then followed this with the question: \"Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\"\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen Cortes answered, \"The country,\" Trump reportedly responded: \"I don't know.\"\n\nWhile Cortes has publicly announced that this dialogue was \u201cawkward\u201d and has proceeded to make excuses for this on his Twitter , I can tell you with confidence that when you know about our president\u2019s stance on the southern border, this exchange definitely doesn\u2019t count as an \u201cawkward\u201d moment. Instead, it is nothing less than a direct attack on a whole race of people \u2014 as well as emblematic of the struggle mixed-background Hispanics like me face daily.\n\nSome might not understand the complexity that comes with being both white-looking and Hispanic in America. I acknowledge this as being a \u201csuperpower\u201d, but also sometimes an Achille\u2019s heel. There are clear benefits to having white skin, especially with the constant attacks on Hispanics and other people of color perpetrated by the current administration; however, it\u2019s rarely that simple. For one thing, when you\u2019re \u201chalf white\u201d and \u201chalf\u201d something else, you often find yourself corralled into \u201cpicking a side\u201d \u2014 something which is as ridiculous as it is offensive.\n\nThe politics of my skin color are something that I\u2019ve experienced my whole life. And last night, those two very pieces of my identity went directly to battle.\n\nI was taught throughout my childhood that dark skin was bad: it was a sign of being poor, uneducated, less deserving. My white uncle\u2019s support of MAGA during the 2016 election days was the culmination of decades of prejudice toward Hispanic people such as those on my father's side. This side of my family crossed the southern border during the Bath Riots in 1917 where Hispanics crossing at El Paso were doused with \u201ccleansing\u201d chemicals. Needless to say, no one can tell me that anti-Hispanic racism is anything new.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

big this war is. My life experience made the comments yesterday hit that much harder and hit me to the very core of my shared identity. There is no answer to \u201cWho do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\u201d because it isn\u2019t a coherent or logical question.\n\nPeople with mixed backgrounds like me are extremely common here in America. We are a nation that should be proud to be one people unified through our diverse identities. When we begin to ask what or who is \u201cmore important\u201d, we begin to lose what makes this country America.\n\nI know now \u2014 though I was taught so much to the contrary during my childhood \u2014 that there is no shame in being Hispanic. Generations have tried to insist this for over 100 years. We are a country that is fortunate enough to experience a wide breadth of diversity. It\u2019s time to unlearn the false dichotomies.", "description": "President Trump held a rally in New Mexico yesterday evening.
