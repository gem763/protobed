(Image: Julian Totino Tedesco, Marvel Comics)\n\nThe fact that Marvel is making an Eternals movie is just one of the absurdest things in their already incredibly absurd slate of upcoming projects. But somehow at D23 they managed to make it just a touch weirder, by announcing that Game of Thrones\u2019 Kit Harington had joined the film as one of the obscurest Marvel heroes around: the Black Knight.\n\nYe Olden Comicks\n\nCreated by Stan Lee and Joe Maneely in 1955, the Black Knight\u2019s legacy stretches back deep into the roots of Marvel\u2019s history \u2014 in fact, back to a time when Marvel was not yet Marvel, but Atlas Comics, itself a rebranding of the progenitor publisher that birthed the industry titan, Timely Comics.\n\nTimely\u2019s rebranding into Atlas came in the waning days of the Golden Age of superhero comics. Although characters like Namor the Sub-Mariner, the Human Torch and Captain America had huge popularity at the height of the second world war, by the early 1950s superhero comics were on their way out.\n\nTo combat the dwindling successes of its superpowered output, Timely became Atlas, and diversified its genre offerings to stretch behind superheroes and into the realms of the supernatural and horror, to romance and crime, to westerns and spy-fi, and yes, to tales of Medieval chivalry. That is where the first incarnation of the Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia, comes in.\n\nSir Percy charges onto the cover of Black Knight #1. (Image: Joe Maneely, Atlas Comics)\n\nSir Percy, star of his own brief comic series, was a member of King Arthur\u2019s court, and a legendary Knight of the Round Table. While he wasn\u2019t exactly a superhero like Lee\u2019s more famous creations, Percy wasn\u2019t just a knight in shining armour either: he wielded a magical sword, the Ebony Blade, forged by Merlin himself out of a meteorite. When wielding the blade, Percy \u2014 who otherwise pretends to be an incompetent buffoon to maintain his secret \u2014 becomes the Black Knight, with the sword and armour he wore granting him invulnerability to everything but weaponry made from the same material as the Ebony Blade.\n\nWhich, unsurprisingly, is how Percy is ultimately done in: his long time archnemesis, King Arthur\u2019s villainous nephew Mordred, stabs Percy with a blade cut from the same meteorite that forged the Ebony Blade, mortally wounding him during the fall of Camelot. After learning of Percy\u2019s death, Merlin casts an enchantment that ensures Percy\u2019s legacy as the Black Knight will live on, tying his spirit to the Ebony Blade so, should Mordred ever return, Percy could guide his descendants in battling him.\n\nYou Know Nothing, Dane Whitman\n\nFor a time, that\u2019s basically what happened in the Black Knight\u2019s genre-hopping, publisher-evolving legacy. Although the Black Knight series ended after just five issues, the character was revived by Lee, now working with Dick Ayers, in 1964. This time, now in Marvel\u2019s name, the Black Knight was no longer a chivalric Medieval hero: they were a supervillain named Nathan Garrett who fought Iron Man and Captain America.\n\nGarrett, a biologist turned spy, uncovers Sir Percy\u2019s tomb \u2014 and the fact that he is actually a direct descendant of the knight \u2014 and the Ebony Blade in modern Europe, fleeing the custody of Hank Pym. Sir Percy\u2019s spirit finds Garrett unworthy of wielding the blade, however, so to spite his ancestor, Garret builds a litany of medieval-themed gadgets and weapons, as well as armour and even a flying horse, to adopt Sir Percy\u2019s Black Knight persona for a life of crime.\n\nNathan Garrett puts a boot in ol\u2019 Shellhead\u2019s face on the cover of Tales of Suspense #73. (Image: Gene Colan, Jack Abel, Stan Goldberg, and Sam Rosen, Marvel Comics)\n\nAs the Black Knight, Garret joined the Masters of Evil and became a regular thorn in the side of the Avengers and Iron Man in particular, before falling from his horse in battle against the Iron Avenger and being mortally wounded by the drop.\n\nAs he lay dying, Garrett recanted his life of crime and revealed the true legacy of the Black Knight and the Ebony Blade to his nephew, a physicist named Dane Whitman, asking Dane to redeem the Black Knight\u2019s mantle and wield the sword he couldn\u2019t. Dane would indeed redeem the Black Knight persona, not just becoming a superhero, but a card-carrying member of the Avengers team his uncle had fought so many times \u2014 after using the confusion over his uncle\u2019s identity to infiltrate and expose the Masters of Evil.\n\nOver the course of the late \u201860s and \u201870s, Dane had a wild career beyond being one of Earth\u2019s mightiest. He travelled across time to fight Kang the Conqueror, he joined the Defenders and promptly got petrified by the Enchantress, turned to stone. He even had his soul wrenched back into the 12th century in the process of said petrification, where he hung out for a while and occasionally teamed up with time-travelling heroes until his petrified body was restored in the present.\n\nUpon his return, Dane discovered the Ebony Blade has not only grown in power \u2014 now able cut through basically any substance, deflect energy, and even absorb mystical energy \u2014 it was infected with a powerful blood curse, slowly corrupting wielders of the Blade before they become bloodthirsty killers, using the sword to feed the curse.\n\nDane was forced to free Sir Percy\u2019s spirit from the weapon forever to lift the blood curse, but the curse returned when noted arsehole, King of Atlantis, and occasional superhero, Namor, swiped the Ebony Blade from out of Dane\u2019s protection and used it to kill his wife Marrina, who\u2019d been transformed into a soulless monster. The curse began corrupting Dane, physically and spiritually, requiring the return of Sir Percy\u2019s soul (with a little help from Doctor Strange) to destroy the curse once and for all and save Dane\u2019s life.\n\nThe Eternals Connection\n\nIt\u2019s after all this that Dane returns to the Avengers \u2014 and actually becomes one of its most important figures, a de-facto leader in Captain America\u2019s absence \u2014 that his connection to the Eternals is revealed. Because, it\u2019s at this time that Dane strikes up a romantic relationship with Sersi, played by Gemma Chan in the upcoming movie... and things get really complicated.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t complicated, it wouldn\u2019t be the Eternals!\n\nLong story made... well, a little bit less longer: an alternate reality version of Dane, operating under the name Proctor, plans to wipe every single version of Sersi across the multiverse out for being from a reality where she turned him down. Ikaris, one of Sersi\u2019s Eternal allies \u2014 and played by Harington\u2019s onetime Thrones co-star, Richard Madden, in the new movie \u2014 attempts to save Sersi\u2019s damaged psyche from Proctor\u2019s machinations by connecting her and Dane\u2019s spirits together in an Eternal process called the Gann Josin.\n\nThe problem is, the bond doesn\u2019t quite work because Dane\u2019s beginning to get the hots for another of his superheroic colleagues, the very-much-married Princess Crystal of the Inhumans. Sersi ultimately snaps, going evil for a bit and even using the spiritual bond Ikaris gave her and Dane to turn him into her unwilling accomplice.\n\nDane doesn\u2019t take too kindly to the Gann Josin process getting in the way of his adultery attempt in Avengers #361. (Image: Steve Epting, Tom Palmer and Bill Oakley, Marvel Comics)\n\nBeing asked to fight Crystal breaks the bond between Dane long enough for the Eternals to save both him and Sersi \u2014 who promptly kills Proctor with his own version of the Ebony Blade \u2014 but the trauma of Proctor\u2019s machinations is so much that Sersi is forced to retreat to limbo between layers of the multiverse to recover.\n\nDane decided to join her out of shared guilt for her trauma and also because he doesn\u2019t want to commit some Inhuman adultery. The duo travelled through the multiverse together for a time, and at one point even found themselves back in the 12th century where Dane had found himself spiritually flung to previously.\n\nAfter hanging out there for a bit, Sersi felt ready to return to the present day and opened up a portal to the 20th century. Only... just Dane returned to the present, his bond with her permanently severed, while Sersi mysteriously vanished.\n\nOh, and Dane also finds out that most of the Avengers had just been murdered by Onslaught, but, that\u2019s a story for another time.\n\nAs weird as the idea of this movie is already, it\u2019s perhaps unlikely that the absurd story behind Dane and Sersi\u2019s relationship in the comics will be translated to the silver screen. But beyond that Eternals connection, Dane and the legacy of the Black Knight represent an opportunity to put a slightly different mystical spotlight on the weirder corners of the Marvel Universe.\n\nDoctor Strange brought magic to the MCU in a big way, but it was a specific way, intricately tied into the tale of the Infinity Stones and of more eastern-inspired magic. Dane\u2019s connection to western fantasy and medieval history represents a different side to that kind of mysticism, one that no doubt we\u2019ll scratch a teeny surface of when The Eternals hits theatres in November 2020.", "description": "The fact that Marvel is making an Eternals movie is just one of the absurdest things in their already incredibly absurd slate of upcoming projects.
