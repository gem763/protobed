Yet stopping no deal is the priority and in the best national interest,\u201d she said.\n\nCommons chaos: is no deal blocked? Is an election happening? Read more\n\nJohnson has repeatedly called the legislation, which would oblige him to seek an extension to article 50 if he has not secured a new Brexit deal by 19 October, \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very sad that MPs have voted like this,\u201d Johnson said, adding, \u201cthe country must decide\u201d whether he or Corbyn go to Brussels for the critical European council meeting on 17 October.\n\n\u201cHe would beg for an extension; he would accept whatever Brexit demands, and we would have years more dither and delay,\u201d he said.\n\nBenn\u2019s bill passed through all its stages in the Commons in a matter of hours on Wednesday, as the rebels maintained their solid majority over Johnson\u2019s government, gaining a new Conservative convert in former minister Caroline Spelman.\n\nThere were occasionally chaotic scenes. One amendment, tabled by Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, and calling for the extension to be used for the purpose of passing a Brexit deal, effectively passed by default.\n\nJohnson\u2019s motion calling for a general election was held 24 hours after he failed to prevent backbench MPs led by former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin seizing control of the parliamentary timetable to debate the anti no-deal Brexit bill.\n\nThe prime minister campaigned for the Conservative party leadership with the slogan, \u201cdeliver Brexit by 31 October, unite the party, defeat Jeremy Corbyn \u2013\u2260 and energise our country!\u201d\n\nBut just weeks after taking power, he is facing a growing backlash from colleagues on Wednesday, after 21 MPs, including former chancellor Philip Hammond and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Nicholas Soames, were expelled from their party.\n\nSoames said on Wednesday, \u201cI will not be standing at the next election, and I am thus approaching the end of 37 years\u2019 service to this House, of which I have been proud and honoured beyond words to be a member. I am truly very sad that it should end in this way.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:16 Sir Nicholas Soames delivers emotional speech after Tory whip withdrawn \u2013 video\n\nIn a crowded evening meeting of the 1922 Committee less than 24 hours after the defenestration of the 21 rebels, senior Tories including the former defence minister Tobias Ellwood, Theresa May\u2019s former deputy Damian Green, former children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton and the veteran MP Sir Edward Leigh, all expressed deep concern at the move.\n\nOne MP said there was alarm that \u201ccurrent tactics could be interpreted as a desire to shift the party to the right, to which the PM gave an emphatic no.\u201d Several sought assurances that if a fresh deal was put to the Commons, the same disciplinary measures would be applied to Brexiters opposed to the withdrawal agreement, the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d.\n\nGreen later wrote to Johnson on behalf of the One Nation group of moderate Tories \u2013 originally set up by the current cabinet minister Amber Rudd \u2013 saying they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the whip being removed from \u201cprincipled, valued and dedicated colleagues\u201d.\n\nGreen, who chairs the group, said that the actions overnight had \u201chindered the mission\u201d of uniting the party and said the group could only support Johnson \u201cif moderate modernising Conservatives are still welcome in Parliamentary party\u201d.\n\nHowever, in an exchange with Tory Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski at the 1922 meeting, Johnson appeared to commit that no MP would have the whip restored. Kawczynski was booed by some MPs for his remarks but said he wanted to hear them on the record from the prime minister. \u201cHe said the whip would not be restored to them and I am going to hold him to it.\u201d\n\nAfter opening the debate on his call for a general election, Johnson faced a withering response from Kenneth Clarke, who the previous day had been stripped of the Conservative whip after 49 years as a Tory MP.\n\n\u201cI do think the prime minister, with the greatest respect, has a tremendous skill in keeping a straight face whilst he\u2019s being so disingenuous,\u201d Clarke told a scowling Johnson.\n\nThe PM, Clarke said, was \u201cdesperate\u201d for an election before 31 October \u201con the basis that he\u2019s been thwarted in getting an amazing, beneficial deal for this country\u201d.\n\nIt was nonsense for Johnson to say that backers of the bill hoped to overturn Brexit, Clarke said: \u201cA very large percentage of those who\u2019ve been defeating him over the last two days are prepared to vote for Brexit \u2013 they\u2019ve voted for Brexit more often than he has.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Johnson and Corbyn clashed at a bad-tempered PMQs \u2013 Johnson\u2019s first since taking office in July.\n\nThe Labour leader accused the PM of not having a Brexit negotiating strategy and trying to cover up the true impact of a no-deal departure.\n\nJohnson \u2013 who pointedly failed to answer any of Corbyn\u2019s direct questions \u2013 in turn accused the Labour leader of running scared of a snap election.\n\nPlay Video 2:01 Caracas and chlorinated chicken: Johnson's first PMQs clash with Corbyn \u2013 video highlights\n\nThe exchanges, in which Johnson was barracked remorselessly by the opposition benches, came the day after the prime minister lost his first vote in parliament, on a backbench bill seeking to delay Brexit, and then ejected 21 Tory rebels from the party.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been prime minister for six weeks and he promised to get Brexit sorted,\u201d Corbyn told the Commons. \u201cIn six weeks he\u2019s presented nothing to change the previous prime minister\u2019s deal, which he twice voted against. These negotiations that he\u2019s talking about are a sham. All he\u2019s doing is running down the clock.\u201d\n\nJohnson repeatedly taunted the Labour leader over backing an election: \u201cI know he\u2019s worried about free-trade deals with America, but there\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken that I can see in his house, and he\u2019s on that bench.\u201d", "description": "MPs block bid to call snap election after vote on bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Jessica Elgot", "Peter Walker", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52fc86e30f0eb9643e22501fc2ca70f43e0cedc/0_74_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04c2acbcbda766edfbcbafc5cd44f451"}
