Maybe it\u2019s forgetting to sign up for a loyalty program and not accruing them in the first place. Other times, it\u2019s letting miles earned on airlines I rarely fly expire. The other day, I got an email from British Airways saying that my Avios (their term for frequent-flier miles) were going to expire in 12 months because of inactivity. My initial thought? Oh, well. What\u2019s the worth of 3,401 points on an airline I never go with, anyway? Or those 457 BIG Points I lost from Air Asia?\n\nApparently, I\u2019m not the only one letting valuable loyalty points linger until they vanish. According to a report by Bankrate.com, almost half of American adults who participate in airline and hotel rewards programs have let points or miles expire. We\u2019re underestimating the value of that loss, too.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do this [study] to show people that you\u2019re probably sitting on some value that you might not even know about,\u201d says Bankrate.com credit card analyst Ted Rossman. \u201cA lot of people do let [airline miles] expire, and a lot of people don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re worth.\u201d\n\n[Tell us what you think of By The Way]\n\nAlthough everyone\u2019s guilty of letting miles go, millennials are doing so at a higher rate, even though they\u2019re the demographic more likely to sign up for airline loyalty programs in the first place.\n\n\u201cPeople in that age group might not be realizing how valuable they could be,\u201d Rossman says. \u201cThey think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only 10,000 miles, or something, how much could that be worth?\u2019 What people don\u2019t realize is that there can be a compounding effect \u2060 \u2014 that you save these up and don\u2019t let them expire, and then it does turn into a real trip.\u201d\n\nWhile you want to hold onto your miles and make sure you don\u2019t let them expire, you also don\u2019t want to hoard them forever. They\u2019re more valuable being used than saved.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to be a points millionaire,\u201d Rossman says. \u201cI know it kind of sounds fun, but really, the purpose of these is to use them, and they generally will not get more valuable over time.\u201d\n\nRossman\u2019s advice is to save your airline miles until you reach a certain goal, then spend them. It\u2019s dangerously easy to let them expire, but there are more strategies out there to keep them active than people realize.\n\nOne strategy to top up their expiration clock is to shop for things you would have normally needed to buy.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a trip coming up, you can still keep these points and miles active by making a purchase through an airline\u2019s shopping portal,\u201d Rossman says. \u201cAmerican Airlines is a good example. You can click through their shopping portal and go to retailers that you would have made a purchase from anyway.\u201d\n\nAirlines may be associated with major retailers like Macy\u2019s or Best Buy; buying a TV or a tank top will buy you time on your airline miles. Just log into the airline\u2019s shopping site with your frequent-flier number and look for everyday items. Some airlines also offer the option to buy magazine subscriptions.\n\nIf your airline of choice allows it, you can go even cheaper by using iTunes.\n\n\u201cYou could make a 99-cent purchase through iTunes, bank that mile to your American Airlines account or any other program that offers this, and that\u2019ll reset the clock,\u201d Rossman says.\n\nAnother closely related mile-extending trick is using a dining rewards programs.\n\n\u201cMost airlines and a bunch of hotels have these dining rewards programs that you could participate in,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as you enroll and you go to a participating restaurant \u2014 this could be a neighborhood place you were planning to go anyway \u2014 and bank those points or miles there, that\u2019s going to be qualifying activity that\u2019s going to reset your expiration clock.\u201d\n\nFor those feeling generous, you can also gift miles to friends, family or donate them to charity. For example, Etihad Airways partners with Doctors Without Borders as an option for frequent fliers who would like to donate miles. You can give away even a fraction of your miles to a person and organization to add more time to the rest of the miles you\u2019re saving.\n\n[United Airlines rolls out miles that don\u2019t expire in a move to please customers]\n\nBetter yet, skip the hassle of worrying about your expiring miles by becoming loyal to an airline that doesn\u2019t let your miles expire in the first place, like Delta and JetBlue. The good news is that it may even become a trend in the industry: Just this August, United Airlines announced that its miles would no longer expire, as well.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of in-flight grooming\n\nA guy tweeted an ingenious hotel-room hack\u2060 \u2014 and Twitter responded with their own\n\nFollow By The Way on Instagram for city highlights, travel tips and more", "description": "Too many of us are leaving money from rewards on the table.
