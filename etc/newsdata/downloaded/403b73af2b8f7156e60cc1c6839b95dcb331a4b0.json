According to Reddit users, Millie the Owl gets this close with people on a regular basis, but Willington had no idea he was about to be her next victim.\n\n\u201cI had no way of knowing it was coming straight for me,\u201d he exclusively told Pedestrian.tv.\n\nThe unsuspecting camera man was testing out the slow-motion feature on his iPhone when Millie decided to get in his face. Although the bird \u201cbarely touched\u201d him, the story is still enough to give me nightmares.\n\n\u201cI was testing out slow-mo on my phone, so I was just more focused on getting the right shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was coming straight at me but it sort of like swooped up slightly grazing the top of my phone and my head,\u201d Luke told us.\n\nYep. File that straight under \u201cFuck No\u201d because birds are gross and fucked and I would drop dead if a bird ever got this close to me.\n\nBut Luke\u2019s quiet weekend trip to the sanctuary has gone semi-viral online, with over 4000 upvotes on Reddit in less than 24 hours. Ahh, Reddit sure does love a fucked Australian story, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cIn her defence, Millie\u2019s job is pretty repetitive, and scaring the shit out of a tourist is the bright spot in her otherwise dull day,\u201d a Reddit user rushed to the defence of Millie the Owl\n\nThe ordeal was apparently over in about four seconds, leaving a very confused Willington wondering what the heck had happened.\n\n\u201cIt was so quick that I didn\u2019t realise what was happening, all I knew was that it had hit my head,\u201d he said\u201dI had no time to react but the slow-mo caught every single moment.\u201d\n\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I am about to go have some horrific nightmares about this fucked up bird.
