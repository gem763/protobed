The more money you make, he said, the more money you have to pay someone to find ways to legally avoid paying tax.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley economists said the 400 richest Americans paid a combined state, local and federal tax rate this year of 23%, lower than the combined 24% tax rate for the bottom half of households. The claim has its skeptics, but some economists say the Trump administration\u2019s revamp of the tax code helped wealthy Americans. They also have other theories.\n\nThe wealthy also have a slew of savvy professionals to help them navigate a complicated tax system, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics. Nearly 69% of taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000 a year used a professional tax preparer versus 85% of those earnings between $500,000 and $1 million, and 92% of people earning at least $1 million.\n\nThat compares to a national average of 53.4%. While many less wealthy Americans may not have such complicated accounts, they also miss out on the myriad ways of legally avoiding paying taxes, experts say. Paid preparers \u2014 like accountants and tax attorneys \u2014 submitted 80 million of the almost 150 million tax returns in 2016, the most recent data on the matter.\n\nWhy the rich don\u2019t file their taxes like everyone else\n\nThe wealthy obviously have more complicated returns, and that can cause problems. IRS data for this tax season, as of July, showed a $1.13 trillion tax liability for all individual returns. Tax liability for taxpayers worth at least $1 million accounted for 14% of that total bill. Including liabilities incurred by those who earn between $500,000 and $1 million, that percentage rises to 25%.\n\nYet some observers \u2014 like Berkeley University economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez \u2014 contend the nation\u2019s richest haven\u2019t being taxed enough, and part of that is because the rich know how to minimize their tax exposure. The pair have advised Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on her proposals to tax the wealthy.\n\nKyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, said there\u2019s a big difference between illegal tax evasion and tax avoidance \u201cwhich is totally normal and legal.\u201d Tax avoidance is finding the ways within the law to keep taxation at its smallest amount. That, after all, is what the paid professionals are there to do.\n\nOne shrewd money move: donating stocks to an heir upon death. If the heir sells the stock, he or she could sidestep the capital gains tax, he said. \u201cIs it tax evasion?\u201d he said. \u201cNo. Is it tax avoidance? Of course.\u201d That advice doesn\u2019t come cheap. Tax attorneys can charge an hourly rate between $200 and $400, though that rate can go much higher in large law firms, according to one estimate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, low-income taxpayers claiming the earned income tax credit (EITC) face a disproportionate amount of scrutiny. In fiscal year 2018, 37% of all the audited individual returns were picked because they had an EITC claim, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, a watchdog within the IRS. EITC returns comprised 18% of all individual returns filed in 2017.", "description": "\u2018There are a lot of advantages to being rich, and this is one of them.\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT116_tax_pr_ZG_20191010222036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
