Worth noting: that backpay only covered the period between 2017 and 2018.\n\nAll of this seems likely to put the restaurant industry under a fair bit of stress, but probably not as much stress as underpaid workers face across Australia.", "description": "Law firm Maurice Blackburn has filed a new complaint with the Fair Work Ombudsman.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/perry-new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
