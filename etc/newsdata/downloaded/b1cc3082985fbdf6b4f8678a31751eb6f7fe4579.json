Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe account, first reported in a book excerpt released by the The New York Times on Tuesday, was confirmed to ABC News by a senior administration official who was in the room at the time, as well as several other sources who were later briefed on the conversation.\n\nAccording to two sources familiar with the matter, Trump in private meetings raised the prospect of shooting migrant families seeking asylum at the border as early as November 2018. He also floated a similar idea publicly at one point, suggesting that rocks thrown by migrants will be considered a firearm and potentially warrant lethal force.\n\nSources interviewed by ABC News say Trump\u2019s aides discouraged the idea of shooting unarmed migrants and it was never acted upon. But Trump remained focused on the idea, bringing it up again in the private Oval Office meeting in March 2019, when the number of undocumented migrants arriving at the border topped 100,000 for that month alone.\n\nWilliam Dowell/Task Force Barrier\n\nThe detail of shooting migrants below the waist are included in a new book \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration,\u201d by Times reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear. According to Davis and Shear, the president also talked to aides about building an electrified border wall, as well as a \u201cwater-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday, Trump denied the allegations about the trench and the electrified fence, but did not address the idea of shooting migrants.\n\n\"I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough,\" he wrote. \"The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!\" he tweeted, initially misspelling \"Moat\" as \"Moot.\" It was later corrected.\n\nNow the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nAttending the meeting was then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned in April. It was widely reported at the time that Trump didn\u2019t think Nielsen had done enough to curb the tide of asylum seekers, which is expected to fall shy of 1 million people this year alone.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated question on allowable use of force underscores the extreme lengths the president has been willing to consider to address a signature issue for the president. Trump frequently describes people coming across the border as part of an \"invasion\" and people who are criminals.\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nNielsen was replaced by acting Homeland Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who has overseen a reduction in border numbers in recent months in part because of a new policy \u2013 initiated by Nielsen \u2013 that forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. Human rights groups say the policy has created a humanitarian crisis south of the U.S. border, where migrant families face scarce food and clean water and fear for their safety.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, McAleenan expressed frustration with \u201cthe tone\u201d on immigration in general.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the words matter a lot,\u201d McAleenan said. \u201cIf you alienate half of your audience by your use of your terminology, it\u2019s going to hamper your ability to ever win an argument.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n___ ABC News' Ben Gittleson and Quinn Owen contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump, in a private meeting with close aides, asked whether the U.S. could shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down, ABC News confirmed Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-rt-jt-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
