(Mario Laporta, AFP)\n\nA volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli erupted dramatically on Wednesday, reportedly killing a hiker and sending tourists fleeing.\n\nThe volcano is known to be active but on Wednesday there was a particularly powerful eruption.\n\nItalian media reported that a hiker had been killed and their partner injured, but firefighters could not immediately confirm any casualties.\n\nThe dead man was a 35-year-old from Sicily who was walking with a Brazilian companion who was found in dehydrated and in a state of shock, the AGI news agency reported.\n\nThey were walking below the 400 metre altitude limit above which a guide is required.\n\n'Like being in hell'\n\nA boat has been sent to the 12 square kilometre (five square miles) island for a possible evacuation, Italian media said.\n\n\"It was like being in hell because of the rain of fire coming from the sky,\" Italian news agencies quoted local priest Giovanni Longo as saying.\n\nHe said it was not known if there were any hikers on the volcano at the time of the eruption, which caused fires around the village of Ginostra.\n\nStromboli is topped by an active volcano which is a magnet for tourists from early spring each year.\n\nItalian media reported that some tourists had fled into the sea after the eruption, while others had barricaded themselves into homes.\n\nItaly's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said there were two huge explosions on the central-southern side of the volcano's crater at around 1446 GMT Wednesday, one of the biggest explosions ever recorded on the island.\n\nThe explosions were preceded by lava spills \"from all the active mouths of the crater terrace,\" the INGV said, prompting a two-kilometre high plume of smoke.\n\n\"It's been a long time since we had an eruption of this magnitude,\" former local councillor Gianluca Giuffre told RAI news.\n\n\"My experience and of those who have been living here for generations leads us to believe that the situation will calm down again but we must be cautious,\" he said.\n\nA firefighting plane could not put out fires in the area because of the amount of smoke, Italian media reported.\n\nThe INGV said it was monitoring the situation.\n\nCinematic fame\n\nA previous massive eruption in December 2002 prompted a tidal wave after magma from a particularly violent eruption cascaded into the sea. Six people were injured.\n\nPiers, boats and some buildings were swept away by the wave which swept around the island at an estimated height of 10 metres (over 30 feet).\n\nAccess to the island was forbidden to outsiders for over a month amid the risk of further landslides and scientists set up electronic observation stations to monitor volcanic activity.\n\nFour-fifths of the population of around 500 decided to leave for the Aeolian island administrative centre of Lipari, whose schools have taken on Stromboli's children since the disaster.\n\nStromboli was made famous in the 1950 film of the same name by Roberto Rosselini, starring Ingrid Bergman and is a major tourist attraction with thousands of people visiting its lava-spitting crater each year.\n\nStromboli is part of the seven-island Eolian Archipelago just off Sicily in southern Italy.", "description": "A volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli erupted dramatically on Wednesday, reportedly killing a hiker and sending tourists fleeing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2236/381e4d810fee4befa1aa615f18356271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-03"}
