Thankfully Elizabeth Warren meets my expectations for everything. I welcome the opportunities I get to see her double down and expound upon those beliefs. As a gay man who grew up in an oppressively religious household, it means a lot to me to hear her make this point 1/2 \u2014 Black Boy Wonder \ud83c\udf0a\u270a\ud83c\udffe (@MalcolmDubya) October 11, 2019\n\nGreat answer, Elizabeth Warren!\n\nIf you\u2019re against gay marriage, don\u2019t have one https://t.co/QmVpa3Uxza \u2014 Grant Rich (@grantra) October 11, 2019\n\nI am on the record as believing in @ewarren\u2019s commitment for the LGBTQ+ community.

I\u2019m going to show you.\u201d\n\nShe then read aloud their names: \u201cDana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon, Claire Legato, Muhlaysia Booker, Michelle Washington, Paris Cameron, Chynal Lindsey, Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey, Denali Berries Stuckey, Pebbles LaDime \u201cDime\u201d Doe, Tracy Single, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love Slater and Ja\u2019leyah-Jamar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for a President of the United States of America to say their names,\u201d she said to a cheering audience.\n\nWarren also made a surprise appearance at RuPaul\u2019s DragCon in New York City earlier this year and drew attention to the ongoing violence against transgender individuals in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need to call it out, and we need to fight back,\u201d she continued. \u201cEverybody should be able to go to school, to work, to get healthcare, or just walk down the street without fear of discrimination or violence. Equal means equal, period.\u201d\n\nAfter urging American residents to vote, she said: \u201cI\u2019m in this fight for LGBTQ+ equality. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to make sure everyone is free to be who they are and to love who they love.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jonathan Van Ness reveals he\u2019s backing Elizabeth Warren in presidential election.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been hailed as a \"gay icon\" after her appearance at the CNN forum on LGBTQ issues.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/elizabeth-warren.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
