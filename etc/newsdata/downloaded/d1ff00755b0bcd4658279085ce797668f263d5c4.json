He deferred to the Patriots\u2019 statement late Tuesday in which they said they were aware of the lawsuit and \u201ctake these allegations very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cAntonio and his representatives have made statements, so I\u2019m not going to be expanding on any of those,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cThey are what they are. We\u2019ve looked into the situation. We\u2019re taking it very seriously all the way through the organization. I\u2019m sure there are questions, but I\u2019m not going to enter into the discussion about that.\u201d\n\nBrown has denied the allegations. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, told The Associated Press his client plans to countersue. The NFL has declined to comment but will be opening an investigation into the matter.\n\nBelichick was asked specifically about the possibility of Brown being placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list by Roger Goodell. That special designation, which is used at the discretion of Goodell to allow the league to conduct investigations into possible violations of the league\u2019s personal conduct policy, would prevent Brown from practicing or attending games while on the list.\n\nBrown would, however, be eligible to continue being paid on the one-year deal he signed Monday with the Patriots that could pay him $15 million this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for one day at a time,\u201d Belichick said.\n\nIn the less than five-minute portion of practice open to the media, Brown wore a No. 1 jersey and a visor with his helmet while going through warmup drills with teammates. Brown has worn No. 84 throughout his previous nine NFL seasons, but that number is currently being worn by Patriots tight end Ben Watson.\n\nBrown wasn\u2019t present in the locker room during the 45-minute period open to reporters. His locker, which is situated two stalls away from quarterback Tom Brady, had both doors shut.\n\nBrady declined to comment on Brown\u2019s civil case or on a report that Brown was currently staying at Brady\u2019s house while he gets settled in New England.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to show up and play football and try to prepare (for the Dolphins),\u201d Brady said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get ready for them and things that don\u2019t involve me don\u2019t involve me.\u201d\n\nSafety Devin McCourty, in his 10th season in New England, said the Patriots teams he\u2019s been on have generally done a good job of blocking out distractions. Though he acknowledged Brown\u2019s situation is unique.\n\nMcCourty said the players realize how serious the allegations are against Brown.\n\n\u201cBut I think from a football standpoint we\u2019ve got to be prepared to go out there and play against the Dolphins on Sunday because that\u2019s what our job calls on us to do,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCourty said it\u2019s still too early to know what kind of teammate Brown will be.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going through a personal situation and none of us really know him yet,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cWe\u2019re just starting to get to know guys. I think that\u2019s what you build on, just trying to get to know guys that come in here. \u2026 I think that\u2019s all part of getting new teammates, to get to know them for yourself and not judging them on what\u2019s happened on other teams or different things, but just trying to get to know guys.\u201d\n\nBrown was originally traded from Pittsburgh to Oakland in the offseason. But a bizarre foot injury, fights with the NFL over his helmet, skipping practices, multiple fines, a run-in with Raiders general manager Mike Mayock and his social media posts ultimately led to the decision to release him.\n\nHe agreed to a deal with the defending Super Bowl champions hours after the Raiders granted his request and let him go.\n\nNotes: The Patriots signed free agent offensive lineman Marshall Newhouse to the 53-man roster on Wednesday. Newhouse, an eight-year veteran who had previous stints with the Packers, Bengals, Giants, Raiders, Bills and Panthers adds some depth to the line following the shoulder injury to starting right tackle Marcus Cannon in last week\u2019s win over Pittsburgh. \u2026 Cannon, RB Brandon Bolden (hamstring) and TE Matt LaCosse (ankle) were all limited participants during Wednesday\u2019s practice.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patriots receiver Antonio Brown practiced with the team for the first time on Wednesday, a day after his former trainer filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/Patriots_Antonio_Brown_Lawsuit_Football_40534.jpg-97989_c0-0-4496-2621_s1770x1032.jpg?e26fa21f40e185dcc4c602369905f78258d600e1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
