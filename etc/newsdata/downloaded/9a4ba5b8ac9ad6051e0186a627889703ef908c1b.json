He reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nVindman also told investigators Tuesday that he tried to change the White House\u2019s rough transcript of the call by filling in at least one of the omitted words, \u201cBurisma,\u201d a reference to the company linked to Biden and his son, according to people familiar with his testimony. But Vindman was unsuccessful.\n\nHis concerns, though, were far bigger than the transcript. And lawmakers said his failed effort to edit it didn\u2019t significantly change their understanding of what transpired during Trump\u2019s call that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nVindman\u2019s arrival in military blue, with medals, created a striking image at the Capitol as the impeachment inquiry reached deeper into the White House. He testified for more than 10 hours.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said, according to prepared remarks obtained by the Associated Press. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a military officer at the National Security Council, arrives at the Capitol early Tuesday.\n\nVindman, a 20-year military officer, added to the mounting evidence from other witnesses \u2014 diplomats, defense and former administration officials \u2014 who are corroborating the initial whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump and providing new details ahead of a House vote in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cEvery person has put it in higher resolution,\u201d said Rep. Denny Heck, D-Wash., during a break in the daylong session.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story: There\u2019s not like a new headline out of all of these,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J. \u201cEvery single witness, from their own vantage point, has corroborated the central facts of the story we\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry is looking into Trump\u2019s call, in which he asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 to investigate Democrats \u2014 that the Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid and could be an impeachable offense.\n\nWith the administration directing staff not to appear, Vindman was the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment panels. He was issued a subpoena to appear.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Tuesday to denounce the probe as a \u201csham,\u201d adding: \u201cWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!\u201d\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, said that it was his \u201csacred duty\u201d to defend the United States.\n\nSome Trump allies, looking for ways to discredit Vindman, questioned the colonel\u2019s loyalties because he was born in the region. But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to criticize his patriotism.\n\n\u2018This is a decorated American soldier, and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\u2019 Sen. Mitt Romney\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the slams on Vindman \u201cabsurd, disgusting and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier, and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\u201d\n\nThe testimony came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would vote on a resolution to set rules for public hearings and a possible vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote would be the first on the impeachment inquiry and aims to nullify complaints from Trump and his allies that the process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution merely \u201cconfirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he and other GOP lawmakers will review the resolution to see if it passes a \u201csmell test\u201d of fairness to Trump.\n\nThe session Tuesday grew contentious at times as House Republicans continued trying to unmask the still-anonymous whistleblower and call him or her to testify. Vindman said he is not the whistleblower and does not know who it is.\n\nGOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio acknowledged Republicans were trying to get Vindman to provide the names of others he spoke to after the July 25 phone call, in an effort to decide whom to call to testify. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Vindman testified that in spring of this year he became aware of \u201coutside influencers\u201d promoting a \u201cfalse narrative of Ukraine\u201d that undermined U.S. efforts, a reference in particular to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHe first reported his concerns after a July 10 meeting in which U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nVindman says he told Sondland that \u201chis statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\u201d\n\nThat differs from the account of Sondland, a wealthy businessman who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration and testified before the impeachment investigators that no one from the NSC \u201cever expressed any concerns.\u201d Sondland also testified that he did not realize any connection between Biden and Burisma.\n\nVindman said he listened to the Trump call with Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office.\n\nFor the call between Trump and Zelensky, Vindman said he listened in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office. He said he again reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nVindman served as the director for European affairs and a Ukraine expert under Fiona Hill, a former official who testified earlier in the impeachment probe. Hill worked for former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nHe told investigators that Ukraine, in trying to become a vibrant democracy integrated with the West, is a bulwark against overt Russian aggression.\n\nVindman attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration with a delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and he and Hill were both part of a Ukraine briefing with Sondland that others have testified irritated Bolton at the White House.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d wrote Vindman, who was wounded in Iraq and received a Purple Heart.\n\n\u201cFor over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d the decorated Army lieutenant colonel said, according to prepared remarks obtained by the Associated Press. \u201cI did not think...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
