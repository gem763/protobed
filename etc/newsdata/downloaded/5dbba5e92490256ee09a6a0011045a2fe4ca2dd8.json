Thunberg said their mockery of children showed her message had become \"too loud to handle\".\n\nPutin said young people who paid attention to environmental issues should be supported, adding: \"But when someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned.\n\n\"I'm sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.\"\n\nInspired by Thunberg's solitary weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament a year ago, millions of people have poured onto the streets around the globe to demand governments take emergency action on climate change.\n\nThunberg told the U.N. conference: \"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?.\n\n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this week, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament, the Duma, invited Thunberg to Russia to deliver a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Katya Golubkova and Olesya Astakhova; Writing by Andrey Ostroukh and Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Janet Lawrence)", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday took aim at teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, telling an energy forum he did not share the excitement about her United Nations speech last month.
