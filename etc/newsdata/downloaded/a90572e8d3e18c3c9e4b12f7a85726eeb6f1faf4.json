He said he planned to visit Washington to meet Trump in the first half of November where they would discuss plans for the \u201csafe zone\u201d.\n\nTurkey has long argued for the establishment of a 20-mile (32 km) \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border, under Turkish control, driving back the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia - which is the dominant force in the SDF alliance and which Ankara considers a terrorist organization and a threat to its national security.\n\nThe United States helped the YPG defeat Islamic State militants in Syria, and had been seeking a joint \u2018security mechanism\u2019 with Turkey along the border to meet Turkey\u2019s security needs without threatening the SDF.\n\nThe SDF accused Washington of betraying its ally.\n\n\u201cThe American forces did not fulfill their commitments and withdrew their forces from the border areas with Turkey, and Turkey is now preparing for an invasion operation of northern and eastern Syria,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nSDF official Mustafa Bali said U.S. forces were \u201cleaving leaving the areas to turn into a war zone\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut the (U.S.) statement today was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF,\u201d SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel said in an interview with al-Hadath TV.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium July 11, 2018.

The statement made pointed reference to Washington\u2019s European allies, saying many captured IS fighters came from those countries, which had resisted U.S. calls to take them back.\n\n\u201cThe United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,\u201d the White House said.\n\nIn the first Turkish comment following the statement, Erdogan\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey\u2019s \u201csafe zone\u201d plan was within the framework of Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\n\u201cThe safe zone has two aims: to secure our borders by clearing away terrorist elements and to achieve the return of refugees in a safe way,\u201d Kalin wrote on Twitter.\n\nHowever the Kremlin, the strongest foreign ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said Syria\u2019s territorial integrity had to be preserved and Moscow continued to seek the withdrawal of all foreign forces illegally present in Syria.\n\nTurkey says it wants to settle up to 2 million Syrian refugees in the zone. It hosts 3.6 million Syrians sheltering from their country\u2019s more than eight-year-old conflict.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Fighters from a new border security force under the command of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dance during a graduation ceremony in Hasaka, northeastern Syria, January 20, 2018.

The Turkish presidency said that during the call between Erdogan and Trump, Erdogan had expressed his frustration with the failure of U.S. military and security officials to implement the agreement between the two countries on a safe zone.\n\nThe NATO allies agreed in August to establish a zone in northeast Syria along the Turkish border. Turkey says the United States moved too slowly to set up the zone. It has repeatedly warned of starting an offensive on its own into northeast Syria.\n\nFor graphic on where Kurds live, click on tmsnrt.rs/2OqcPVd", "description": "The United States began pulling troops from northeast Syria on Monday in a major policy shift, opening the way for a Turkish attack on Kurdish-led forces long allied to Washington and handing Turkey responsibility for thousands of jihadi captives.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437929409&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950MG", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
