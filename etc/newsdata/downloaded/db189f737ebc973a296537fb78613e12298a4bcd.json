But that doesn't mean they should be cavalier and allowed to do whatever they want in the world \u2013 of course not.\n\n\"But that's what we've always got to balance with this desire to regulate with what makes the company dynamic, quick to move and healthy.\"\n\nDoubled down\n\nHe is also concerned about the anti-business sentiment in Australia.\n\n\"Big business is owned basically by mum and dad shareholders these days through this fund or that fund,\" he said.\n\n\"Business is not some alien life form out there that should be stopped and banned \u2013 it's us, it's ordinary Australians.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the interview, Mr Mullen doubled down on last week\u2019s call for an urgent co-operative effort by business and government to fix the economics of the wholesale broadband network, NBN Co.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we can all sit down and just put an Australian hat on rather than individual areas of interest and see how we address this the better,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Mullen told Telstra\u2019s annual meeting the NBN was not affordable for consumers and the thin profit margins it allowed for retail service providers would ultimately strangle telco capital investment.\n\nHis speech caused a storm when he said Telstra must bear some of the blame for the state of the NBN \u201cdue to its recalcitrance in helping government at the time\u201d.\n\nNational importance\n\nThose to have weighed in on the NBN debate include former Telstra chairman Don McGauchie, former competition regulator Graeme Samuel, former Howard government finance minister Nick Minchin and NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue.\n\nCommunications minister Paul Fletcher has already dismissed Mr Mullen\u2019s comments in an op-ed in the Financial Review.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe most important public policy question is whether broadband consumers are better off \u2013 and the answer unambiguously is yes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Mr Mullen believes the issue is of such national importance he has repeated his call for co-operative action.\n\n\u201cWe've got a very good relationship with the minister\u2019s office and obviously the last thing I want to be seen to do is make life difficult for them and knocking where we are,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we all in the industry realise this is an issue and at some stage we've got to fix it. It's in everyone's interest: the government, NBN, all the resellers and, ultimately, the consumer.\n\n\u201cIt really is genuinely \u2013 it's not just words \u2013 it is genuinely in everyone's interests.\u201d\n\nDiverting resources\n\nMr Mullen said he was shocked at the response to his comments about Telstra\u2019s hand in creating the current NBN business model.\n\n\u201cMy comments at the AGM we're supposed to be 5 per cent of how we got here and 95 per cent on what we should collectively be doing about it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the reaction was 95 per cent who did what to who and 5 per cent what we're doing about it, which is a shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe've never complained about the NBN servicing the enterprise market. They're entitled to do that and, in fact, we're actively partnering with them in a number of services to customers.\n\n\u201cBut what we do object to is that the NBN is designed to be a wholesale provider and would not favour or discriminate between the RSPs and clearly that does appear to be happening from what the ACCC said and our own information.\n\n\u201cThe other concern, I guess, is it does seem odd that they would be diverting resources to overbuild the existing infrastructure when the consumer rollout isn\u2019t complete and the large number of people are yet to be connected.\u201d\n\n'Eventually gravity prevails'\n\nAsked what he thought about the NBN ultimately moving into private ownership Mr Mullen used this as an opportunity to talk about the broken economics of the NBN model.\n\n\u201cWe've studiously avoided getting involved in the sort of policy levers of the nation \u2013 I think that's for government,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government has said \u2013 both sides of politics have said \u2013 their ultimate goal is to return the NBN to private ownership.\n\n\u201cWe are working on the assumption that either side of politics will deliver that one day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll we have really done is just try to focus on the affordability of broadband, which is why we have called for a reduction, along with the rest of the industry, in wholesale prices.\n\n\u201cHow we get there is really not for Telstra to decide. We\u2019ll let the government do that.\n\n\u201cBut we really think that it is fundamentally important that we do achieve that affordability. Eventually gravity prevails in economics, like anywhere else.\n\n\u201cWe went from a handful of RSPs effectively to, I think, over 180 at maximum, all reselling the NBN.\n\n\u201cThe basic economics are that for the average RSP it still costs about 55 bucks a month per use, and we're charging less than $70 as an industry.\n\n\u201cSo, eventually one of two things will happen \u2013 either people will withdraw from reselling the NBN because it's just not economic to do it, or the retail consumer will have to go up to a point where we make enough of a margin to be able to have a viable business.\n\n\u201cAnd I can't see either of those are really in the nation's interests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeated comments made at the Telstra AGM by chief executive Andy Penn that \"most telcos\u2019 return on invested capital is already below their cost of capital.\"\n\nMr Mullen said: \u201cOur mobile networks are the envy of the world. We're always consistently in the top five in the world. We're investing. We invested $4 billion last year alone. And I think the industry in Australia overall is about $12 billion a year or something like that.\n\n\u201cIt's absolutely critical if we're going to maintain the standards that we have that we generate enough cash to do that.\u201d\n\nMr Mullen refused to comment on the current stance of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in mobile networks.
