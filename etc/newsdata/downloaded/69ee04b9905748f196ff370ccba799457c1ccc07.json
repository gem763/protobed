I wanted to be the cool guy.'\n\nHamza Abbas did not speak in court, nor has he renounced any extremist beliefs.\n\nHis lawyer Felicity Gerry QC said if there was a process to denounce violent ideology 'he would do that', but there was not.\n\nJustice Beale is due to sentence Mohamed, Chaarani and Hamza Abbas on November 29.\n\nHe joined his cousins Ibrahim (pictured) and Hamza Abbas, and friend Ahmed Mohamed in conspiring to develop the potentially deadly plot, for which they'd bought machetes, carried out reconnaissance and built practice bombs", "description": "Footage has emerged of\u00a0Ahmed Mohamed, Abdullah Chaarani and Hamza Abbas shopping for bomb-making supplies in Broadmeadows, Melbourne on December 21 2016.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press", "Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/14/19789106-0-image-a-19_1571232378277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
