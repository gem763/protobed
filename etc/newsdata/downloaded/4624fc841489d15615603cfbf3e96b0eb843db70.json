But at a speech in the US last month, Mr Morrison did, however, raise a few hackles by suggesting China had outgrown its \"developing economy\" classification.\n\nIndeed, most Australians on the ground in China privately agree relations will never return to where they were three years ago. This was reinforced by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson, who told Senate Estimates last week that differences between Beijing and Canberra over values are the \"new normal\".\n\nMorrison, who has had mixed success juggling the security concerns and economic upside that come with dealing with China, last week defended Australia's western democratic traditions, saying the country would not be corralled into either the pro-US or pro-China camp.\n\nAustralia is not alone in its struggle to deal with this increasingly nationalistic and aggressive superpower. China\u2019s economic and military might means there is little incentive for officials working under President Xi Jinping to play nice with the rest of the world.\n\nThis is reflected in the aggressive tone adopted by Chinese diplomats around the world. When Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton spoke about Communist Party values in a speech earlier this month, the Chinese Embassy in Canberra fired off a statement within hours calling his remarks \u201cmalicious\u201d.\n\nThis kind of direct response from a Chinese embassy would have been unusual a year ago. Now it is commonplace.\n\nOne western diplomat, who is not Australian, says frank exchanges with Chinese officials are rare. Most rattle off talking points approved by Beijing rather than inviting any kind of meaningful dialogue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother challenge for the Morrison government is the perception in Beijing that Australian politicians are doing Washington\u2019s bidding when it comes to China. If Canberra raises human rights abuses in Xinjiang or concerns about the Hong Kong government invoking colonial-era emergency powers, Chinese officials accuse the government of pandering to Washington.\n\nThis assertion is frustrating for those working to improve ties, because it is often not true. Australia may be less powerful than the United States, but it is grown up enough to have its own independent views on China\u2019s affairs. Canberra cannot afford to be as aggressive with China as Washington, but it also has the right - some would argue an obligation - to raise human rights issues.\n\nDespite their importance, Hong Kong and Xinjiang are almost side issues for Canberra. The real test in the relationship will come from matters which directly threaten Australia\u2019s sovereignty or security in the region. This includes Huawei's access to 5G networks, academic interference, disputes in the South China Sea or China-built military bases in Australia\u2019s backyard.\n\nThrough all this, Australia's commercial relationship with China remains strong. Australian executives on the ground say it is largely business as usual, although they are increasingly nervous about sudden changes in regulation, stricter visa requirements and the nationalistic backlash against companies perceived as supporting the Hong Kong protesters or Taiwan's independence.\n\nDemand for Australia\u2019s iron ore and gas remains robust and is likely to remain that way for some time. But analysts in China say restrictions on Australian coal remain in place, and securing new licences to import agricultural products such as dairy and beef is troublesome.\n\nSo what can the government do to mend ties? Penny Wong says the prime minister is putting populism ahead of foreign policy, while former ambassador Geoff Raby says Canberra should take a leaf out Victoria's book and sign up to Xi's signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nOthers believe Australia needs to wean itself off its economic dependence on China. The other sensible tactic is to keep the dialogue open with China on as many levels as possible which is what is what many in government are trying to do.\n\nForeign policy will be on the agenda when China's leaders meet behind closed doors this week for what is called a plenum. But despite the US trade war and growing international pressure on human rights issues, there are no signs of a softening in the way Beijing deals with Australia or anyone else.", "description": "China's approach to Australia has shifted in the past six months.
