But where is the acknowledgment of the very substantial differences between the claims against Kavanaugh and virtually any other recent high-profile claim of sexual misconduct \u2014 either in the #MeToo era or before?\n\nClaims against public figures such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Roy Moore, and many, many others feature a considerable amount of contemporaneous corroborating evidence. Other people will state that the victim specifically told them about the incident when it occurred. There will at least be evidence the accuser and accused were together at the date and times specified.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that #BelieveWomen is a slogan, not an evidentiary standard. We should hear all accusers and carefully consider their claims. But before we judge claims \u201ccredible,\u201d shouldn\u2019t there be at least some meaningful supporting evidence? And is a word such as \u201ccredible\u201d appropriate when the available additional evidence fundamentally contradicts the accusations?", "description": "", "authors": ["David French", "Nationalreview.Com No-Brett-Kavanaugh-Has-Not-Been-Credibly-Accused"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
