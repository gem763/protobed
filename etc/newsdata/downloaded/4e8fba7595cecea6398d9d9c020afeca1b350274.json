Today.\n\nNew research from Barclays suggests that Brits hoping to find love in time for Hallmark\u2019s favourite holiday will need to start going out on dates today \u2013 because that\u2019s how long it takes to get coupled up.\n\nThe bank has revealed that we will go on a total of 18 dates before meeting a long-term partner.\n\nSo, if that\u2019s one date per week, you would need to start your search on 7th October in order to find love by V Day. Talk about a deadline.\n\nSo if you want to have a significant other to exchange soppy cards and drink lukewarm Prosecco with by February, get swiping right and open up your DMs because Cuffing Season is officially open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis trend is supported by research from dating app Hinge which found that men are 15 per cent more likely to look for a relationship in the colder months than any other season, while women are five per cent more likely to.\n\nIt makes sense. Autumn is the perfect time to snuggle up with a partner on the sofa, binge all the great new Netflix releases and generally shun all outdoor activity until Christmas party season kicks off.\n\nBut settling down with your autumn cuddle buddy doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nBarclays also found that the average spend per date is a whopping \u00a392.50 per person. So single Brits are set to spend \u00a31,665 each through the Cuffing Season in order to find \u2018the one\u2019.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to start taking your dates to Wetherspoons instead of Groucho?\n\nTips to keep your costs down on dates Set a budget: Dating can be expensive, particularly in the early stages when the pressure to impress is on. For the sake of your finances, it\u2019s important not to get carried away. Before going out, set yourself a realistic budget for the evening based on how much you can afford to spend. Stick to your budget: Even with the best intentions, it is easy to get carried away with spending once you are out and enjoying yourself. Consider taking your budget for the date in cash, so you can keep track of how much you have to spend, and to discourage you from going over. Bag a bargain: If you are planning on going out for a meal or to see a film, look for money-saving offers that you can use to keep costs down \u2013 there is often a deal to be had \u2013 or perhaps you could swap a night out for a night in instead! Keep on top of your finances: The best way to ensure you aren\u2019t spending more than you can afford is to always know how much money you have to spend. Honesty is the best policy: Money can be an awkward topic to chat about at the best of times, let alone with someone that you are dating \u2013 but you don\u2019t want to be putting yourself under financial pressure because you want to avoid the topic. If you are keeping a closer eye on your finances, let your date know and suggest a different activity that\u2019s more within your budget. Cutting costs doesn\u2019t mean cutting the fun, and they will probably be grateful about saving a few pounds themselves.

And there are plenty of ways to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day even if you\u2019re free and single.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, obviously, it\u2019s up to you. But if your deepest desire is to be presented with a wilting red rose in February, then you had best get a move on.\n\nMORE: Christmas has come early as Lovehoney launches sex toy advent calendar\n\nMORE: Woman quits job as funeral director to become a professional mermaid earning \u00a3100 an hour\n\nMORE: Artist creates brilliant paintings of the Queen by using her boobs as brushes\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "New research suggests that Brits need to start dating someone today - 7th October - if they want to be in a relationship by Valentine's Day.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dating-3-60ba_1570444836.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
