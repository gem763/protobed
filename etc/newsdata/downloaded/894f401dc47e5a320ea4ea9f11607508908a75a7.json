Since July, Mr. Zuckerberg has reportedly courted conservatives in private, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.\n\n\u201cIn your ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures, some of who advance the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a hoax, did you discuss so-called social media bias against conservatives and do you believe there is a bias?\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\n\u201cUh, congresswoman, um, sorry, I don\u2019t remember everything that was in the sentence, in the question that you asked,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez followed up by asking why Mr. Zuckerberg would allow the conservative outlet The Daily Caller to function as a fact-checker for Facebook, which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez labeled \u201ca publication well-documented with ties to white supremacists.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you won\u2019t take down lies or you will take down lies? I think that\u2019s just a pretty simple yes or no.\u201d\n\n\n\nComplete exchange between @RepAOC @AOC and Mark Zuckerberg at today\u2019s House Financial Services Cmte hearing.\n\n\n\nFull video here: https://t.co/heT7Psnlp1 pic.twitter.com/0iiWtfU5gQ \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWe actually don\u2019t appoint the independent fact-checkers, they go through an independent organization, called the Independent Fact-Checking Network that has a rigorous standard for who they allow to serve as a fact-checker,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\nAs time allotted for her questioning expired, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez continued to press Mr. Zuckerberg for why he would allow \u201cwhite-supremacist-tied publications\u201d to meet Facebook\u2019s standards for fact-checking. Mr. Zuckerberg responded by again pointing to the Independent Fact-Checking Network, a project of Poynter, as the one making the determination.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
