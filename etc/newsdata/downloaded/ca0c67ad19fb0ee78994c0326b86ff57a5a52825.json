Vergecast hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn attended and were able to record an interview with Google\u2019s hardware chief Rick Osterloh, the company\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services.\n\nOsterloh talked about the new products Google announced, including the Pixel 4, the Pixelbook Go, the Nest Mini, and the all-new Pixel Buds. The conversation also touched on Google\u2019s approach to marketing its many hardware products, updates to the camera on the Pixel 4, and how serious the company is about Project Soli motion gestures and the Thread smart home protocol.\n\nTake a listen to the interview here or subscribe in your podcast app.\n\nBelow is a lightly edited excerpt of the conversation.\n\nDieter Bohn: So, you\u2019ve made an incredible phone. How do you make sure that you sell it to an incredible number of people?\n\nRick Osterloh: Well, thank you. One of the key things is, we\u2019ve been pretty measured in our distribution approach to date. Now, we\u2019re going to be available from day one on all the major US carriers. I think that\u2019s going to make a big difference. We announced we\u2019ll be on AT&T and T-Mobile and Sprint and Verizon today, so that\u2019s great. You can also buy it unlocked from us or Best Buy and other places, and supports Google Fi as well.\n\nThat\u2019ll be the key thing when all the channels that people are primarily buying these products through or selling our product, I think that\u2019ll help us a lot. Of course, we have a lot of marketing push behind it as well.\n\nNilay Patel: Well, so a lot of marketing push is kind of the key, right? There was a bunch of marketing push around the previous Pixel phones. Is it going to be substantially more or are you going to go make sort of the investments that your big competitors make in marketing phones?\n\nWe think they\u2019re pretty significant. You\u2019ll see a lot of our advertisements around. You know, we\u2019ll be in a lot of live events. We also do a lot on YouTube. We found that we can reach the people we\u2019re trying to reach on YouTube.\n\nNP: How very convenient.\n\nYes. YouTube is a handy marketing capability, but at the same time it\u2019s sort of obvious, too. We\u2019re selling a phone that brings together the best of Google services, so a lot of those people are going to be using Google services. So it\u2019s a good place--\n\nNP: One of the narratives of the overall phone market is saturated, right? There\u2019s not a lot of people in America who don\u2019t have a smartphone who want to buy an $800 flagship phone. So, you\u2019ve got to convert. Either switch people from the other ecosystem or you\u2019ve got to convert them out of being a Samsung or LG or something. Are you actively thinking about that challenge?\n\nYeah, I mean, everyone who buys one of our phones is probably coming from something else and that\u2019s just a mature market. And the thing they\u2019re coming from is probably pretty good, so it\u2019s super important to keep trying to improve the user experience and you have to make it better and better every year. The upgrade cycles are really slowing down. I think you said this actually in a recent podcast. But most of the people we\u2019re making product for are actually people that own a Pixel 1 or Pixel 2 or maybe something like an iPhone 7 or something. This is actually a really big upgrade for them and can be quite a big difference because they\u2019ve skipped like two or three generations of product.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make it easy for someone to use a Pixel for the first time. Trying to make it so that the setup experience is easy if they\u2019re coming from a different ecosystem, that the conversion process is okay. We now have included, with all the Pixel 4s, Google One support. So they can have live support if they run into something they don\u2019t understand. They can call someone and they\u2019ll literally walk them through how to get through it.\n\nSo, hopefully that will help a lot. It\u2019s certainly hard to convert people to a new product and ours is definitely different. It\u2019s how we as Google want the experience to show up to our users and we hope people like it.\n\nNP: So, a big part of that is Soli.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nNP: Is that a science experiment? Is this something you\u2019re committed to for generations of phones?\n\nYeah. We\u2019re definitely going to keep working on it for the long term. I think it\u2019s going to be useful for phones and other things, too. It\u2019s probably not very hard to imagine how it might work in something in your home. There\u2019s a ton of pretty interesting applications that could come from it, too, that we\u2019re experimenting with. I mean, gestures are kind of obvious like... I think it\u2019s also one of my favorite things, is if you walk away from your phone, it locks. Things like that.\n\nBut we can also do some pretty interesting stuff around things like sleep tracking. We also think we can probably get a pretty accurate read on heartbeat. So, this technology is really interesting.\n\nNP: Wait. The Soli sensor, in the phone right now, can... How does it detect a heartbeat? Or how could it detect a heartbeat?\n\nAll it is, is just like--\n\nNP: Just waves of--\n\nJust waves... the signal coming back and we try to figure out what it is. Like, what are we reading?\n\nAnd so, we think we can do pretty interesting things like that. Now, they\u2019re all research experiments right now, but we do believe we can land some of these in the coming quarters.\n\nDB: How did you decide on the feature set that you\u2019re including in the Pixel phone? Specifically for Motion Sense, because it\u2019s just a handful of things. I used Soli three years ago and I was able to do wacky things like rub my finger and thumb together and adjust volume. So, there\u2019s many, many things you could have included. How\u2019d you land on this set?\n\nWell, these were a combination of very common use cases and also things that we thought were really useful and quite frankly, things that we knew we could really get right. Because there\u2019s a lot of other things that are possible like we just mentioned, but you have to have them be completely right for them to be truly useful.\n\nSo, we knew that this, in and of itself, is hard enough. Like you saw in the video, like someone moving a coffee cup, you really don\u2019t want to skip to the next song when that happens, but the face unlock capability along with this was really useful. That made it so that it could be pretty performant and those are just a couple of examples of things that we knew we could get right and that were going to be... You know, people are going to unlock their phone about a hundred times a day. So, that\u2019s going to be something that is pretty useful.\n\nNP: Just to answer the question, you\u2019re all committed to Soli. It\u2019s going to be a feature of the products. You\u2019ll see it across sort of the Google hardware ecosystem in the years to come?\n\nI think so. Yeah, I mean, we\u2019ll definitely keep working on it and see where we think it\u2019s going to be the most useful. But like, gestures at a glance when you\u2019re listening to music at a high level seems like a pretty useful capability to me. So, we\u2019ll keep working on it and hopefully we can get it right and get it in some more products.\n\nNP: So this was the first phone. I think the 3A was technically the first phone that the HTC team that you guys acquired helped you out. But this is the first flagship phone with that big team involved. What\u2019s been different about that process versus sort of the previous flagship Pixel phones?\n\nAh, well, I mean, we\u2019re a lot bigger now and you\u2019re starting to see the capability of our Taiwan team really come into play. I mean, they\u2019re so experienced and have done a lot of really interesting technology developments over the years. So, we\u2019re psyched to have them as part of our organization. They\u2019re awesome. They\u2019re very good at product and we\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to work with them. We\u2019re one large functioning organization that knows how to ship together and I think that\u2019s a really key thing that\u2019s actually quite hard to figure out with new people coming together, like how do you actually make a good product and ship it?\n\nThere\u2019s so many thousands of interactions that happen every day between people in your organization that you have to come to a common language of how you develop things and what\u2019s important and what\u2019s good enough and what your focus areas are. So, we\u2019re--\n\nNP: In having that team, what do you do that you don\u2019t think you would have been able to do before?\n\nWell, for sure, Pixel 3A is a great example, but they completely did all of that phone. So, it was done entirely out of our Taiwan team and they did a great job with it. Now, it\u2019s like everything is inter-meshed so we have our... All the stuff we\u2019re building, our road map, they\u2019re involved at some degree and in many cases, they\u2019re doing full products. It\u2019s... a lot of it is just a function of scale. That\u2019s a key thing.\n\nThey also have some really terrific expertise in wireless and RF and mechanical engineering, too. It\u2019s super helpful as well that they\u2019re in Asia and they\u2019re very close to our supplier so that... Many of our suppliers, so that is a tremendous help.\n\nDB: So, if they\u2019re super good at RF and wireless, why was this not the moment to make a 5G phone?\n\n5G is still pretty early and we could have made a $1,200 phone like everyone else. We didn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t think a $1,200 phone was the best thing to do right now. I think 5G will be interesting eventually, but it\u2019s early. We\u2019ll keep working on it, but we didn\u2019t feel the timing was right for us now.\n\nI think my point of view is that right now, 5G has a lot of fundamentals that could be better... Like better useful, I mean. You\u2019re going to get more capacity out of networks. You\u2019ll get reduced latency. You\u2019ll get better IP support. So, there\u2019s a lot of positive things that can come of it, but it\u2019s just like everyone is in the process of upgrading and it\u2019s going to take a very long time.\n\nThe other key thing is there\u2019s no super obvious driving application right now. Frankly, I think Stadia is one of the things that would be most interesting on 5G because of reduced latency and things like that, like cloud gaming. But it\u2019s different than with 4G where it\u2019s sort of like you couldn\u2019t watch video on 3G, but you could on 4G. And you couldn\u2019t really browse on 3G, but you could on 4G.\n\nNP: So, let\u2019s shift to the camera \u2014 the feature you are shipping, not the 5G radio that you\u2019re not. So, the camera\u2019s been the big differentiator of the Pixel 1 for years now. It\u2019s the reference standard we hold up all the other smartphones against. I think Apple did a pretty good job this year. I enjoyed Marc Levoy onstage taking his shots. Some of what he was saying is anybody can understand what\u2019s happening here. It\u2019s not mad science.\n\nHow are you thinking about that camera as a differentiator moving forward? How are you thinking about the look of the Pixel? It has had a very distinctive look over time. Is that still the thing that\u2019s going to market the phone for you? Is it a package?\n\nRight. I think it\u2019s a key pillar of who we are. As I look back on the last four years, or last four generations, it\u2019s such great strength of Google that we were able to build on. I think it\u2019s a great example of how we hopefully bring forward Google hardware going forward, which is, we have this incredible technology strength and research around imaging. We\u2019re able to combine it with some interesting hardware design and create a user experience that we think best represents our latest technology.\n\nWe were very fortunate to have people like Marc and many others like him who were working on cutting-edge imaging science. Every year, we try to bring their latest research and work to market. This year, obviously the key focus was really on zoom. That was an enormous area of focus. We combined some pretty interesting concepts with optical zoom and Super Res Zoom that we shipped last year with Pixel 3. The results are it\u2019s pretty cool. I think people are going to find zooming is now actually a really viable thing to do on smartphones. In the past, I\u2019d say results have been mixed and a lot of users are a little bit worried about actually doing it.", "description": "Google held their annual hardware event in New York City this week to announce all their upcoming products under the Pixel and Nest line.
