That gassy planet is prominent in the evening\u2019s prime time now, but if you look low and to the right, you\u2019ll see the reddish Antares.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know where Jupiter is, the first-quarter moon leapfrogs over it Sept. 5 and 6, and the swelling moon sneaks past Saturn on Sept. 7 and 8. Saturn is a zero-magnitude planet, loitering in the south in the mid-evening, and the ringed planet is substantially dim compared with Jupiter. Find Saturn near the handle of Sagittarius\u2019s teapot shape.\n\nMars, Mercury and Venus hide in the sun\u2019s glare. Mars conjuncts with the sun on Sept. 2, and the fleet Mercury reaches superior conjunction (Mercury is behind the sun from Earth \u2019s perspective) on Sept. 4. The effervescent Venus reached superior conjunction Aug. 14 and will emerge from the sun\u2019s glare later in September, low in the evening\u2019s western sky. Mars surfaces from the sun\u2019s brightness later in October.\n\nWelcome to fall! The Autumnal Equinox \u2014 when the sun appears to cross from the Northern Hemisphere into the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 is Sept. 23 at 3:50 a.m. Eastern time, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. That\u2019s when fall starts in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 and spring starts in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe harvest moon \u2014 the full moon near the autumnal equinox \u2014 officially happens Sept. 14 at 12:33 a.m. Eastern time, according to the observatory. Because this happens just after midnight in the eastern United States, the full moon occurs on Sept. 13 for the remaining time zones. Thus, for the central time zone, that moon becomes full at 11:33 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nDown-to-Earth events:\n\n\u25cf Sept. 5 \u2014 The University of Maryland Observatory, College Park, hosts an open house, which features an astronomy talk and then observations of the heavens, weather permitting. 9 p.m. www.astro.umd.edu/open house.\n\n\u25cf Sept. 6 \u2014 \u201cQuantum Gravity: It\u2019s Different and Why,\u201d a lecture by Jared Kaplan, a Johns Hopkins University physics professor, at the Philosophical Society of Washington.
