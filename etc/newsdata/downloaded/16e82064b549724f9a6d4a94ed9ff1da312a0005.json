Gonzales, who was arrested at the auto dealership where he worked, was booked into the Hunt County jail on a charge of capital murder of multiple persons. Bond was set at $1 million.\n\nThe shooting happened around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. Authorities believe the shooter may have been targeting just one person at the party of about 750 people, and that others may have been shot at random, Meeks has said.\n\nKevin Berry Jr. of Dallas and Byron Craven Jr. of Arlington, both 23, were killed, authorities said.\n\nThe shooting took place at a Halloween and homecoming party for Texas A&M University-Commerce at a facility called The Party Venue, according to Meeks, though officials said it was not a school-sanctioned event.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter entered the venue, which sits along a highway in a rural area some 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from the Greenville city limits, through the back door and began firing with a handgun, Meeks said. It was \"complete chaos\" after the shots rang out, with hundreds of people including the gunman fleeing, the sheriff said.\n\nOf the 12 people injured, six were shot and six were trampled or hurt by glass, authorities said. Five remained in the hospital \u2014 one in critical condition and four in good condition \u2014 on Monday, Meeks said.\n\nThe shooting came as Texas A&M University-Commerce, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of Dallas, celebrated homecoming weekend. According to its website, it is the second-largest university in the Texas A&M University System.\n\nAfter a vigil for Berry on Sunday night at a Dallas park, at least one person opened fire. Dallas police said no one was injured but several vehicles were reported damaged.\n\nTexas A&M University-Commerce had planned to hold a community gathering Monday afternoon featuring student and faith-based leaders along with counselors. But the school later said that based on conversations with students, the decision was made to postpone the gathering. University officials did not elaborate.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the suspect's last name is Gonzales, not Gonzalez.", "description": "A man suspected of opening fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, killing two people and injuring 12 others, was arrested Monday.
