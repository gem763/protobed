Donors for Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have argued that such implicit bias causes voters and pundits to treat Mr. Buttigieg as the natural heir to Mr. Biden\u2019s moderate coalition, though their candidates perform better among older black voters, the Democrats\u2019 most loyal moderate voting block.\n\nOther Democrats, however, say the blame rests with the candidates themselves. None of the nonwhite challengers have been able to forge a strong coalition or peel away black voters from Mr. Biden. Some voters and elected officials, white and nonwhite alike, now say privately what the polling suggests: They have not been swept off their feet by any of the candidates of color.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Democratic-Candidates-Race.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
