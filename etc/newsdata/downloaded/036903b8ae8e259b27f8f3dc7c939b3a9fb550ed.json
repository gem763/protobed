Katie Hill demanded the Daily Mail take down a group of graphic, intimate images on Thursday, including one of her nude and holding a bong. The California Democrat\u2019s lawyers argued that the tabloid committed a criminal act under California\u2019s revenge porn law by publishing the photos.\n\n\u201cYou have also exposed your publication to grave legal consequences for California has some of the strongest criminal laws in the United States against the secretive generation and distribution of private, sexual images,\u201d her team wrote in the letter to the Daily Mail, according to a copy of it obtained by Politico.\n\nBut successfully prosecuting a revenge porn case in California isn\u2019t necessarily the slam dunk her lawyers have suggested it is.\n\nThat\u2019s because California, often lauded as boasting some of the toughest protections for people who have seen sexually explicit photos of them leak, has adopted cumbersome statutes that make it more difficult for victims to argue their cases in court.\n\nREAD: The Katie Hill sex misconduct scandal keeps getting worse\n\nForty-six states plus D.C. criminalize the distribution of revenge porn. But the definition of what revenge porn is \u2014 and the penalties it carries \u2014 varies significantly from state to state.\n\nThough California was an early adopter of revenge porn laws in 2013, the state is far from possessing the most progressive form of the law.\n\nUnlike several other states, the penalty for revenge porn in California is only classified as a misdemeanor, which carries the possibility of a six-month jail sentence and $1,000 fine. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty minor charge,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a criminal law professor at the University of Miami who drafted the criminal statute on which many states\u2019 revenge porn laws are modeled.\n\nOther states, like Arizona and Connecticut, make the distribution of revenge porn a felony punishable by up to three to five years in state prison. Franks points out that crimes with relatively low penalties make them less urgent to judges, who may view the issuance of a search warrant as more trouble than it\u2019s worth for a crime that carries such a small charge.\n\nCalifornia also requires prosecutors to prove that the entity leaking or publishing the explicit images did so with malice, and sought to inflict distress or harm on the subject. (States like Illinois don\u2019t carry this statute.)\n\n\u201cWhen you have these statues that have these motive requirements, you really make it hard on victims to bring successful cases, because as with all criminal laws, every element would have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Franks said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if you have to show that someone did this to cause you to stress, that's really hard to prove. Because a defendant can say, \u2018Look, I didn't do it to cause stress, I did it because I thought it was an interesting news story,\u2019\u201d she continued.\n\nIt\u2019s for these reasons that Franks said California\u2019s revenge porn laws aren\u2019t actually used all that frequently.\n\n\u201cWhat we have heard anecdotally, from California, is that the [revenge porn] law does not get used very often precisely because it's so hard to prove,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Daily Mail justified publishing the photo of Hill holding a bong by claiming that it was taken several years ago, before California legalized the recreational use of pot. It also characterized a tattoo of Hill\u2019s as \u201cNazi-era.\u201d\n\nPublication of the new photos came just a day after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into Hill over allegations that she had a sexual relationship with her legislative director, an affair she denies. The congresswoman has also been trying to contain the initial fallout after a conservative blog published nude photos of her with a 24-year-old campaign aide last week.\n\nHill strongly implied that her estranged husband, who she is in the process of divorcing, leaked the photos, in a statement she made to the Washington Post this week.\n\n\u201cThe fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d Hill said. She also said that she referred the case to the U.S. Capitol Police for review.\n\n(A spokesperson for Hill did not respond to VICE News\u2019s requests for comment, and a spokesperson for the Capitol Police declined to comment on an ongoing investigation.)\n\nBecause revenge porn is so difficult to prove in California, plaintiffs tend to prosecute them using identity theft or computer fraud laws, which tend to be more successful in court.\n\nIf prosecutors in California decide to sue the entities that leaked and published the photos, Franks said it would be a fascinating case study in a revenge porn case being litigated in the public sphere.\n\n\u201cThere's often extraordinary prejudice against people like her, especially women, because there's so much judgments that are often made by law enforcement officers about whether she should have ever had these pictures to begin with, whether or not it's not her fault that they were issued,\u201d Franks said. \u201cWe've already seen the kind of really ugly sort of framing of this.\u201d\n\nCover: Rep.
