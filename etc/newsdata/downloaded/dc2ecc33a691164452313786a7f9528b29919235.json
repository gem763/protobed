The president must be held accountable. No-one is above the law.\"\n\nShe said approval of impeachment was a \"Constitutional power of the utmost gravity\" but it was the \"responsibility\" of the House to uphold the republic.\n\nMr Trump hit back on Twitter within minutes of the announcement, questioning why Democrats had not waited for the release of the call transcript and declaring: \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\n\nPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! \u2014 Donald J.
