We need to do that for a whole 60 minutes. That hasn\u2019t been a problem for us to get our starts, but it was tonight and it ended up in the back of the net.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitals (3-2-2) dug themselves an early deficit when Braden Holtby allowed three pucks past him in the game\u2019s first eight minutes. Coach Todd Reirden pulled him in favor of 22-year-old rookie Ilya Samsonov, who allowed a fourth goal on a power play barely a minute after entering.\n\nSamsonov rallied, however, and stopped 19 of the next 20 shots he faced, but committed an ill-timed turnover early in the third period that led to Matt Nieto\u2019s goal with 15:36 remaining that pushed the Avalanche lead back to three goals.\n\nDown 4-0 after 20 minutes, the Capitals punched back. Washington outshot the Avalanche, 16-7, in the second period and outhit Colorado, 12-4. to only be down 4-2 entering the third. Goals by Lars Eller at 6:56 and T.J. Oshie at 15:28 cut Colorado\u2019s lead in half.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t there,\u201d Eller said. \u201cThat is the best way to describe it. We just weren\u2019t there. . . . Maybe we thought we were better than we were. It looked, I can\u2019t speak for everybody, but it looked like we thought it was going to be easier than it was.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSamsonov\u2019s mistake early in the third period led to Nieto\u2019s goal and swung the momentum, but Alex Ovechkin\u2019s power-play goal with 2:21 left trimmed the margin back to two. Moments later, it looked like the defenseman John Carlson had pulled the Capitals within one with a goal but replay review determined Washington was offsides, wiping away the goal.\n\nNathan MacKinnon\u2019s empty-netter with 39.2 seconds left sealed it for Colorado (5-0-0).\n\nAD\n\nThe game was physical, and the Capitals lost defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler midway through the third period after a collision with MacKinnon. Siegenthaler went to the locker room immediately afterward and did not return.\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 blue line was already without Michal Kempny (hamstring), with Reirden stating Monday he was hopeful for Kempny\u2019s return this week.\n\nAD\n\nEller broke the seal for the Capitals early in the second period when Ovechkin pounced on a poor pass from Mikko Rantanen. The captain poked the puck to Eller, who slid it past former Capitals netminder Philipp Grubauer, who made 29 saves en route to winning for the third time in as many starts.\n\nAD\n\nOshie made it 4-2 when he finished off a slick passing sequence from Evgeny Kuznetsov and Dmitry Orlov for his fourth goal.\n\n\u201cIn that position, you just have to do something to do a wake-up call,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt was frustrating, but yeah we all make mistakes and I think we didn\u2019t respond well in the first period after the first and second goal.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Grubauer, who was traded to Colorado in the summer of 2018, the game also marked the return of ex-Capital forward Andre Burakovsky, who was dealt to the Avalanche in the offseason following a trade request, according to General Manager Brian MacLellan. Before Monday\u2019s contest, Burakovsky said he didn\u2019t completely agree that he \u201crequested\u201d a trade, but told the organization that he wanted to \u201cplay more and if that wouldn\u2019t be with the Caps, then it would be somewhere else.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBurakovsky, who had game-winning goals in each of his previous two games, contributed early. He recorded an assist on Colorado\u2019s first goal off a left point shot from Erik Johnson at the 3:42 mark of the first period and set a screen on Holtby to block his view of Johnson\u2019s shot.\n\nColorado flew right back down the ice, tallying its second goal on its second shot of the night at the six-minute mark from Nikita Zadorov. Nazem Kadri\u2019s goal at the 7:54 mark of the first period was about all Reirden needed to see from Holtby, who was ushered off for Samsonov.\n\n\u201cJust got to find a way,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cSometimes it comes easy, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Just have to find a way to help the team win and it is on me to make sure I improve that and it is frustrating.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Caps are unable to dig themselves out from early 4-0 hole as Colorado wins fifth straight to start season.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8EUrav2koyihcM12cnCkoEll21M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N3MMURHO3YI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
