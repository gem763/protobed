It operates 52 U.S. golfing centers, three in Britain and one in Australia.\n\nTopgolf has invited investment banks to pitch for roles on the IPO, which is planned for next year, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sources cautioned that the IPO plans had not been finalized and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Topgolf declined to comment.\n\nAmong Topgolf\u2019s top investors are investment firm WestRiver Group, sporting goods company Callaway Golf Co (ELY.N), hockey team Carolina Hurricanes majority owner Thomas Dundon, and buyout firm Providence Equity Partners.\n\nWhen Callaway increased its investment in Topgolf in December 2017, it valued its 14% stake at $290 million, suggesting an equity valuation for Topgolf of $2.1 billion. Topgolf\u2019s estimated valuation currently could not be established.\n\nTopgolf uses microchips in its balls to track distance and accuracy across a variety of golf games. It also offers food and drinks to its golfers.\n\nTwin brothers Steve and Dave Jolliffe originated the concept in 2000 in Watford, just outside London.\n\nThe golfing sector has proved popular with investment firms in recent years. Private equity firm KPS Capital Partners acquired golf equipment and clothing brands TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth from Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) two years ago for $425 million.", "description": "U.S. golfing center operator Topgolf International Inc is in talks with investment banks about hiring underwriters for an initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
