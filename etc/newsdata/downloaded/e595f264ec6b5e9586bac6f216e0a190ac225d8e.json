It holds together tightly \u2013 the most secure out of all of the lunch boxes we tested \u2013 thanks to a vacuum release valve system, which is nifty, and ensures no leakages. While it was tricky to choose between this lunch box and Black + Blum\u2019s sandwich box (which has a bamboo lid which doubles up as a chopping board), this one came out top as it has the added bonus of being able to be used in the oven, and can also be placed in the freezer (obviously not suitable for microwave as stainless steel). It\u2019s surprisingly lightweight, and also looks the part. Box, fork and divider are all dishwasher safe.\n\nBuy now\n\nBamboo reusable lunch box: \u00a39.99, Oxfam\n\nWith its colourful painted base and bamboo top, stylistically this lunch box was one of our favourites. Made from sustainably-sourced bamboo fibre and solid bamboo, it also has great eco credentials. It shuts firmly \u2013 and that\u2019s without using the additional silicone strap it comes with. The downside is that it is best not to fill with liquids such as soup, nor can it be placed in the microwave. It\u2019s also best to wash by hand (even though the bottom can be placed in the dishwasher). But it\u2019s still a fantastic option for salads and sandwiches and when not in use, makes a great storage container for the kitchen.\n\nBuy now\n\nTala Push & Push food to go dual compartment tuck-box with cutlery: \u00a38.83, Amazon\n\nThis compact lunch box, which can house 650ml and 230ml of contents respectively, promises to be 100 per cent leak proof and airtight \u2013 and we didn\u2019t experience any leakages while testing. We particularly enjoyed is handy in built open and close mechanism where you push down to lock, and again push to open. We also liked the fact that it comes with a fork and spoon attached to its side, which fit snugly without being cumbersome and have a protective case around them to keep them clean. As a vertical container, this is great for salads, or noodle dishes like ramen. The separate compartment on top is handy for things such as herbs, nuts, or snacks, or salad dressing if you don\u2019t want your salad to go soggy. It can be placed in the microwave, fridge, freezer and dishwasher and is BPA free.\n\nBuy now\n\nSistema salad to go reusable lunch box: \u00a33.99, Sainsbury\u2019s\n\nThis well-thought out and compact lunch box also has a large capacity, holding up to 1.1l. Its neat, square-shape fits nicely in a bag (and stacks away neatly into a cupboard), while also being highly functional: it houses a dual-top compartment, which is ideal for sandwiches and snacks, plus a separate bottom compartment, a nifty little pot for salad dressings and a spoon and fork which tucks away inside. It also clips shut tightly. The dividing tray, along with its connecting cutlery and salad dressing pot, are also removable if you simply want to fill the whole space with your choice of lunch. The cutlery is a nice touch, as is the salad dressing pot. It\u2019s also safe to us in dishwasher, microwave (excluding lid), fridge and freezer and is phthalate and BPA free.\n\nBuy now\n\nWilko discovery reusable lunch bag tote: \u00a34, Wilko\n\nWhile not strictly a lunch box per se, this stylish lunch bag is a great option for transporting your lunch, especially if you\u2019re a sandwich-plus-all-the-snacks type grazer. On top of looking the part (and being impressively affordable), it\u2019s also functional. The top is roomy enough to fold over several times, before securing with velcro and a buckle. The bag boasts a 3.7l capacity in total, meaning there\u2019s also space for a drink and even ice packs if you want to keep everything cool. We particularly enjoyed its easy-to-clean lining \u2013 it simply needs a wipe down if anything should spill. The best bit? It\u2019s nice enough to carry as it is, so lunch is always accessible.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland small leak-proof lunch box with compartments: \u00a37.99, Lakeland\n\nThe kidney-shaped design of this compact and functional lunchbox means it\u2019s not too bulky for your bag. We also found it to be successfully leak-proof, in part due to its secure silicone rim. The clear lid is also handy for helping you identify which lunch is yours in the staff fridge, although it is slightly on the heavy side. Handy additions include a removable dressing pot, plus a fork which tucks neatly into the side of the container. Handily, it\u2019s also dishwasher and microwave safe.\n\nBuy now\n\nTefal masterseal to go snack box,1.2l: \u00a39, Amazon\n\nWhen you can\u2019t quite decide what to have for lunch, it\u2019s best to have a bit of everything, and this well-designed lunch box is the answer. It comes with three removable compartments, which are incredibly useful if you\u2019re feeling indecisive, or if you\u2019re feeding a baby or toddler. Four large clips safely lock everything in place, so you don\u2019t have to worry about spilling any of your lunch either. Handily, this is also microwave safe, and suitable for freezing.\n\nBuy now\n\nElephant Box steel reusable lunch box: \u00a329.50, Yumbles\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to transport a hearty lunch, this one\u2019s for you, and the fact that it\u2019s made from sustainable, food grade stainless steel makes a welcome change to plastic. It boasts a fantastic depth (7.5cm, with a 1.8l capacity), so just the thing if you have a penchant for hefty, doorstop-style sandwiches for your lunch. Also, as it\u2019s stainless steel, it doesn\u2019t suffer from discolouring or lingering odours, which other lunch boxes on the market can. The design is inspired by traditional tiffin boxes, but as it isn\u2019t leakproof we wouldn\u2019t recommend filling with curry. It can be popped in the dishwasher, so it\u2019s nice and easy to clean. You can even write your name on it with a dry-wipe marker.\n\nBuy now\n\nbobbleBox 1.8l reusable lunch box: \u00a313.99, Auteur\n\nAvailable in a range of colours including surf, neon pink and our personal favourite, a combination of grey and neon pink, this vibrant lunchbox will certainly jazz up your lunch. This sizeable container comes with a removable top section, split into two for sandwiches/ snacks, and a larger bottom compartment for salads. Plus, unlike many of the other lunch boxes we tested, this comes with a removable ice pack to keep your lunches cool. Stylish yet robust, its leak-resistant thick walls means your lunch is going to stay in one piece, even if it\u2019s thrown around in your bag on your commute. Good news for the environment, too \u2013 it\u2019s recyclable and BPA free. For convenience, it can also be used in the freezer, microwave, and the top rack of the dishwasher.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoseph Joseph go eat reusable lunch box: \u00a316, Joseph Joseph\n\nWhen it comes to kitchenware, Joseph Joseph is celebrated for its functional yet stylish products, and this lunch box is no exception.
