As well as raising $13,000 from wine sales for the charity so far, Burton has established work experience placements at Gundog\u2019s cellar door for young people at risk of or experiencing homelessness.\n\nVinomofo CEO Justin Dry picking grapes in the Yarra Valley for the Homeless Grapes Project label.\n\n\u201cAs owners of a small business you travel a challenging personal journey,\u201d he says. \u201cSuddenly you reach a point where you realise how privileged you are. Once you realise that, it becomes a really obvious path to find a way to give back to the community.\u201d\n\nWhile these initiatives certainly contribute to a company\u2019s sense of community engagement \u2013 and fulfil their corporate and social responsibility \u2013 not everyone believes the sale of alcohol should be associated with certain kinds of fundraising.\n\nThis year, Canberra entrepreneur Ben Osborne launched a vodka called Cheers Mate. Describing his new product as \u201cthe world\u2019s most ethical vodka\u201d, Osborne donates the $10 profit from the sale of each bottle to mental health support networks working with the hospitality industry.\n\nThe Homeless Grapes label has four wines and is \"a community-focused project,\u201d says wine buyer Charlotte Cels.\n\nThe chief executive of the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, Michael Thorn, has been scathing in his criticism. In a comment piece on the DrinkSpace website titled \u201cEthical vodka? You must be taking the piss!\u201d, he described Osborne\u2019s initiative as \u201cincredibly misguided\u201d and \u201ctone deaf\u201d, failing to make the link between alcohol, depression and suicide.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t support the thousands of people injured and orphaned by exploding landmines by selling them landmines; no matter how lucrative,\u201d Thorn wrote.\n\nThe Woolworths-owned liquor chain BWS faced a similar backlash by partnering with the Dry July Foundation: critics such as Thorn felt it was highly inappropriate that a charity raising funds for people with cancer should associate itself with a company selling alcohol when alcohol is linked to more than 5000 cases of cancer in Australia each year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome might argue there is a certain contradiction, too, in raising money to secure a water supply in another country with wine made using increasingly precious irrigation water in this country; or raising money to help homelessness, when alcohol so often plays a role in causing that problem in the first place.\n\nHow do the people on the frontline of the fundraising feel about such criticisms?\n\n\u201cWe do understand there is an association between alcohol abuse and homelessness,\u201d says Vinomofo partnerships manager Rosa Nguyen. \u201cWe also acknowledge that there are a multitude of reasons why homelessness occurs ... \u2018Do Good\u2019 is actually a part of our company credo and homelessness is the key focus of this charity arm of the company, as it\u2019s something that we\u2019re passionate about, especially our CEO and founder, Justin Dry. Justin has been involved with this cause for more than a decade.\u201d\n\nGundog Estate's Matt Burton says the partnership with Path 2 Change has been rewarding for both parties.\n\nGundog Estate\u2019s Matt Burton says both his staff and Path 2 Change\u2019s clients have found the experience of working together very rewarding. \u201cOne of the most significant aspects of this partnership has been the establishment of communication lines which allow everyone involved to see how the funds are being used, and the profound impact our support is having on the lives of vulnerable young people.\u201d\n\nMelbourne support centre St Mary\u2019s House of Welcome will be pouring Vinomofo\u2019s Homeless Grapes Project chardonnay \u2013 along with a dozen other Victorian wines \u2013 and encouraging people to buy it by the case at their annual Degustation for Dignity fundraising dinner on October 25 (disclosure: I helped select the wines to be poured at the event, and will be MC for the evening).\n\nI asked St Mary\u2019s chief executive, Robina Bradley, how she felt about selling wine to raise money to help people whose own relationship with alcohol is often very damaging.\n\n\u201cAll the guys here know exactly what we do with our fundraising,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cThey know it involves alcohol, and they all assure me they\u2019re OK with that.\u201d\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nSt Mary\u2019s House of Welcome\u2019s annual Degustation for Dignity, a seven-course fundraising dinner with matching wines from top producers and a silent auction, is at Collingwood Town Hall, Melbourne, on October 25.
