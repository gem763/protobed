Not surprisingly, Westpac's direct mail campaign, starting in 2014, was designed to persuade customers they could save money by rolling over their super into BT products and services. And it worked. Over three years, some $650 million was rolled over into its BT Funds Management arm.\n\nHayne's recommendations disappointed those hoping for radical structural shifts in the financial services industry by deciding not to back the end of \"vertical integration\". This allows financial institutions to manufacture financial products and sell them to customers, often via the provision of financial advice.\n\nBut Hayne decided this level of disruption could not be justified, particularly given the changes already occurring in practice in the industry. Except for Westpac, three of the big banks are getting out of wealth management altogether, for example, having discovered profits are not worth the reputational damage in an era where commissions are (very belatedly) disappearing.\n\nAnd although Westpac wants to maintain its BT wealth management business, it is in negotiations to sell its financial advice arm. This does underscore a key question in the financial services industry. Unless people are prepared to pay several thousand dollars up front for \"independent\" personal financial advice, they can't expect to get it. Given bad or conflicted financial advice is usually worse than no advice, that's not necessarily a negative.\n\nBut for people on average incomes who do want assistance in \"their best interests\", how to pay for it is still a work in progress for consumers and businesses alike.\n\nASIC has been encouraged to \"prosecute first and ask questions later\", one lawyer claims. Peter Braig\n\nDefining personal advice\n\nIn Westpac's case, ASIC lost part of its test case when it argued BT had crossed the line into personal advice for 15 customers after Justice Gleeson ruled in favour of the bank last December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProviding personal advice requires comprehensive (and expensive) analysis of a person's individual circumstances to ensure it is in their best interests. This is in contrast to general advice that can be provided for free with much less need for detailed examination of the individual's financial needs and priorities.\n\nAccording to Daniel Crennan, ASIC's new deputy chairman appointed to beef up enforcement, the dividing line between personal and general advice is one of the most important provisions within financial services laws.\n\n\"It directly impacts the standard of advice received by consumers,\"he said in a statement. \"This is why ASIC brought this test case and ASIC believes further consideration by the Full Court of the Federal Court is necessary to better inform consumers and industry.\"\n\nBut Justice Gleeson also found the bank had breached Section 912A of the Corporations Act by not ensuring it had done everything necessary to ensure its sales process to sell super products was provided \"efficiently, honestly and fairly\".\n\nThe judge found the bank's systems and marketing scripts for staff responding to queries were inadequate, making it possible to say the wrong thing, even inadvertently.\n\nTougher penalties\n\nWestpac is at least fortunate in timing. There is currently no financial penalty written into the law for breaches of that particular section. But the Senate finally passed a bill to allow ASIC last Friday to impose dramatically increased fines on corporations and executives for breaches of the Corporations act overall. The House is now expected to pass it this week, leading to a major if so far little-appreciated impact on the whole financial services industry.\n\nThat is because the new laws mean maximum civil penalties for individuals jump from $200,000 to the greater of $1.05 million or three times the benefit gained. For corporations, maximum civil penalties rise from $1 million to the greater of $10.5 million or three times the benefit or 10 per cent of annual turnover, capped at $525 million. That can really add up.\n\nThese provisions now include breaches of Section 912A despite the interpretation of \"fairness\" being rather vague and subjective legally.\n\n\"With the fire lit under ASIC's toes to prosecute first and ask questions later, and the penalties now so large, it will lead to a lot more court cases,\" says one lawyer.\n\nThe results will play out long after the \"Shock and Orr\" of the royal commission \u2013 or the fate of mortgage brokers \u2013 have faded from public consciousness.", "description": "ASIC's move against Westpac on Monday is a sign of a new mood among regulators \u2013 \"prosecute first and ask questions later\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4073%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1964%2C$x_36%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/22807f54cdfc496482c507cdc4206aa139a88669", "published_at": "2019-02-18"}
