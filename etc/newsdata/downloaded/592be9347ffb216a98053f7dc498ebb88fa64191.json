But the director-general said I was not allowed to participate and should not raise my hand because I was the one who went to the media making allegations of fraud and corruption relating to the project. He was, in a way, intimidating, harassing and victimising me,\u201d Mathiba wrote.\n\n\u201cThe director-general remarked that I was happy to be a five-minute celebrity and would regret [it] for the rest of my life. I therefore feel insecure and threatened.\u201d\n\nHe said he believed that the project was pushed through, in contravention of the Sita Act, because certain individuals stood to benefit from \u201ccorruption\u201d, given that this project was a possible \u201cconduit or conveyor belt\u201d for funds.\n\n\u201cWithout this project,\u201d said Mathiba, \u201cLimpopo Connexion would have no reason to exist because it would have no work to do.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from City Press, Sita\u2019s acting chief executive officer, Ntutule Tshenye, concurred with Mathiba\u2019s view.\n\nTshenye said that Sita was working with the Limpopo government to align the broadband initiative to the legislative framework.\n\nHe said the agency was not involved in the issuing of the tender and had warned that the use of the Limpopo broadband tender would result in irregular expenditure.\n\n\u201cUpon learning about this development, Sita wrote a letter to the director-general and departmental heads in the provincial government on February 22 2018, formally alerting them not to utilise the vehicle created through Limpopo Connexion as doing so would violate the Sita Act,\u201d Tshenye said.\n\n\u201cWhile the Limpopo government has made a significant investment in broadband infrastructure, Sita has put forward reasonable options for consideration.\u201d\n\nActing provincial spokesperson Mamogo Ntuli confirmed Mathiba\u2019s suspension but would not be drawn into commenting about the charges.\n\nNtuli said the Limpopo government supported the Zondo commission\u2019s work and encouraged public servants to report corruption or maladministration to such agencies.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, we cannot comment any further, and neither will we go into the merits of the case since this is a matter between the employer and the employee,\u201d she said.\n\nWith regard to encroaching into Sita\u2019s space, Ntuli said: \u201cAccording to the Sita Act, Sita\u2019s mandate is to connect national and provincial departments, not the general population. Limpopo Connexion is focusing on connectivity to the entire population of the province. Sita and Limpopo Connexion will collaborate to provide broadband connectivity where possible.\u201d\n\nMathiba decried the fact that no action had been taken with regard to this project since February 2018, when the alleged irregularity was initially raised.\n\n\u201cWe are now approaching 2020 and nothing has happened. Limpopo wants to deplete the R585 million,\u201d he said.", "description": "Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha has allegedly suspended a senior official, who made it known that he would testify to the Zondo commission about possible corruption in the province relating to a R585 million broadband connection tender.", "authors": ["Sizwe Sama Yende"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4888/954ddbd8cde94d4e844ef6b3472b398c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
