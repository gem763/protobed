Though this might appear convenient for Apple's services revenue line it is equally inconvenient for both apparent hardware ASPs and margins in high sales quarters like the upcoming FQ1'20 to December,\" Hall added.\n\nApple shares fell 2% in trading Friday from their previous close of $223.09 a share. Goldman cut its 12-month price target on the company to $165 from $187. The firm has a neutral rating on Apple's stock.\n\nHall's new price target is the lowest of the major Wall Street banks and the fifth lowest of all analysts who cover Apple, according to TipRanks.com.\n\nApple did not immediately return CNBC's email request for comment. Goldman is not accusing Apple of improper accounting but believes that hardware profit margins will suffer as a result of this TV+ free trial and investors will react negatively.", "description": "Goldman Sachs believes Apple faces a \"material negative impact\" on earnings for the accounting method it will use for an Apple TV+ trial.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz John Melloy", "Michael Sheetz", "John Melloy"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106122287-1568139145268gettyimages-1167242360.jpeg?v=1568139169", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
