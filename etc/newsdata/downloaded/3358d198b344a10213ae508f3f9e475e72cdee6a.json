REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe move is sure to spark legal challenges over issues including states\u2019 rights and climate change that administration officials say could ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump met with senior officials last Thursday and agreed to greenlight the plan to bar California from setting tailpipe emission standards or requiring zero emission vehicles, Reuters reported last week. The White House declined to comment.\n\nThe administration plans to issue separate rules rolling back Obama-era fuel economy requirements in the coming weeks. A formal announcement is tentatively set for Wednesday at the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) headquarters and automakers and dealers have been invited to attend, industry officials said.\n\nGovernment officials said the timing is still in flux and could be announced later in the week.\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, speaking to a group of auto dealers, said Tuesday that \u201cin the very near future, the Trump administration will begin taking the steps necessary to establish one set of national fuel-economy standards.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump, federal regulators have backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials say its final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration set in 2012.\n\nThe Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration\u2019s preferred option to freeze requirements.\n\nWheeler said the EPA would take action \u201cvery soon\u201d with the U.S. Transportation Department \u201cto bring clarity to the proper \u2013 and improper \u2013 scope and use of the Clean Air Act preemption waiver.\u201d\n\nReuters has previously reported the administration plans to revoke the waiver California received in 2013 to set its own vehicle emissions standards that are followed by more than a dozen other states.\n\nCalifornia wants 15.4% of vehicle sales by 2025 to be EVs or other zero emission vehicles and 10 other states have adopted those requirements.\n\nCalifornia has vowed to challenge the Trump administration effort, arguing that the United States has an obligation to protect the environment for future generations. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court if you stand in our way,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.\n\nSome senior administration officials believe provoking a court battle with California gives them a historic chance to displace the state from vehicle emissions oversight and could give the Supreme Court the chance to revisit a landmark 5-4 2007 decision that found the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles.\n\nWheeler on Tuesday said California\u2019s ability to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles would not be affected.\n\n\u201cOne national standard will provide much-needed regulatory certainty to automakers, dealers, and consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nTo meet the Obama-era rules, automakers might have been forced to lower the price of electric vehicles and \u201craise the price of other, more popular vehicles, such as SUVs and trucks,\u201d Wheeler added.\n\n\u201cIn other words, American families are paying more for SUVs and trucks so automakers can sell EVs at a cheaper price.\u201d\n\nDan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said the attack on California and other states \u201cthreatens to make America polluted again. It rejects cleaner, less-polluting vehicles in favor of pollution-spewing Trump-mobiles for urban cowboys hauling lattes home from Starbucks.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is battling California on several auto industry fronts.\n\nIn August, the Justice Department sent letters to four major automakers asking about their voluntary agreement with California to adopt compromise vehicle emissions requirements, antitrust chief Makan Delrahim confirmed Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not out there to try to increase pollution into the air,\u201d Delrahim said at a Senate hearing.\n\nFord Motor Co (F.N), Honda Motor Co (7267.T), BMW AG (BMWG.DE), and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) said in July they had reached a deal to adopt standards that were lower than Obama-era rules but higher than the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 proposal.\n\nThe automakers were defying the Trump administration\u2019s effort to strip California of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.", "description": "The Trump administration will announce as early as Wednesday it is revoking California\u2019s authority to set its own greenhouse gas and vehicle fuel efficiency standards and barring all states from setting such rules, two auto industry officials said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430950335&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1G1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
