REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African business confidence improved in September, recovering from a 34-year low in the previous month as exports and vehicle sales increased while economic activity picked-up, a survey showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s (SACCI) monthly business confidence index (BCI) rose to 92.4 in September from 89.1 in August.\n\nSeven sub-indices of the index improved and three remained unchanged between September and August.\n\n\u201cPositive annual contributions in September came from the higher U.S. dollar price of precious metals, energy supply \u2013 the latter mainly owing to a decline in the crude oil price,\u201d SACCI said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThere are indications that the economy may have hit a trough and could obtain some stability which could auger well for growth prospects,\u201d the business body said.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most industrialised economy expanded 3.1% in the second quarter after contracting by the same margin in the first, and analysts are divided on whether the momentum can be sustained due to the slow speed of policy and economic reforms.\n\nFinance Minister Tito Mboweni\u2019s mid-term budget speech due on Oct. 30 will be closely watched for details on the restructuring of state-owned power utility Eskom and progress on reviving tax revenues.", "description": "South African business confidence improved in September, recovering from a 34-year low in the previous month as exports and vehicle sales increased while economic activity picked-up, a survey showed on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438779988&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980Q4-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
