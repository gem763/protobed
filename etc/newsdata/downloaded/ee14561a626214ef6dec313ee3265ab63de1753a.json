Foran \u2014 a seasoned retail veteran \u2014 will join Air New Zealand Limited as CEO, and is expected to stay on through January 31.\n\nThe 45-year-old Furner, who\u2019s spent 25 years at the company in key roles from chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart China to running the members-only warehouse Sam\u2019s Club, will take the reins on November 1.\n\nTo be sure, investors didn\u2019t appear to be phased by changing of the CEO guard. Shares of Walmart (WMT) held above $120 in midday dealings, setting a new intraday high.\n\nIn a note to clients, Bank of America (BofA) analysts expect Foran\u2019s departure to be viewed as a \u201csignificant loss\u201d for the U.S. business, especially because of his \u201cintegral role\u201d in driving same-store sales growth and the launch and expansion of the online grocery pickup offering.\n\nHowever, BofA also cited the retailer\u2019s \u201cimpressive momentum\u201d as reasons to remain bullish on Walmart, since Foran\u2019s departure is unlikely to yield a change in the core strategy.\n\n\u201cWe believe WMT's outlook should continue to be supported by its strong execution across both its Supercenters and digital business,\u201d in addition to its booming grocery delivery business, the bank wrote.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cthe continued expansion of next-day delivery from Walmart.com (now covering 75% of the US population); and [its] aggressive rollout of \u2018Delivery Unlimited,\u2019 (a service offered to customers for $98/yr. or $12.95/month that is achieved with delivery partners)\u201d bodes well for the future.\n\nIn this Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, photo Walmart U.S. President and CEO Greg Foran, right, high-fives associate Alicia Carter as she fulfills online grocery orders at a Walmart Supercenter in Houston.

Phillip) More\n\nIn his role, Foran, who has served as the U.S. CEO since 2014, developed a reputation for his unannounced store visits at the retailer\u2019s 4,700 U.S. locations. Foran told Yahoo Finance in an interview in June, that aspect was a \u201ccritical part of the job.\u201d\n\nDuring Foran's tenure, he focused heavily on improving the quality of the fresh food department, since it's one of the first areas customers encounter, in addition to the overall in-store experience. During his visits, he would check virtually every detail, from store associates down to lighting and the smell of fresh produce.\n\nMeanwhile, under Furner\u2019s leadership, Sam\u2019s Club has seen its comp-store sales improve and its membership-base grow. Bank of America called the incoming domestic chief a \u201cseasoned executive.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn has done a fantastic job at Sam\u2019s Club, and he will continue the momentum we have in Walmart U.S.,\u201d CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement.\n\n\u201cJohn knows our business well, having held many different jobs in the company over more than 25 years, and he is helping transform it for the future. I look forward to seeing his impact for our customers and associates in Walmart U.S.\u201d McMillon added.\n\nAnd Sam\u2019s Club has experienced a lot of the rapid technological transformations taking place within Walmart\u2019s broader ecosystem.\n\n\"There always are changes. And, I think what I would say about change is it's easy to talk about, but it's hard to do because it affects the way people work, it affects the way people shop,\" Furner told Yahoo Finance in June.\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
