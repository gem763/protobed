REUTERS/Andrej Ivanov\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois, revitalized under new leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, jumped to 32 seats from 10 seats in the predominantly French-speaking province, according to provisional results. Quebec accounts for 78 seats in the House of Commons, second only to Ontario.\n\n\u201cWe have come far but we will go further,\u201d Blanchet told jubilant supporters in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nThe ruling Liberals went into the election seeking to add 10 seats to the 40 they held in Quebec. But the Bloc\u2019s resurgence meant they lost seven, helping Trudeau fall 14 seats short of a national majority.\n\nBlanchet\u2019s party will not be a kingmaker in the new Parliament, however, since the Liberals look set to govern with the left-leaning New Democrats.\n\nSurveys show support for Quebec independence is far below the levels it hit in 1995, when a referendum on breaking away from Canada only just failed.\n\nBlanchet has muted talk of separatism, positioning the Bloc as a party that wants to stand up for Quebec\u2019s interests and the French language in the federal Parliament in Ottawa rather than actively seeking to break up the country.\n\n\u201cThe strength Blanchet brings is he projects an image that is not quite as hardcore as the previous leaders. That allows him to draw on a much wider slice of the electorate,\u201d said University of Montreal professor Pierre Martin.\n\nThe 54-year-old former provincial minister and media personality said the Bloc wanted to make Parliament work and would back any proposed legislation that was good for Quebec.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe Quebecers and Canadians elected a minority government with the goal of going back to the ballot boxes in 18 months,\u201d he said.\n\nBlanchet - repeating comments he made over the weekend - said Quebec could one day \u201cgive itself all the attributes of sovereignty,\u201d while making clear it would not happen during the lifetime of this federal Parliament.\n\n\u201cOur job is not to make Canadian federalism work. Our job ... is also not to cause problems,\u201d he said, adding the party would not be servile.\n\nAt one point, the crowd chanted: \u201cWe want a country,\u201d prompting Blanchet to say: \u201cI do as well ... but this time, achieving sovereignty is not in our mandate.\u201d\n\nBlanchet is particularly close to Quebec\u2019s nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec government, which brought in legislation earlier this year banning some public employees from wearing religious symbols.\n\nTrudeau said during a French-language campaign debate that he would be prepared to challenge the law, prompting Blanchet to accuse him of not respecting Quebec.\n\nJon Pammett, a professor of political science at Carleton University, said Quebec voters were often less predictable than those in other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThere tends to be a kind of movement toward a party which seems to be working to further Quebec\u2019s interests ... people are volatile in terms of their party alignments,\u201d he said.", "description": "A Quebec separatist party that softened its demands for independence reaped the reward on Monday, mounting a remarkable comeback in Canada's election that helped deprive Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of a majority.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443635518&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0H2-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
