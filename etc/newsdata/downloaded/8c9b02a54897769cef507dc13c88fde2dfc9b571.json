Marc White came across two Facebook posts from Heritage teachers stating that there were several students who weren\u2019t going to be able to dress up for their class party on Thursday. In the post, the teachers asked for donations of gently-used or new costumes so that the children would be able to dress up and wouldn\u2019t feel excluded.\n\nAround 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Sgt. White mentioned the posts to the five other Wentzville police officers working at the time and told them he was going to buy a few costumes from Walmart since the store was open 24 hours, Schmidt said.\n\nDEMI LOVATO STUNS IN MARIE ANTOINETTE-INSPIRED HALLOWEEN COSTUME\n\n\u201cOne of the officers says, \u2018I\u2019ll buy one if you buy one,\u2019\u201d Schmidt told Fox News. \u201cThey end up pooling enough money between the six of them to buy 10 costumes. \u201c\n\nAfter the sergeant officers bought the costumes, some of them held them up in front of the school and took a picture. Sgt. White then commented on one of the teacher\u2019s posts with the photo, Schmidt said.\n\nHe added that the officers left the costumes in the school resource officer\u2019s office with a note asking that they be delivered to one of the teachers who had asked for donations.\n\n\u201cIt was $150-200 that they pooled together,\u201d Schmidt told Fox News. \u201cThey just wanted to do a nice gesture.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Wentzville Police Department tweeted the photo and wrote, \u201cLast night, Sgt. White and officers from P4 [Platoon 4] heard of a need for Halloween costumes for students at Heritage Elementary School. They pooled their money and bought 10 costumes so they can participate in all the Halloween fun and trick or treat this Thursday night. Great job P4!\u201d\n\nThe department also posted the photo on Facebook, which Schmidt said prompted several people to ask how they can donate costumes as well.\n\nThe Heritage Elementary Parent Teacher Association responded with a Facebook post writing, \u201cThis is why we love our Heritage and Wentzville community.\u201d\n\nOHIO TEEN WITH ONE ARM KICKS BULLYING TO THE CURB WITH SIGHTS SET ON PARALYMPIC GAMES\n\n\u201cWe are not just responsive for calls for service, we really do try to go out there and help the community,\u201d Schmidt told Fox News. \u201cMore than half of our police officers live in town so we have a vested interest in the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole mission at this point is to make sure every student has a costume so they can participate,\u201d he added.\n\nSome teachers at Heritage Elementary School posted on their personal social media accounts asking for costume donations after the school\u2019s principal sent an email to staff identifying that there was a need following concerns from students, Mary LaPak, the school's chief communications officer said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe staff is overwhelmed with the kindness, generosity and support from the Wentzville Police and our community,\u201d LaPak told Fox News.\n\nCostume donations for grades K-6 are being accepted at Heritage Elementary School in Wentzville until 10 a.m. Thursday. The school's Halloween party will start later that day.", "description": "Missouri police officers pooled their money together and bought costumes for children in need on Tuesday after finding out some students at a local elementary school couldn\u2019t afford to get one for the school\u2019s Halloween party.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
