Because they are conflicted by trying to comply with the wishes of the ANC government & not our CONSTITUTION. Malema\u2019s racist invective is not only offensive, unconstitutional and vile, it\u2019s also dangerously incendiary,\" Trollip's tweet continued.\n\nFormer DA leader Tony Leon asked: \"Where is @SAHRCommission? [Missing in Action] again?\"\n\nMalema posted a note, with the words \"Stratcom\" and #Gushungo, to show that there had been a complaint over his post and that it had not broken rules.\n\nMugabe died in Singapore on September 6 at the age of 95. His funeral service was held on Saturday, attended by African leaders.\n\nComment was not immediately available from the SA Human Rights Commission on whether any complaints had been received over the post.", "description": "EFF leader Julius Malema's tweet containing \"racist\" quotes next to a picture late Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe has been found not to have violated Twitter's rules, Malema has posted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9357/3efe4a2f404e40fcae3cf4b5e4a82330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
