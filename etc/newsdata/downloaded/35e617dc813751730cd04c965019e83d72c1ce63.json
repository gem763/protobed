(AP Photo/Noah Berger)\n\nSAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Californians on Wednesday found themselves facing winds, wildfires and darkness from yet another power outage that hit more than 1 million people.\n\nFrustration and anger mounted across Northern California as Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, began its third round of sweeping blackouts in a week aimed at preventing its electrical equipment from being fouled by wind-whipped branches or toppling and sparking wildfires.\n\nMeanwhile, fires continued to burn at both ends of the state.\n\nPG&E said Tuesday's blackouts would affect about 1.5 million people in some 30 counties including the Sierra foothills, wine country and San Francisco Bay Area. They included 1 million still without power from a shut-off over the weekend.\n\nWith no electricity for the fourth straight day Tuesday, chef and caterer Jane Sykes realized she would have to throw out $1,000 worth of food, including trays of brownies, cupcakes and puff pastry.\n\nShe also had little hope of getting a good night's sleep \u2014 there was no way to run the machine she relies on to counter her apnea.\n\n\"I don't think PG&E really thought this through,\" she lamented.\n\nPG&E officials said they understood the hardships caused by the safety blackouts but continued to insist they were necessary.\n\nIn the wine country, firefighters on Tuesday coped with 30-mph (48.28-kph) gusts while tackling a wildfire that has burned 86 homes and charred an area more than twice the size of San Francisco. About 90,000 buildings remained threatened. More than 150,000 people were under evacuation orders.\n\nThe winds were expected to ease in the north Wednesday but red flag conditions would remain because of hot, dry weather.\n\nMeanwhile, ferocious Santa Ana winds returned to Southern California, where a fire that erupted Monday in the tony Brentwood area of Los Angeles has destroyed a dozen homes.\n\nAbout 9,000 people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and LeBron James, remained under evacuation orders.\n\nThat fire was caused when a dry branch from a eucalyptus tree was flung 30 feet (9 meters) by high winds into a city Department of Water and Power line, which short-circuited and sparked, the utility and Fire Department announced Tuesday.\n\nThe power line had been operating safely and the DWP had cut away brush and trees from around the line, officials said.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti called it an \"act of God.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service called an extreme red flag warning for much of Southern California through Thursday evening, with some wind gusts reaching 80 mph (128.74 kph). It could be the strongest wind event in years.\n\nCoupled with tinder-dry brush and low humidity, they could blow the smoldering fire back to life and spread embers to start new blazes, authorities warned.\n\nSouthern California Edison, which had previously made safety shutoffs and then restored power, warned that it could black out more than 300,000 customers, or some 600,000 people.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Edison announced in a quarterly earnings report that it was \"likely\" its equipment caused last year's Woolsey Fire, which killed three people and destroyed hundreds of homes in a swatch stretching from north of Los Angeles south through Malibu to the sea.\n\nNo deaths were reported from the current fires but weekend gusts may have claimed three lives. A 55-year-old homeless woman was crushed by a falling tree during high winds Sunday at a Santa Cruz campsite and a couple was killed the same day in a remote area of Madera County when a tree fell on their Jeep, which then crashed.\n\nAcross Northern California, people who weren't facing another day as fire refugees were worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, staying warm and keeping their food from spoiling.\n\nSome ended up at centers set up by PG&E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns.\n\nIn Placer County, Angel Smith relied on baby wipes and blankets to keep her 13-month-old son Liam warm and clean. The family has been without power since Saturday night and cannot draw well water without electricity.\n\nShe ran a cord from her neighbors' generator to keep her phone and tablet charged so the two could watch movies. Temperatures were expected to drop below freezing overnight in parts of Northern California.", "description": "Californians on Wednesday found themselves facing winds, wildfires and darkness from yet another power outage that hit more than 1 million people.
