So why is Democratic leadership standing in the way?", "language": "en", "text": "The leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada have already signed the most important trade deal in a generation. Mexico and Canada, not China, are currently our two largest trading partners. For the sake of America\u2019s economy and workers, this deal needs to get done.\n\nThe only obstacle is political obstruction by congressional Democrats more intent on depriving President Trump of a win than bestowing one on the American people.\n\nThis is politics at its worst, and that\u2019s saying something.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING VOTERS WHY TRUMP SHOULD BE REELECTED\n\nThe United States stands to make immense economic gains from this comprehensive renegotiation of the deeply flawed 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The importance of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is widely recognized on both sides of the political aisle, yet more than nine months after the signing ceremony, it lingers in Congress, unratified, undebated and uncertain.\n\nAs a \u201cnon-self-executing treaty,\u201d both Houses of Congress have to pass the USMCA before it can take effect. Like all treaties of this magnitude, the deal deserves careful debate. But, given its broad popularity, the process should be much further along by now.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether the deal is worth making, but rather why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preventing debate. Various Democratic lawmakers have suggested that they might wish to tweak certain aspects of the agreement, but so far they\u2019ve largely avoided even learning about the details.\n\nThe reasons for ratifying the USMCA as quickly as possible are readily apparent. NAFTA was poorly negotiated, typical of an era of very bad trade dealings by American leaders that hurt the people they should protect the most.\n\nSen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana \u2014 two Republicans from the heartland constituencies hit hardest by NAFTA\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 both published very persuasive arguments this past week explaining why the USMCA is so beneficial for the United States.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThey point to the higher wages and labor protections that will be, for the first time, imposed on Mexican factories that produce goods for the U.S. market. Many Mexican auto workers, for example, will have to earn at least $16 per hour in order for the cars they make to qualify for tariff-free export to America. That will decrease incentives to offshore American manufacturing jobs and give workers in Detroit a fair chance to compete.\n\nAmerican farmers, meanwhile, will gain easier access to Canadian and Mexican markets \u2014 something they\u2019ve been seeking in vain for decades.\n\nBut while Trump was the mastermind behind the USMCA, it\u2019s not just Republicans who are convinced of the agreement\u2019s merits, or at least eager to keep the ball moving forward. In July, 14 House Democrats signed a letter to Pelosi urging her to let the House vote on the USMCA before year-end.\n\nWe need to replace NAFTA, and Democratic leadership is the only thing standing in the way.\n\nThe principles behind this deal are neither partisan nor ideological \u2014 getting a better deal for American workers and requiring more robust labor and environmental protections from our trading partners are goals that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have explicitly endorsed, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even as she rejects the USMCA.\n\nThe Warren example sheds a revealing light on Pelosi\u2019s obstructionism. It\u2019s clear as day why Warren is opposing USMCA. She\u2019s running for president against the man whose vision and determination made the deal a reality. Of course, she opposes it.\n\nWarren\u2019s cover story is that she thinks the USMCA is too lenient on pharmaceutical companies, but there\u2019s no evidence the deal would actually raise drug prices for Americans. In any event, the place to bring up such concerns would be during open debate in Congress, where they could be addressed in the final deal, assuming Warren could get enough of her colleagues to share her tongue-in-cheek skepticism.\n\nThe same logic is at work with Pelosi. She is stalling, refusing to set a date, and dodging questions about whether it protects workers and the environment \u2014 despite the fact the USMCA has the most robust labor and environmental protections of any major trade deal the United States has ever signed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLike Warren, Pelosi\u2019s opposition is just politics at its worst \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something. If Pelosi really believes the protections are insufficient, then she and her allies should suggest modifications, or even pass USMCA and request that the U.S. trade representative work with our partners to improve the deal going forward.\n\nThe only reason Democrats are dragging their feet on the USMCA is because they wish to deny Trump a hard-fought win as we approach an election year. That Machiavellian approach is not what America\u2019s economy and workers need right now. We need to replace NAFTA, and the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership is the only thing standing in the way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDY PUZDER", "description": "The only reason Democrats are dragging their feet on the USMCA is because they wish to deny Trump a hard-fought win as we approach an election year.", "authors": ["Andy Puzder", "Andy Puzder Was Chief Executive Officer Of"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/ContentBroker_contentid-12cbf3d251174e119e24084c8352b550.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
