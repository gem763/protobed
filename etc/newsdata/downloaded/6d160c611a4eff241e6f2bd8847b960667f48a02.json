Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nOfficers have started the grim job of removing the bodies from the lorry and the painstaking task of trying to identify them in a massive investigation that spans several countries, including the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Bulgaria and China, and will likely go on for months.\n\nCoroners face the monumental task of carrying out 39 post-mortems to confirm the cause of death of each person in a case that echoes one almost 20 years ago when the bodies of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants were found in Dover.\n\nIt is believed the stowaways had been inside the trailer for more than 12 hours by the time they were found dead.\n\nEssex Police, who have launched the biggest murder investigation in its history, continued to question Robinson - whose girlfriend is said to be expecting twins - on Thursday and launched a fingertip search at the scene in Grays.\n\nSources told the Telegraph it is \"very unlikely\" Robinson knew about any alleged plans to smuggle migrants into the UK.\n\nPolice were investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring, the report claimed.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said it was working to identify \"organised crime groups who may have played a part\".\n\nRobinson's friends have claimed that he alerted the emergency services about the migrants inside the container. An HGV driver for more than five years, he doesn't own the lorry or the trailer.\n\nA friend told MailOnline: \"He wouldn\u2019t have known those people were in the back.\n\n\"Apparently he\u2019d parked up at the industrial estate in Essex and had gone to fetch the paperwork from a pocket on the inside of the lorry door.\n\n\"When he opened the container up and saw all the dead bodies, he was absolutely horrified - as anyone would be - and called the ambulance service who in turn alerted the police.\"\n\nA neighbour of Robinson's parents told Belfast Telegraph that the couple, from Laurelvale in Co Armagh, has flown to England from Northern Ireland to support their son.\n\n(Image: Eastnews Press Agency)\n\nRobinson is understood to have moved to a house on the outskirts of Markethill recently.\n\nThe detached property in the Co Armagh countryside and the semi-detached family home in a development in Laurelvale were searched by police.\n\nIt is believed Robinson - who called his red truck the \"Polar Express\" - picked up the trailer two hours before the migrants were found dead.\n\nThe trailer - normally used to transport goods such as biscuits, it is claimed - had entered England via a freight ferry service from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet, Essex, on the River Thames.\n\nBelgian authorities said the container arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm local time on Tuesday and left the Belgian port the same afternoon.\n\nJoachim Coens, chief executive of the Zeebrugge port, said it was unlikely that migrants had been loaded into the container there.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe told VRT: \u201cA refrigerated container in the port zone is completely sealed. During the check, the seal is examined, as is the licence plate. The driver is checked by cameras.\u201d\n\nThe cargo must pass these checks before it can be loaded onto a ferry.\n\nIn Wednesday's incident, the ferry docked in Essex just after 12.30am on Wednesday and the lorry left the port in Purfleet about 35 minutes later.\n\nThe tractor that hauled it away from the port had originally come from from Northern Ireland, according to police.\n\nIt entered the UK on Sunday after taking a ferry from Dublin to Holyhead in North Wales.\n\nRegistered in Bulgaria, the truck had \"Ireland\" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message \"The Ultimate Dream\".\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nThe Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna, a Black Sea port in Bulgaria, \"under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen\".\n\nParamedics were alerted first after the bodies were discovered and Essex Police were notified at about 1.40am.\n\nThe migrants were found dead in the trailer after the lorry stopped at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays.\n\nWitness Andy Larkin told Sky News that he saw the lorry parked at the Grays industrial estate on Tuesday afternoon about 10 hours before the container was picked up in Purfleet.\n\nHe said: \"What drew me to it was the unit itself. The cab looked very expensive, big chrome exhausts, and the paintwork on it. It was unusual from being a company lorry. It was more of a private cab.\n\n\"I thought someone was asleep inside because the curtains on the cab were pulled around. Like the drivers do when they are sleeping in their cabs. I thought he was inside.\"\n\nPolice have moved the lorry to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered as part of the largest murder investigation in Essex Police history.\n\nThe force confirmed all 39 were believed to be from China. A victim initially said to be a teenager has been confirmed as a young adult woman.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said \"nothing could be released as of now\". The embassy in London was working with UK police, adding: \"We read with heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex, England.\"\n\nAn Essex Police spokesperson said: \"A 25-year-old lorry driver from Northern Ireland remains in custody after 39 people were found dead in Grays.\n\n\"Our work continues today, and for the foreseeable future, to be focused on providing the victims and their loved ones with an investigation that is filled with dignity, compassion and respect for those who have died.\n\n\"Each of the 39 people must undergo a full coroner\u2019s process to establish a cause of death, before we move on to attempting to identify each individual within the trailer.\n\n\"This will be a substantial operation and, at this stage, we cannot estimate how long these procedures will take.\"\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar)\n\nThe force added: \"We might not have all the answers straight away.\"\n\nSenior officers briefed Home Secretary Priti Patel on their progress as mourners signed a book of condolence at Thurrock Council and left flowers at the scene in Grays.\n\nThe Home Secretary tweeted earlier: \"I stand behind them as they continue their work to establish how this horrific event came to happen.\"\n\nBelgium's federal prosecutor's office has launched its own investigation to find out where the trailer originated and how long it had been in the country.\n\nThe office said it is not yet clear when or where the victims entered the container.\n\nBelgian authorities believe the migrants boarded the trailer at a location away from the port in Zeebrugge.\n\nC.RO Ports, which manages the ferry terminals in Zeebrugge and Purfleet said it was \"deeply saddened\" and assisting investigators.\n\nDeputy Irish premier Simon Coveney said Irish police will co-operate fully with an investigation.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe said: \"This is an issue that comes right into our own lives into the UK and the investigation that's under way at the moment involves an Garda Siochana (Irish police).\n\n\"The investigation taking place will have the absolute and full co-operation of an Garda Siochana.\"\n\nWednesday's incident has been compared to Britain's biggest illegal immigrant tragedy in which the bodies of 58 Chinese migrants were found crammed into a tomato truck at the southern port of Dover in 2000.\n\nThe migrants had paid a criminal gang to be smuggled into the UK in a sealed, airless container.\n\nThe vehicle had begun its journey in Zeebrugge.\n\nNeighbours told Irish media that Robinson's parents had already left their home in the rural village of Laurelvale and travelled to England to support their son.\n\nHis father, Mark, is the manager of Laurelvale FC, a local amateur club in the Mid-Ulster Football League.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLorry deaths timeline - what we know Here is what we know so far about the timeline (all times UK unless indicated): Sunday 20 October The tractor unit of the lorry enters the UK via Holyhead, North Wales, on a ferry from Dublin. According to police, it came from Northern Ireland. Tuesday 22 October The refrigerated container arrives at the port of Zeebrugge, Belgium, at 2.49pm local time and leaves that afternoon on a ferry to England. The tractor is seen parked at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex, at around the same time, according to a witness. Wednesday 23 October 12.30am: The trailer arrives at a port in Purfleet, Essex, where it is picked up by the tractor. 1.05am: The tractor - registered in Bulgaria under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen - and trailer leave the port in Purfleet. 1.40am: Essex Police receive reports of bodies inside a container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays. The driver, a 25-year-old man from Portadown, Northern Ireland, is arrested on suspicion of murder. Later, the lorry is moved to Tilbury Docks in Essex and police in Northern Ireland search three properties in Co Armagh. Thursday 24 October Police confirm all 39 victims are believed to be Chinese nationals. It is feared the 31 men and eight women froze to death inside the trailer. It is one of the biggest murder investigations in UK history and the largest ever carried out by Essex Police.\n\nPaul Berry, a local councillor, said he spoke to Robinson's dad \"a couple of times\" on Wednesday before the father found out about the arrest on social media.\n\nMr Berry told the Belfast Telegraph: \"When I was talking to him nothing had been confirmed to him that it was Mo. The police or nobody of that nature had informed him.\"\n\nHe stressed Mo Robinson was \"innocent until proven guilty\".\n\nThe councillor told PA: \"He had said he had been getting messages via people on social media on what was happening and at that stage it was not confirmed to him or his family that his son had been arrested.\n\n\"In the local area the feeling is one of complete shock and hope this is not a true story in terms of his involvement.\"\n\nMr Berry, who knows the father well, said the family were \"very well respected\" in the Laurelvale area.\n\nHe added: \"The local community is hoping that he (Mo Robinson) has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this.\"\n\nHe said the family had been left upset by the \"unwelcome spotlight\" the incident had shone on them.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"It was very distressing for the family as they just felt they were captive in their own home,\" he said.\n\nOne of Robinson's neighbours said the lorry driver had only been living in his house in Markethill for a few months.\n\nThe neighbour described the picturesque property as one of the original gate lodges for nearby Gosford Castle, adding that it had recently been renovated and placed on the market.\n\nA property website contains a now expired listing for the house, which it called Drumlack Gate Lodge.\n\nThe neighbour said he had never spoken to Mr Robinson but had noticed the red lorry unit parked beside the house.\n\n\"If it had been a car I wouldn't have noticed it, but the fact it was dominant beside that property, you tended to notice it,\" he said.\n\nMr Robinson's passion for truck driving is clear from his social media posts.\n\nPictures of a red and white Scania feature prominently.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe dog-loving trucker, who attended Southern Regional College in Co Armagh, is known to have worn a cowboy style hat when at the wheel.\n\nMeanwhile, migrants in Zeebrugge were undeterred in their quest to make it to Britain despite the tragedy.\n\nPhotos showed a number of suspected migrants being detained by police near the port on Thursday.\n\nWednesday's incident follows warnings from the National Crime Agency and the Border Force of the increased risk of people-smuggling via Belgium.\n\nSecurity checks for people smuggling are believed to be less stringent at both ports than at Calais and Dover.\n\nExperts say it is impossible to check every container entering Britain due to the sheer number of arrivals.\n\nJust hours after the 39 migrants were found dead, a lorry carrying nine migrants, who were alive, was stopped on the M20 near Ashford, Kent, on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBefore this week's discovery in Grays, at least five suspected migrants had been found dead in lorries or containers in the UK, according to the UN, which tracks figures.\n\nShaun Sawyer, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police and a spokesman for UK police on human trafficking, said thousands of people were seeking to come to the United Kingdom illegally.\n\nWhile they were able to rescue many of those smuggled in, Britain was perceived by organised crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers.\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"You can't turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders.\"\n\nThe head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were \"upping their game\" and closer cooperation with fellow European nations was needed, albeit that may be complicated by Britain's potential exit from the European Union.\n\n\"There is simply not enough being done in terms of security, in terms of the protection of vehicles across Europe,\" Richard Burnett told the BBC.\n\nHe said the conditions for anyone inside refrigerated trailers would be \"absolutely horrendous\".", "description": "The bodies of 31 men and eight women were found inside a lorry container in Grays, Essex, shortly after arriving from Belgium", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "David Young", "Rebecca Black", "Image", "Swns.Com", "Eastnews Press Agency", "Pa", "Sky News", "Humphrey Nemar", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712039.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_CONTAINER_DEATHS_56.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
