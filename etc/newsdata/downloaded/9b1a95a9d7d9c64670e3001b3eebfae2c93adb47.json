Photograph: PA\n\nBy the middle of the 1970s, after landing a job at the European commission, he was to take a more significant parenting role as bouts of depression led to the repeated hospitalisation of his first wife, Charlotte.\n\nThese days, Stanley, 79, a former MEP, remains a visible and vocal supporter of his eldest son, even if his support for remain during the 2016 referendum has led some to question the depth of his commitment to leaving the EU.\n\nBy contrast, his daughter Rachel has continued to fiercely oppose Brexit. A journalist whose CV includes stints at the Financial Times and as editor of The Lady, the one-time Liberal Democrat ran as a lead candidate for Change UK during this year\u2019s European parliamentary elections, although she later described herself as a \u201crat that jumped on to a sinking ship\u201d.\n\nRachel and Leo Johnson on their close relationship Read more\n\nAs the spotlight fell on the family after Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation on Thursday, she was quick to dismiss suggestions of familial strife, tweeting: \u201cI said last night at a charity do that the family avoids the topic of Brexit, especially at meals, as we don\u2019t want to gang up on the PM!\u201d\n\nOf the other siblings, Leo Johnson has distanced himself from politics, having built a career in the City and as a co-host of a Radio 4 series that explores how innovation could transform the way society functions.\n\nNevertheless, his retweeting of remain accounts has been noted, not least a recent one criticising the role of the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and another lambasting \u201cholier than thou so-called upholders of democracy\u201d for repeating a mantra about the need to deliver Brexit.\n\nFor the second time in less than than a year, meanwhile, the departure from government of Jo Johnson has narrowed scrutiny of the family\u2019s Brexit divisions to the relationship between him and his louder, older brother.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stanley Johnson, left, and Boris Johnson\u2019s siblings Rachel and Jo Johnson.
