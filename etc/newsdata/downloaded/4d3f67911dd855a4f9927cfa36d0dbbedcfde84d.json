He was also recommended a payment of 25 million pounds for his role in two capital raisings, the jury at London's Old Bailey criminal court was told.\n\nKalaris, the former CEO of the bank's wealth management business, received 13 million in 2007 and 7.7 million in 2008. Boath, the investment bank division's head of corporate finance for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was paid 2.87 million in 2007 and 1.87 million in 2008, the prosecutor said.\n\nProsecutors allege that Barclays paid Qatar 322 million pounds in extra, secret fees for participating in two fundraisings in June and October 2008, which were disguised as \"bogus\" advisory service agreements (ASA).\n\nJenkins told colleagues in the same recorded telephone conversation that Qatar would be paid a fee for investing in the bank in comments that looked like a \"complete acceptance\" of core allegations against him, Brown alleged.\n\n\"Here was Roger Jenkins, at the time, not suggesting that the ASA was anything about genuine advisory services of value at all. It was nothing more than a fee for investing and Mr Jenkins said so,\" Brown said.\n\nJenkins is the only defendant charged over the October 2008 fundraising as well as the June 2008 capital call.\n\nQatar, which invested around 4.0 billion pounds in Barclays over 2008, has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe trial, expected to last around five months, continues.", "description": "Ex-Barclays executive panicked over scrutiny of salary in 2008, court hears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E1FG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
