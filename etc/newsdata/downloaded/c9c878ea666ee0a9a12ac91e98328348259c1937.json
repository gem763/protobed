And heck, it\u2019s pretty and I want one in my hands yesterday.\n\nAnalogue\u2019s Pocket is a sleek rectangle that looks like the love child of an iPhone 5 and an Xperia Play. It\u2019s got a very similar button layout to the original Game Boy, but with a 3.5\u2033 LTPS LCD screen. According to Analogue, the 1600\u00d71440 resolution is 10x the resolution of the original handheld. I might have to flagellate myself for saying this, but it\u2019s a great deal sexier, as it were, than my Game Boy. I just want to stare into its black void of a screen and quietly salivate.\n\nNote this isn\u2019t an emulation machine, like some retro console throwbacks are. The Pocket is designed to play physical cartridges. Its slot fits Game Boy cartridges \u2014 original, Color, and Advance. It\u2019s also compatible with Game Gear, Atari Lynx, and Neo Geo cartridges via adapters. This sets it apart from the likes of the SNES Classic or the Neo Geo Mini. With the Pocket, you can actually use those game cartridges that have been sitting in the back of a drawer or stored with your old handhelds.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: like the Switch, the Pocket can be connected to a TV via a dock. So you could potentially play all of your old-school Game Boy games on your HDTV. I\u2019m not exactly sure how those games, made for such a small screen, would scale up to the size of my 4K TV, but it\u2019s still something I want to see. Once it\u2019s hooked up, the Pocket can be controlled via Bluetooth controllers \u2014 Analogue recommends those from popular third-party company 8bitdo. Wired USB controllers will also work.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re into music, the Pocket apparently has a built-in synth/sequencer called Nanoloop. So if you want to make music on a gaming handheld, here\u2019s your curiously specific machine. Hey, I\u2019m not judging.\n\nThe device is set for release some time in 2020 and will cost $199. The dock will be sold separately for an as-yet-undetermined price.\n\nMeet Analogue Pocket\u2122 on Analogue\n\nRead next: US House rejects Trump's 2024 Moon landing plan", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FAnalogue-Pocket.jpg&signature=64097d2f895cc1203620f3fa03afb5d4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
