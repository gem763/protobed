Biden\u2019s involvement in his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen: If the whistleblower\u2019s allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u201d Mr. Graham told Fox\u2019s Maria Bartiromo on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cif that doesn\u2019t happen in the House, I will make sure it happens in the Senate.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened an impeachment inquiry last month following a complaint by the first whistleblower, which alleges Mr. Trump leveraged military aid in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s involvement in his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine.\n\nA transcript released by the White House shows Mr. Trump making no reference to withholding military aid, while texts released Friday by House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff show the top U.S. diplomat in the Ukraine complaining about a perceived quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d said U.S. charge d\u2019affaires William Taylor in a Sept. 9 text to U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nMr. Sondland replied that, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nTwo more texts from the batch released by House Democrats would indicate that there are things that weren\u2019t put in writing. And that career diplomat Bill Taylor is uncomfortable with how the situation with a Trump meeting/Ukraine funding has been unfolding. pic.twitter.com/9ynmHDidIL \u2014 Tamara Keith (@tamarakeithNPR) October 4, 2019\n\nMr. Graham cited the president\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to confront his accusers.\n\n\u201cNobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nHe also said that Mr. Schiff has \u201cmade himself a witness\u201d after the whistleblower reportedly went to his committee before filing the Aug. 12 complaint.\n\n\u201cSchiff has made himself a witness,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cIf he did in fact interview the whistleblower before the complaint was filed, then he becomes a witness. I want to know what was said originally.\u201d\n\nMr. Zaid told media outlets that a second intelligence official has spoken to the Inspector General, and that this person has \u201cfirst-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint,\u201d according to ABC News.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
