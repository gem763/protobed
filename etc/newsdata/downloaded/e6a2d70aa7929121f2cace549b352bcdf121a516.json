One such ETF that is flying under the radar is the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSE: SPYD).\n\nWhat Happened\n\nSPYD, which tracks the S&P 500 High Dividend Index, may not be getting much press, but the fund is up more than 6% this month, a move that has boosted its year-to-date return into the double digits. With a dividend yield of 4.7%, SPYD is undoubtedly attractive in today's low yield environment, but investors considering the fund should examine how sector and security selection impact returns.\n\n\u201cWe analyzed the returns for the S&P 500 High Dividend Yield Index ('the high dividend strategy') and the S&P 500('the market') over the past year and year-to-date through August,\u201d said State Street in a recent note. \u201cWe found that in each time period, the sector biases for the high dividend yield strategy were a net positive contributor. The stock weights, however, were net detractors. In almost every sector for both periods, security selection was negative.\u201d\n\nThis underscores a problem investors may encounter when picking among individual high-yield stocks: some equities in this space are financially strained and may not be able to keep with high payouts.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nSPYD allocates over 30% of its combined weight to the high-yield real estate and utilities sectors, the latter of which has recently been making a series of all-time highs. Both sectors function as bond-like groups, making them attractive when interest rates decline.\n\n\u201cStocks with high dividends, therefore, could be said to have been poor performers, but not high dividend sectors,\u201d according to State Street. \u201cThe latter point explains why two bond-proxy sectors (Utilities and Real Estate) can be top performers but bond-proxy dividend paying equities cannot.\u201d\n\nAn obvious sector level detractor for SPYD has been energy. The ETF devotes 12.1% of its weight to that group, nearly triple the S&P 500's exposure to energy stocks.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nAnother consideration with dividend ETFs is how factors, such as quality and value, influence returns. For SPYD, critical factor-level contributors have been size, value, profitability, and growth.\n\n\u201cDividend yield was actually a positive contributor,\u201d said State Street. \u201cThis confirms the notion that the dividend style should produce positive returns when bond rates are falling, and it refutes the misperception that 'dividends' just didn\u2019t work as rates fell.\u201d\n\nRelated Links:\n\nWhy This Dividend ETF Is So Consistent\n\nThese Leveraged ETFs Are Hot\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
