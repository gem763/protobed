It has ignited an impeachment drive in the House, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announcing Tuesday the launch of a formal inquiry and accusing Trump of violating the Constitution in seeking help from a foreign leader to damage a political opponent.\n\nTrump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, who served on the board of a Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there.\n\nTrump has denied doing anything improper, but lawmakers have raised concerns about his directive to freeze nearly $400 million in military assistance for Ukraine in the days leading up the phone call with Zelensky.\n\nWhy now? The moments that moved Pelosi and House Democrats toward impeachment.\n\n9:15 a.m.: House to vote Wednesday afternoon to condemn administration for withholding whistleblower complaint\n\nThe House plans to vote Wednesday afternoon on a resolution condemning the administration\u2019s efforts to block the release of the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump\u2019s promise to a foreign leader constituted an \u201curgent concern\u201d to national security.\n\nActing director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to share the complaint from a U.S. intelligence official in what Democrats say is a clear violation of the law.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, reviewed the complaint and determined that it was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees.\n\n\u201cWe hope that all Members of the House \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 will join in upholding the rule of law and oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution as Representatives of the American people,\u201d Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a joint statement.\n\nIn a rare, albeit subtle protest from the GOP-led Senate, lawmakers adopted a resolution on Tuesday calling for the White House to turn over the complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required under law.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Giuliani says the rough call transcript was read to him\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Wednesday morning that the rough call transcript had been read to him, an acknowledgment that prompted protests from Democratic members of Congress who had yet to review the document.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in which he defended Trump and attacked Biden, Giuliani was asked if he had seen the rough call transcript.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say it was read to me,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing?\u201d asked co-host Brian Kilmeade.\n\n\u201cI hope,\u201d Giuliani replied.\n\nDemocrats, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), argued that Giuliani, who doesn\u2019t hold a government position, should not have had an opportunity to review the transcript before they did.\n\nThe rough transcript of Trump\u2019s Ukrainian call: There are likely no tapes \u2014 but plenty of witnesses\n\n8:15 a.m.: Schiff raises concerns about the validity of what will be released\n\nAhead of the expected release of a rough call transcript, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) raised concerns about whether it would provide a full picture of what transpired between Trump and Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know whether what we get from the White House is the complete story in terms of that conversation,\u201d Schiff said during an interview on CNN. \u201cWe certainly know we can\u2019t rely on the White House to be forthcoming.\u201d\n\nSchiff said Democrats are concerned that \u201cwhatever they release today may not be the full content of that conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything we know from the Mueller investigation, it\u2019s that this president will go to extraordinary lengths to obstruct an investigation into his misconduct,\u201d he added, referring to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nAsked to elaborate on his concerns, Schiff said it is unclear that \u201cif it is in fact a transcript, that is someone taking word-by-word notes of what was said, like a stenographer, or whether there was a recording of the conversation that can be transcribed or whether instead this is one of the president\u2019s staff or someone else from the [National Security Council] or someone else from the State Department sitting in on the call and writing only that which would not thoroughly embarrass the president.\u201d\n\nHe said House Democrats investigating Trump\u2019s conduct want to talk to the note-taker.\n\n7:25 a.m.: Trump complains again about Democrats \u2018frozen with hatred and fear\u2019\n\nTrump went on Twitter early Wednesday to complain about continued Democratic scrutiny of his actions.\n\n\u201cThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s salvo followed several tweets on Tuesday night in which he shared video clips of friendly commentators arguing that he is being treated unfairly.\n\n6:40 a.m.: New poll shows limited support for impeachment\n\nAmid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting Trump from office.\n\nThirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Thursday through Monday, as details were emerging about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\nThe poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed.\n\nRead more here.\n\n5 a.m.: Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelensky is a high-wire act for both leaders\n\nTrump meets with Zelensky on Wednesday afternoon as he seeks to dispel concerns about his decision to temporarily hold nearly $400 million of military aid from the embattled country.\n\nThe meeting, scheduled at 2:15 p.m., is a high-wire act for both leaders as Zelensky tries to avoid angering the U.S. president or his Democratic opponents while Trump tries to disarm allegations that have generated a formal impeachment inquiry by the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nAt issue is the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump is said to have brought up investigating former vice president Biden, a potential 2020 presidential opponent, and his son. Days before the phone call, Trump ordered a hold on the aid for Ukraine, which has been fending off Russian-backed separatists in the country\u2019s east.\n\nRead more here.\n\n5 a.m.: Giuliani pursued shadow Ukraine agenda as key foreign policy officials were sidelined\n\nTrump\u2019s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists \u2014 including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said.\n\nThe sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments \u2014 all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani\u2019s activities from news reports.\n\nSeveral officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president\u2019s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump\u2019s political gain.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDevlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky and John Hudson contributed to this report.", "description": "Key developments are expected to play out in a controversy that has ignited a drive for impeachment of the president by House Democrats.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/et66EnI428TVRAu3Oe1iCYi0TMQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GSGM64G7P4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
