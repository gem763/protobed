We\u2019re finding that rocks are rocks everywhere, with very similar geophysics and geochemistry,\" she said.\n\nDEEP SEA CREATURES DEVOUR WHALE CARCASS, PHOTOS AND VIDEO REVEAL\n\nThe scientists used calculations and formulas since they're unable to study actual rocks from white dwarfs.\n\nThe analyzed data were collected by telescopes, mostly from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, according to UCLA.\n\n\u201cIf extraterrestrial rocks have a similar quantity of oxidation as the Earth has, then you can conclude the planet has similar plate tectonics and similar potential for magnetic fields as the Earth, which are widely believed to be key ingredients for life,\u201d said co-author Hilke Schlichting, UCLA associate professor of astrophysics and planetary science. \u201cThis study is a leap forward in being able to make these inferences for bodies outside our own solar system and indicates it\u2019s very likely there are truly Earth analogs.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Earth-like exoplanets may be quite common in the universe, a new UCLA study suggests.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/mark-garlick-illustration-ucla-news.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
