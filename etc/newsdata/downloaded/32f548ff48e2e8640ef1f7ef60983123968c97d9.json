We all know that you lose downforce behind the car so that is not an excuse and I think he is experienced enough to know that.\n\nThe young Red Bull driver was absolutely furious at Leclerc's actions on the track in Japan\n\n'The weird thing is initially they didn't investigate it right away. My whole car is destroyed. The whole side. There are just holes in the side of the car.\n\n'And now they will investigate it after the race. What more should he do to get a penalty?\n\n'I like hard racing, but I don't think this was hard racing, I think it was irresponsible driving into turn two. He had a bad start so for sure he was trying to recover places but there's only so much you can do. It's a shame that it happens.'", "description": "After starting fast in fifth, Verstappen moved to overtake his rival but was shunted off the track and eventually had to retire from the race, with officials launching an investigation afterwards.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/08/19648758-0-image-a-6_1570953455908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
