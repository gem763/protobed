Here, customers can quickly cook up whatever cuts of meat they like from tongues to tails and everything in between.\n\nIt\u2019s really a meat-lover\u2019s paradise, as it cuts out all the excess like buns and toppings, and aside from an optional dipping sauce or marinated offering, focuses solely on the meat\u2019s inherent flavor. On the other hand, yakiniku restaurants are often boisterous drinking establishments frequented by chain-smoking salarymen after a long day\u2019s work.\n\nUp until now, that\u2019s always been part and parcel of the yakiniku experience, but one establishment in Osaka has decided to buck the trend and go all non-smoking and non-alcohol.\n\nSandaime Wakihiko Shoten Honten has only been open for a year now, and already gets booked up for three months at a time. They\u2019ve also already opened a second location in Nagoya as of August this year.\n\nBoth locations operate on a membership system but are not as exclusive as they sound. By following their Facebook page it is possible to find openings for non-members as well.\n\nFor those not familiar with yakiniku restaurants in Japan it\u2019s probably hard to imagine but this is actually quite a radical departure for this kind of eatery. Wakihiko says the reason for it is quite simply to allow the high quality of their meat, rice, and sauce to shine, without the aroma getting diluted by cigarette smoke or taste lost by an alcohol numbed tongue.\n\nThe demand for such a meat-intensive experience is certainly there, with the only drawback being lack of seating. But until more yakiniku restaurants follow suit, it looks worth the wait for a table at Wakihiko. Just get some of that yakiniku bath powder to hold you over until your reservation.\n\nRestaurant information\n\nSandaime Wakihiko Shoten Honten / \u4e09\u4ee3\u76ee \u8107\u5f66\u5546\u5e97 \u672c\u5e97\n\nOsaka-shi, Fukushima-ku, Fukushima 2-10-22, Daiwa City Fukushima 1F\n\n\u5927\u962a\u5e02\u798f\u5cf6\u533a\u798f\u5cf62\u4e01\u76ee10-22 \u30c0\u30a4\u30ef\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u798f\u5cf61F\n\nHours: 5 p.m. \u2013 11 p.m.\n\nWebsite\n\nSource: PRdesse, Facebook/Wakihiko\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Restaurant raises the bar for customer service in Japan, will help you name your baby\n\n-- Tasty and cheap: 30 minutes of all-you-can-eat yakiniku for only 780 yen\n\n-- Yakiniku chain store lets customers enjoy delicious Japanese barbecue together with their dogs\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Yakiniku restaurants, establishments where customers grill their own meat on tattoo inspiring little BBQs, are extremely popular in Japan.
