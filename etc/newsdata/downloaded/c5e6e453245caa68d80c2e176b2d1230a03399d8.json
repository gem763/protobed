He then suggested several September dates where the presidents could meet in the White House.\n\nThe messages show the Ukrainian advisor hoped to confirm a date before publicly announcing the investigation.\n\nTwo weeks after the call Mr Yermak wrote: \u201cOnce we have a date we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-Ukraine relationship , including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The allegation is a popular and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory.\n\nAs negotiations progressed, Mr Sondland said in a text that Donald Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nThe plan began to fall apart after Mr Trump chose to freeze $250m (\u00a3202m) in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe country depends on the funds to maintain defences against Russia.\n\n\u201cNeed to talk with you,\u201d Mr Yemak said in a message to Kurt Volker, after the aid was frozen.\n\nThe decision to halt access to funds appears to have unnerved Mr Taylor, the most experienced of the diplomats.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Mr Taylor asked, in a text to his two colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. [And I quit],\u201d he added on 8 September.\n\nOn 9 September he wrote: \u201cThe message to the Ukrainans [and Russians] we send with the decision on security assistance is key.\n\n\u201cWith the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nWithin a month of the call, Mr Trump had cancelled his meeting with the Ukranian leader, sending diplomats scrambling to find a solution. Mr Taylor continued to express fears over the plan.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Mr Taylor said, in a text sent on 9 September.\n\nMore than four hours later Mr Sondland replied, claiming the president \u201chas been crystal clear, no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nKurt Volker handed the cache of messages to the House of Representatives committees after Democrats announced they were launching formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nSenior Democrats made the decision after a whistleblower raised concerns about Mr Trump\u2019s July call with Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThey have accused the president of pressuring a foreign government to interfere with US elections by investigating the Bidens.\n\nJoe Biden is one of the Democratic frontrunners for the 2020 election.\n\nMr Volker testified on Thursday for more than eight hours in front of the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nThe chairs of the committees said the text messages were \u201dstill only a subset of the full body of the materials\u201d handed over by the former diplomat.\n\nKurt Volker resigned from his post shortly after the impeachment probe was launched.\n\nMr Trump has denied all allegations but on Thursday he openly called on China and Ukraine to launch investigations into Joe Biden.\n\n\u201c[Ukraine] should investigate the Bidens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nEllen Weintraub, head of the Federal Election Commission, retweeted on Thursday a post she first wrote in June,\n\n\u201cLet me make something 100 per cent clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election. This is not a novel concept.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry continues.", "description": "White House envoys to Ukraine\u00a0pushed\u00a0the country\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s family while also offering a meeting in DC with Donald Trump, according to a series of damning text messages.
