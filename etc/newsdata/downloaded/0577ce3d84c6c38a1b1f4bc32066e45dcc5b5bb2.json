It belongs to a new genus and species of a herbivorous hadrosaurid dinosaur, the university said in a news release.\n\nScientists named the dinosaur \"Kamuysaurus japonicus.\" The name comes from \"kamuy,\" the word for diety in Ainu, the language of the indigenous people of northern Japan; \"saurus,\" meaning reptile in Latin; and \"japonicus\" for Japan.\n\nHow the dinosaur might have looked when it was alive\n\nResearchers found a nearly complete skeleton during an excavation in 2013.\n\nA group of researchers led by Yoshitsugu Kobayashi from the Hokkaido University Museum analyzed the skeletal bones.\n\nThe dinosaur found was most likely an adult, according to the research team's histological study.\n\nIt was about 8 meters long and weighed either 4 or 5.3 tons, depending on if it walked on two or four legs respectively. That's around the weight of an Asian elephant.\n\nThe frontal bone of its skull had a long anterior platform for the nasofrontal sutural surface, meaning the dinosaur had what some might call a duck bill.\n\nThe team discovered this dinosaur has three characteristics that aren't shared with other biologically similar dinosaurs: the low position of the cranial bone notch, the short ascending process of the jaw bone and and the anterior inclination of the neural spines of the sixth to twelfth dorsal vertebrae.\n\nWhat they learned from this discovery\n\nCarcass of Kamuysaurus, floating in the sea with two mosasaurs, two sea turtles, and four ammonoids.\n\nScientists are interested in what the Kamuysaurus japonicus can tell us about its clade, a taxonomic grouping of organisms with a common ancestor -- its branch on the tree of life, so to speak.\n\nThe study also provided a better understanding of the origin of this new dinosaur's clade -- a taxonomic grouping of organisms with a common ancestor -- and how it migrated.\n\nThe latest common ancestors of the dinosaurs in the Edmontosaurini clade were spread across both Asia and North America. At the time, they were connected by what is present-day Alaska, which allowed them to travel back and forth between the two continents.\n\nThe group's research also suggests that the dinosaur's ancestors preferred to inhabit areas near the ocean. The coastline environment may have played an important role in the diversification of hadrosaurids in its evolution.", "description": "A nearly complete skeleton of a dinosaur was found, according to a study published in Scientific Reports, and it belongs to a new genus and species of a herbivorous hadrosaurid dinosaur.", "authors": ["Kendall Trammell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190905160525-new-dinosaur-species-illustration-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
