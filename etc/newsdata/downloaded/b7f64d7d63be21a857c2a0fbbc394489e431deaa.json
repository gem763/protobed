Dubbed \u201cThe Expandables,\u201d Away\u2019s newest line of travel gear is made for chronic over-packing travelers who need a little extra room to squeeze in souvenirs at the end of their trip.\n\n\u201cThe Expandables\u201d have the same look of Away\u2019s original luggage line, but the suitcases feature a durable nylon material designed to withstand tough travel conditions. Travelers will find most of the same features the brand already boasts on its current hard-case line, like TSA-approved combination locks, 360-degree spinner wheels, interior compression pads and that removable laundry bag.\n\nAway Away Soft-Sided Luggage\n\nThe biggest difference, however, is that the new soft-luggage has a built-in zipper feature that increases the packing size by 4.5-centimeters. Because of the softer material, this collection also includes a front pocket to store any items you want easy access to.\n\nThere\u2019s one big thing to be aware of before you buy: Away\u2019s soft-sided luggage doesn\u2019t come with the option of adding the ejectable battery like the hard-shell suitcases do. Travelers who are worried about staying juiced on their journey might consider snagging a portable power bank to keep in their purse or backpack. After all, travelers need to remove the power bank from the classic Away carry-on if they check their bag anyway.\n\nThis is the second seasonal launch from the direct-to-consumer travel brand, which in mid-September released a travel tote carry-on that attaches to a suitcase. A while back, the brand released modular packing cubes to keep luggage organized, but this is the first major suitcase addition they\u2019ve offered since the brand\u2019s debut in 2016.\n\nAway Away's first-ever soft-sided luggage is finally here.\n\nThe Away suitcase quickly became a favorite of frequent fliers and Instagrammers for its practical features, chic aesthetic and median price tag in a world where $50 luggage falls apart halfway through the trip and luxury luggage can easily set you back $500.", "description": "Meet Away's first-ever soft-sided luggage collection.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e5ae62100005009acc224.jpeg?cache=7qWQAERoTc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
