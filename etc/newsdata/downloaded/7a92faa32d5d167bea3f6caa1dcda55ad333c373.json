Banks that have rallied of late also dropped, with Deutsche Bank (DBK.XE) and Commerzbank (CBK.XE) lower.\n\nThe German DAX weakened 0.65% to 12387.81, the French CAC 40 fell 0.78% to 5611.15 and the U.K. FTSE 100 fell 0.36% to 7341.03.\n\nOil prices were off the day's highs but still strong, with Brent crude oil futures up over $5 a barrel, a gain of about 9%.\n\n\"To take out over 5% of global supply (in the country with the bulk of 'spare capacity') in a single strike - a volume exceeding cumulative non-OPEC supply growth over 2014-2018 - is highly worrying,\" said Jon Rigby, an analyst at UBS.\n\n\"While U.S.-China trade and U.S. oil supply growth have been the primary price drivers we see a return of the political risk premium as the market has been arguably complacent about risk events,\" he said, adding its upside scenario would see oil getting to $80.\n\nU.S. stock futures were weaker as well, while the yield on the 10-year fell 4 basis points to 1.86%.\n\nOutside of the big oil news, H&M shares (HM-B.SK) fell 1.9% after climbing over 50% over the last 12 months. The Swedish chain reported a 12% rise in third-quarter sales and said it had well-receiver summer collections and increased market share.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 16, 2019 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
