Turkish media reports say Turkish artillery has launched new strikes at Isis targets across the border AP\n\n\u201cThe ruling party has destroyed its own room for manoeuvre and been enslaved by its wrong decisions, chain errors of calculation and obsessions fuelled by its adventurist and sectarian policies,\u201d said the statement, which called for negotiations with the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. \u201cAKP administrations have made their choices in favour of war rather than peace, leading to prolonged conflicts and continued deferral of peace.\u201d\n\nMomentum towards a ground incursion appeared to be increasing. Local news outlets on Wednesday reported that convoys carrying Turkish special forces, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery along with scores of trucks transporting an estimated 2,000 Free Syrian Army fighters were arriving near the Syrian border south of the city of Sanliurfa as they waited for US troops to depart as part of a deal negotiated with President Donald Trump earlier this week.\n\nMr Erdogan has long demanded the creation of a Turkish-influenced \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria\u2019s northeast as a space to alleviate the pressure of more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey and as a means to destroy Rojava, the budding proto-state there run by an affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a separatist group that Ankara has been fighting for decades.\n\nBut the president\u2019s Syria policies have also begun to badly hurt him and his allies politically, as economic troubles exacerbate long-simmering Turkish animosity towards Arabic-speaking Syrians. Aided by local allies, Turkey has already created several relatively successful and mostly stable zones of influence in Syria\u2019s north and northwest.\n\nTurkey\u2019s broadcast news outlets, mostly loyal to the government, reported jingoistically about the military intervention.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Opposition figures voiced support for troops taking part in what is being dubbed Operation \u201cPeace Spring\u201d, or \u201cStream of Peace\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur prayers are for our heroic soldiers to return home safe and sound, after successful completion of Operation Stream of Peace. May God protect and lead our boys to glory,\u201d CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu announced on Twitter.\n\nBut rather than unite Turks behind the flag and the armed forces, the operation has prompted numerous voices of dissent, a potential consequence of the increased political openness since ruling party losses in municipal elections earlier this year. On social media the hashtag #SavasaHayir, or \u201cno to war\u201d was trending in Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe war is Erdogan\u2019s attempt to divide the opposition front using the flag of nationalism,\u201d exiled journalist Can Dundar said. \u201cIf the opposition falls into this trap by saying this is a \u2018national issue,\u2019 it will shoot itself in the foot and throw the country into the fire. That is why we must say no to war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis war is not a war of the people, but the palace,\u201d the HDP said, in reference to the vast Erdogan-built presidential complex in Ankara.\n\nCriticism of the war is risky. Turkish authorities detained more than 800 people critical of last year\u2019s intervention into Afrin, a Kurdish-dominated enclave in Syria\u2019s northwest.\n\nIn contrast to its previous interventions, including one into an area previously controlled by Kurds, the operation in the country\u2019s northeast has also elicited strong criticism and worry from the US Congress, Washington power players, European leaders, neighbouring Iran, the government in the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq and much of the Arab world.\n\n\u201cThis planned operation represents a clear violation of Syrian sovereignty, threatens Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and opens the door to further deterioration in the security and humanitarian situations,\u201d said a statement by the Arab League secretary-general Ahmed Abul Gheit.\n\nEven Mr Trump, who gave the operation a green light by vowing to remove the last few hundred US troops deployed to Syria, warned in a bizarre Tweet that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it violated any of his undefined red lines in Syria, prompting a sell-off of the country\u2019s currency.\n\nOpposition voices said that Turkey risked international isolation by intervening militarily inside Syria with only the word of an untrustworthy Trump as its diplomatic cover.\n\n\u201cWhile the Turkish military\u2019s operation brought the [Syrian Kurds] closer to Damascus, Trump\u2019s zigzag tweets are continuing.\u201d Opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet wrote. \u201cThey are playing with Turkey.\u201d\n\nOthers noted wryly that perhaps Mr Trump is showing wisdom by seeking to abandon Syria, and handing to Turkey thorny issues such as the hundreds of Isis prisoners held in detention facilities in northeast Syria. \u201cWhile everyone else in Syria is trying to clean their hands, Ankara is trying to place its hand in more dirt,\u201d said analyst Kerim Has.\n\nTurks also worry that the intervention could put them on a path of direct confrontation with a resurgent Isis, which reportedly launched a multipronged attack that killed and wounded 25 Kurdish-led fighters in its former Raqqa stronghold on Tuesday.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defence ministry noted that it has fought against Isis \u201cboth domestically and beyond its borders\u201d.\n\nSyrian political opposition leaders allied with Turkey appeared poised to take up the reigns of governance inside northeast Syria. On Tuesday, Oqab Yahya, vice president of the Syrian National Coalition told a western diplomat that his organisation had already begun mapping out security and administration in the enclave, which stretches from the Euphrates River east to the Iraqi border.\n\nBut critics described the intervention as a dangerous last-ditch gambit by Mr Erdogan to salvage a Syria policy that many Turks regard as an unceasing disaster that has cost it tens of billions of dollars. The financial ratings agency S&P issued a note on Wednesday warning that the incursion \u201craises risks for Turkey\u2019s currency and balance of payments\u201d by potentially damaging tourism revenues.\n\n\u201cThe war is a decayed branch that the AKP, which is near exhaustion, is holding onto,\u201d economist Mustafa Sonmez wrote. \u201cWar is a quagmire and it will deepen the crisis. People have become pessimistic, production and consumption have decreased and unemployment is rising. Price hikes and taxes are never ending.\u201d", "description": "Turkey\u2019s intervention in northern Syria inspires\u00a0domestic support for the country\u2019s armed forces, but also scepticism, fear and anger in a politically divided country that perceives it has already suffered greatly because of the continuing eight-year conflict to its southeast.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/10/turkey-syria-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
