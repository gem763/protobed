And Mr Johnson said there won\u2019t be a second referendum, because I asked him: wouldn\u2019t that be a solution to get out of the situation?\u201d\n\nBettel said the UK government needed to lay out on paper an alternative to the Irish backstop, and appeared to suggest that party political considerations might be standing in the way.\n\nEU officials have long believed that Johnson is unlikely to table any ideas until after the Conservative party conference in two weeks but they fear that this will not allow enough time for a deal to be agreed given the gap between the two sides.\n\nA government source confirmed that the UK would not be putting forward any formal text for at least another week. No 10 maintains that progress is being made and that a deal is still possible in the time remaining. Johnson told the BBC he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d because EU leaders had had \u201ca bellyful of all this stuff\u201d.\n\nProfile Who is Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel? Show Hide Xavier Bettel has been prime minister of Luxembourg since 2013. He was previously the mayor of Luxembourg City. Born in Luxembourg City in 1973, he studied law at university in both France and Greece, and combined working as a barrister with his political career. Bettel was first elected to municipal office in 1999, representing Luxembourg\u2019s centre-right Democratic party. In 2018 he became the first openly gay prime minister in the world to be re-elected for a second term. He married his husband, Gauthier Destenay, in May 2015, five months after his government had legalised equal marriage.

You cannot hold their future hostage for party political gain.\u201d Gesticulating to the empty lectern, he added: \u201cSo now it is on Mr Johnson.\u201d\n\nBettel raised his voice in frustration when asked by reporters whether Downing Street may be pursuing a sham negotiation in order to pin the blame on the EU for a no-deal Brexit: \u201cI told him, \u2018I hear a lot but I don\u2019t read a lot\u2019. If they want to discuss anything we need to have it written [down] \u2026 Don\u2019t put the blame on us because they don\u2019t know how to get out of the situation they put themselves in.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Some of the protesters Boris Johnson tried to avoid. Photograph: Joshua Sammer/Getty Images\n\nAsked about the suggestion that Johnson would break the law to avoid extending article 50, Bettel said: \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t happen in Luxembourg.\u201d\n\nIt is understood Downing Street had asked that the scheduled press conference with Bettel be moved inside away from a crowd of around 75 noisy protesters but that the Luxembourg government rejected the request.\n\nFrom the safety of the British embassy, Johnson later told broadcasters the Brexit talks were in a \u201cdifficult moment\u201d and that the press conference had to be cancelled as \u201cthere was clearly going to be a lot of noise and our points would have been drowned out\u201d.\n\nJohnson insisted that there was movement in the talks in which the UK is trying to find an alternative plan to the Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nHe said: \u201cOver the last couple of weeks, there\u2019s been a lot of work \u2026 papers have been shared. But we are now at the stage where we need to start accelerating the work and that was the agreement today with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier.\n\n\u201cWe need to manage this carefully. Yes there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it. Everybody can see roughly what could be done.\u201d\n\nJohnson: no transition period extension if Brexit deal is struck Read more\n\nJohnson conceded that a deal was not \u201cnecessarily in the bag\u201d but that all sides were working to find a compromise. Confronted with the commission\u2019s statement on a lack of progress, Johnson said: \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly the case that the commission is still officially sticking on their position that the backstop has got to be there.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:18 Boris Johnson on why he skipped Luxembourg press conference \u2013 video\n\nThe protests outside the Bettel\u2019s offices were organised by David Pike, a classical baritone singer with joint Canadian, British and Luxemburger nationality. He led the noisy singing and chanting to the EU\u2019s anthem.\n\n\u201cWe are British and quite often dual nationals. I\u2019m not a protester. I have been on a protest,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t go on protest, they are professionals, boring people. People who are concerned about this catastrophe.\u201d\n\nAn official in the Luxembourg government official said that they had to decline Downing Street\u2019s request for the press conference to be inside as there was not a room large enough for the media: \u201cWe tried to change it but on such short notice we had to work with what we had \u2013 it really wasn\u2019t our intention to embarrass Mr Johnson.\u201d", "description": "Xavier Bettel gesticulates at empty podium as British PM skips press conference amid loud protests", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d89942f9f2f48a2a68e4f1501c84a8e1cbddd13a/543_146_2486_1492/master/2486.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae88f91ace92b4ab43b6d355a9674dea", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
