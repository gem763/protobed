But most people who visit Knight's Spider Web Farm in Williamstown, Vt., marvel at the webs and enjoy learning about the spiders from farm owner Terry Knight.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything wrong with being afraid of spiders. They are hairy. They're not the cutest little things. They're not little Charlottes,\" Knight said, referring to Charlotte from the children's book Charlotte's Web.\n\nBut the hairy arachnids did not stop Knight and her husband from pursuing a truly unique profession \u2013 one they stumbled upon by accident.\n\nFrom spider to web\n\nIn 1969, Knight and her late husband Will packed up their family and moved from Brooklyn to an old farmhouse in Vermont.\n\nLess than a decade later, her husband lost his job and the Knights began looking for other ways to make money. Will Knight was a woodworker, and Terry Knight painted and did crafts as a hobby.\n\nThe late Will Knight, accompanied by two young visitors, studies a collected and mounted spider web at Knight's Spider Web Farm in Vermont. (Knight's Spider Web Farm)\n\nAs the adage goes, when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. But in the case of the Knights, life gave them spiders so they made spider webs.\n\nOr a spider web farm, to be more exact.\n\nThe Knights' old farmhouse porch had always had a lot of spiders, and the couple had already shared an appreciation of the intricate beauty of spider webs. So when Terry Knight read that you could collect spider webs, the couple got to work collecting and preserving the webs on their farm.\n\nThe webs are sprayed with white paint. Then, they are carefully pressed onto a finished piece of wood while they are still sticky. The web is then further preserved by coating it with Varathane.\n\nThe late Will Knight working on mounted spider webs at Knight's Spider Web Farm. (Knight's Spider Web Farm)\n\nSince 1977, Knight's Spider Web Farm has sold more than 12,000 webs.\n\nEvery spring, they try to help birth more than 1,000 spiders. They watch for spider eggs and carefully move them to the barn area where they hope the webs will be built.\n\n\"We never got wealthy on it, but at the same time people started to recognize that he was doing something that was unique,\" said Knight.\n\n\"It was by accident, definitely by accident. And he ended up doing what he loved.\"\n\nTo hear the full interview with Terry Knight, download our podcast or click Listen above.", "description": "A farm of spiders might sound like a nightmare, but at Knight's Spider Web Farm in Vermont they see spiders as creators of things of beauty.
