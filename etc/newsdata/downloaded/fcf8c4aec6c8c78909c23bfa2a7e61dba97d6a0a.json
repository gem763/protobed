(FMG.AU) will extend its on-market share buyback for a further year, during which the mining company might repurchase up to 500 million Australian dollars (US$338 million) in stock, it said Friday.\n\nFortescue started a A$500-million buyback program in October 2018, although in August said it had only bought 34.8 million shares, costing a total A$139.2 million or an average A$3.997 per share. That program was due to end this month.\n\n\"Fortescue may now buy back up to A$500 million of shares\" during the year ahead, although \"the number of shares purchased and timing of the buy-back will depend on Fortescue's share price and market conditions,\" the miner said.\n\nFortescue's shares have more than doubled in value this year, underpinned by a surge in prices for iron ore, the only commodity it produces.\n\nWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 19:30 ET (23:30 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
