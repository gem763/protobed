However, both McDonald's (MCD) and UPS (UPS) have negative responses to their reports and that is keeping the upside contained in the broader market.\n\nBreadth is running 3600 gainers to 3100 decliners but the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) is pausing while the S&P500 and the Nasdaq 100 are leading. The S&P 500 is looking to fill its opening gap and there are pockets of profit-taking developing.\n\nEssentially we have a market that has become a little extended and a little giddy due to recent positive action and it needs some rest and resets. This looks like a normal pause within an uptrend rather than the beginning of a major reversal but that can always change.\n\nMy stock of the week, InMode (INMD) , is seeing some good follow through this morning and biotechnology names like Global Blood (GBT) and Biohaven (BHVN) are acting well.\n\nOne small-cap of interest on my radar here is Digital Turbine (APPS) which is gaining some momentum. I continue to watch for bottoming action in SmileDirectClub (SDC) which should see a boost as shorts take their profits and move on.", "description": "This looks like a normal pause within an uptrend....BIIB", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "We Have A Market That Has Become A Little Extended", "This Looks Like A Normal Pause Within An Uptrend.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bruce Kamich", "Bret Jensen", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c1b0dd21-ccd3-11e9-848d-bfafe2ab4af0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
