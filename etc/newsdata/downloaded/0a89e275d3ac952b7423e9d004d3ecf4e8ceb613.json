A second delegate who attended the trip said Arcuri, who was initially rejected from attending by organisers, was \u201cout of place\u201d on the visit.\n\nArcuri leapt to Johnson\u2019s defence on Twitter after he had been quizzed on TV about lying in relation to an extra-marital affair saying it was \u201cpersonal\u201d business and that he was an \u201camazing leader\u201d.\n\nA London assembly member who sat on City Hall\u2019s finance committee during Johnson\u2019s mayoralty raised the prospect of an inquiry about the grants.\n\nJohnson has yet to explain his friendship with 34-year-old Arcuri after the Sunday Times revealed that he failed to declare a series of potential conflicts of interest.\n\nBoris Johnson urged to justify 'awarding public funds to close friend' Read more\n\nAsked about the claims, Johnson told the BBC: \u201cAll I can say is I\u2019m very proud of what we did when I was mayor of London, very proud of everything that we did, particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I can tell you absolutely that everything was done entirely in the proper way.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent interview with Sky News, Johnson was pressed on the claims he faced a potential conflict of interest but he again declined to engage with the question, saying only that as mayor he had been \u201cbeating the drum\u201d for London.\n\nIt comes after \u201cethical hacker\u201d Arcuri \u2013 who first met the politician when she joined his 2012 mayoral campaign after moving to the UK \u2013 was reportedly handed a total of \u00a3126,000 in public money.\n\nJohnson, 55, who was the capital\u2019s mayor between 2008 and 2016, was reportedly a regular visitor to Arcuri\u2019s east London flat. Arcuri, who was then in her late 20s, described Johnson as \u201cone of her best friends\u201d.\n\nJohnson appeared at four events for Arcuri\u2019s Innotech, a firm which organises summits for young technology entrepreneurs based in east London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout.\n\nIn October 2013, Innotech received a \u00a310,000 grant from London & Partners (L&P), a promotional group which Johnson was responsible for as mayor. L&P paid Innotech a further \u00a31,500 to sponsor an event in the House of Commons the following summer. The group said the money given to Arcuri\u2019s firm was \u201cnot a grant but a commercial sponsorship\u201d and denied Johnson had involvement.\n\nArcuri received a separate \u00a315,000 government grant. She relocated back to America last June but her latest company, Hacker House, won a \u00a3100,000 cyber skills grant from DCMS earlier this year.\n\nArcuri was rejected after applying to join two trade trips to New York and Tel Aviv but went anyway after Johnson\u2019s office lobbied on her behalf. She attended a third trip led by Johnson to Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nShe was also added to the Tel Aviv trip in November 2015 at the eleventh hour at the request of Johnson\u2019s team. Aldo de Pape, founder and CEO of TeachPitch, a web-based learning platform that helps teachers and schools identify the best online resources available, said Arcuri told fellow delegates she was friends with Johnson.\n\n\u201cShe was nice, she was friendly, she was quite open about her personal relationship with Johnson. She said she was friends with him. She didn\u2019t imply anything romantic,\u201d he said, but added Johnson should explain his relationship with Arcuri.\n\nAnother delegate, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \u201cShe was the odd one out. I just remember thinking there\u2019s a bunch of tech people here and then there\u2019s you.\u201d\n\nArcuri did not respond to requests for comment. She previously told the Sunday Times: \u201cAny grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.\u201d", "description": "PM stonewalls allegations of conflict of interest over friendship with Jennifer Arcuri", "authors": ["Simon Murphy", "Matthew Weaver", "Peter Walker", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6362b83487f1e7e92c3207ba2993686fcd2249/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33f4cb2df6557187832b2b80d998c56c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
