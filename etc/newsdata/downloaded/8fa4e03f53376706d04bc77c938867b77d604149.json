Analysis found that almost half of these had a \"rubbery texture\" and could be synthetic or natural rubber, with vehicle tires one possible explanation.\n\nUsing modeling, the team estimated an annual discharge of 11 trillion microparticles into the bay.\n\n\"Approximately two thirds of these microparticles were estimated to be plastic, yielding an estimated annual discharge of 7 trillion microplastics per year,\" the report said.\n\nAs for the rubber, it could be that rainwater is sweeping rubber stuck to roads into the tributaries and then on the ocean.\n\nWater released from treatment plants meanwhile contained microplastics from textiles, like acrylics and polyester, probably coming from clothes washed in washing machines, and microbeads from hygiene and beauty products.\n\nPolyethylene microplastics, probably from plastic bags and wrap, were also widely found.\n\nThe study is an important stepping stone, the authors wrote.\n\n\"The field of microplastics pollution is in its infancy, and there are not yet widely accepted standards for sample collection, laboratory analysis, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), or reporting of microplastics in environmental samples,\" they concluded.", "description": "Research has revealed the presence of trillions of microparticles from clothes, plastic wrap and possibly tires in the San Francisco Bay, according to a study released Wednesday.
