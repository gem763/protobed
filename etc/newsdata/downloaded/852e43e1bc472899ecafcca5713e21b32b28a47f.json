Antetokounmpo and Greece (2-1) will be the opponent when the U.S. (3-0) opens second-round play on Saturday night, in what\u2019s essentially a must-win game for the Greeks in their quest to reach next week\u2019s quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s going to come out to kill us. There\u2019s no question,\u201d said U.S. center Brook Lopez, Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammate with the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cHe\u2019ll try to tear our heads off. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything otherwise.\u201d\n\nGreece has already survived one must-win game in this World Cup, beating New Zealand 103-97 on Thursday night to clinch the 16th and final available spot in the second round. Had they lost, the Greeks were going to the classification round and relegated to no better than a 17th-place finish in the 32 team tournament.\n\nInstead, they get the U.S. in a game that\u2019s sure to command major attention.\n\n\u201cFor us, we go as far as Giannis goes,\u201d Greece\u2019s Nick Calathes said. \u201cNot just offensively because offensively he can score, he can pass. But defensively, he\u2019s a big impact for us. We\u2019ll be ready to go. We\u2019re not afraid of anybody. Obviously, USA is the best team in the tournament right now so we\u2019ll be prepared and have the right mindset coming in.\u201d\n\nAll second-round teams play two games before the quarterfinal field is set. The U.S. will play Brazil in the second-round finale Monday, while Greece will play the Czech Republic.\n\nThere is no mystery about what this event means to Antetokounmpo.\n\n\u201cTo represent my country, it\u2019s an unbelievable feeling,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou really cannot explain it. But one thing I\u2019ll say is when you play for the national team, you don\u2019t only play for yourself. You represent every single Greek person.\u201d\n\nHe said in the weeks leading up to the tournament that he would trade the MVP award for the World Cup crown.\n\nIf only it were that easy. Greece will face a U.S. team that is coming off a 53-point romp against Japan to finish first-round play.\n\n\u201cOur opinion has been all along that all these players from overseas that play in the NBA are obviously good players or they wouldn\u2019t be there, and Giannis is pretty special as far as good players are concerned,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cBut when they play for their countries, we like to say that they become superheroes.\u201d\n\nGreece will probably need Antetokounmpo to find his superhero cape if this upset is going to happen.\n\nHe\u2019s averaged 15.7 points so far in three games in China, shooting 50 percent from the floor and only 17 percent from 3-point range. The Greeks have been careful with his minutes and his best game of the World Cup, by far, was Thursday when he logged 30 minutes and scored 24 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and handed out six assists.\n\nGreece coach Thanasis Skourtopoulos likely won\u2019t be cautious with his star\u2019s minutes Saturday.\n\n\u201cGiannis is the superstar of the team and everybody knows what he can do,\u201d Skourtopoulos said.\n\nThe Americans struggled at times in their opener against the Czech Republic, nearly lost to Turkey in their second game and arrived in China last week a few days removed from a loss in Australia. All that has led to plenty of questions about their vulnerability.\n\nSkourtopoulos isn\u2019t buying that notion.\n\n\u201cThe USA team, of course, even with a lot of stars missed, the roster is great,\u201d Skourtopoulos said. \u201cThe coaching staff is more than great. It\u2019s a very good team and we\u2019ll have to be 100 percent ready if we want to go against them and take the victory against this great team.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a very distinct familiarity for Lopez and U.S. wing Khris Middleton, since they see Antetokounmpo in Bucks practice every day during the NBA season. And three members of the Boston Celtics who are on the U.S. roster - Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart - faced Antetokounmpo in the second round of last season\u2019s playoffs, the Bucks winning in five games.\n\nBrown is eager for Saturday.\n\n\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d Brown said.\n\nMiddleton said he hasn\u2019t done any chatting with Antetokounmpo since the World Cup started. And he cautioned that focusing too much on Antetokounmpo could be problematic for the Americans.\n\n\u201cHe is the MVP, but at the same time they do have other great players on that team,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cThey have Calathes, they have a couple bigs, couple shooters. So it\u2019s not just all about Giannis. He\u2019s a smart player who knows how to use his teammates. We can\u2019t just focus on him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. men's basketball team figured that it would eventually cross paths with Giannis Antetokounmpo at this World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/china_basketball_world_cup_74912_c0-1513-3385-3486_s1770x1032.jpg?8640d19d52bcb1eb46641f404f610f5ccde9c359", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
