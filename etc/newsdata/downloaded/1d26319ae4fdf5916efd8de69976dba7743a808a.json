At the Detroit debate this summer, Mr Biden said he was \u201ca little surprised\u201d at the flak he took about Mr Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cHe was a president our children could and did look up to,\u201d Mr Biden said in the new ad.\n\nMr Biden, who has led most national and early state polls since he joined the field in April, is downplaying the prospects of a mighty clash with Ms Warren, despite their well established policy differences on health care, taxes and financial regulation.\n\nThe location of the debate is interesting. While Donald Trump won Texas 53 \u2013 43 in the 2016 presidential election, Harris County, which contains Houston, was taken by Hillary Clinton 54 \u2013 42. Democrats believe the changing demographics of such places, and the way in which Donald Trump has put off many Latinos and white women who voted for him last year, could provide rich pickings in 2020.\n\nOfficials from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) have said they believe they could flip up to six congressional seats, against the backdrop of a flurry of Republican retirements.\n\nAs such, viewers turning in on Thursday will have seen the diversity of the modern Democratic Party. The debate, held on the campus of historically black Texas Southern University, features several women, people of colour and a gay man, a genuine contrast from the increasingly white and male Republican Party.\n\n\u201cI will get behind whatever candidate the party chooses. I don\u2019t care who it is,\u201d said Patrick King, 58, a professor of data science, who was at a coffee shop near the debate location on Thursday morning. \u201cI think the priorities need to be healthcare, and basic human decency.\u201d\n\nAsked about the prospects of Mr Trump being re-elected in 2020, Mr King said he thought they were \u201calarmingly high\u201d.\n\nLarry Johnson and his daughter, Sydney, were at a grocery store. They said they would be watching the debates to see who emerged as the person best placed to defeat Mr Trump.\n\n\u201cThere have been five or six of them who I\u2019ve thought could do a good job,\u201d said Mr Johnson, a sales manager, who said he scored Mr Trump just four out of 10, and said he strongly opposed his views on immigration.\n\nMs Johnson said for her, climate change was the most important issue. She scored Mr Trump three out of 10. \u201cI do like Elizabeth Warren. There are a few I could live with,\u201d she said.\n\nMany in Houston highlighted the fact that while the state had gone to Mr Trump, the city had not.\n\nShweta Tempee, a 23-year-old student, said Mr Trump\u2019s term as president had emboldened bigots.\n\n\u201cI like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Kamala has real power,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019d support anyone who could defeat Trump and make it all less crazy.\u201d\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nThe debate in Houston comes at crucial moment in the election cycle as many voters return from summer holidays and start to pay closer attention to the campaign.\n\n\u201cFor a complete junkie or someone in the business, you already have an impression of everyone,\u201d said Howard Dean, who ran for president in 2004 and later chaired the Democratic National Committee. \u201cBut now you are going to see increasing scrutiny with other people coming in to take a closer look.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Joe Biden is seeking to hold off a surge from Elizabeth Warren, as the two leading Democrats finally appear on the same stage.
