Attorneys for the plaintiff argued that Johnson and Johnson marketed the drug without warning patients enough about its link to gynecomastia.\n\nMel Evans/AP, FILE\n\n\"This jury, as have other juries in other litigations, once again imposed punitive damages on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients,\" the attorneys' statement added. \"Johnson & Johnson and Janssen chose billions over children.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson called the jury's determination \"grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case\" and added that it is \"confident it will be overturned.\"\n\n\"This award for a single plaintiff stands in stark contrast with the initial $680,000 compensatory award and is a clear violation of due process,\" the company added in a statement.\n\nJohnson & Johnson also defended their labeling of Risperdal, saying that it \"clearly and appropriately outlined the risks associated with the medicine,\" and the benefits it provides to patients with mental illness.\n\nThe company said that they were unable to present a \"meaningful defense due to the Court\u2019s exclusion of key evidence\" and argued attorneys for the plaintiff did not present any evidence that the plaintiff suffered actual harm.\n\n\"We will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict,\" the company added.", "description": "A jury says Johnson & Johnson must pay $8 billion in damages over their drug Risperdal which has been linked to abnormal breast enlargement in men.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/johnson-ap-er-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
