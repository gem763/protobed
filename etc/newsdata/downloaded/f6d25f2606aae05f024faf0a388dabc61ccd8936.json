Their call came in response to intergovernmental action being blocked by a minority of very powerful, science-denying governments, representing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry. Through the Global Green New Deal, cities have reaffirmed their commitment to protecting our environment, strengthening our economy, and building a more equitable future by cutting emissions from the sectors most responsible for the climate crisis \u2014 transportation, buildings, industry, and waste \u2014 to keep global heating below the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe city leaders called to cut global emissions by 50 percent by 2030, an effort the United States has already led the charge on despite a lack of participation in the Paris Agreement.\n\nCarbon emissions from energy usage from the U.S. are at the lowest levels since 1992, as Breitbart News\u2019s entertainment editor and author of 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know, Jermone Hudson, told Fox & Friends last month.\n\nAdditionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report last year, which indicated that greenhouse gas emissions decreased during Trump\u2019s first year in office.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe EPA report revealed that total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 2.7 percent from 2016 to 2017.", "description": "Dozens of mayors involved in the\u00a0C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group formally called for a \"Global Green New Deal\" on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/C40-Summit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
