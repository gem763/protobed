Giuliani is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nAnother foreign service officer set to testify Wednesday, Catherine Croft, will say that during her time at the National Security Council, she received multiple phone calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston telling her that the-then ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, should be fired.\n\n\u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u201cObama holdover\u201d and associated with George Soros. It was not clear to me at the time_or now_at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d she will say.\n\nTheir testimony follows that of Alexander Vindman, an Army officer with the National Security Council who testified that he twice raised concerns over the administration\u2019s push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats and Joe Biden.\n\nVindman, a lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat, was the first official to testify who actually heard Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy. He reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nVindman also told investigators Tuesday that he tried to change the White House\u2019s rough transcript of the call by filling in at least one of the omitted words, \u201cBurisma,\u201d a reference to the company linked to Biden and his son, according to people familiar with his testimony. But Vindman was unsuccessful.\n\nHis concerns, though, were far bigger than the transcript. And lawmakers said his failed effort to edit it didn\u2019t significantly change their understanding of what transpired during Trump\u2019s call that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nVindman\u2019s arrival in military blue, with medals, created a striking image at the Capitol as the impeachment inquiry reached deeper into the White House. He testified for more than 10 hours.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said, according to prepared remarks . \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nVindman, a 20-year military officer, added to the mounting evidence from other witnesses \u2014 diplomats, defense and former administration officials \u2014 who are corroborating the initial whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump and providing new details ahead of a House vote in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story: There\u2019s not like a new headline out of all of these,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J. \u201cEvery single witness, from their own vantage point, has corroborated the central facts of the story we\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry is looking into Trump\u2019s call, in which he asked Zelenskiy for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 to investigate Democrats \u2014 that the Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid and could be an impeachable offense.\n\nWith the administration directing staff not to appear, Vindman was the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment panels. He was issued a subpoena to appear.\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, said that it was his \u201csacred duty\u201d to defend the United States.\n\nSome Trump allies, looking for ways to discredit Vindman, questioned the colonel\u2019s loyalties because he was born in the region. But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to criticize his patriotism.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the slams on Vindman \u201cabsurd, disgusting and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier, and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\u201d\n\nThe testimony came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would vote on a resolution to set rules for public hearings and a possible vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote would be the first on the impeachment inquiry and aims to nullify complaints from Trump and his allies that the process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution merely \u201cconfirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.\u201d\n\nThe session Tuesday grew contentious at times as House Republicans continued trying to unmask the still-anonymous whistleblower and call him or her to testify. Vindman said he is not the whistleblower and does not know who it is.\n\nGOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio acknowledged Republicans were trying to get Vindman to provide the names of others he spoke to after the July 25 phone call, in an effort to decide whom to call to testify. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nVindman testified that in spring of this year he became aware of \u201coutside influencers\u201d promoting a \u201cfalse narrative of Ukraine\u201d that undermined U.S. efforts, a reference in particular to Giuliani.\n\nHe first reported his concerns after a July 10 meeting in which U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nVindman says he told Sondland that \u201chis statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\u201d\n\nThat differs from the account of Sondland, a wealthy businessman who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration and testified before the impeachment investigators that no one from the NSC \u201cever expressed any concerns.\u201d Sondland also testified that he did not realize any connection between Biden and Burisma.", "description": "Christopher Anderson\u2019s testimony may show that administration officials were concerned about Giuliani\u2019s back-channel involvement in Ukraine policy.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG092_bolton_ZG_20180322193330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
