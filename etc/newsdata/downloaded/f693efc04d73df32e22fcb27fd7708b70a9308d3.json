The layer, the ionosphere, and its highly variable plasma waves can disrupt GPS signals and other radio-wave-based communication systems.\n\nTo better understand the ionosphere and pinpoint the forces responsible for its variability, scientists at NASA are sending a specially equipped satellite into space to observe the enigmatic layer.\n\nThe Ionospheric Connection Explorer, or ICON, developed by a team of scientists and engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, will be carried into space this week by Northrup Grumman\u2019s Pegasus XL rocket.\n\n\u201cICON is built specifically to understand the connection between conditions at the boundary of space, at approximately 60 miles altitude, and how the ionosphere above responds,\u201d Thomas Immel, principal investigator on the ICON mission and a researcher at Berkeley\u2019s Space Sciences Laboratory, told UPI. \u201cThe mission design includes an orbit that strongly favors this kind of investigation.\u201d\n\nHow the ionosphere works\n\nScientists have long struggled to accurately model the behavior of the ionized plasma, which travels along rapidly shifting geomagnetic field lines.\n\nDuring the day, as the sun\u2019s energy heats the upper atmosphere, gas molecules become ionized. Upwellings of ionized gas create dense bands of particles running on either side of the magnetic equator.\n\n\u201cBasic models of the ionosphere predict that there should be a regular rise and fall of this portion of the atmosphere as the Earth rotates from day to night, independent of longitude,\u201d according to the Space Sciences Laboratory.\n\nBut observations of the ionosphere have shown the layer\u2019s ionized particles and plasma waves behave and are distributed in unexpected ways \u2014 ways not explained by current models. Analysis suggests the layer\u2019s idiosyncrasies aren\u2019t triggered by changes in solar activity.\n\n\u201cThe ionosphere can vary a lot from one day to the next,\u201d Immel said. \u201cIt is not clear why, so it is nearly impossible to predict.\u201d\n\nBy more accurately modeling and forecasting the behavior of the ionosphere, engineers could better protect the signals of navigational and communication satellite systems from disruption. To improve their models, scientists need to determine what drives the ionosphere\u2019s dynamism, the terrestrial weather below or the space weather above.\n\n\u201cWe think that the key is in the connection between the ionosphere and the energy in the atmosphere far below and we are built to resolve this,\u201d Immel said. \u201cIf the atmosphere below really is \u2018in charge,\u2019 then one can start to investigate how the atmosphere below plays a role in plasma storms around Earth, and how these storms driven by the sun are influenced by the Earth\u2019s weather itself.\u201d\n\nICON\u2019s mission and scientific payload\n\nICON will orbit Earth at a 27-degree inclination and at an altitude of some 360 miles \u2014 a position that will allow its instruments to continuously image the atmosphere-space boundary, from roughly 60 to 250 miles above Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe scientific payload, which is mounted on an Orbital ATK LEOStar-2 spacecraft, features four instruments tasked with observing the ionosphere and measuring the characteristics of the surrounding space environment.\n\nThe Michelson Interferometer for Global High-resolution Thermospheric Imaging instrument will measure the temperature and speed of the neutral atmosphere, which is driven by weather patterns lower in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe Ion Velocity Meter will track the speed and movements of the ionosphere\u2019s charged particles. The instrument\u2019s measurements will help scientists isolate the influence of high altitude winds and the electromagnetic fields on the charged particles.\n\nThe Extreme Ultra-Violet instrument will help scientists model the daytime ionosphere by collecting images of oxygen glowing in the upper atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThis helps track the response of the space environment to weather in the lower atmosphere,\u201d according to NASA.\n\nThe fourth instrument, the Far Ultra-Violet instrument, will image the upper atmosphere in the far end of the ultraviolet spectrum. The instrument will help scientists measure the density of the ionosphere at night, measurements that help researchers figure out how the ionosphere is impacted by weather in the lower atmosphere.\n\nScientists had to design and build the payload in such a way that all four instruments can function properly at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe instruments first have to be designed not to interfere with each other \u2014 self-compatibility \u2014 which we have done,\u201d Immel said. \u201cThen you have to make sure that the instruments do not interfere with the spacecraft and vice versa. We did that too.\u201d\n\nIf the instruments perform as expected, scientists will soon have the measurements they need to determine the effects of terrestrial weather on ionospheric variability, as well as understand how energy and momentum from the lower atmosphere influences the space environment.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding what drives variations in the ionosphere is important so that we can better predict what types of signal distortions we may expect and where, as well as ways to design systems that are more robust against these effects,\u201d according to the Space Sciences Laboratory.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Inside the outermost layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, billions of negatively charged electrons bounce freely for long periods of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
