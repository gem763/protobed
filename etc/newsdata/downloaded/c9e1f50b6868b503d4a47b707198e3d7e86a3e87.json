Later versions of the story say the PM has \u201cput Britain on a general election footing\u201d after the latest setback, in which MPs refused to allow him to rush through the legislation without proper scrutiny. The Matt cartoon riffs off the Guy Fawkes gunpowder plot.\n\nPhotograph: Daily Telegraph\n\nThe Guardian says MPs blocked Johnson\u2019s timetable for a deal even after he threatened to pull the bill and call for a general election. Johnson will now press EU leaders to avoid a lengthy delay, it says. If you can pull yourself away from the image of Wolf for the \u201cGladiators: 20 years on\u201d feature, the headline is \u201cParliament puts brakes on Johnson\u2019s race for Brexit.\u201d\n\nGuardian news (@guardiannews) The Guardian front page, Wednesday 23 October 2019: Parliament puts brakes on Johnson's race for Brexit pic.twitter.com/vl3sFN8Mtg\n\nThe Sun deploys Little Britain\u2019s Vicky Pollard to interpret the two votes on the deal and the timetable, going with the headline: \u201cYeah but no but \u2026\u201d Nine former Tories voted against the proposed three-day schedule, it says.\n\nThe Sun (@TheSun) Tomorrow's front page: MPs finally backed Boris Johnson's #Brexit deal - then wrecked it within minutes by rejecting his three-day timetable to push it through Parliament https://t.co/HDF8fUegpy pic.twitter.com/XSehkDKrJ1\n\nThe Mirror refers to the PM\u2019s Halloween deadline for a straightforward headline: \u201cPM\u2019s Brexit horror\u201d, and says in its intro he doesn\u2019t stand a \u201cghost of a chance\u201d of leaving the EU on his timetable. It too mentions high that Johnson had threatened to pull the withdrawal bill entirely but instead opted to pause it.\n\nDaily Mirror (@DailyMirror) Tomorrow's front page: PM's Brexit horror #TomorrowsPapersToday https://t.co/Trnv17lX9k pic.twitter.com/NDeqY8Uxb2\n\nThe Daily Mail again criticises MPs for scuppering a quick deal, with the headline: \u201cTrust this lot to turn triumph into disaster!\u201d It claims Johnson\u2019s win on the second reading of the bill as a \u201chuge boost\u201d but says the next step is now in the hands of the EU. The Express follows a similar tack after an \u201cevening of high farce in Westminster\u201d, saying MPs have spoiled a historic deal with \u201cyet more dithering\u201d.\n\nPhotograph: DAILY MAIL\n\nPhotograph: DAILY EXPRESS\n\nThe i says a Halloween Brexit is in tatters, and points out that MPs have technically supported a Brexit bill for the first time. It also quotes a \u201cNo 10 source\u201d as saying an election is the \u201conly way to move on\u201d.\n\ni newspaper (@theipaper) Wednesday's front page: Boris Johnson's Halloween Brexit in tatters #tomorrowspaperstoday #skypapers #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/YUdbIWlBbv\n\nThe Times gives its splash to a potential breakthrough drug that can slow Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms, with an arms-crossed Johnson in the picture slot. In a slightly muted treatment, it describes the PM as \u201cfrustrated\u201d that MPs supported the \u201clandmark\u201d deal but thwarted his deadline. The FT uses almost exactly the same phrasing in its splash headline. Later versions said a \u201csnap election was back on the agenda\u201d.\n\nPhotograph: The Times", "description": "MPs blamed for letting Boris Johnson nudge his deal forward but blocking his self-imposed deadline", "authors": ["Graham Russell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa87b7aee770842986ccb2f35278c810b1f2abde/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af17ba7efcf18fcc7a58c646672f642b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
