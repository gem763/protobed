Kennedy to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nFor anyone who read Trump\u2019s missive to Erdogan, the parody \u2014 which first appeared on Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d \u2014 bears more than a few similarities.\n\n\u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d it reads. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, ok? Get your missiles out of Cuba. Everybody will say \u2018Yay! Khrushchev! You\u2019re the best!\u2019 But if you don\u2019t everybody will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really busting my nuts here,\u201d the note says in closing. \u201cGive you a jingle later.\u201d\n\nFound in the archives... pic.twitter.com/iFFeqloYHM \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 20, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House released Trump\u2019s Oct. 9 memo to Erdogan, which was written in the same boorish tone, warning the Turkish president not to attack the Kurds in northern Syria after Trump withdrew U.S. troops from the region.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2015 and I will.\u201d\n\nConcluding the letter, Trump says, \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nUpon first look, the message\u2019s language caused some readers, including seasoned White House reporters, to wonder if it was real.\n\nThough Clinton\u2019s was not, Trump\u2019s sure was. But his bizarre approach failed to deter Erdogan from launching an offensive against the Kurds.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Turkish presidential sources told the outlet that when he received Trump\u2019s letter, Erdogan \u201cthoroughly rejected it and put it in the [trash] bin.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based watchdog organization, said that as of Sunday, there have been 120 civilian casualties and 300,000 people displaced in the region.\n\nLove HuffPost?
