He had worked on North Yorkshire\u2019s railways before moving to Hunslet, known as the \u201cworkshop of Leeds\u201d on account of its iron foundries and steelworks. Like neighbouring Holbeck, the centre of Leeds\u2019 textile industry, workers lived in red-brick terraced houses close to their places of employment.\n\nBy the 1890s Hunslet\u2019s steel works was Britain\u2019s largest producer of railway tracks, sprawling over a 25-acre site. By 1911, one in every five men worked in Leeds\u2019 heavy industries, which were predominantly concentrated south of the River Aire.\n\nSouth Leeds\u2019 reliance on iron, steel and textiles meant it was hit hard by industrial decline. By the 1960s the area\u2019s traditional industries had largely collapsed and workers\u2019 terraces were demolished in slum clearances. Stourton, a working-class suburb bordering Holbeck, was transformed in the space of a few years from residential suburb to post-industrial wasteland. The city council, keen to rebrand Leeds as a thoroughly modern city, welcomed the construction of the M621 motorway through Holbeck and Hunslet, and attempted to style Leeds as the \u201cMotorway City of the Seventies\u201d.\n\nFifty years later, the effects of post-industrial decline and poor urban planning are increasingly difficult to ignore. South Leeds\u2019 grandiose industrial architecture is decaying; far from singing the motorway\u2019s praises, the council now recognises that the M621 \u201cdisrupts the community, cutting it off from the rest of Leeds\u201d. In 2018 the council launched an ambitious plan to redevelop Leeds\u2019 \u201cSouth Bank\u201d, hoping to redevelop industrial wasteland to double the size of the city centre. Architectural plans show the \u201cSouth Bank\u201d sprinkled with high-rise office buildings, and residents might question whether the benefits will be spread evenly between businesses and the local population. Nonetheless, attention is at last being focused on the future of south Leeds and its unique heritage.\n\nA walk through south Leeds reveals a district caught between industrial grandeur, post-industrial wasteland and urban blandness. The starting point is Leeds station, where the 1960s edifice and the 1930s art-deco concourse sit directly above the Dark Arches, a series of vaults spanning the River Aire that serve as the station\u2019s foundation. A metal walkway passes through the Dark Arches and over the Aire, where passers-by can stop and trace watch the churning water receding into darkness. Around 18m bricks were used to construct the arches during the 1860s \u2013 the largest such project in the world at that time.\n\nThrough the Dark Arches lies the Leeds-Liverpool canal and the gentrified tip of Holbeck: \u201cHolbeck Urban Village\u201d, a tight knot of former red-brick flax mills and steam engine works. The Round Foundry dates back to 1795 and was once home to steam engine manufacturers; today the complex is home to offices, a brewery and Yorkshire\u2019s official tourist board. The gentrification of this small part of Holbeck has done little to ease poverty in south Leeds as a whole, but it has preserved a part of the district\u2019s history that was previously at risk.\n\nThe buildings in the Urban Village are significant, but the most impressive relics of south Leeds\u2019 industrial heritage lie just around the corner. Tower Works on Globe Road was constructed in the 1860s by the industrialist Thomas Harding to produce needles for south Leeds\u2019 textile manufacturers. A lover of Italian architecture, Harding took the unusual decision to embellish his factory with red-brick replicas of famous towers in Verona, Florence and San Gimignano. Derelict for several decades, Tower Works is currently being converted into luxury flats.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive relic of south Leeds\u2019 industrial past lies a five minute walk from Tower Works. Pass Marshall Mills, an imposing six-storey edifice that dwarfs the smaller industrial buildings around it, and you might be surprised to find an Egyptian temple executed in millstone grit. This is Temple Works, modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu on the west bank of the Nile, and a prime example of northern industrialists\u2019 use of architecture to flaunt their cultural capital.\n\nTemple Works opened in 1840 and boasted the largest single-span room in the world, as well as a grass-covered roof where sheep could graze, sometimes falling on to the street below. The mill was sold in the 1880s, and by 2008 it was on the verge of collapse. After several stalled attempts at redevelopment, Temple Works has been purchased by a local developer, CEG. Work has started on the restoration, with CEG stating: \u201cWe want to reconnect the communities that were cut off by the M621 and feel the city centre is not for them. It needs to be an inclusive use that everyone is proud of.\u201d\n\nBeyond Temple Works the gentrification ends abruptly. South of the regenerated buildings lies a patchwork landscape of old railway viaducts, industrial wasteland and decaying historic buildings such as Low Hall Mills, constructed in 1874 and now derelict. The area is peppered with listed buildings; the red terracotta and Burmantofts tiling of Holbeck public library, now offices; the United Methodist Free Chapel constructed in 1880, now home to a carpet warehouse. Yet much of the landscape is a blur of roundabouts and light industrial units.\n\nThis part of Holbeck has seen its fair share of controversy: in 2014 the area was profiled in the press as the UK\u2019s first \u201clegal\u201d red light district, a reference to Leeds city council\u2019s introduction of a \u201cmanaged zone\u201d where sex workers and punters could work free of police interference within agreed hours and geographic limits. Although efforts to improve safety for sex workers are commendable, Holbeck\u2019s ginnels and viaducts are far from a sanctuary. In 2016 a young woman named Daria Pionko was murdered by a punter in the managed zone, a reminder of the dangers that women working in Holbeck still face.\n\nIn neighbouring Hunslet, the remnants of south Leeds\u2019 industrial past are harder to spot. Clues remain, however: among the most impressive examples of Hunslet\u2019s industrial past are Leeds city college\u2019s conversion of a former printworks factory into a campus, resplendent in terracotta, and the former Hunslet Engine Company headquarters on Jack Lane, where an exposed section of rail track still cuts through the road (the Hunslet Engine Company is still manufacturing locomotive engines in south Leeds to this day).\n\nJust over the border in Middleton lies the oldest continuously operating railway in the world, Middleton Railway, opened in 1758 to serve south Leeds\u2019 coal mines. There are other reasons to be optimistic: Victoria Mills, derelict since the 1970s and once among the Victorian Society\u2019s top 10 at-risk buildings, is being redeveloped as flats. It is not clear how many will be affordable, but at the very least part of Hunslet\u2019s industrial history has been salvaged.\n\nSouth Leeds was once the heart of industrial Leeds, but suffered a steep decline in the late 20th century. There are reasons to question how far the redevelopment of buildings like Victoria Mills will address stubborn poverty in the area, and there remains a perceived boundary between Holbeck proper and the Urban Village. Nonetheless, after decades of neglect, there are signs that south Leeds and its remarkable history is finally being recognised.\n\nFrancesca Roe is a writer, printmaker and illustrator from Leeds.
