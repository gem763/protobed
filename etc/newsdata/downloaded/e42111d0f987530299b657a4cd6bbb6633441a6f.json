Shadow chancellor John McDonnell insisted that any Brexit deal must be subject to a confirmatory referendum.\n\nDeclaring that Labour \u2013 despite the absence of its leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 is a Remain party, Mr McDonnell said: \u201cWe believe that our future best lies within the European Union itself.\u201d\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry vowed to ask Scotland\u2019s highest court on Monday to take action to force Johnson to request a delay to Brexit.\n\nAnd Mr Bercow said he was ready to sign the letter to Brussels in Johnson\u2019s place if asked to by Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session, telling Ms Cherry: \u201cIf I were instructed by this House, I would do as instructed and if I were directed or instructed by a court, I would do as directed.\u201d\n\nJohnson struck a defiant tone after his hopes of securing parliamentary approval for an EU withdrawal deal were dashed, after three failed attempts by his predecessor Theresa May.\n\nHis plan was scuppered by an amendment tabled by former Conservative cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin, who he last month expelled from the party over a previous Brexit rebellion.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Dodds later hinted that the DUP could give decisive backing to bid expected next week for a second referendum, telling the PM in the chamber: \"We will examine all amendments in the light of our overriding concern about the constitutional and economic integrity of the Union. That is our priority.\"\n\nSome six Labour MPs backed Mr Johnson, while four abstained, suggesting he can expect the support of no more than 10 Labour rebels if his deal is finally put to a vote.\n\nInstead of confirming he would comply with the law requiring him to delay Brexit, Johnson took to the despatch box to declare: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, neither does the law compel me to do so.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn insisted Mr Johnson must obey the law, telling him: \u201cHe can no longer use the threat of a no-deal crash-out to blackmail members to support his sell-out deal.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission said it \u201ctook note\u201d of the MPs\u2019 vote and expected the UK government to \u201cinform us about the next steps as soon as possible\u201d. In a statement, Irish premier Leo Varadkar noted that an extension beyond 31 October \u201ccan only be granted by unanimity\u201d of the 27 remaining EU leaders.\n\nThe office of French president Emmanuel Macron said a further delay was \"in the interests of no-one\".\n\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government was planning to give MPs another chance on Monday to approve the last-minute deal sealed by Johnson in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nBut Mr Bercow signalled he may not allow the motion to be put forward again so soon, telling MPs it would be \u201cmost curious and irregular\u201d if its purpose was to seek to invalidate today\u2019s vote.\n\nAnd a Tory rebel source accused Mr Johnson of \u201cpetulance\u201d, pointing out that the successful Letwin amendment states that approval cannot be granted \u201cunless and until\u201d ratification through a Withdrawal Agreement Bill is complete.\n\n\u201cThis sends a clear signal that the prime minister should now bring forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, not a meaningful vote, on Monday so that MPs can vote for or against it,\u201d said the source. \u201cIn the meantime, he must comply with the law.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson insisted he was not \u201cdismayed or daunted\u201d by the setback.\n\nIf he is unable to secure a meaningful vote on Monday, he will hope to reverse his defeat during the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill over the coming days.\n\nBut scrutiny of the bill is likely to be a fiercely fought affair, giving MPs plenty of opportunities to insert amendments to require a second referendum.\n\nPeople\u2019s Vote organisers estimated the size of the demonstration was up to 1 million, making it one of the biggest public protests in British history. Marchers and supporters flocked to sign a letter to MPs, MEPs, the prime minister and the leaders of the other 27 EU states calling for a Final Say ballot.\n\nMinisters including Mr Johnson\u2019s no-deal supremo Michael Gove were given police escorts to leave the Palace of Westminster, which was surrounded by thousands of protesters, leading business secretary Andrea Leadsom to complain of \u201cintimidation\u201d.\n\nThe Final Say letter can be signed at www.peoples-vote.uk/letter.", "description": "Boris Johnson has been dealt a humiliating double blow by MPs who ordered him to delay Brexit while up to a million voters marched on parliament to demand a Final Say referendum.
