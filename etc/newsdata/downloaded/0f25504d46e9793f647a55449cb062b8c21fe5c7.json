Brennan Jr. attempts to defend his judicial career of misinterpreting the Constitution to entrench liberal policy preferences. Brennan states that the \u201cencounter with the constitutional text has been, in many senses, my life\u2019s work,\u201d and he speaks also of his 29 years of \u201cwrestl[ing] with the Constitution,\u201d but his speech illustrates how Brennan\u2019s \u201cencounter\u201d with the Constitution would better be described as his mugging of it.\n\nBrennan purports to disclaim the view that justices are \u201cplatonic guardians appointed to wield authority according to their personal moral predilections.\u201d Rather, he claims:\n\nWhen Justices interpret the Constitution they speak for their community, not for themselves alone. The act of interpretation must be undertaken with full consciousness that it is, in a very real sense, the community\u2019s interpretation that is sought.\n\nBut the \u201ccommunity\u201d Brennan imagines is neither the community of citizens who adopted the constitutional provision nor the contemporary community of citizens.\n\nIndeed, Brennan shows how utterly illusory are the supposed \u201cconstraints\u201d on his own approach to constitutional \u201cinterpretation\u201d as he restates his position that \u201ccapital punishment is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d That position is incompatible with the original meaning of those constitutional provisions. Further, as Brennan acknowledges, \u201cit would seem [that] a majority of my fellow countrymen [do] not subscribe\u201d to that interpretation. So much for Brennan\u2019s phony claim of undertaking the \u201cact of interpretation \u2026 with full consciousness that it is, in a very real sense, the community\u2019s interpretation that is sought.\u201d", "description": "1985\u2014In a speech at Georgetown law school, Justice William J.
