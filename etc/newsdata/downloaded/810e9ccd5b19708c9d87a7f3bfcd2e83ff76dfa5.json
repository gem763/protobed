Specifically, Telegram stressed that the authority allegedly decided to do so because Telegram promised to reimburse its investors in case if TON does not launch by Oct. 31.\n\nThe filing reads:\n\n\u201cDespite the SEC knowing for 18 months that if the TON Blockchain did not launch by October 31, 2019, Telegram would be obligated under its agreements with private purchasers to return the funds it raised, the SEC (i) never requested that Telegram delay the launch of the TON Blockchain; (ii) never advised Telegram of its intention to seek injunctive relief; and (iii) waited until the eleventh hour to file an ex parte application to enjoin Telegram\u2019s launch.\u201d\n\nGram is \u201cmerely a currency or commodity\u201d\n\nIn the document, Telegram pushed back the U.S. securities regulator by claiming that its Gram token is not a security. The firm emphasized that Telegram already treated the Private Placement as a securities offering pursuant to valid exemptions to registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Once the TON blockchain launches, the grams will merely be a currency or commodity like gold or silver, but not a security, the firm wrote.\n\nTelegram is not an ICO\n\nTelegram also considered the ambiguity of Gram\u2019s connection with initial coin offering (ICO) products, stating that Telegram has never issued a security to the public through an ICO. Telegram explained that instead of doing an ICO-like product, the firm entered into private purchase agreements with a limited number of purchasers that provided the future payment of Gram currency. The firm wrote:\n\n\u201cUnlike other digital assets that were offered to the general public through so-called Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d), Telegram did not \u2014 and will never \u2014 offer any securities to the public through an ICO.\u201d\n\nWhile informing that court that Telegram has decided to delay the launch of the TON blockchain, the firm concluded that there is no need for the Court to enter a preliminary injunction in the filing.\n\nAs reported, in addition to declaring Gram token illegal, the SEC also issued a temporary restraining order on the issuance of Gram tokens, with a court hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.", "description": "Telegram responds to the SEC in a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, calling the SEC\u2019s injunction \u201can \u2018emergency\u2019 of its...", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvN2U1MWNjYmEzNmJkMWI2OGIyZTRkZmRmNDdmMDdlYWYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
