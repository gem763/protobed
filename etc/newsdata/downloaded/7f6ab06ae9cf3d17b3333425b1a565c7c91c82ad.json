Chief Executive Officer Peter Grosskopf said, sharing his company\u2019s investment strategy. If the bigger producers of the metal don\u2019t end up buying their smaller rivals, \u201cthe juniors will consolidate among themselves to create bigger companies,\u201d he said.\n\nGold miners may become attractive targets as the supply pipeline of their bigger rivals start running dry. Reserves still buried in mines owned by the largest producers have fallen by more than half from a 2011 peak, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nDetour Gold Corp. is an example of one those beaten-up companies and \u201csomebody missed that one as an acquisition candidate,\u201d Grosskopf said in an interview in New York Tuesday. In August, Sprott agreed to buy Tocqueville Asset Management\u2019s gold strategy business. Tocqueville owns a 4.6 per cent stake in Detour Gold.\n\nTocqueville had started investing in Detour Gold a few years ago when the miner was in bad shape, he said.\n\nDetour Gold shares have climbed 70 per cent this year after Paulson & Co. convinced shareholders of the mining company to overhaul its board of directors, including its interim CEO, ending a nasty six-month proxy battle.\n\nTorex Gold Resources Inc. is another attractive asset that could be a potential target, according to Sprott.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Gold miners may become attractive targets as the supply pipeline of their bigger rivals start running dry", "authors": ["Vinicy Chan", "Justina Vasquez", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gold-bars.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
