No.\n\nWhat did you think it would go for? I\u2019d been advised about $1.8 million.\n\nI was forced to pay the amount because the new purchaser refused to proceed with settlement until $35,000 was paid in full. \u2014 Vendor Jyotsna Field\n\nWhat was surprising about it?\n\nI had bought another property and the auction was scheduled for October 20, 2018. The other lot owner purchased my property through a buyers\u2019 agent and my agent and I only became aware of the identity of the purchaser at exchange of contracts on October 20. This did not present a problem for me as I was happy with the purchase price. I also had some concern about a new owner coming into a very difficult situation [between the existing owners]. It seemed the most satisfactory solution to have the other owner buy my property.\n\nI received a notice of a special levy for capital works of $35,000 on October 25, which had been raised on October 19, 2018 - the Friday before the scheduled auction.\n\nI was forced to pay the amount because the new purchaser refused to proceed with settlement until $35,000 was paid in full. Yet on exchange of contracts, the purchaser was now the owner of both lots, and as such, a strata arrangement was redundant.\n\nThe capital works fund belongs to the owners\u2019 corporation but, in this case, the owner of both lots simply requests the funds be transferred to them. The levy had been charged in accordance with applicable laws, but meant that even though I was no longer the owner of the land, I was forced to pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you not know that levy was in the works?\n\nThe strata report requested for inclusion in the contract of sale stated clearly that no further special levies were scheduled.\n\nWe had [previously] appointed a strata manager with a compulsory management order after a dispute between the two strata lot owners.\n\nThe compulsory management order gives the manager unfettered powers to make any decision they wish to make. In hindsight, I would have asked for limited powers rather than the manager being given the full powers of the owners\u2019 corporation.\n\nOurania: Ordinarily, the legislation requires a 10-year plan to be put in place for a capital works fund. Sometimes a special levy can be raised by the owners corporation voting on a levy in circumstances where there are insufficient funds to cover large capital works or emergency repairs. This may not be the case, however, where a compulsory manager has been appointed and unilaterally decides on the amount of the levy and capital works without consulting the owners corporation.\n\nJyotsna: The manager replied that she could make any necessary decisions. There was no official site visit to ascertain what capital works were necessary. The amount seems to have been an arbitrary amount. It seems the manager\u2019s decisions were based on the opinion of one lot owner. Yet the owners\u2019 corporation is supposed to be responsible for representing all lot owners.\n\nMy strata specialist lawyers and my conveyancing lawyer requested that the funds be quarantined until my application to NSW civil and administrative tribunal to have the levies refunded was heard. This was refused.\n\nIt [then] became apparent NCAT would not necessarily set aside the actions by the compulsory manager. I withdrew my application on the advice of my lawyers, because I could not afford the substantial costs of litigation and lodged a complaint with the Department of Fair Trading. I have just been informed that they found insufficient evidence to support allegations of a breach of conduct.\n\nDo you reckon we\u2019ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?\n\nI would hope never again in these circumstances. I would not like anyone to go through what I\u2019ve gone through.", "description": "A previous strata arrangement - and unhappy neighbour relationship - put this owner on the hook for a hefty bill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4c1406052e7af4619081c189a57e7a91e4516e2b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
