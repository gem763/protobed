Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMy brain goes through the exact same exercise around 5 p.m. every Dec. 31. As I don my tuxedo for a night of revelry \u2013 OK, fine, I\u2019m usually in sweatpants settling in for a night of board games \u2013 I reflect back on the year that was.\n\nOf course I think about fun family moments such as vacations, birthday parties and youth soccer goals, but I\u2019m primarily evaluating numbers: Did we move forward or backward? And by how much?\n\nI don\u2019t raise these queries out of greed. Instead I\u2019m trying to determine whether or not I\u2019m a liar. That's because at the beginning of every year, I declare a series of goals that can be quantified. And by New Year's Eve, I've either delivered on those promises or not.\n\nThe primary categories I evaluate my progress against include college fund deposits, health savings account (HSA) deposits, 401(k) deposits, charitable contributions, and savings account balances.\n\nThis list has changed drastically over the years. I used to focus on investment account balances, but I realized that was a giant mistake. Yes, the balances will eventually fund my goals, but I can\u2019t control their variable nature, so I was finding myself focusing on something I couldn\u2019t control \u2013 a practice as pointless and frustrating as me trying to elegantly wrap holiday gifts. So if my investment balances fall because of some significant global or domestic event, I\u2019ve made the decision to not care.\n\nBut while those accounts may go backward through no fault of our own, if a savings account goes backward, it\u2019s generally our doing. Therefore, I am willing to set a particular deposit goal with a savings account.\n\nWith that as background, it\u2019s worth revisiting the elements of effective financial goal-setting, especially as we reach the end of the year.\n\nBe declarative and use numbers\n\nI prefer to start with the phrase \u201cI will.\u201d I like its declarative nature. It doesn\u2019t hedge the way \u201cI\u2019d like to\u201d does. \u201cI\u2019d like to have zero debt\u201d pales in comparison to \u201cI will have zero debt.\"\n\nFive thousand dollars in savings, $6,500 deposited in investment account or zero dollars in credit-card debt are all better than saying subjective words like less, full or more. \u201cI will have less debt\u201d or \u201cI will have more savings\u201d leave you way too much wiggle room.\n\nDates are vital too. If you don\u2019t use them, you have an idea, not a goal. \u201cI will have $5,000\u201d is monumentally different than \u201cI will have $5,000 by Dec. 31.\u201d\n\nWhat's the purpose?\n\nRecently I began describing what accomplishing a goal will allow me to do. For instance, \"I will have $12,000 in my emergency fund by Dec. 31, and it will allow me to focus on saving for a down payment on a home, going forward.\u201d\n\nI highly recommend you adopt this add-on. It leads you to what\u2019s next. There\u2019s no resting on your laurels or keeping your future at bay. The time wasted between goals is very valuable time, ripe with momentum. Use it.\n\nStart early\n\nI\u2019m pulling the trigger early this year. Primarily because something funny happened last year. Well, it wasn't so much funny as it was an exercise in advanced face-palming. I had inadvertently forgotten to make a deposit. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever tried to make money immediately appear in an investment account at 5:15 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve, but it\u2019s impossible. And just like that, I was a liar in 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s how effective goal-setting works. Your declaration either will be your reality on the predetermined date, or it won't. There\u2019s no kinda. There\u2019s no sorta. And almost doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t know whether or not you accomplished a goal, you didn\u2019t. This sentiment scares people away from goal-setting, but those frozen in fear will never experience the glory of consistently hitting well-structured and meaningful goals.\n\nAs you set goals for 2019 and beyond, force your own hand. Set up a scenario in which, in the end, you\u2019re either a liar or you aren\u2019t. It\u2019s better than not knowing.\n\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: Million Dollar Plan. Have a question about money for Pete the Planner?
