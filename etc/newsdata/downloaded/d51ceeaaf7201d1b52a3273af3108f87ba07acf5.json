The judge noted that the state of Florida already has comprehensive health care laws in place, while Tampa has never substantively tried to regulate medicine, psychotherapy or mental health treatment.\n\n\u201cThe State, not localities, occupies this field,\u201d Jung wrote in a 41-page ruling that prevents Tampa from enforcing the ban.\n\nTampa\u2019s 2017 ordinance sought to prevent licensed therapists from counseling children with the goal of changing their gender expression or sexual orientation. Experts have said that the practice, also referred to as reparative therapy or sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE), is ineffective and potentially harmful for children.\n\nUnder the ordinance, Tampa therapists would have been fined $1,000 fine for a first offense of practicing conversion therapy and $5,000 for subsequent violations.\n\nJung argued that Florida\u2019s legislature hasn\u2019t given municipalities the authority to regulate health care. He added that there is nothing unique about Tampa that supports allowing statewide, uniform medical regulations to vary in the city.\n\n\u201cSubstantive regulation of psychotherapy is a state, not a municipal concern,\u201d Jung wrote.\n\nBut Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature doesn\u2019t appear interested in taking on the issue. Statewide bills to ban conversion therapy have died without getting hearings, the Daily Beast reported, so activists are instead trying to push the ban in counties, cities and municipalities.\n\nGetty Images Participants walk with a 100-foot rainbow flag during the Hillsborough Pride in Exile weekend celebration Aug. 13, 2005, in Key West, Florida.\n\nJung was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017. He was also tapped by President Barack Obama in 2016, but the Senate Judiciary Committee didn\u2019t vote on his nomination.\n\nConversion therapy has been banned in at least 20 other Florida communities, in 18 U.S. states, in Washington, D.C., and in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian law firm based in Orlando, challenged the Tampa ordinance on behalf of Robert Vazzo, a marriage and family therapist who practices SOCE counseling, and New Hearts Outreach, a Christian ministry that refers people to SOCE therapists. Vazzo claims that his version of SOCE is harmless because it is a voluntary, non-aversive therapy delivered through conversations.\n\nJudith Glassgold, director of professional affairs at the New Jersey Psychological Association, said that non-aversive conversion therapy can also be harmful, since patients report \u201csuicidality, hopelessness, increase in depression and anxiety, through rejecting and inaccurate stereotypic information and interactions, as well as false promises of change.\u201d\n\nShe also pointed out that Tampa\u2019s ban applied to minors, which means it would be impossible for Vazzo\u2019s child patients to give informed consent.\n\n\u201cYoung children cannot understand what is happening to them,\u201d Glassgold told HuffPost. \u201cThe judge did not address this very important issue and actually made a decision that ignored the government\u2019s (at any level) obligation to protect children from harm, which is the crux of the law.\u201d\n\nIn February, a federal magistrate judge recommended that Tampa\u2019s ordinance be partially blocked because it violates therapists\u2019 First Amendment rights to free speech. Jung did not discuss this point in his opinion, instead hinging the ruling on jurisdiction issues. The case could now head to an appellate court.\n\nLiberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver said that the ruling \u201cdooms\u201d similar bans in Florida and around the country.\n\n\u201cRegulating healthcare is above the pay grade of local municipalities,\u201d Staver said in a statement. \u201cThis ruling also shows clearly why the other statewide laws will meet the same fate as Tampa. The First Amendment will wipe away every one of these speech-restrictive laws.\u201d\n\nCaroline Mala Corbin, an expert on the First Amendment\u2019s speech and religion clauses at the University of Miami School of Law, said that Jung\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t binding on other district courts. She pointed out that earlier this year, the southern district of Florida had upheld Palm Beach County\u2019s conversion therapy ban.\n\n\u201cOf course, courts could adopt [Jung\u2019s] reasoning and strike down local bans on preemption grounds,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cBut they could also ignore this decision, especially because it is based on one court\u2019s interpretation of Florida law and the Florida Constitution.\u201d\n\nEdward Linsmier via Getty Images Speakers promoting equal rights for the LGBTQ community speak at the National Republican Convention on Aug. 27, 2012, near downtown Tampa.\n\nIn his opinion, Jung spent some time citing reports that there wasn\u2019t enough research on SOCE to definitively claim that this kind of therapy has a negative effect on minors. He referred to a 2009 American Psychological Association Task Force report, which he said concluded that \u201cno study to date has demonstrated adequate scientific rigor to provide a clear picture of the prevalence or frequency of either beneficial or harmful SOCE outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis illustrates the complex and dynamic subject matter of human gender and sexual preference,\u201d Jung wrote. \u201cTampa\u2019s lay attempt at psychotherapy regulation crowds into this very complex, evolving area.\u201d\n\nGlassgold, who served as the APA task force\u2019s chair, argued that Jung ignored the report\u2019s key findings.\n\n\u201cThe Report conclusively found that there is no evidence that conversion therapy is effective, so that it is pointless and harmful to offer this treatment to patients, especially minors,\u201d Glassgold told HuffPost.\n\nGlassgold said that studies have demonstrated that adults are harmed by conversion therapy of all types. Research on minors would be unethical to do because of this risk of harm, she added.\n\n\u201cThe foundation ethical requirement for any healthcare practice, including mental health care practice, is \u2018Do no harm,\u2019\u201d Glassgold said. \u201cThere is no need to even risk one case of harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would any therapist offer a treatment that is ineffective and potentially harmful?\u201d she asked.", "description": "The judge argued that the Florida city didn't have the legal authority to ban therapy to change someone's sexual orientation or gender expression.", "authors": ["Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d18ec20000027064fafa5.jpeg?cache=uzvir5hh1z&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
