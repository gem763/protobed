AI-related applications grew to about 3,800 in 2018 from roughly 3,200 in 2017 and about 1,900 in 2014. Figures for 2019 haven\u2019t been released.\n\nApplications last year included smart software and other tools related to machine learning, neural networks and AI-enabled learning methods, according to the agency. Most are being filed by large companies, with roughly 40% coming from applicants based in California, agency data shows.\n\nThe patent office is grappling with the broader issue of whether an AI system can be recognized as the inventor of a product.\n\nU.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios, speaking at a recent AI forum in Washington, said the country has roughly 2,000 AI companies, including 17 of 32 global AI startups valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nLarge companies are acquiring AI firms \u201cbecause the technology has reached a state where it can provide significant benefits,\u201d said Michael McLaughlin, a research analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology policy group. The number of such acquisitions has increased every year since 2012, he said, growing to 191 last year from 17 in 2012\u2014with U.S. firms accounting for 68% of global AI acquisitions.\n\nThe increases reflect an upswing in world-wide AI spending, according to estimates by technology research company International Data Corp. Led by software, global spending on AI is projected to hit $35.8 billion this year, up 44% from 2018, and is expected to more than double to $79.2 billion by 2022, IDC estimates.\n\nThe U.S. federal government\u2019s fiscal-year budget for 2020 requested $973.5 million for unclassified, nondefense AI R&D. In addition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is part of the Defense Department, last year announced a $2 billion initiative to develop AI technologies.\n\nRitu Jyoti, IDC\u2019s global lead for AI, said the technology offers large organizations\u2014including the patent office\u2014an opportunity to improve operational efficiencies, boost customer services, cut costs and drive revenue.\n\nAll that activity is boosting demand for skilled AI workers. Mr. Iancu said the patent office has received many job applications from a diverse group of candidates. He said the agency\u2019s strategy is to pitch its core mission of supporting innovation.\n\nFor the right person at the right point in their career, he added, \u201cwe can offer a unique opportunity to make a real, long-lasting difference for the country and our innovation economy.\u201d\n\nThe agency expects to fill the post by next week.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is expanding its use of artificial intelligence to tackle steadily growing patent applications, including an influx of AI-related filings.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FF393_IancuA_SOC_20191015161415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
