The municipality introduced an incentive called the \u2018baby bonus\u2019: any resident who gave birth would be entitled to \u20ac10,000, paid over 10 years.\n\nIt\u2019s taken off: nearly 60 children have since been born in the municipality. Compared to the prior seven years in which only 38 children were born, the new babies are a big boost to this village of fewer than 800 people.\n\nBaby bonus recipients Jukka-Pekka Tuikka, 50, and his wife Janika, 48, work as entrepreneurs in the agricultural industry. Their second daughter, Janette, was born in 2013, just in time to earn herself a playful nickname: \u2018ten-thousand-euro girl\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe had been planning a second child for some time and were getting older,\u201d Tuikka explains, \u201cso I can\u2019t say that money really influenced our decision to have a baby.\u201d Still, Tuikka considers the incentive an important measure which shows that local leaders are interested in offering a helping hand to families. Tuikka has saved most of the \u20ac6,000 his family has received so far, and plans to use it in a way that benefits them all in the future.", "description": "Across Europe, birth rates are dropping.
