Senior euro zone officials were neutral to positive this week to the plan presented by their Greek peer.\n\nMitsotakis visited Germany, France and the Netherlands in recent weeks to appeal to his European counterparts to support his campaign and also invest in Greece.\n\nThe prime minister is also expected during Saturday's speech to reiterate a government plan to revive a stalled gold mine project.\n\nOther initiatives that the government is keen to accelerate include a long-delayed tourist investment at a disused Athens airport and the sale of a stake at Greece's biggest oil refinery Hellenic Petroleum (AT: ).", "description": "Greek PM set to outline tax cuts, structural reforms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF860FY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
