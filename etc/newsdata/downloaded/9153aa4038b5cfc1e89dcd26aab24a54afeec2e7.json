Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHe ripped the ball into right field \u2014 and helped send Washington into the next round of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cJust get a base hit to the middle,\u201d Soto said to TBS in a postgame interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nSoto\u2019s hard-hit single rolled under the glove of Brewers right fielder Trent Grisham, and three runs scored on the eighth-inning play, pushing the Nationals to a 4-3 comeback win over visiting Milwaukee in the National League wild-card game Tuesday night.\n\nWashington advances to face the Los Angeles Dodgers, who will host Game 1 of the National League Division Series on Thursday night. The Nationals went 3-4 against the Dodgers during the regular season.\n\nFor most of the evening, it looked as though the Brewers would head west to Los Angeles.\n\nMilwaukee scored three runs in the first two innings and held on to a 3-1 edge entering the bottom of the eighth. Brewers manager Craig Counsell brought in Hader (0-1), a hard-throwing southpaw who notched 37 saves this season.\n\nHader quickly found trouble. Michael A. Taylor took first with one out after umpires ruled that he was hit by a pitch, although replays indicated that the ball may have hit the knob of his bat before striking him on the hand.\n\nOne out later Ryan Zimmerman followed with a broken-bat single, and Anthony Rendon drew a walk on a full count to load the bases for Soto.\n\n\u201cThe hit by pitch, I\u2019d have to look at it again,\u201d Brewers manager Craig Counsell said to TBS. \u201cI didn\u2019t really catch a good glimpse of it. Our dugout seemed to think it hit the bat first.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the game, Yasmani Grandal and Eric Thames homered for the Brewers. A promising campaign ended abruptly for Milwaukee, which won 89 games \u2014 including 18 of its final 23 contests \u2014 before the late-inning collapse.\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg (1-0) earned the victory after pitching three scoreless innings of relief. He gave up two hits, walked none and struck out four.\n\nDaniel Hudson notched the save by pitching a scoreless ninth for the Nationals. He and Strasburg followed starter Max Scherzer, who gave up three runs in five innings and left the mound with the Nationals\u2019 postseason hopes in doubt.\n\n\u201cThese guys are amazing,\u201d Soto said of the Nationals\u2019 pitching staff. \u201cThey always go to compete. They never give up. They show us how to never give up, so we just keep going and fight.\u201d\n\nHader allowed three runs (two earned) on two hits and a walk in one inning. He struck out two.\n\nThe Brewers jumped to a 2-0 lead before recording their first out at the plate. Grisham drew a leadoff walk, and Grandal yanked a first-pitch fastball over the wall in right field for his third career postseason home run.\n\nThe quick strike stunned the Nationals home fans, who had just settled into their seats. Grandal was 1-for-13 with seven strikeouts against Scherzer in regular-season matchups before belting the two-run homer into the Washington bullpen.\n\nIn the second, Milwaukee increased its lead to 3-0 on a leadoff shot by Thames. He pounded a low breaking ball an estimated 411 feet to right-center field for his first career postseason homer.\n\nThe Nationals pulled within 3-1 in the third on Trea Turner\u2019s solo homer. He squared up a 97 mph fastball for his first postseason blast off Brewers starter Brandon Woodruff. The right-hander threw four innings and gave up one run and two hits, striking out three without a walk.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Washington Nationals rookie Juan Soto tracked a pitch from Milwaukee Brewers closer Josh Hader and quickly recognized a fastball down the middle of the plate.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436116175&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9109S-OCASP"}
