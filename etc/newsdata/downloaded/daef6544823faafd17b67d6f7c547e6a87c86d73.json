The drop erased this year\u2019s gain and lowered the gauge\u2019s valuation to the weakest since March, before the kingdom\u2019s stocks were included in MSCI Inc.\u2019s emerging-market gauge. Equities in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain retreated at least 0.4%.\n\nThis is a \u201cvery tense situation,\u201d elevating risk in the region \u201cto unprecedented levels,\u201d said Mohammed Ali Yasin, the chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attack cut production in half and the biggest on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure since Iraq under Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles into the kingdom during the first Gulf War. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who\u2019ve launched several drone attacks on Saudi targets in the past, claimed responsibility for the assault on Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq plant, one of the world\u2019s largest crude-processing facilities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in a tweet blamed Iran directly, but didn\u2019t offer any evidence. Iran denied responsibility for the attacks.\n\nWhile the incident won\u2019t derail Aramco\u2019s initial public offering, it may impact the company\u2019s valuation, according to the Eurasia Group. \u201cCrown Prince Mohammad bin Salman will push the company to demonstrate that it can effectively tackle terrorism or war challenges,\u201d said analysts led by Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research.\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nHelping Hand?\n\nThe main index recovered about half its losses within the first hour of trading, a sign government funds may be limiting the decline.\n\nTadawul traded 1.3% lower as of 10:57 a.m in Riyadh\n\nSabic dropped as much as 5% to the weakest since late 2016\n\nAl Rajhi curbed its decline to 1.7%, poised for the lowest level since January\n\n\u201cBeing Sunday, foreigner participation may not be in full swing, and that should help government funds intervene more effectively,\u201d Joice Mathew, the head of equity research at United Securities in Muscat. Their support \u201ccould be identified if we see any sharp recoveries in first 90 minutes of trading,\u201d he said.", "description": "Saudi Arabian stocks sank after drone strikes highlighted the vulnerability of the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities to terror attacks.", "authors": ["Filipe Pacheco"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8096/4d10d52016fc44b4afa30eaf6634f43b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
