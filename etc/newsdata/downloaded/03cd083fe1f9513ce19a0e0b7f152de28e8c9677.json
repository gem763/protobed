Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to break them up.\n\n\u201cThe lack of trust in a brand, if it goes to the heart of its business model, is really going to affect a brand,\u201d said Charles Trevail, global chief executive at Interbrand.\n\nFacebook declined to comment.\n\nDeclining relevance and rising competition also hurt, which is partly how Interbrand explains Gillette\u2019s 18% brand-value drop this year, sinking to 37th place from 28th.\n\nGillette, a Procter & Gamble Co. brand that peaked at 13 on Interbrand\u2019s list in 2009 and 2010, tried to improve its appeal to young people this year with moves like an ad campaign taking on \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and a new heated razor under the name GilletteLabs.\n\nP&G said it focuses on sales growth and the number of people using its brands. The company\u2019s grooming business expanded organic sales in the year through June 30 and gained 15 million new users globally, a P&G spokeswoman said, adding that Gillette has the top market share in the U.S. and holds a more than 65% share of the male blades and razors market world-wide.\n\nMarketers don\u2019t treat outside rankings like Interbrand\u2019s as solid financial data, but do keep an eye on the results.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cIt is an outside-in view of how this community, this portion of the marketplace is looking at us,\u201d said Jeff Hansen, general manager of brand strategy at Microsoft Corp., which Interbrand said boosted its brand value 17% to $108.8 billion to remain at No. 4. \u201cAnd then complementing our own proprietary research and insights we do\u2014It\u2019s often nice to have a separate methodology and data points to complement our own insights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exact valuation they come up with is not something I really focus on,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. \u201cI do think how much are we increasing or decreasing in a given year against many others is interesting.\u201d\n\nAmazon remained in third place on Interbrand\u2019s rankings, behind No. 1 Apple Inc. and No. 2 Google. But Amazon\u2019s brand value rose more quickly, by 24% to $125.3 billion. Disney moved to No. 10 from No. 14 with an 11% increase in brand value to $44.4 billion.\n\n\u201cThe companies that are doing well are the ones that are making big bets,\u201d Mr. Trevail said, citing Disney\u2019s streaming-video service arriving next month as an example.\n\nLuxury and retail brands made up the fastest-rising sector for the second year in a row, Interbrand said.\n\nRaja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard Inc., said reports like this help marketers evaluate their brands in a wider context than usual. Interbrand said Mastercard\u2019s brand value rose 25% to $9.4 billion.\n\n\u201cMost studies you do about your brand are in the context of who you think are your competing brands and how you are doing,\u201d Mr. Rajamannar said. \u201cEveryone collectively is fighting for consumers\u2019 hearts and minds, not just in your categories.\u201d He added: \u201cSo these kinds of external studies cutting across categories are also helpful for us.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com", "description": "Facebook slid again in a new report on the world\u2019s most valuable brands, while the famous names of Amazon.com and Walt Disney gained.", "authors": ["Nat Ives", "Nat.Ives Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117669/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
