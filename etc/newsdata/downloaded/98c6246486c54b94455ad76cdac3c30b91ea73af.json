As a result, some are now looking at legal actions where no such duty of care is needed, such as misleading and deceptive conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe class actions usually settle. Professor Harris thinks this could be because, having seen \u201cthe embarrassment\u201d PwC experienced in the Centro litigation in 2012, \u201cthe firms don\u2019t want the scrutiny\u201d of court.", "description": "A major class action against big four firm PwC has stalled, pending a judgment in a case involving Deloitte that could end the growing trend of class actions against auditors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/405a750477ca282e3cc34c1b9e7277fc1e854992", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
