(Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\n\n\nWhether you think it rises to the level of an impeachable offense, can we all agree that what President Trump did was profoundly wrong? He pressured a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent. This is very different from the Russia investigation, which was at its core about whether, as a candidate, Trump had colluded with the Kremlin. In the case of Ukraine, the president is accused of using the awesome power of the United States \u2014 power that could make a life-or-death difference for Ukraine \u2014 to serve his personal political gain.\n\nSadly, this is part of a pattern of violations of democratic norms \u2014 and perhaps laws. The Mueller report reveals that Trump actively sought to curtail or end the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Trump has allegedly dangled pardons for officials who might break the law in carrying out his immigration agenda. He has repeatedly lambasted the investigative agencies of government or, even worse, pressured them to investigate his political opponents. He has ignored congressional subpoenas and refused to turn over documents, including his tax returns, and he has enriched his businesses through his position. He has attacked the judicial branch and the media, often calling the latter \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nTrump is a particularly egregious example, but his misbehavior fits a global trend. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson engaged in a political maneuver \u2014 suspending Parliament \u2014 that the nation\u2019s high court unanimously ruled was \u201cunlawful.\u201d Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken and governed in ways that have terrified his country\u2019s minorities and eroded its secular culture. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has praised extrajudicial killings. And leaders such as Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Viktor Orban of Hungary have managed to change the constitution to assist in one-party \u2014 or one-man \u2014 rule.\n\n\n\nMany scholars and writers have chronicled the \u201cdemocratic recession,\u201d but it remains unclear why this is happening in so many places. Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk have compiled data showing that across the globe, enthusiasm for autocrats has grown. Between 1995 and 2014, there were large increases in the share of people who would like to see \u201ca strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections,\u201d growing by nearly 10 percentage points in the United States, almost 20 points in Spain and South Korea, and around 25 points in Russia and South Africa.\n\nWhy is this? The best I can guess is that we are living in times of great change \u2014 economic, technological, demographic, cultural \u2014 and in this swirl, people feel insecure and anxious. They believe that existing institutions, elites or established ideologies are not serving them well. Of 27 democracies surveyed by the Pew Research Center (if you consider Russia and Hungary democracies), a majority in 21 countries say they see little change regardless of who wins an election. So people are open to supporting populist leaders who play on their fears, seize on scapegoats and promise to take decisive action on their behalf.\n\nAdd to this the rising reality of tribal politics \u2014 the sense that each of us is on a team and that our team is always in the right. Tribalism is the enemy of institutions, norms and the rule of law. After all, the whole point of the rule of law is that it applies to everyone, friend and foe. In a recent book, \u201cWhen Crime Pays,\u201d Milan Vaishnav showed that politicians who have been charged with a crime are more likely to win elections in India. In tribal politics, people actually celebrate leaders who break the law because they supposedly do so to help their tribe.\n\nPolitical parties used to act as gatekeepers and norm-setters, keeping out populists and demagogues and forcing their members to adhere to certain rules. But parties are old-fashioned institutions, unable to stay strong in an age of entrepreneurial politics. Politicians can now raise money and gain a following through direct appeals to the public, using social media to exploit the very anger and emotion that parties often used to moderate.\n\nThe key enabler of American populism has been the Republican Party. The movement\u2019s rise began with Newt Gingrich\u2019s assault on the old Republican Party of George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole, which Gingrich pilloried as weak and accommodationist. It is further enabled today by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who was willing to violate norms on something as important as a Supreme Court nomination simply to serve the Republican agenda.\n\nIn his 1960 study of American politics, Clinton Rossiter declared: \u201cNo America without democracy, no democracy without politics, no politics without parties, no parties without compromise and moderation.\u201d American democracy today desperately needs the GOP to uphold democracy rather than feast on its destruction.\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The \u201cdemocratic recession\u201d is deepening under populist leaders such as Boris Johnson, Modi, Duterte, Erdogan and Orban.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHTHiy.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1379&y=1066"}
