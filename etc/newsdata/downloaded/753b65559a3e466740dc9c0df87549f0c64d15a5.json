The Houston-Bush Intercontinental Airport reported that it was at a full ground stop as of 9:30 a.m. local time. In an 11 a.m. update, the airport said its terminals and concessions remained open, but streets surrounding the airport were flooded. An FAA update said the airport was expected to remain closed until Friday afternoon. All city bus and train service was halted. City officials said in an afternoon news conference that the situation in Houston was improving, but still urged caution. By 3 p.m., the rate of rainfall had slowed to about half an inch per hour, Mayor Sylvester Turner said. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office reported it had fielded calls for 133 high water rescues in the Houston area before noon. Most of the emergency phone calls in Houston were for stranded drivers, officials said. \u201cEveryone is going to have to exercise a high degree of patience,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cEven though it may not be raining as much, it doesn\u2019t mean the water is going to quickly subside\u201d Corrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly spelled Hamshire, Texas as Hampshire.
