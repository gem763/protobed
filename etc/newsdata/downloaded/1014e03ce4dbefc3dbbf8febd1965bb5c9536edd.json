It resembles climate change plans offered by other Democratic candidates but is more aggressive in setting the earliest deadline \u2014 2045 \u2014 to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire U.S. economy.\n\nThe Steyer plan is \u201cjustice-centered,\u201d meaning it targets social justice issues and job creation in low-income communities while eliminating the use of fossil fuels.\n\nMs. Jones said the plan would not leave out workers in the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\u201cWorkers employed in the fossil fuel industries possess critical skills and experience that we will need to rapidly decarbonize our economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey and others have a significant role to play, and Tom\u2019s plan reflects a commitment to making sure the work of tomorrow is safer and better paying than the work of today.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
