The biggest was the Kincade Fire, in Sonoma County north of San Francisco, which burned quickly through 85 square miles, powered by winds that reached 100 miles per hour, and forced the evacuation of 180,000 as it approached Santa Rosa, which had burned just two years ago in the Tubbs Fire, which killed 22. In Southern California, also on Sunday, the Tick Fire burned 4,615 acres in Los Angeles County; then, on Sunday night, what was called the Getty Fire broke out at 2 a.m. along the 405 freeway, burning at least 400 acres and forcing the sudden evacuation of 3,300 homes. \u201cGet out when we say get out,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti said at an emergency early morning press conference. Some residents had only 15 minutes to escape.\n\nIf the phrase \u201cGetty Fire\u201d rings a bell for you, it should \u2014 the same area burned in 2017, in a fire (called the Skirball fire) which broke out in almost the same spot, eventually threatening Rupert Murdoch\u2019s California home among other Bel Air estates. Fires used to sweep through even the most vulnerable communities just once a generation; they are now striking, in some places, every other year, intensifying fears, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, \u201cthat parts of California could become almost dangerous to inhabit.\u201d This time, LeBron James was among the evacuated, tweeting, at not quite 4 a.m. local time:\n\nMan these LA \ud83d\udd25 aren\u2019t no joke. Had to emergency evacuate my house and I\u2019ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms. No luck so far! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 28, 2019\n\nAnother severe wind event was forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday; the state\u2019s embattled power utility PG&E warned that it could impact 32 counties across the state. Last week, 25 million Californians were under wildfire warning \u2014 ready to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nBut thanks to a protracted quiet period throughout the summer and early fall, the total damage from this year\u2019s wildfires \u2014 barring a catastrophic late fall \u2014 will be barely a tenth of 2018\u2019s total, and less than a quarter of 2017\u2019s. And yet, as a measure of just how totally unprepared even the country\u2019s wealthy, green liberal paradise is to deal with the brutality of even today\u2019s amount of climate change, California is entirely overwhelmed this year, too. I mean, just look at this photo, taken outside Vallejo:\n\nOr this one:\n\nThis looks apocalyptic--dramatic situation unfolding near a lot of structures in #Vallejo right now.

Cell-phone communications were disabled, too, Southern California Edison warned that 300,000 in that region could face preventive blackouts in the week ahead. Vallejo had to declare a \u201cwater emergency\u201d \u2014 unable to pump the necessary water to fight the fire engulfing it because of the power shutdown designed to prevent the outbreak of fire.\n\nOn Sunday, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide \u201cstate of emergency,\u201d mobilizing \u201cevery available resource\u201d to fight the wildfires. But when the winds are this strong \u2014 predicted to be 60 to 70 mph in Northern California at midweek, and as fast as 75 mph in the southern part of the state \u2014 no amount of resources are enough. As the environmental historian Mike Davis told me in the spring, \u201cNo one will ever be honest about this, but firefighters have never stopped a wildfire powered by Santa Ana winds. All you can hope for is that the wind will change.\u201d Garcetti told me, \u201cThere\u2019s no number of helicopters or trucks that we can buy, no number of firefighters that we can have, no amount of brush that we can clear that will stop this. The only thing that will stop this is when the Earth, probably long after we\u2019re gone, relaxes into a more predictable weather state.\u201d\n\nThe pattern held this weekend. On Sunday, the Kincade Fire roughly doubled in size, the Chronicle reports, \u201cdespite the numerous air tankers, dozens of bulldozers and more than 350 engine crews hopscotching across the region in an effort to get the upper hand.\u201d Rather than making progress, the firefighters lost ground, the fire dropping from 10 percent contained to 5 percent. \u201cWhen this fire decides to make a run and the winds push it,\u201d the Sonoma County fire chief told the paper, \u201cyou can\u2019t win.\u201d Early Monday morning, as if to mock even the pretense that this landscape could be controlled, an earthquake hit Sonoma just a few miles from the Kincade Fire, which still raged.
