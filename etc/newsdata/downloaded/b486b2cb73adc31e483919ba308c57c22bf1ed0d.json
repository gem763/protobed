But his parents made a promise to God that if he recovered, they would allow a piece of his hair to grow forever uncut, something they also promised for Diego. The practice, called a \"promesa,\" is commonly associated with Mexican Catholocism, according to the Catholic News Agency.\n\nFOOTBALL COACH FIRED FOR DEFYING SCHOOL PRAYER BAN COULD GET SECOND SHOT AT LEGAL BATTLE\n\nRev. Thomas L. Goodwin of the Immaculate Conception Parish in Skidmore wrote a letter confirming that Pedro, the boys' father, \"made a religious promise to the Blessed Mother - Our Lady of San Juan that he would not cut the hair of his children...this promise should be respected by the school system as part of religious devotion and faith.\"\n\nPublic school officials said the brothers' hair is a violation of the district's dress code, which forbids long hair for males. However, the school district granted them an exemption from kindergarten to sixth grade. Upon entering seventh grade, the boys found out they were no longer allowed to participate in all University Interscholastic Leave (UIL) interschool competition and clubs.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable to keep children from doing what they love because of their religious beliefs,\u201d said Alvarado. \u201cMathis ISD should follow the law and respect these students\u2019 religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe court announced it will issue a more \"detailed order\" soon.
