They had become increasingly confrontational and angry with everyone since the murder of one of their own, Elijah Dornelly in May 2017; they were engaged in a turf war with a number of other local groups of youths, in particular over the relevant period they were in conflict with another grouping known as Priory Court.\n\n\"It can be inferred from where they went to avenge this attack, that Ul-Haq and his Mali Boy associates presumed that this was an attack upon them by Priory Court. This clearly provided additional fuel to their anger and lent a particularly personal quality to the revenge motive for their actions on 14 March 2018.\"\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "It's alleged Hamza Ul Haq, 21, Loic Nengese, 19, and a 16-year-old boy murdered Joseph William-Torres in the belief he was their nemesis Samuel Hunter", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Central News", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749849.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-cnl_-J_W_Torres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
