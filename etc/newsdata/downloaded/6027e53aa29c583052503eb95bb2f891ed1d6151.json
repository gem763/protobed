He was always thought to be hiding in the borderlands between Iraq and Syria in the heart of the Islamic State\u2019s former caliphate, or religious state.\n\nThe dominant group in Idlib is a jihadist organization called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, formerly known as the Nusra Front, which was linked to Al Qaeda. They and ISIS are rivals so it would be surprising if Mr. Baghdadi were hiding in Idlib. But hundreds of ISIS fighters fleeing Iraq and northeastern Syria are believed to be hiding in the northwest, some even joining their former Qaeda rivals, so analysts said it is possible Mr. Baghdadi found refuge with them.\n\nThe Islamic State has not had a significant presence in Idlib for many years since they were chased out of northwest Syria by angry rebels.\n\nAn American official said on Saturday night that senior military officials had decided that, with American forces largely withdrawing from Syria, commandos should take action quickly to try to kill or capture senior terrorists in northwest Syria before the United States lost that ability.\n\nMr. Baghdadi, the cunning and enigmatic black-clad leader of the Islamic State, transformed a flagging insurgency into a global terrorist network that drew tens of thousands of recruits from 100 countries.\n\nHe has been the target of a yearslong, international manhunt that consumed the intelligence services of at least four different countries, and is believed to hew to extreme security measures, even when meeting with his most-trusted associates.\n\nMuch of the world first learned of Mr. Baghdadi in 2014, when his men overran one-third of Iraq and half of neighboring Syria and declared the territory a caliphate, claiming to revive the Muslim theocracy that ended with the fall of the Ottoman Empire.", "description": "The identity of the target was not confirmed but President Trump was scheduled to make a statement on Sunday morning.", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Maggie Haberman", "Rukmini Callimachi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/us/politics/26dc-raid2/26dc-raid2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
