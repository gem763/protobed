Congenital melanocytic nevus is a skin condition characterized by an \u201cabnormally dark\u201d patch on the body, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. People with the illness are at high risk for developing melanoma, according to the department.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to remove it,\u201d Carol told Inside Edition. \u201cThat can turn to cancer, also because of the bullying and stuff we are going through when we go out. People saying bad things about it.\u201d\n\nBaby Born with Rare Skin Condition Will Have Batman-Shaped Face Patch Removed More\n\nCarol was \u201cshocked\u201d when she gave birth to Luna in March and saw the dark patch covering a large portion of the little girl\u2019s face, she told WPLG. She began looking into options for treatment after doctors in the U.S. recommended that Luna undergo several surgeries over the next four years.\n\n\u201cWe saw a lot of doctors. We went to Boston, Chicago, and New York trying to find a better result,\u201d she told WPLG.\n\nSoon a doctor from Russia contacted the desperate mother: \u201cHe said, \u2018Come here. I can do something they don\u2019t do in the USA.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRELATED: This 6-Year-Old Boy Has a Disease So Rare Doctors Say He Is the First to Have It\n\nThe Russian surgeon, Dr. Pavel Borisovich Popov, will perform up to eight surgeries over the course of 18 months, according to SWNS. Carol and Luna will travel to Russia while Carol\u2019s husband, Thiago Tavares, stays behind in Florida, she said.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks I\u2019m crazy to go to Russia, but I have done a lot of research and gained advice from several doctors and I really think that this is the best option for Luna right now,\u201d she told SWNS. \u201cIt will be a huge relief if it works for Luna. I don\u2019t want her to get bullied. People ask if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contagious and say really mean things.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe page set up in April to cover the family\u2019s travel and Luna\u2019s medical expenses has raised nearly $40,000.\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Luna,\u201d begins the page, which is written from Luna\u2019s perspective. \u201cI\u2019m 4 months old. I was born with a rare disease that affects 1.5% of the world population called Congenital Melanotic Nevus.\u201c\n\n\u201cPeople like me with large moles get more than their fair share of looks, stares, whispers, and finger-pointing,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cIt is heartbreaking for my parents and it can have a devastating effect on me as I grow up. I need your help because I want to be a normal kid and have a normal life.\u201d", "description": "Baby Will Have 'Batman' Face Patch Removed", "authors": ["Char Adams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ezi4_0UG7aqDCRbSvIAU1A--~B/aD0xMTk5O3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/85851b78093321d7dd40e3d579db2236", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
