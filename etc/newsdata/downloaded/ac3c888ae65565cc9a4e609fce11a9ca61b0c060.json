Now, with each thunderous stride on the track, she makes it. And on a balmy desert night she summoned up a performance of shock and awe to become the first British female sprinter to win a world championship title.\n\nThis was not so much a race as a 91-step exhibition of Asher-Smith\u2019s staggering athletic talents. The usual rocketing start. Then a bend so geometrically perfect it could have been drawn by a compass. And, finally, grace and power right to the finish. Long before she crossed the line in 21.88 sec \u2013 a time that lowered her own national record \u2013 gold was in the bag.\n\nDina Asher-Smith already preparing for Olympic success after gold in Doha Read more\n\nThen, after a little jig of joy, the scale of her accomplishment began to hit, and her eyes began to water. \u201cNormally I am so chatty and full of energy, but I am lost for words,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody keeps saying world champion, world title, but it hasn\u2019t sunk in and honestly I don\u2019t think it ever will. I have dreamed of this and now it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nSuch was Asher-Smith\u2019s symphony of destruction that her nearest rivals, the US silver medallist Brittany Brown, who ran 22.22sec, and the Swiss athlete Mujinga Kambundji, who claimed bronze in 22.51, were barely in her slipstream. The champagne, however, will be put on ice until after the 4x100m relay final on Saturday.\n\nIt is 15 years since Asher-Smith was persuaded to do her first cross-country race at primary school and hated it. Halfway round she nearly stopped \u2013 only for her parents to promise her an ice cream if she kept going. She ended up finishing fifth out of 400 and a glorious track and field career was born.\n\nAfter Wednesday night\u2019s win she paid tribute to her coach, John Blackie, who has known her since she was eight \u2013 and knew, even then, that she was a little bit special. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the fastest when I was younger, but I worked so hard with my coach John,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cThat we\u2019re champions together means so much to me.\u201d\n\nThere were also the warmest of words for her father, Winston, and her mother, Julie, who have proudly followed her journey through windswept local athletics tracks to arenas around the world. \u201cMy mum and dad have been to every single one. English schools. National athletics league. Junior competitions. All the way through to the world championships and Olympics.\u201d\n\nShe knows that next year\u2019s Olympics will be tougher \u2013 especially as the world\u2019s best 200m runner, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, was unable to compete here because of scheduling clashes with her favourite event, the 400m. But Asher-Smith\u2019s achievements in Doha should not be played down. Her 200m time was so fast it would have won 13 of the 17 world championships.\n\n\u201cObviously you want to run in front of a stacked field but at the same time a world title is a world title,\u201d said Asher-Smith, who looked back to her first moment on the world stage when she won 200m and 4x100m relay golds at the European Junior Championships in 2013.\n\n\u201cI would say to that Dina, just go and do well because you\u2019re never going to be as nervous as you are right then and now. I even thought about that tonight. When I started to get a bit nervous I reminded myself that I was never going to be that young, unprepared or inexperienced again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after setting a new PB in the shot.

True, she is still a significant underdog against the reigning Olympic and world champion, Nafi Thiam. But the Briton has certainly done enough to make her great rival sweat overnight after posting her best-ever first-day score of 4,138 points.\n\nJohnson-Thompson made a superb start, running a personal best of 13.09sec in the 100m hurdles and following it up with a 1.95m high jump. But it was the shot put, so long her bete noire, where she really struck a significant blow. After two throws that barely scraped over 12 metres, suddenly all the moving parts clicked as she threw her final attempt 13.86m \u2013 an enormous personal best by 71cm. No wonder there was a fist pump and a smile. A season\u2019s best 23.08sec in the 200m ensured she ended day one with a healthy lead.\n\nThe question now is can she maintain it in the long jump, javelin and 800m? If she can match her personal bests in those events she will score over 7,000 \u2013 and that might be too much even for the great Thiam. \u201cThat\u2019s a great day,\u201d Johnson-Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019ve got another day to negotiate tomorrow but I\u2019m in a good position.\u201d\n\nElsewhere Laura Muir got her 1500m off to a reliably solid start, with no sign of the calf tear that had kept her off the track from late July to early September, as she cruised through her opening heat. However the reigning world indoor hurdle champion, Andrew Pozzi, was unable to put an injury-hit season behind him as he crashed out of the 110m hurdles after finishing fifth in his semi-final. He could only watch as the American Grant Holloway produced a shock in the final, winning gold in 13.10sec after the Jamaican Omar McLeod tripped.", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith powered into history as she became the first female British sprinter to win a 100m or 200m World Athletics Championships title", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe7a238b12a70d17e3f1332ff0c3e44ee990b19/161_251_4141_2484/master/4141.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a5f2c2398f9d53f3cf75143e184876db"}
