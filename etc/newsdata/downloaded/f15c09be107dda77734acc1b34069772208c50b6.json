In particular, Australian (-11%), Chinese (-10%) and German (-6.67%) tourists stayed away in the period between August 2018 and August 2019.\n\nVisitors from these countries comprise more than 73% of tourists who visit on an annual basis.\n\nAlthough visa regulations are finally being relaxed, Christelle Grohmann, director of BDO\u2019s tourism unit, said the situation would not be turned around within the next six months. Stats SA\u2019s figures show that only Italian, Indian and American visitor counts increased slightly in the past year.\n\nThe number of tourists from Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain and other African countries also declined.\n\nWhen figures from January to August were compared with the same period in the previous year, tourism numbers had fallen by 1.5%. During this period, there were 3.4% fewer visitors from Europe, with the numbers for Germany (-7.4%) and France (-8.7%) showing the sharpest decrease.\n\nGrohmann said international tourism was on the rise and South Africa couldn\u2019t blame a weak world economy for the numbers. Tourism is one of the most important economic sectors in the country and is estimated to account for more than 9% of total employment.\n\nAmong other things, the decline in tourism figures may be ascribed to the regulations implemented by former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba. The regulations made it impossible for children to travel to South Africa without unabridged birth certificates. President Cyril Ramaphosa has reportedly called for the birth certificate regulations to be recalled, but the damage will likely remain for some time.\n\nGrohmann said it was a perfect storm for tourism.\n\n\u201cEvery government decision, every xenophobic attack has an effect on the tourism and hospitality industry. We sometimes forget how many people from Africa live in the US, Europe and other big tourist markets around the world.\u201d\n\nShe said while the recent xenophobic attacks may not have been directed at tourists, they would still be something people would find disturbing and a knock-on effect may well lead to fewer tourists visiting the country over the holidays.\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa said government planned to attract 21 million tourists by 2030.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s double the number of tourists who were in the country at the beginning of the year \u2026 but the latest decline shows how far we are from reaching this target,\u201d she said.", "description": "The destructive effect of government\u2019s visa regulations was evident this week in the latest tourism figures, which show a sharp decline.", "authors": ["Liesl Peyper"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8715/e863644e945b4f1989fa4d2744d61e19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
