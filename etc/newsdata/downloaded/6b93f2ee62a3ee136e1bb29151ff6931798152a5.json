Photo-Illustration: by Stevie Remsberg; Photos: Getty\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about coloring your eyelids a color this spring, give some thought to blue-green. A lot of eyelids are wearing teals, turquoises, aquas, and cyans these days. If yours could speak, write, and/or communicate telepathically, first of all, that would be alarming, but also, they\u2019d probably request you dress them in this trending shade.\n\nHere are some reasons why: Teal is the exact right amount of bright to catapult you into spring, and it\u2019s reminiscent enough of both chlorine-y pool and tropical beach waters to carry you all the way through summer. The boldness of the color also protects you from having to do anything precise with it. It creates so much contrast against every skin tone that you can put any amount anywhere on your lids and instantly be wearing \u201ca look.\u201d Also, teal is just fun \u2014 so much fun that even David Beckham couldn\u2019t resist its call.\n\nIf you can\u2019t either, start by picking your product of choice: a multitasking crayon, a waterproof pencil, a precise liquid pen, even a singular shadow. Then, look for keywords like \u201clagoon,\u201d \u201ctropic,\u201d \u201cmarine,\u201d or just plain \u201cteal.\u201d Finally, draw anything: a chunky swipe, an angular cat eye, an amorphous blob of color, or a wave of shadow simply moving up toward the brows.\n\nFor extra credit, study the 11 looks below and try pairing your handiwork with a pink lip.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Spring 2019 is all about aqua makeup and teal makeup worn on the eyes.
