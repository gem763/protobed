No one has been able to crack it so far.\u201d Tash Sorensen\n\n\u201cA week and a half ago that was a cauliflower on the bench,\u201d says the ex-patron chef of two-hatted fine diner L\u00fbm\u00e9, pointing to the camembert.\n\nThe cosy scene feels a world away from a multimillion-dollar plant-based food business, but that\u2019s exactly what Quade and his partner Veronica Fil, a behavioural economist with a background in marketing and brand strategy, are planning to launch by early next year, in New York.\n\nThe couple have just landed $US200,000 ($298,000) in funding from Big Idea Ventures (BIV) \u2013 a New York-based venture capital-accelerator fund supporting plant-based food and alternative protein companies \u2013 and flew out on Friday to spend the next several months in Manhattan bringing their cheese business, Grounded Foods, to market.\n\nThere\u2019s no soy, no nuts, no dairy, no gluten, no additives, no coconut oils, no lab-grown synthetics. \u2014 Veronica Fil\n\nThe accelerator program funding \u2013 based on Grounded's launch value of $US4 million \u2013 comes from a $US50 million \u201cnew protein\u201d fund established by BIV, backed by the US food giant Tyson and the Singapore government\u2019s investment arm.\n\nIt also comes hard on the heels of a $40,000 grant awarded in August by Mars Food Australia\u2019s Seeds of Change Accelerator program, designed to help companies learn the ins and outs of running a business. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild,\u201d admits Fil of the strong interest shown in their fledgling venture and their departure to New York.\n\nSo what has everyone so excited for Quade\u2019s cheeses? According to Fil, there\u2019s nothing quite like them on the market. \u201cThere\u2019s no soy, no nuts, no dairy, no gluten, no additives, no coconut oils, no lab-grown synthetics,\u201d says Fil. \u201cPeople have been trying to make nut-free, soy-free cheese for years and years.
