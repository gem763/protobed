I was wrong.\"\n\nThe following day she received a message from her sister telling her to check her friend's Snapchat story.\n\nIt showed the chicken nugget packaging and her 'friends' then feeding them to her.\n\nIt also included the conversation where she checked if they were meat-free.\n\nAnother video showed them pretending to be her when she found out she had unwittingly eaten meat by fake crying and yelling 'the chickens'.\n\nShe continues: \"I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police on the grounds of food tampering and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank. In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.\"\n\nShe asks people to give wade in on who is right on the forum named 'Am I the A**hole?'\n\nThe majority of the top comments say she was in the right to take action against her friends.\n\nOne said: \"I\u2019m impressed and kinda think this is awesome. I think that it\u2019s awesome you went to the police and they\u2019re taking it seriously.\"\n\nAnother added: \"You're all forgetting that they uploaded a Snapchat video making fun of her too, it wasn't just food tampering.\"\n\nDespite all the support, there were still those who thought she was the one to have gone too far.\n\nA comment which added fuel to the debate read: \"What kind of answers are these? Esh.\n\n\"You\u2019re pressing charges over chicken nuggets. You have a moral stance against meat. That\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s not a life threatening allergy.\n\n\"It\u2019s absolutely a s***ty thing for them to do. They aren\u2019t friends. They should be ashamed. But pressing charges is just way too much.\"", "description": "She found the video of her friends feeding her meat and mocking her online", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Eyeem", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546522.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Close-Up-Of-Chicken-Nuggets-With-Sauce-On-Granite-Plate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
