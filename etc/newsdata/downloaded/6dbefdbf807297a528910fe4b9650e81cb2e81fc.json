It says electricity will be restored to 98% by Saturday.\n\n6:45 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. says it expects to restore power to 98% of some 2 million people affected by the utility\u2019s deliberate blackout by the end of the day.\n\nThe utility announced Friday that crews have been making excellent progress declaring power lines safe.\n\nThe power was shut off earlier this week to customers in the Sierra Nevada foothills, Central Valley and San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPG&E announced Friday evening that power had been restored to 96% of customers in the Bay Area and 89% systemwide, with the inspection and repair work continuing.\n\nPG&E began the sweeping blackouts Wednesday to prevent its power lines from being hit with tree branches or other debris and sparking deadly fires during dry, windy weather.\n\n___\n\n4:40 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co., says crews discovered four sections of wind-related damage after the company cut power twice during windy weather weeks before Wednesday\u2019s massive cuts.\n\nThe company reported to state regulators Friday that crews found vegetation on utility equipment before restoring power during the outages on Sept. 23 and Sept. 25. Crews also found and repaired one damaged conductor.\n\nThe first outage affected 26,000 customers in the Sierra foothills and the second hit 49,000 customers in the foothills and the North Bay.\n\nPG&E officials say that they under-reported the number of customers who were affected at the time. That\u2019s because a substation in Oroville lost power only briefly when some of the lines feeding it were shut off. They also didn\u2019t initially count properties in Paradise with inactive accounts.\n\nThe utility cut power to nearly 2 million people earlier this week to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires during dry, windy weather.\n\n___\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nThe daughter of a Northern California man who died when his oxygen equipment failed during a planned power shutdown says she doesn\u2019t understand why Pacific Gas & Electric Co. turned off the electricity.\n\nThe utility cut power to nearly 2 million people Wednesday to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires during dry, windy weather.\n\nMarie Aldea told KTXL-TV in Sacramento Friday that her 67-year-old father Robert Mardis Sr. may have not been able to reach his battery-operated backup machine in time when the power went out around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nMardis, who had been sleeping, died about 12 minutes after the shut down.\n\nA PG&E spokesman said earlier Friday that it had not confirmed the accuracy of the report.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nNorthern California fire officials say a man dependent on oxygen died about 12 minutes after Pacific Gas and Electric shut down power to the area as part of a massive effort to prevent fire.\n\nEl Dorado County Fire Chief Lloyd Ogan said Friday that fire personnel responded to a call in Pollock Pines that came in after 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nHe said crews arrived to find an unresponsive man in his 60s and were unable to revive him.\n\nOgan said the man\u2019s oxygen equipment required power but could not say whether the shutdown was related to his death.\n\nPG&E spokesman Jeff Smith said it has not been able to confirm the accuracy of the report.\n\nThe utility started turning off electricity early Wednesday in Northern and Central California in advance of strong, dry winds.\n\n___\n\n6:50 a.m.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric says it has restored power to more than half of the nearly 2 million people left in the dark in Northern California after the utility shut down power to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires during dry, windy weather.\n\nPG&E says it has restored electricity to about 426,000 businesses and residences. Another 312,000 customers remain without power. Experts say a customer includes between two and three people.\n\nAreas without power includes Plumas, Yuba and Butte counties, where people are on their third day without electricity. Butte County is where a fire started by PG&E equipment last year decimated the town of Paradise and killed 85 people.\n\nThe utility says power also remain out in of Kern County in the southern part of the state\u2019s agricultural Central Valley, where strong winds prompted PG&E to cut power on Thursday.\n\nThe utility it was able to restore power after winds subsided and workers could inspect its power lines.\n\n___\n\n4 a.m.\n\nA wildfire fueled by Santa Ana winds has closed two freeways, is threatening homes and has forced evacuations around Los Angeles.\n\nFire officials say the Saddleridge fire had consumed more than 4,600 acres by 3 a.m. Friday.\n\nIt broke out after 9 p.m. Thursday along the 210 Freeway and jumped the highway. Flames also crossed the 5 Freeway. The highways were closed because of heavy smoke.\n\nAuthorities have ordered mandatory evacuations in the Granada Hills, Porter Ranch and Oakridge Estates neighborhoods.\n\nSeveral homes were seen burning in Granada Hills, and the LA fire department said an \u201cunknown number\u201d of homes were potentially threatened.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries.\n\nThe blaze comes as hot, dry winds are raising concerns that the region\u2019s largest utility could widen power shutoffs to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.\n\n___\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nHot, dry winds sweeping into Southern California raised concerns that the region\u2019s largest utility could widen power shutoffs Friday to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.\n\nSouthern California Edison turned off electricity to about 20,000 people but warned that thousands more could lose service as Santa Ana winds gained strength.\n\nMeanwhile Winds gusted dangerously as forecast in Northern California before weather conditions eased and the lights started to come back on. Planned blackouts affected millions and Pacific Gas & Electric faced hostility and second-guessing for its widespread shutoffs.\n\nOver 500,000 PG&E customers were still waiting for power to come back on as of Thursday night.", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the power shutoff involving California wildfires (all times local): 6:50 p.m. An autopsy has concluded that a planned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/c0a935_california-wildfires-37626-in-thursday-oct-10-2019-photo-firefighters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
