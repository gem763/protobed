I think this is a time for cool heads, and violence only plays into the hands of republicanism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 30,000-member Orange Order, a Protestant organisation, is central to the culture for Northern Irish loyalists - named for their allegiance to the British throne - and will strongly influence whether unionists take to the streets in big numbers to protest.\n\nGibson, a Presbyterian minister whose society holds annual parades that often raise tensions between Irish nationalist Catholics and pro-British Protestants, said there is \u201csomething wrong\u201d when people in Northern Ireland must fill in customs forms and those in Scotland, England and Wales, the other parts of the United Kingdom, do not.\n\nA 1998 peace accord largely ended three decades of sectarian and political conflict in Northern Ireland, referred to as the \u201cTroubles\u201d, that cost some 3,600 lives, including some in attacks in mainland Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland has been open as a part of that accord, but this has created a dilemma over how to avoid reinstating a hard border once Britain leaves the bloc, something that the EU believes would be jeopardise peace.\n\nUnder the proposed Brexit deal, Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom\u2019s customs area but tariffs would apply on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland if they were deemed to be headed further, to Ireland and the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\nBut the DUP\u2019s hopes of persuading pro-Brexit members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party to join them in opposing the deal may prove a longer shot if those lawmakers believe it will not fan unrest and put Northern Ireland\u2019s fragile peace at risk.\n\nMany unionist politicians, including DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds are members of the Orange Order.\n\n\u201cI think we have been let down by him (Boris Johnson), badly. It\u2019s a deal that could see us sleepwalk in to a united Ireland. He hasn\u2019t understood the unionist position, it wasn\u2019t until now people are beginning to realise that,\u201d Gibson said.\n\n\u201cThis deal needs a unionist response from across the board. Parts of the deal need to be changed because this deal isn\u2019t a good deal for unionism. It orientates us to Dublin economically and we are an integral part of the United Kingdom so should be treated as such.\u201d\n\n\u2018DON\u2019T NEED UNREST\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s Northern Ireland Minister Julian Smith said on Sunday that he had \u201cgood calls with unionist community leaders\u201d and would continue to speak to them as he pledged to fight for Northern Irish interests during the next Brexit phase.\n\nSmith\u2019s comments followed a report by Sky News on Saturday quoting an unnamed source as saying loyalist groups had met to consider their response to the deal, including the possibility of \u201ccivil disobedience on a large scale\u201d.\n\nHowever that was dismissed on Sunday by the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), a small loyalist political party with links to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commando.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThose two groups waged bombing campaigns during the \u201cTroubles\u201d before putting down their weapons. Backed by church leaders last year, they said they were turning their backs on criminality and would expel members who engage in activities such as drug dealing and racketeering.\n\n\u201cI am not hearing it, I haven\u2019t heard anything about unrest,\u201d PUP leader Billy Hutchinson, a former UVF prisoner who is one of the party\u2019s four local councillors in Northern Ireland, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cPeople are unhappy for a number of reasons, they don\u2019t like the idea of Northern Ireland being half in and half out... I can\u2019t speak for every person in society but from my point of view we don\u2019t need unrest, we need unionism to act as one and have a united voice.\u201d", "description": "The head of Northern Ireland's influential Orange Order said on Sunday unionists in the province should avoid staging violent protests over British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal despite feeling that they had been let down.", "authors": ["Amanda Ferguson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443242123&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0NI", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
