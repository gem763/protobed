(See his track record here.)\n\nRoku's platform is able to satisfy each stakeholders' individual needs and is a key selling point for investors at a time when competition intensifies and Roku's stock valuation is elevated, the analyst said.\n\nRoku remains in the early innings of building out a global platform, he said. Most recently, the company announced an expanded partnership with Hisense to sell Roku-equipped TVs across Europe by the end of the year.\n\nThe company's strategy to focus on the global market is notable for three reasons, Morris said:\n\nThe growth of streaming video globally will outpace the U.S. over the next five to 10 years.\n\nSmart TV penetration outside of the U.S. remains low.\n\nRoku is able to demonstrate its advantages to content providers and original equipment manufacturers and generate value for everyone.\n\nGuggenheim's revised $170 price target is based on five times 2024 platform segment sales of $3.4 billion and values the international business at $6 billion.\n\nPrice Action\n\nRoku shares were down 10.23% at $135.12 at the time of publication Wednesday.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nRoku CEO: Our Technology Should Be Included In Half Of TVs\n\nRoku Leverages Recent Momentum With New Line Of Audio Devices\n\nPhoto courtesy of Roku.\n\nLatest Ratings for ROKU\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Maintains Buy Sep 2019 Maintains Hold Sep 2019 Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for ROKU\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
