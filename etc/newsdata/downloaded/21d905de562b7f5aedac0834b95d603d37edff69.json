(AP) - Missouri coach Barry Odom insisted all fall his team is good enough to play with just about anybody into the fourth quarter.\n\nTurned out lousy for the Tigers last weekend.\n\nDespite a frantic late rally, Missouri fell 37-31 at Wyoming in one of the big upsets so far this season. The Tigers allowed 297 yards and three touchdowns on the ground, and not even a 423-yard passing performance by transfer quarterback Kelly Bryant could save them.\n\n\u201cObviously not the start that we were anticipating there,\u201d Odom said. \u201cWe understand who we are and any game that if we prepare the right way and then we go execute, any game that we\u2019ve got on our schedule will be decided in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s who we are as a team.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not so bad against the likes of Alabama. Not so good against Wyoming.\n\nNow, the Tigers get a chance to right a start that went completely wrong when West Virginia visits Saturday. The Mountaineers are in a rebuild after coach Dana Holgorsen left for Houston, and they needed 10 points in the fourth quarter to squeak out a 20-13 win over James Madison in their opener.\n\nAnd if the Tigers had trouble stopping the run, the Mountaineers had trouble getting it started.\n\nKnown for its prolific offenses under Holgorsen, West Virginia managed just 34 yards rushing on 24 attempts in Neal Brown\u2019s first game as coach. The Mountaineers\u2019 longest carry? Five yards.\n\n\u201cThe run game was really poor,\u201d said Brown, who\u2019d been banking on the run game being one of the most experienced units on the team. \u201cYou can look at the stat sheet and say that. I think we lacked physicality across the board. It\u2019s easy to blame the O-line or the running backs in the run game, but everybody has a piece in it. It just wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d\n\nThe two schools, who will always be tied together for their roles during conference realignment - the Tigers bolted to the SEC, the Mountaineers backfilled from the old Big East - are in fact meeting for just the third time in Columbia. The most recent of those was 1994.\n\nMORE ON BRYANT\n\nIn his first start since transferring from Clemson, Bryant was at turns dynamic and dismal. He had some gaudy passing numbers, including a couple touchdown throws, but often fled the pocket too early and threw an interception.\n\n\u201cKelly hadn\u2019t played in a year, basically,\u201d Odom said, \u201cbut out of the gate he played pretty well. We always would like a couple back.\u201d\n\nSPEAKING OF QBS\n\nWest Virginia quarterback Austin Kendall wants to see overall improvement in the offense after a sluggish start. The Mountaineers were outgained 328-294 by James Madison.\n\n\u201cI missed too many vertical balls that were out of the reach of our receivers\u2019 hands,\u201d said Kendall, an Oklahoma graduate transfer who threw for 260 yards and two TDs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be better. We didn\u2019t run the ball well. Sometimes we didn\u2019t throw the ball well. We\u2019ve got to be better overall.\u201d\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\n\nThe Tigers hardly tackled during training camp in an attempt to stay healthy, and it showed in their inability to stop the Cowboys last weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not raising the level of concern,\u201d Odom said. \u201cI need to see a little bit more of the body of work to see where we stack up.\u201d\n\nWELL, ONE PERSON TACKLED\n\nMissouri linebacker Cale Garrett had 16 tackles against Wyoming, which makes one wonder how many yards the Cowboys would have had without the senior on the field. It was the most by a Missouri player since Kentrell Brothers had 17 against Georgia in 2015, the year he led the nation in tackles.\n\nBRIGHT SPOT\n\nBryant isn\u2019t the only transfer Missouri is leaning on this season. Wide receiver Jonathan Nance, who led Arkansas in receptions and yards receiving last season, had three catches for 62 yards and two scores against the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big, explosive guy,\u201d said Brown, who remembers watching Nance at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. \u201cI\u2019m certainly familiar with him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Missouri coach Barry Odom insisted all fall his team is good enough to play with just about anybody into the fourth quarter.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/west_virginia_bush_football_69445_c0-281-6720-4199_s1770x1032.jpg?726aa4b153188cab25e8810a338d35af19c29541", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
