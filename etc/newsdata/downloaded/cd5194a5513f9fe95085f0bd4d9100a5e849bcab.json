(BIT:ASC) For Its Dividend", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Ascopiave S.p.A. (BIT:ASC) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Ascopiave. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 0.8% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Ascopiave for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Ascopiave!\n\nBIT:ASC Historical Dividend Yield, October 10th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 70% of Ascopiave's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Ascopiave paid out 586% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. While Ascopiave's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Ascopiave's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nIs Ascopiave's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Ascopiave has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.11 times its EBITDA, Ascopiave's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Ascopiave has interest cover of more than 12 times its interest expense, which we think is quite strong.\n\nWe update our data on Ascopiave every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Ascopiave S.p.A.
