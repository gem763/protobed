Al-Qaeda operatives hijacked four planes to execute this attack. The Pentagon and the World Trade Center were struck. The loss of life was severe. Almost 3,000 Americans died that day. Families were shattered. The nation was shocked. And so began our war on terrorism, specifically those who are followers of radical Islam. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) actually had a nice tweet to commemorate this day, saying \u201cWe will never forget the thousands of Americans who lost their lives in the largest terror attack on U.S. soil. I will continue to fight to make sure we care for the first responders and families who lost loved ones.\u201d\n\nNicholas Haros Jr. Is the son of a 9/11 a victim; today he appeared at NYC commemoration & unloaded on @IlhanMN\n\n\n\n\"Madam, objectively speaking we know who and what was done, there is no uncertainty about that ... 19 Islamic terrorist members of al Qaeda killed over 3,000 people.\" pic.twitter.com/iXWvGIeySc \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 11, 2019\n\nYou see, that wasn\u2019t hard. And that goes for all left-wingers who hate America. For one day, you don\u2019t have to be insufferable cretins and bash the country. Then again, Omar did describe the 9/11 attacks as an event where, \u201csome people did something,\u201d at a CAIR fundraiser this year. The New York Post torched her for that nonsense, as did some of the victims of that horrible attack. That \u201csomething\u201d was radical Islam, it was al-Qaeda, and the inability of the Left to recognize that radical Islamic terrorism is a problem continues to be an annoying aspect of their political correctness agenda. You saw that on full display today with The New York Times, who said that planes, on their own, crashed into the towers. Leah wrote about it.\n\nDid Omar and Tlaib write that article? \u2014 GlennAC (@GlennAC14) September 11, 2019\n\nSome planes did something \u2014 Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) September 11, 2019\n\n\u201cSome planes did something\u201d was the new line until the publication changed it for being rightfully trashed for the PC headline.", "description": ".09/12/2019 3:05:57AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/199/82ec5ce9-1c71-4318-a18f-d112e6cafbd2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
