The reasons for refusing bail are subject to a non-publication order.\n\nDressed in a grey jumper, Chan appeared via video link from Long Bay jail hospital. He appeared impassive throughout the hearing, and only sought to speak, through an interpreter, at the end of the hearing, when his microphone was turned off.\n\nChoi, a naturalised Australian citizen of South Korean origin, was arrested in December 2017, after a raid on his home in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood. He has been in custody on remand since then.\n\nPolice allege he was acting as an \u201ceconomic agent\u201d for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, seeking to generate income for the isolated North Korean regime by selling weapons technology and resources, in breach of Australian and United Nations sanctions.\n\nHe has been charged with offences under the Charter of the United Nations Act and the Autonomous Sanctions Act, as well as the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act. The maximum penalty for these offences is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe Guardian has seen a police statement of alleged facts. These have not been tested in court and have not been agreed to by Choi\u2019s defence.\n\nThe statement alleges Choi used a web of blackmarket contacts in Syria, Taiwan, Cambodia and Russia to broker deals mostly in coal and iron, but also in weapons technology, including short-range missiles.\n\nThe statement cites Choi\u2019s regular overseas travel, including to North Korea, and alleged email correspondence that reveals a declared loyalty to the North Korean regime. An email allegedly from the regime praised Choi\u2019s devotion and willingness to \u201cwork hard for our country\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven when you are far away from our country, in your heart there is the country, so I am certain that your project will run successfully,\u201d the email, sent in July 2013, allegedly said of Choi.\n\nThe police statement alleges Choi, who used the pseudonym Solomon in his negotiations, developed a code to discuss weapons sales on the phone, referring to missiles as \u201cpine trees\u201d and missile factories as \u201cnurseries\u201d.\n\nWhen Choi was arrested, Australian federal police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan stressed Choi was not alleged to have engaged in syping, but simply to have tried to raise money for the North Korean regime.\n\nGaughan said evidence suggested Choi had been in contact \u201cwith high-ranking North Korean officials\u201d but did not provide details.\n\n\u201cWe believe this man participated in discussions about the sale of missile componentry from North Korea to other entities abroad.\u201d\n\nGaughan would not identify the alleged international entities or their location, but said there were no governments or government officials involved.\n\nAccording to the police allegations, Choi described himself as North Korea\u2019s \u201cinternational commerce\u201d liaison, working on behalf of the highest echelons of the DPRK government.\n\n\u201cI am a recognised strategist that has favour with Kim Jong Eun [sic],\u201d he wrote.\n\nPolice allege the various deals Choi attempted to broker did not go ahead.\n\nThe police allegations state that in late 2017 Choi brokered the sale of missiles and missile technology with a Taiwanese contact. They also state that he negotiated to send experts to the contact to help operate the technology. But the alleged deal was disrupted by his arrest.", "description": "Sydney man Choi Han Chan allegedly used blackmarket contacts to broker deals in coal and iron, but also in weapons technology", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b0a7a54ca7afa09bae93d955af48566160b450/26_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b0df5acc3bee260a623dc1c584d7d04", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
