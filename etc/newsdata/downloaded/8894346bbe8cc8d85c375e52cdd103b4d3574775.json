He Didn't.", "language": "en", "text": "In a startling boast Sunday, President Donald Trump suggested that the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center could have been averted had America heeded his call nearly 20 years ago to kill terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nTrump claimed he warned of the serious danger bin Laden posed in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIn that book about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, \u2018There\u2019s somebody named Osama bin Laden. You\u2019d better kill him or take him out,\u2019\u201d he insisted in his remarks after announcing the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. military operation on Saturday. He complained that he never \u201cgets any credit\u201d for that warning.\n\nTrump also claimed that \u201cnobody ever heard of\u201d bin Laden when he published his book. In fact, bin Laden was on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted list in 1999 for U.S. embassy bombings \u2014 a year before the book was published.\n\n\u201cNobody listened to me\u201d about killing bin Laden, he complained. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way, if they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different.\u201d\n\nTrump referred to bin Laden once in the book as one of many shadowy figures being tracked by the U.S. as part of a confusing strategy. He did not characterize him as a particularly notable threat, nor call for his death.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cOne day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\u201d\n\nHere's the mention in the book. Not quite as he characterized it. pic.twitter.com/wsdssORuWn \u2014 esther c\ud83c\udf0a (@PortlandEsther) October 27, 2019\n\nThe passage reveals that bin Laden was clearly known to American officials at the time and was being tracked as a threat \u2014 without any heads up from Trump.\n\nTrump also referred in the book to a likely terror attack that would dwarf the earlier 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center in 1993. But he did not mention any links to al Qaeda \u2014 or bin Laden.\n\nTrump claimed Sunday that people still marvel at how prescient he was about bin Laden so long ago.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I get people coming up to me,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey said, \u2018You know what one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.\u2019 It\u2019s true. Now, most of the press doesn\u2019t want to write that ... but, you know, it is true. If you go back, look at my book.\u201d\n\nStop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate \u2014 Donald J.
