If convicted, he faces from five years of jail to life in prison.\n\nThe US government alleges that Tony Hernandez, who served as a member of the Honduran Congress from 2014 to 2018, worked from 2004 to 2016 with others in Colombia, Honduras and Mexico to import cocaine into the US by plane, boat and submarine.\n\nThe prosecution also says Hernandez was involved in at least two murders of rival drug traffickers in 2011 and 2013.\n\nHernandez met US President Donald Trump in September in New York to discuss the issue of migrants from Latin America [Presidency of Honduras via Reuters]\n\nSome of the cocaine he was transporting was labelled with his initials \"TH,\" according to US lawyer Geoffrey Berman.\n\n'Target of criminals'\n\nDefence lawyer Omar Malone said Tony Hernandez was a target of violent criminals because his brother's administration authorised the extradition of drug traffickers to the US.\n\nHe also referenced the cordial relationship between Honduras and the US, which saw the country's president shake hands with his US counterpart Donald Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe president of Honduras has interacted with the US like any other president of any other country, Malone said.\n\nTony Hernandez, 41, wore a blue suit and appeared calm during the selection process of 12 jurors and six alternates. For security reasons, the jurors will be identified only by numbers, which is typical for major drug-trafficking trials.\n\nThe judge estimates the trial will last between 10 and 12 working days.\n\nHernandez's trial comes after Guzman, the 62-year-old former co-leader of Mexico's feared Sinaloa drug cartel, was convicted in February of smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and cannabis into the US.\n\nHe has been jailed for life, a sentence he is appealing.\n\nUS prosecutors have aggressively pursued current, or former Honduran public officials and their relatives over drug-trafficking allegations.\n\nThe prosecution also claims that several candidates from Honduras' ruling National Party accepted campaign funding from Hernandez, including his brother and former president Porfirio Lobo. Hernandez was elected first in 2013 and again in 2017.\n\nDrug-tainted campaign money\n\nThe Manhattan prosecutor's office filed a motion in August alleging that President Hernandez received at least $1.5m in drug money from one of the prosecution's cooperating witnesses for his first campaign, and $40,000 for the second.\n\nPresident Hernandez and Lobo have rejected the accusations, and neither has been formally charged with offences in the US.\n\nThe prosecution plans to call as witnesses five former drug lords imprisoned in the US who claim they were Tony Hernandez's accomplices.\n\nOne witness is a former cartel leader who claimed during the 2017 trial of Fabio Lobo, Porfirio Lobo's son, to have bribed Hernandez during his congressional tenure.\n\nFabio Lobo was sentenced to 24 years in a US prison for conspiring to smuggle cocaine.", "description": "In trial of president's brother, New York prosecutors claim Honduran leader took at least $1.5m from Mexican drug lord.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/b16ae1ae583246aeb5685f6d6cea95d1_18.jpg"}
