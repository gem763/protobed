These must have brands hold an extremely strong bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis the retailers within their supply networks and use their market power to implement market wide practices aimed at controlling the supply and, ultimately, the pricing of their products,\" Sports Direct said.\n\nMr Ashley's grievance stretches as far back as 2013 when the German giant withdrew replica Chelsea shirts from Sports Direct stores. The retailer said the dominance of Nike and Adidas allows them to \"[refuse] to supply key products... with no apparent justification\".\n\n'They're toast'\n\nThe Sunday Times disclosed that Nike had told several independent retailers it will pull its products from their stores. It is part of a move by the US giant to reduce the number of retailers it uses and push customers towards its website, the newspaper said.\n\n\"All those companies that built a business on the back of Nike and Adidas are toast - there's no way they can replace that [business],\" a source told the Sunday Times.\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nLast month, Sports Direct complained that its rival JD Sports' planned \u00a390m takeover of Footasylum could reduce Mr Ashley's access to the top brands.\n\nIn the past, Adidas and Nike have preferred to work with JD Sports but Sports Direct has attempted to make inroads, appointing former Nike executive David Daly as chairman of its board.\n\n\"Sports Direct has consistently aimed to provide the widest range of products at attractive prices and will continue to work constructively with all its suppliers to enhance its product offering for the benefit of consumers,\" the company said.\n\nA Nike spokesperson said: \"Nike continually evaluates the marketplace and competitive landscape to understand how we can best serve consumers. As part of this, from time to time we do make adjustments to our sales channels, in order to optimize distribution.\" Adidas has yet to respond to a BBC request for comment.", "description": "The Mike Ashley-owned retailer says the \"must-have\" brands hold too much market power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3AC3/production/_107134051_mikeashley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
