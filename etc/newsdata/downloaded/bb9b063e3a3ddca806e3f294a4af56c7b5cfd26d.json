Sure, kimono look nice, but they\u2019re less practical and more time-consuming to put on than a shirt and pants or skirt.\n\nAn exception, though, are waitresses at fancy restaurants that serve Japanese cuisine, who are generally required to wear kimono while on the job. For these restaurants, a large part of their appeal comes from culinary and gastronomic traditions that stretch back generations, and by extension their classical Japanese decor and staff attire.\n\nJapanese Twitter user @wine_kimono has worked in numerous restaurants where she needed to wear a kimono, which doesn\u2019t seem to be a garment she\u2019s averse to, given her online name. However, there\u2019s another common part of the dress code at fancy Japanese restaurants that she\u2019s far less happy about.\n\n\u201cThe most puzzling thing about working in a Japanese restaurant is being told \u2018Take off your glasses,\u2019\u201d @wine_kimono tweets. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in large Japanese restaurants and small independent ones, and about 90 percent of them won\u2019t let you wear glasses.\u201d\n\nWhen @wine_kimono has asked why, the three reasons she\u2019s been told are:\n\n\u25cf Your glasses might drop into the food as you\u2019re serving it.\n\n\u25cf It\u2019s rude to look at customers over the rims of your glasses.\n\n\u25cf Kimono and glasses are a weird combination.\n\nThe first one two are already odd, since glasses aren\u2019t more likely to fall into Japanese food than they are any other kind of cuisine, and it\u2019s not like waitresses at non-Japanese restaurants in Japan are constantly having their eyewear slip off their faces. Likewise, peering at a customer over the top of your glasses can make it look like you\u2019re glowering no matter what kind of food is on the menu, and seems easy enough to prevent by simply, well, looking at customers through the lenses, like people with glasses do in polite interpersonal interactions regardless of whether or not they\u2019re working at the time.\n\nBut it\u2019s the third reason, that glasses and kimono aren\u2019t an appropriate combination, that really has Japanese Twitter users scratching their heads. The ostensible logic seems to be that since Japan didn\u2019t have eyeglasses until after contact with the West, they make the waitresses attire seem less \u201cJapanese,\u201d and since orthodox etiquette in Japan has a major preference for thorough aesthetic singularity (such as with the attitude that \u201cwomen dressed for business need to wear formal heels\u201d), the restaurants feel that wearing glasses with kimono would be a sloppy, or at least respectful, manner of dress.\n\nJust because commenters could envision the line of logic, though, doesn\u2019t mean that they agreed with it, and reactions included:\n\n\u201cEyeglasses are practically a medical device. What\u2019s weird is for an employer to prohibit their use.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould they say the same thing if a waitress had a hearing aid or prosthetic leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor people who need glasses, they\u2019re like a part of their body.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people have eye conditions that don\u2019t allow them to wear contacts instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wearing glasses with kimono. My mom does, and she teaches tea ceremony\u2026I think it would be much ruder, and dangerous, to serve guests food when the waitress can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nAdding another wrinkle to the discussion is that the clientele for high-end Japanese cuisine in Japan tends to be, on average, older than for many other sectors of the restaurant industry, which leads to an even greater preference for old-fashioned fashion. On the bright side, online reactions show that many people have no complaints about kimono and glasses, so hopefully @wine_kimono\u2019s observation that around 10 percent of fancy Japanese restaurants do allow glasses is a figure that\u2019ll increase in the future, even as Japan holds on to its kimono history.\n\nSource: Twitter/@wine_kimono via Jin\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Customer gets more than expected after ordering the large size at a Japanese restaurant\n\n-- Traditionally dressed Japanese waitress runs so fast her kimono flies off in cheeky Wi-Fi advert\n\n-- Tokyo retro kimono photography service provides customers with gorgeous snapshots of the past\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/26/waitress-explains-a-baffling-annoying-part-of-kimono-dress-codes-at-many-japanese-restaurants/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "In the modern era, on most days Japanese women wear Western-style clothing.
