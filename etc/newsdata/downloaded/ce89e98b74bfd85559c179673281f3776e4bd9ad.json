The climate crisis explained in 10 charts", "language": "en", "text": "From the rise and rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to possible solutions\n\nThe problem \u2013 rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\n\nThe level of CO 2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is now at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking \u2013 the fastest for 66m years \u2013 with scientists saying we are in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d.\n\nThe causes \u2013 fossil fuel burning\n\nBillions of tonnes of CO 2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. There is no sign of these emissions starting to fall rapidly, as is needed.\n\nThe causes \u2013 forest destruction\n\nThe felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth.\n\nThe consequences \u2013 global temperature rise\n\nThe planet\u2019s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense.\n\nThe consequences \u2013 ice melting in Greenland\n\nGreenland alone is now losing almost 4 trillion tonnes of ice per year. Mountain ranges from the Himalayas to the Andes to the Alps are also losing ice rapidly as glaciers shrink. A third of the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ice is already doomed.\n\nThe consequences \u2013 rising sea levels\n\nSea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai.\n\nThe consequences \u2013 shrinking Arctic sea ice\n\nAs heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat, causing more heating \u2013 one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe upside (I) \u2013 wind and solar energy is soaring\n\nHuge cost drops have seen renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and solve difficult problems such as aviation and farming.\n\nThe upside (II) \u2013 electric vehicles\n\nThe global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream.\n\nThe upside (III) \u2013 battery costs\n\nRenewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating hydrogen, will also be needed.", "description": "From the rise and rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to possible solutions", "authors": ["Damian Carrington", "Cath Levett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878b7f7d8fc5f605ea9152bccd042d31cd269bb2/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8924e78a2f2e8824349646d39b15ea1a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
