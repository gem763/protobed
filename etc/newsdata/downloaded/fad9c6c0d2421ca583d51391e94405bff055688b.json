However, macOS Catalina also comes with one big drawback: Apple won\u2019t let you run 32-bit apps anymore. If that\u2019s a big issue for you, or you\u2019re concerned that critical apps you need won\u2019t be supported in the latest OS, you have a few easy ways to check.\n\nFirst, click on the Apple logo in the upper-left corner of your screen and select \u201cAbout This Mac.\u201d Click on \u201cSystem Report,\u201d and scroll down the sidebar a bit until you see \u201cLegacy Software.\u201d Any apps in this section are 32-bit apps and won\u2019t work on macOS Catalina.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see any apps at all, try clicking on \u201cApplications\u201d in the sidebar. There should be a column that says \u201c64-Bit (Intel),\u201d and any apps listed with \u201cno\u201d are 32-bit, not 64-bit.\n\nYou can also use a third-party app like Go64 to find 32-bit apps on your system, which takes also into account whether 64-bit apps \u201ccontain 32-bit plugins, frameworks or services.\u201d (These also might cause complications if you upgrade to macOS Catalina.)\n\nIf you find that some of the apps you use are 32-bit, you\u2019re low on options. You can contact the developer to see what their plans are, if any, for making a 64-bit version. You can also hunt down a similar app that is 64-bit. Worst case scenario, you can simply not update to macOS Catalina, though Mojave \u2014 the last macOS operating system that supports 32-bit apps \u2014 should stop receiving support from Apple in 2020.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend using an older OS (especially one that isn\u2019t receiving any more patches or security updates), but I totally understand if some critical apps force you to do so. In that case, perhaps having a copy of Mojave for a handful of apps and a copy of Catalina for everyday use might be your best option.", "description": "Apple\u2019s latest operating system update \u2014 released Tuesday \u2014 comes with plenty of new and exciting features.
