(Image: DC Universe)\n\nWhen Slade Wilson first crossed paths with Dick Grayson and the original Titans team, the assassin\u2019s attack left the young heroes so devastated that once they believed they\u2019d defeated him, they vowed never to come back together out of fear that doing so might somehow lead to more tragedy. But eventually, Titans brought the heroes back, and all of their greatest fears about Deathstroke seem to be coming to pass.\n\nDespite its title, \u201cDeathstroke\u201d doesn\u2019t spend all that much time depicting Wilson\u2019s latest plan to destroy the Titans from his own perspective, opting instead to emphasise what his presence alone can do to put Dick on edge and make everyone question whether he\u2019s really cut out to be their leader.\n\nEpisodes like this one make you appreciate the effort Titans puts into giving each of its characters solid conflicting motivations. As haunted by metaphorical ghosts as Titans\u2019 tower has been, the Titans have all been able to keep them at the edge of their minds up until this point. But now that everyone knows what Rose\u2019s connection to Deathstroke is, and Jason Todd\u2019s life is seemingly in the balance, the Titans\u2019 ghosts are being put front and centre so that they can no longer be ignored.\n\nThere was a moment at the very end of Titans\u2019 previous episode suggesting that while Deathstroke is every bit the homicidal maniac the show\u2019s heroes have made him out to be, at least one of his attacks on them \u2014 the one that presumably led to the team\u2019s dissolution \u2014 was prompted by something the Titans themselves did. Following Aqualad\u2019s death by Deathstroke, Dick sought out Deathstroke\u2019s son Jericho and made quick work of befriending the boy under false pretenses.\n\nWhile we still don\u2019t know exactly what Dick and the Titans ended doing to Jericho, his sister Rose in the present day has insinuated that Jericho\u2019s long dead, suggesting that Deathstroke has returned, in part, because he\u2019s got an understandable bone to pick. But he isn\u2019t just a vengeful killer, he\u2019s a sadistic monster who delights in torturing people emotionally as well as physically, and so his sickening plan to destroy Dick revolves around Jason Todd.\n\nThere\u2019s a tragic poetry to the fact that Jason wouldn\u2019t have ended up wandering into the sewers hoping to apprehend Doctor Light were it not for Dick\u2019s insistence at benching Jason without trying to explain the reasons why.\n\nWhile Dick has seen Jason\u2019s potential and how good training under Bruce has been for the new Robin, the younger hero\u2019s impulsiveness and his inclination toward brutality give Dick rightful pause. But by not understanding that Jason needed more communication rather than being shut out, Dick demonstrates that anger issues aren\u2019t the only character flaw relearned from Bruce.\n\nWhen Dove told Dick to \u201cbe Batman\u201d in \u201cAqualad,\u201d there were any number of ways you could have interpreted her meaning, but in the present day it seems as if what Dick\u2019s trying to settle into is that kind of mentor/leader role that Batman ultimately played within the Bat Family.\n\nDick\u2019s new to the whole business of building a chosen family of heroes and so you can understand why he\u2019d make a certain number of mistakes. Unfortunately for Jason, \u201cmistakes\u201d in this context amount to his being captured by a surprisingly disposable Doctor Light and tortured by Deathstroke.\n\nDeathstroke torturing Jason. (Image: DC Universe)\n\nWhy Titans decided to introduce Doctor Light, who essentially ended up being a steroid junky whose juice of choice was the soft white light emanating from naked light bulbs, only to kill him so unceremoniously remains a mystery. But his death, like Aqualad\u2019s, winnows down the story Titans is right to focus on \u2014 the one about Deathstroke\u2019s desire to teach by inflicting pain.\n\nAs Deathstroke sharpens his blades in preparation for cutting into Jason\u2019s flesh, he explains that what he\u2019s really trying to do is disabuse the young hero of any notion that his antics with the Titans or Bruce Wayne are a good thing. Unsurprisingly, Jason\u2019s true purpose for the time being is to act as a bargaining chip in exchange for Rose. Deathstroke seems to have a legitimate disgust for young superheroes \u2014 which is such a classic, but underused, character trait for a villain that it\u2019s interesting to see here.\n\nBeing the son of the world\u2019s greatest detective, Dick fully understands that Deathstroke wants to appear as if he\u2019s willing to make a trade. But Dick also knows that a.) Deathstroke\u2019s prone to lying and b.) Dick wants to keep both Rose and Jason as far away from Deathstroke as possible, making a trade untenable. But Dick isn\u2019t alone in making this decision, and the rest of the original Titans and the returned Kory are all divided along moral lines as to how they should proceed.\n\nKory, Dove and Dick believe that keeping everyone safe is in the team\u2019s best option, though none of them is immediately prepared to present a plan as to how to go about doing that. But Hawk and Donna, at least initially, see things in more sharper shades of black and white. Innocent as Rose is, they think ultimately she\u2019s a liability to them all that Dick never should have brought into their orbit.\n\nBy letting Rose, Rachel, and Gar spy on Dick, Hawk, Dove, and Donna as they debate about what to do, the episode gives Titans a really interesting moment of multilayered character building for a number of different people. Rose has had no reason to believe any of Rachel\u2019s assurances that the tower would be a good place for her, and Donna and Hank make it obvious they want her gone. At the same time, however, Kory, Dove and Dick are just as fierce in their defence of Rose, and Rose has no reason to assume that either of them is performing for her because they don\u2019t know that she can see them.\n\nAs abrupt as Kory\u2019s return to Titans\u2019 core storyline is, the time she spends with Rachel discussing the resurgence of her demonic powers makes you realise just how much time the series has spent on the street level as of late (light-sucking villains notwithstanding).\n\nKory explaining the nature of her unique abilities in an attempt to help Rachel understand and accept her own is this small, but solid way of reestablishing that Titans exists in a much larger more fantastical world with more fascinating things in it than assassins who hate millennials. Just as soon as Kory\u2019s encouraged Rachel to unleash the energy she feels inside, though, Rachel ends up demoning out and breaking Rose\u2019s back, promptly causing the girl to wonder if she\u2019s truly destined to be a monster.\n\nDick and Kory teaming up to fight Deathstroke. (Image: DC Universe)\n\n\u201cDeathstroke\u201d begins to stumble some in its final third as the other Titans try to come to grips with the fact that Rachel killed Rose... and then suddenly, Rose\u2019s body regenerates, healing her for the most part, before she passes out. As wild a turn of events as that all is, it\u2019s not exactly out of the ordinary for a team of heroes that once included both an Atlantean and an Amazon.\n\nShocked as they all are, Rose and Rachel\u2019s incident gives the team the resolve it needs to try and take Deathstroke out once and for all while saving Jason in the process. But of course, Dick being Dick, he ends up offering himself up to Deathstroke hoping to make a trade. Surprising no one, Deathstroke\u2019s got no interest in making a trade for Jason and just as it seems as if Deathstroke\u2019s going to make Dick watch Jason die, Kory pops up to work some alien pyrotechnics that somehow don\u2019t manage to fry Deathstroke, who\u2019s merely an enhanced human in a funny getup.\n\nThe final moments of \u201cDeathstroke\u201d aren\u2019t much to write about in terms of narrative substance \u2014 it\u2019s more of a punching, kicking and blasting affair. But that very last shot of a terrified Jason Todd maybe plunging to his death while Dick is helpless to do anything but look on is one of the more heartwrenching shots Titans has pulled off so far.\n\nIf only there were one or maybe two other people on the team who, you know, flew or something.
