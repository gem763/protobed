Then, I use the Joanna Czech face roller and roll it over my face, which actually activates the face mask. Once I finish face rolling for about five minutes, I leave the mask on for another 15 minutes. Next, I remove the mask and use a couple of drops of vintners daughter oil and pat it into my face. I end with the KNC lip mask, and use a good amount of jet lag mask as an under-eye cream, but I use about a pea-sized amount under each eye and I don't really rub it in, I let it sink in.\"\n\nTanyka Renee\n\nTravel, beauty and lifestyle digital creator\n\nTanyka's top picks:\n\nNatural exfoliants made from flaxseeds, rosewater mist, sheet and eye masks, NuScience Cellfood drops, Cellfood Essential Silica Formula, Evolution_18 Beauty Bubbles: Hydration\n\nHer routine:\n\n\"Morning of the flight, I make sure to exfoliate my skin to ensure that the moisturizer penetrates deeply into my pores and doesn't sit on top of dead skin cells. I make a natural exfoliator from ground flaxseeds and coconut oil. Then, I apply moisturizer and lip balm. I top all this off with a refreshing, moisturizing Rosewater mist.\n\nStephanie Flor\n\nCEO of Around The World Beauty, global beauty expert, and beauty director at Unearth Women\n\nStephanie's top picks:\n\nPlant Alchemy Jet Lag Tincture by Plant Alchemy, Kao Lavender Warm eye mask, Nyakio Maracuj\u00e1 and Yangu Soothing Oil, Skyn Iceland Hydro Cool firming eye gels, My Skineez medical grade compression socks\n\nStephanie's routine:\n\n\"My favorite is the Jet Lag Tincture by Plant Alchemy. This whole plant-based formulation is designed to relax the body, restore circadian balance, and refresh the body clock. The tincture is produced with fine organic herbal ingredients that supports healthy sleep so you don\u2019t miss out on being tired from flying. About two to four drops helps get you relaxed, and I like to drink 12-ounce water to get hydrated instantly before taking flight.\"\n\nJulie Kandalec\n\nCelebrity manicurist, global traveler, and CEO of Masterclass Nail Academy\n\nJulie's picks:\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water makeup remover, Weleda Skin Food moisturizer, Chanel Hydra Beauty Essence Mist, Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Capsules Youth Restoring Serum\n\nJulie's routine:\n\n\"Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar water makeup remover comes in the perfect travel size, never leaks in my travel bag, and it removes all my makeup without ever pulling skin or any irritation at all.\"\n\n\"I love having Chanel Hydra Beauty Essence Mist because sometimes I am hesitant to use my hands to apply products to my face while traveling (hello foreign bacteria). This mist smells lightly floral and gives a little boost mid-flight and over makeup.\"\n\nLindsay Ellingson\n\nModel, beauty expert, co-founder of Wander Beauty\n\nLindsay's picks:\n\nWander Beauty Baggage Claim Eye Masks, Wander Beauty Glow Getter Mist, Wander Beauty Extra Mileage Hair Refresher, Slip Silk Eye Mask, gua sha\n\nLindsay's routine:\n\n\"I apply the Baggage Claim Eye Masks 30 minutes before I land to de-puff and brighten my under eyes, especially if I'm headed straight to a shoot or a meeting. Plus, they won't slide off your face and look chicer than your typical eye mask -- perfect for an in-flight selfie.\"\n\nNyja Richardson\n\nContent creator\n\nNyja's picks:\n\nHonest wipes, Lavender mist, shea butter, Jason coconut toothpaste, Thayers Witch Hazel, bonnet or headscarf\n\nNyja's routine:\n\n\"Honest wipes are a must-have for me, especially when traveling with a toddler. Planes aren't always the cleanest so I like to wipe down our section prior to take off.\"\n\n\"I also use Thayers Witch Hatzel when I want to clean my face.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/michelle-lee-02-ht-jt-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
