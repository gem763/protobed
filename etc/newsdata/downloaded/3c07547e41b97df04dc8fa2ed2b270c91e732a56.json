Mr Hoffman has worked as commonwealth deputy secretary and secretary of the NSW Department of Finance, Services and Innovation. He has also held senior jobs at several private corporations. NDIS Minister Stuart Robert told Sky News Mr Hoffman is \u201can extraordinary Australian\u201d and has \"lived some trauma and tragedy in his own life, so understands full well\". Mr Robert said the board would determine whether Mr Hoffman will be based at the NDIA\u2019s Geelong headquarters. \"Where they live is largely irrelevant,\" Mr Robert said. \"I want him to spend an inordinate amount of time outside of the headquarters. Work doesn't get done sitting behind a desk.\" The agency recently created 800 new public servant jobs, with 300 employed so far, Robert said.", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
