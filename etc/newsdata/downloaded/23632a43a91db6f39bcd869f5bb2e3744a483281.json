Google hasn\u2019t responded to The Verge\u2019s request for comment to confirm.\n\nThe idea for Clips was an intriguing one: it was a tiny AI-powered wide angle camera designed to automatically capture short videos of precious moments with your loved ones. In theory, by setting up a Clips camera in your house, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about quick-drawing your phone to record your baby\u2019s first steps.\n\nIn practice, though, Clips didn\u2019t seem to work quite as well as Google\u2019s pitch said it would. In his review, my colleague Dan Seifert found that Clips didn\u2019t capture anything truly special over a couple of weeks of testing. My colleague Sean Hollister felt similarly, saying that, out of the 500 clips he took while reviewing the device, there were only \u201cmaybe a dozen I truly loved enough to share.\u201d Priced at a rather steep $249, both reviewers found it hard to justify the Clips\u2019 high cost.\n\nI\u2019ve never actually seen anyone use Google Clips. And if I asked five of my most tech-aware friends about it, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d even know what it is. So I can\u2019t say it\u2019s surprising that the product is headed for the Google graveyard, but I do still think the concept has promise.", "description": "Google may have introduced a lot of new Pixel camera tech this week, but it quietly retired a camera product as well: the Google Clips camera has been removed from Google\u2019s online store.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BXxc8Z0kBK0Qw0Wu7NLAnSoexo=/0x249:2040x1317/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10301621/jbareham_180221_2303_0192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
