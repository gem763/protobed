Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to recent Insider polling.\n\nIn our polling, we ask respondents who they would be satisfied with in the event the candidate became nominee, and who they would be dissatisfied with.\n\nRight now, 27% of likely Democratic voters would be dissatisfied with Biden. That's higher than the 21% of Democratic primary voters who would be dissatisfied with Sanders as nominee, and the 15% who would be unhappy if Warren was the nominee.\n\nAmong voters who'd be satisfied with Sanders, Biden is considered unsatisfactory by 32%. Just nine percent of Sanders supports would be dissatisfied with Warren and just over 9% dislike Mayor Pete Buttigieg, while 18% dislike Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd among voters who support Warren, Biden is the second-most unpopular of the candidates, after author and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson.\n\nBiden has been steadily shedding support since he announced his 2020 presidential bid last April \u2014 and he's particularly vulnerable to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe number of self-identified Democratic primary voters who'd be satisfied with a Biden presidency has consistently declined, dropping from a high of 71% in February to 56% in October, according to Insider polling.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Democrats who'd be unsatisfied if Biden were to win the nomination has jumped since early this year. That number has approximately doubled from about 14% in January to 27% in October.\n\nDuring the same period, support for a Warren presidency among Biden backers has steadily risen from 42% last December to 57% in October. Among Biden supporters, Warren is by far the candidate favored by the highest percentage of Biden supporters, by far.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
