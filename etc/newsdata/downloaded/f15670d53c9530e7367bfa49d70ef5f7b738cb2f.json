Courtesy Franklin County Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERS\n\nColumbus police arrested her during her performance at the Sirens Gentlemen\u2019s Club on a misdemeanor sex offense for touching three customers who were undercover vice detectives. The charge was dropped hours later.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a lot more with a jury but we recognized that was the number that would get justice and would get attention and we agreed to that,\u201d attorney Clark Brewster told reporters from the courthouse steps, standing alongside Daniels.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, filed suit in federal court in January, alleging police were politically motivated when they arrested her. She originally sought $2 million in damages.\n\nDaniels has described having an affair with Trump before he became president and receiving hush money through his former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to directing payments of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal to avert a scandal shortly before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump has denied having the encounters more than a decade ago with Daniels and McDougal.\n\nDaniels\u2019 lawsuit alleged the Columbus vice unit officers who arrested her were registered Republicans, as is the president, and retaliated by arresting her during her performance.\n\nBrewster, Daniels\u2019 lawyer, credited city officials for how they handled the case.\n\n\u201cThe city of Columbus took responsibility and understood it and did a proper investigation and was critical of their own people. And today we got this case settled,\u201d Brewster said.\n\nDaniels said she would use the money to pay her legal bills and that she was about to start touring as a stand-up comedian.\n\n\u201cTo do any of this, you have to have a good sense of humor,\u201d Daniels told reporters, adding she was proud of how Columbus \u201ctook responsibility and is actively making changes and holding those officers accountable.\u201d\n\nDaniels and her lawyer offered no further details of what changes police would institute, and the Columbus city attorney\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeredith Tucker, a spokeswoman for the city attorney\u2019s office, told other media the parties reached a settlement of $450,000 during mediation, an amount that was \u201cfair given the facts and circumstances involved.\u201d\n\n(This story has been refiled to correct typographical error in first paragraph.)", "description": "Porn star Stormy Daniels has settled a lawsuit against the city of Columbus, Ohio, for $450,000, receiving the payout after she charged that police arrested at a strip club in retaliation for her claim that she had an affair with Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Daniel Trotta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434706560&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q20V", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
