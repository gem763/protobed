Discussions are underway between the Crown Prosecution Service and Northamptonshire Police. If police submit a file of evidence meeting the US extradition threshold, she could be extradited to face justice here. Anne Sacoolas The deal between the US and the UK is set out in the Extradition Act 2003. The CPS must first send a request to the US State Department via the British Embassy in Washington. The critical test is that prosecutors must provide \u2018such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested\u2019. The US Constitution states that suspects cannot be arrested unless the authorities have \u2018probable cause\u2019 for their action. Is it unprecedented? The circumstances of the case may be unusual but extradition requests to the US are not uncommon. An independent review, which was led by the former Court of Appeal judge Sir Scott Baker into extradition between the two countries, revealed in 2011 that there were 54 requests from the UK to the US between January 2004 and July 2011 and none were refused. What happens next? Detectives have given prosecutors an initial file showing their progress in the investigation. But they have yet to submit a full file of evidence. Once a file is submitted, prosecutors will consider whether criminal charges can be brought and whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and whether it is in the public interest to bring charges. If the evidence in this case passes that test, an extradition request could be made to the US for her arrest.\n\nMr Dunn told his son he would be sedated because it was 'for the best' and said he would see him in hospital.\n\nThese were the last words between father and son because Harry never woke up.\n\nIt is exactly seven weeks since US citizen Anne Sacoolas allegedly drove on the wrong side of the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire and collided with Harry's motorbike.\n\nThe 42-year-old, whose husband Jonathan worked as US intelligence official at the base, claimed diplomatic immunity and left the UK.\n\nAfter flying to the US, Harry's parents are on a campaign to get her to return.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in New York, his mother Charlotte Charles said: 'She needs to do the right thing and come back and face what she has done. Face our family. Face the UK justice system.'\n\nMrs Charles added: 'She needs to set an example to her own children. You can't run away from something this terrible.\n\n'CCTV shows that she was driving on the wrong side of the road, then you see Harry's headlight over the brow of the hill and the next you see is a fireball when his bike went up.'\n\nMrs Sacoolas's lawyers released a statement at the weekend describing the death of Harry as a 'tragic accident'.\n\nThey said Mrs Sacoolas wants to meet his family so that she can 'express her deepest sympathies and apologies'.\n\nBut it stopped short of offering to help their quest for justice by returning to the UK.\n\nMrs Charles said: 'We feel that statement should have come out right from the beginning, instead of getting on a plane and running home.\n\n'We've heard her statement but we don't know how sincere it was. Just hearing it from a statement is a little too little too late I'm afraid.\n\n'To have to go through all this, to get an apology, just in writing, it's just wrong. We promised Harry when we lost him that night in the hospital that we would make sure justice was done.'\n\nBreaking down in tears, Mrs Charles added: 'I have a feeling at the pit of my tummy every morning knowing I have lost a child \u2013 telling us that something is not right. All of our grief has gone on hold.'\n\nHarry Dunn's mother Charolotte broke down as she told a press conference in New York that Anne Sacoolas, the American woman suspected of causing her son's death, should be brought back to the UK to face justice\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, (pictured) was killed after Sacoolas, 42, crashed her Volvo SUV into him near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nAsked what he would say to US President Donald Trump if he got the chance to meet him, Mr Dunn said: 'I would say to him as a man, as a father, how could you let this happen.\n\n'If you are a father and your child died surely you'd want that person to own up and take responsibility for their actions.'\n\nOn Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Harry's family saying that Mrs Sacoolas no longer had diplomatic immunity from potential prosecution because her husband Jonathan had left his posting at the RAF base.\n\nIf Northamptonshire Police submit a file of evidence which meets the US extradition threshold, she could be extradited to face justice here.", "description": "Tim Dunn (pictured), who had reached the scene of the accident in the UK when the 19-year-old was still alive, said: 'I could see broken bones coming out of his arms, but he was talking.", "authors": ["Arthur Martin In New York For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19716750-0-image-a-25_1571097189563.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
