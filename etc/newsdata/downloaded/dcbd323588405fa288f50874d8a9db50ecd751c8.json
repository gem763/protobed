But for all the work that she did, for us, she was always a saint,\u201d Creusa Costa, 59, told AFP, as she decorated a statue of Sister Dulce with flowers at the entrance of her sanctuary in a poor neighborhood of the capital of Bahia state.\n\nMost new saints must have two \u201cmiracles\u201d to their names \u2014 usually scientifically inexplicable healings, attributed to prayers.\n\nSister Dulce, who died in 1992, is the first Brazilian-born female saint.\n\nShe is credited with stopping a woman from hemorrhaging after giving birth and returning the vision of a man who had been blind for years.\n\nIn the week since the Vatican ceremony, the number of people paying homage to Sister Dulce at her shrine in the coastal city has surged.\n\nBelievers from across the country take pictures of the white and blue habit worn by the nun when she was buried or talk to her in the room where her remains are kept beneath a ceramic replica of her body.\n\n\u201cShe is in heaven, but she\u2019s looking after us even more than when she was here,\u201d said Maria Silva de Oliveira, who along with Creusa, was involved in decorating the Fonte Nova football stadium \u2014 one of the venues for the 2014 World Cup \u2014 for a special ceremony organized by the Salvador Archdiocese.\n\nDe Oliveira had planned to attend the Vatican sainthood event, but changed her mind after suffering indigestion \u2014 which she says \u201cwas a message from Sister Dulce.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Good angel\u2019 \u2013\n\nBorn into an upper middle-class family in Salvador, Sister Dulce started a health clinic for poor workers and opened a school, a hospital, and an orphanage, as well as care centres for the elderly and disabled.\n\nThe nun, dubbed the \u201cgood angel of Bahia\u201d, was a member of the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nShe was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.\n\nThe year before her death she was visited in hospital by Pope John Paul II, who called her work \u201can example for humanity\u201d.\n\nSince her rise to sainthood, Sister Dulce\u2019s face has been plastered all over Salvador, a popular tourist destination.\n\nIt appears on signs, T-shirts, hats, rosaries, cups and even the wrapping of sweet Christmas bread.\n\nMulticoloured ribbons that usually pay homage to Senhor do Bomfim, or Lord of the Good End \u2014 a representation of Christ revered by Catholics as well as practitioners of the African-rooted Candomble religion \u2014 now also carry the name of \u201cSaint Dulce of the Poor.\u201d", "description": "Salvador (Brazil) (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of Catholic faithful flocked to a football stadium in \u00a0Brazil Sunday to celebrate the Vatican\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/43b584_nuns-queue-canoninization-ceremony-brazil-female-saint-in-salvador-bahia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
