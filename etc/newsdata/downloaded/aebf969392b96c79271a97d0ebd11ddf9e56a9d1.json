During the speech, Zuckerberg stated that Facebook would not be fact-checking political ads on its platform and was committed to free speech.\n\nDorsey stated during the Twitter News Summit in New York City that there was a \u201cmajor gap and flaw\u201d in Zuckerberg\u2019s argument for free speech and called Zuckerberg\u2019s comments about the creation of Facebook \u201crevisionist history.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about speech and expression and we don\u2019t talk about reach enough, and we don\u2019t talk about amplification. And reach and amplification was not represented in that speech,\u201d Dorsey said, according to journalist Sarah Frier. Dorsey stated that Facebook\u2019s algorithm boosts promoted posts on the platform so that people can essentially pay to reach a larger audience which he believes is a \u201cmajor gap and flaw in the substance he as getting across.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg stated during his Georgetown University speech that Facebook was created in response to the Iraq War, saying: \u201cIf more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently.\u201d This is the first time that Zuckerberg has made this claim, previously it was said that Facebook was created as a tool to rank Harvard students\u2019 attractiveness, this was even a major plot point of the film made about Facebook, the Social Network.\n\nDorsey commented on Zuckerberg\u2019s Iraq War claims stating: \u201cThere\u2019s some amount of revisionist history in all his storytelling. It takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nDorsey was asked if he would consider joining Libra, Facebook\u2019s new cryptocurrency to which he quickly replied \u201chell no.\u201d Dorsey stated: \u201cCryptocurrency wasn\u2019t necessary for them to make that thing work. it\u2019s not an internet open standard. It was born out of a company\u2019s intention. That was not consistent with what I personally believe and want our company to stand for.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
