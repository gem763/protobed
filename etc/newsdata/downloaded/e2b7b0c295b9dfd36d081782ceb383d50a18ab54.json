But Patrick Corbin, the ace who signed a six-year, $140 million dollar contract as a free agent before this season, won\u2019t be one.\n\nThe left-handed starting pitcher has excelled on the mound \u2014 Corbin is 12-7 with an ERA of 3.20 in 30 starts going into his next outing \u2014 while dealing with personal loss off the field, including the death of one his best friends.\n\nTyler Skaggs, a pitcher with the Los Angeles Angels, died July 1 in Texas at the team hotel at the age of 27 before a series with the Texas Rangers.\n\nBoth pitchers were drafted in 2009 by the Angels and were teammates with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2012-13.\n\n\u201cI knew him personally,\u201d Corbin told The Washington Times, talking quietly at his locker last week. \u201cIt was tough for a lot of people. You feel for the family and his wife.\u201d\n\nAdding to the tragedy was published reports in August that he died from a mix of alcohol, fentanyl, and oxycodone. The manner of death was ruled an accident, with the Skaggs family claiming in a statement that an Angels employee may have been involved in his death.\n\n\u201cIt is tough to comment on that,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what people are doing on their own time. He was just a great person to be around.\u201d\n\nCorbin was one of several Major League players who attended the funeral of Skaggs in Santa Monica, where Skaggs\u2019 mother is a high school softball coach.\n\nThe day after the death of Skaggs, Corbin started at home against the Miami Marlins and gave up just one run on six hits in seven innings. Corbin didn\u2019t get the decision as the Nationals won 3-2. Corbin normally wears No. 46 but he wore No. 45 in that game to honor Skaggs.\n\nSince then, the 30-year-old from upstate New York posted a 1.95 ERA in six starts in July, a mark of 2.78 in five outings in August and a 3.71 ERA in three starts this month.\n\nCorbin\u2019s next start is Tuesday night at the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u201cHe is a true professional,\u201d Nationals pitching coach Paul Menhart said.\n\nThe lefty is overshadowed on a staff that includes Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. \u201cYou can talk to these guys and pick their brains,\u201d Corbin said.\n\nBut the Nationals feel good about their chances with that trio if they can hold on to the top wild-card spot in the National League.\n\n\u201cHis preparation is equal to Strasburg and Max,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cWe have confidence in all three of them. They are not afraid of the big stage.\u201d\n\nCorbin\u2019s slider, which breaks down and into lefty hitters, is his money pitch. But Menhart said he has gained more confidence in his changeup as the year has progressed.\n\nCorbin made his MLB debut with Arizona in 2012 and the next season he was a National League all-star as he went 14-8 with the Diamondbacks.\n\nHe was also named to the National League all-star team in 2018 with Arizona, as he finished the year 11-7 with a 3.15 ERA in a career-high 33 starts.\n\nAs a free agent, he attracted attention from several teams, including the rival Philadelphia Phillies of the National League East.\n\nCorbin said his roots near Syracuse didn\u2019t play a huge role in going with a team on the East Coast.\n\n\u201cThose were the teams that were interested,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cWe enjoyed our time in Arizona. We loved living there, even in the off-season.\u201d\n\nCorbin said his family in New York now doesn\u2019t have to stay up as late to watch games that he pitches in Washington and throughout the East Coast. He and his wife, Jen, bought a place in Florida since she enjoys being near the water.\n\nThe Nationals checked most of the boxes that Corbin was looking for in a new team.\n\n\u201cIt is just a great group of guys. It is a good team and it is fun to be part of,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously you want to win. It was the first time in my career to go see teams. The Nationals were at the top of the list. The starting rotation that they have, the young talent they have and a front office that wants to win, there was nothing not to like.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
