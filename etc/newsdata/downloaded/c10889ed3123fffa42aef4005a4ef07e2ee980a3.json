Rather than hoard its biggest secrets in teasing reserve, \u201cWatchmen\u201d comes across like a smart, swift kick to the gut.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd as far as all that comic-book/superhero/antihero business goes, just forget it. I promise that even the most genre-averse among us can absorb \u201cWatchmen\u201d (which premieres Sunday) without feeling like we forgot to study for the test. At the same time, fans of the original can relish \u201cWatchmen\u2019s\u201d sublime handling of the mythology, spirit and complex tone of the material. It\u2019s strewn with little gifts made special for them.\n\nOf the six episodes made available for this review (there are nine in all), the first hour may be the only hurdle for viewers, as we\u2019re fully immersed in a warped America with plenty of WTFs, including stray references to the fact that Robert Redford has been president for decades \u2014 after Richard Nixon served multiple successful terms and Vietnam gained statehood.\n\nThe show opens with a horrific flashback to the 1921 massacre in Tulsa, a racist attack on the thriving African American community of Greenwood that left hundreds dead and injured \u2014 the details of which were successfully scrubbed from history for decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWatchmen\u201d uses the real-life massacre as a catalyst for the alternate history that follows. In the show\u2019s present-day Tulsa, police officers don yellow masks that mostly obscure their faces, for their protection, particularly against an uprising of white supremacists called the Seventh Kavalry.\n\nTechnological advancements abound in this version of 2019: flying squad cars, subservient clones, special phone booths for making calls to Mars, brief storms of interdimensional phenomena and a pharmaceutical drug called Nostalgia that mentally replays one\u2019s life experiences. They have everything, with one notable exception: There appears to be no Internet in \u201cWatchmen\u2019s\u201d world.\n\nTulsa\u2019s black community has seemingly thrived in a national effort to correct racial discrimination. This includes financial reparations, which are derisively referred to as \u201cRedfordations\u201d by the local racists, most of whom live in a trailer park ghetto on the edge of town called Nixonville. A cultural heritage center exists where Greenwood once stood; inside, a hologram version of U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Louis Gates Jr. (as himself) stands by to test visitors\u2019 DNA connections to the race riot\u2019s victims.\n\nRegina King stars as Angela Abar, a wife and mother of three who is about to open her own bakery. That\u2019s her cover, anyhow. Angela\u2019s real job is as a rogue detective, part of an elite squad overseen by police chief Judd Crawford (Don Johnson). In her hooded black cloak and mask, Angela does her most effective work as Sister Night, alongside such colleagues as Looking Glass (Tim Blake Nelson) and Red Scare (Andrew Howard).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey are regarded less as superheroes than as a controversial approach to law enforcement. The coolest thing about \u201cWatchmen\u201d is the way it upends one\u2019s personal understanding of the line between heroism and vigilantism, well beyond a Batman-style paradigm. The idea and meaning behind wearing a mask is constantly in play, connoting both good and evil. As Angela moves through this fraught territory between identity and morality, King gives a performance that is both glorious and vulnerable. By now, we shouldn\u2019t expect anything less from the Emmy and Oscar winner. It is settled science that she can do no wrong.\n\nWhile the TV addicts in \u201cWatchmen\u2019s\u201d America are glued to an event miniseries about complicated superheroes of the recent past (a deft, show-within-a-show device to acquaint us with some \u201cWatchmen\u201d lore), there\u2019s the constant unease of the hooded history and malicious presence of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAn unspeakable crime occurs early on, requiring the arrival of FBI Special Agent Laurie Blake, played by Jean Smart, who savors every brilliant line she\u2019s given. Even though \u201cWatchmen\u201d is rife with acts of gaslighting and conspiracy, Laurie\u2019s presence has a clarifying effect. Less clear, at first, is the purpose of the centenarian in a wheelchair played by Louis Gossett Jr., a link between Tulsa\u2019s bloody past and tenuous present.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy now, it sounds like I\u2019m describing a fever dream instead of another prestige cable drama, but that\u2019s what so delicious about it. (And I never even got around to discussing Jeremy Irons\u2019s bizarre character and his futile but fascinating plight.) All I can say is I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about the show; the last time I felt so rapturously overpowered was with David Lynch\u2019s masterful 2017 sequel to \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d for Showtime. It\u2019s a rare and marvelous moment, to be so challenged \u2014 yet dazzled \u2014 by what one is seeing.\n\nAnd not to play favorites among networks (which I strenuously avoid), but we are in the early days of a vicious streaming-TV war, which will gobble up whatever\u2019s left of our leisure time and home-entertainment dollars. Apple TV+ and Disney+ will be here in a few weeks with extra content to consume. We have Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu \u2014 and more on the way, including an expanded streaming service from HBO. Some tough choices will need to be made.\n\n\u201cWatchmen\u201d is a grand reminder, therefore, that HBO is an essential part of whatever configuration you call television. The show is made with the kind of precision and thought that HBO\u2019s competitors (especially Netflix) only occasionally achieve, and it\u2019s all the indication anyone needs that, yes, there is life after \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\n(Correction: An earlier online version of this review incorrectly said that Robert Redford appears as himself in a later episode of \u201cWatchmen.\u201d Redford is not in the cast. The review has been updated.)\n\nWatchmen (one hour) premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO.\n\nAD", "description": "Creator Damon Lindelof lands a perfect punch in this topical take on the \u201980s graphic novel.", "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Tv Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mDqQvdv0zMvNAQgLnb6a8varAX4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4FM6Q6GVP4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
