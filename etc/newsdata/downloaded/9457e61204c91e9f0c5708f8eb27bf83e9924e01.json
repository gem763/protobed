Tanker operators expect disruptions to run into October.\n\nPrices to move crude cargoes are already rising, shipping executives said, as buyers seek oil from sources like the U.S. that will require longer trips to customers in Asia.\n\nBrokers in Singapore and Europe say crude loadings at Ras Tanura, the major oil export port for the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.\u2019s oil plant in Abqaiq that was struck by missiles on Saturday are largely idle for certain types of crude cargoes, with at least eight supertankers waiting outside the terminal.\n\nParis-based shipping tracking service Kpler said three product tankers that move refined products like gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel have been diverted from loading their cargo at neighboring Al Jubail, a global hub for chemical products, and six more were expected to be diverted in coming days.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for instructions from the client to pull out and load elsewhere,\u201d said an executive of a Greek tanker operator that has a product tanker waiting at Ras Tanura. \u201cEveryone is losing money waiting for loadings, so we\u2019ll move on to pick up cargo from elsewhere.\u201d\n\nShip owners said finding alternatives to pick up specific types of crude can be complicated as refineries are tailored to produce specific types of products.\n\n\u201cAmerican refiners have the capacity to produce crude for Asian demand, so they will see more orders,\u201d Mr. Lazarides said, adding that Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait can also supply the market.\n\nStill, he said, \u201cthe Saudis are big players and it won\u2019t be easy for Asian importers to find alternative sources.\u201d\n\nBrokers said that the U.S. and other energy producers can provide up to 1 million barrels a day of crude out of the roughly 5.7 million barrels that are currently offline in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOwners and oil traders said tanker demand could be hurt if Asian importers such as China, India, South Korea and Japan choose to tap into their reserves, but they can\u2019t rely on reserves for more than 10 days without supplies falling to critical levels.\n\nParis-based financial services provider Kepler Cheuvreux said the impact of the Saudi disruptions on tanker freight rates \u201cis likely to be very positive\u201d as tankers will have to travel longer distances from oil sourcing centers like the U.S to reach Asian clients.\n\nVery large crude carrier, or VLCC, rates from the U.S. Gulf to the Far East rose to more than $37,000 a day this week, from around $28,000 on Friday before the attacks.\n\n\u201cPeople think this is just the start of more trouble and there is a real risk this will lead to a war with Iran,\u201d said Ralph Leszczynski, an analyst at Italian ship-chartering firm Banchero Costa.\n\n\u201cBuyers will rush to secure cargoes fearing supply shortages in coming months. This would lead to more shipping volumes and higher tanker rates in the short term,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "U.S. crude shipments are set to rise as major Asian importers look to replenish supplies after attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities took out a big chunk of global oil output.", "authors": ["Costas Paris"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107831/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
