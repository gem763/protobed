As a result, there are massive amounts of readily-available data that have intensified debates around data privacy and protection. Now, there\u2019s a movement in the insurance industry to leverage new forms of surveillance to assess risk during the underwriting process of life insurance policies (the process of assessing a potential customer\u2019s risk).\n\nNaturally, conversations on what that means for consumers have followed, touching on the clear privacy concerns of using social media and other implicit data. However, there are important questions that remain unsettled concerning how the use of the data will impact consumers\u2019 life insurance policies.\n\nThe life insurance industry strives to protect consumers from unfair discrimination. As new forms of data become accessible, we need to continue to avoid discrimination and bias. Big data is shaping the next wave of technology, and the industry will harness its power to create better products and experiences.\n\nHowever, we need to innovate in a way that puts the public good first. There are more factors to scrutinize as we continue to have conversations about using various types of online data to assess an individual\u2019s risk, particularly as more laws and guidelines surrounding data sharing and privacy are implemented.\n\nIt\u2019s Silicon Valley\u2019s responsibility to turn the tides and put the good of the user first\n\nWe live in a world where incidents like Cambridge Analytica are becoming the norm \u2014 which is why I\u2019m an advocate for consumer privacy. The insurtech space \u2014 and the life insurance space specifically \u2014 should question any practice that interferes with fostering customer trust.\n\nThis steps away from traditional life insurance practices that don\u2019t have the customer\u2019s best interest in mind, such as upselling consumers on expensive policies. As the industry evolves and adapts more advanced technology and analyzes more complex data, we need to take note from other industries hit with privacy scandals to avoid the same mistakes.\n\nIt is increasingly common for life insurance companies to use \u201cnon-traditional\u201d sources of public data, like credit scores, court documents, and motor vehicle records, but the use of that data still needs to be ethical. It should be used to inform insurance underwriting decisions only, while still protecting the consumer first.\n\nInsurance will always be a data-driven industry \u2014 it\u2019s how we make informed decisions on anything from marketing to underwriting \u2014 but consumer protection has to be at the forefront.\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2020, which will enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California by giving them improved control of their data. This new privacy regime will eventually become a widespread standard.\n\nInstead of viewing California\u2019s act as an obstacle, insurance companies should look at it as an opportunity to improve their privacy practices and get ahead of future legal changes. Ultimately, the industry needs to continuously champion privacy practices that will set the groundwork for innovation and consumer trust.\n\nOpting in to share fitness data can cause adverse selection if companies aren\u2019t careful\n\nWhile sharing fitness tracker data could benefit some people applying for life insurance policies, it poses the risk of creating inaccurate data pools. The nature of an opt-in program could negatively impact those who choose not to participate. Additionally, the data from those who do opt-in may not provide an honest representation of health status.\n\nStudies have shown many fitness trackers have error rates of 10 to 20 percent and that one in three users stops wearing the device within six months of buying it. This would suggest fitness tracker data hasn\u2019t quite yet proven to be a reliable source of health information.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent analysis found \u201cthere is strong evidence that physical activity, as measured by steps per day, is a powerful predictor of mortality.\u201d This indicates there is still a great opportunity to use fitness data to benefit the customer, if we can overcome certain hurdles and prove it\u2019s possible to avoid adverse selection.\n\nIncentivizing customers by giving them discounted premiums in exchange for their fitness data encourages people to maintain good health. Unlike the health insurance space, which profits off of bad health, the life insurance space is aligned with finding ways to keep people healthy and thriving.\n\nWe need to ensure future practices don\u2019t become invasive\n\nInformation derived from people\u2019s social media profiles, like Instagram (in most cases), is likely not substantive or actionable enough for underwriting. On top of that, analyzing Instagram data for life insurance could create biases and get in the way of fostering customer trust. It\u2019s high risk, low reward.\n\nUsing the Fair Credit Reporting Act as a standard, today\u2019s social media data sources don\u2019t pass with regard to ensuring that risk assessments are noninvasive and anti-discriminatory.\n\nThe insurance industry is ripe for innovation \u2014 as long as it\u2019s ethical\n\nWe\u2019re seeing various states in the US move at different paces in terms of leveraging genetic data, and there are two sides of the argument as it stands today. Using genetic information can lead to adverse selection and could negatively impact some customers. On the other hand, just the existence of usable genetic and healthcare data could usher in an era of product innovation that hasn\u2019t been seen in decades.\n\nMIT Technology Review predicts more than 100 million people will be part of genetic databases within the next two years, and the consumer genetic testing industry is expected to be worth $45 billion by 2024, so it\u2019s likely such information will be used in various parts of our lives.\n\nThe question is, how will it be used ethically? Existing laws are not up to par for protecting the privacy of this massive database of genetic information, so there\u2019s not a clear moral path for insurers to follow \u2014 right now.\n\nWhile these forms of data aren\u2019t perfect sources of information right now, there will be legislative protections put in place to make better use of implicit data. It\u2019s also important to understand the rationale that life insurance companies go through during the underwriting process and ensure that it\u2019s for good reason: to provide consumers with the best policy for their needs.\n\nThe life insurance space has a strong track record of the ethical usage of data because of its commitment to avoiding discrimination and will continue to do so.", "description": "With incidents like Cambridge Analytica becoming the norm, the insurtech space should question any practice that interferes with fostering customer trust.", "authors": ["Peter Colis", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design122.png&signature=5895da72f1dc53606b64123976d4e698", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
