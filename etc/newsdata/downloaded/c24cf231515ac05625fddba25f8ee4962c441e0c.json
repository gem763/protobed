But navigating the complex morass of the Middle East is no less complex for the death of Mr. al-Baghdadi . It is not clear if the president\u2019s decision to pull back American forces in northern Syria in recent weeks complicated the planning and execution of the mission.\n\nAnd while the raid achieved its goal, it did little to resolve the question of whether Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct for disengagement will create room for new strains of violent radicalism that he and his successors will be forced to clean up.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the aftermath of the Bin Laden killing eight years ago should also sound a warning.\n\nEven without its leader, Al Qaeda evolved and spread. The Islamic State began its killing spree in the vacuum of the Middle East by early 2014, in both Iraq and Syria. Mr. Trump himself, in the heat of the 2016 campaign, accused Mr. Obama of creating the conditions for a new iteration of Islamic terrorism to prosper.\n\n\u201cHe was the founder,\u201d Mr. Trump said in August 2016, talking about Mr. Obama and ISIS. \u201cThe way he got out of Iraq, that was the founding of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe history of the Middle East is rife with the rise of extremist movements, and there is no reason to believe ISIS will be the last. Long after the cinematic details of the daring raid \u2014 from its patient beginnings in Iraq last summer to the tense flight into Syria and the chase down a sealed tunnel where Mr. al-Baghdadi met his end \u2014 the enduring question will be whether the Trump administration capitalizes on the moment to address the region\u2019s deep sectarian and political fissures and the underlying causes of terrorism.\n\nClint Watts of the Foreign Policy Research Institute wrote on Sunday that \u201cal-Baghdadi\u2019s death will dash the dreams of an Islamic State centered in the Levant, but its years of operations recruited, trained and dispatched foreign fighters from dozens of countries that will lead the next generation of jihad to other frontiers.\u201d", "description": "The president cast the death of the ISIS leader as validation of his disengagement strategy.
