Soon after it was put into liquidation when its administrators could find no willing buyer.\n\nThose administrators, from accounting firm BDO, have been pursuing the recovery of money ever since to help cover the \u00a37 million (R130 million) owed to creditors. The \u00a34 million in profits pocketed by 44 partners \u2013 money the administrators say they should not have received \u2013 would go a long way to paying off those debts. The latest report from the administrators show that 12 former partners have repaid \u00a3157,000 (around R3 million) of that already, the Financial Times reported this week. Nine more partners have agreed to give back \u00a3311,000 (nearly R6 million) \u2013 but two partners have been unreachable, and 17 have not agreed to repay money. Although the partners involved are not identified in the report, The Telegraph said Henderson is \"wrangling\" over his share, worth R7.5 million. Partners in the firm \u2013 especially those involved in the Gupta contract \u2013 may still face a legal claim from administrators on the basis that they had breached partnership agreements and brought the company into disrepute.\n\n(Compiled by Phillip de Wet)\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Former bosses of the UK public relations firm closely tied to the Gupta family have promised to give back around R9 million to cover debts, but CEO James Henderson is apparently not cooperating with liquidators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6473/d829e668e6784485a40ea833528a7959.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
