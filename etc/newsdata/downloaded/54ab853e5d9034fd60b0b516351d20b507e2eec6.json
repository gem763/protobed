(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nA Syrian constitutional committee made up of opposition, civil society and government members has been finalized after almost two years of negotiations, the United Nations announced Monday.\n\nThe 150-member committee, proposed during a peace conference hosted by Russia in January 2018, will rewrite the Syrian constitution.\n\nThe long-awaited announcement of the committee\u2019s formation came during a visit to Damascus by the U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, who held talks with Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem.\n\nIn a statement, U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the \u201cSyrian-owned and Syrian-led\u201d constitutional committee will be facilitated by the United Nations in Geneva, and he thanked Russia, Turkey and Iran for their diplomatic efforts. Russia and Iran are allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the Syrian opposition.\n\n[Dueling U.N. resolutions on Syria both fail, leaving millions at risk]\n\nDuring a summit last week between the Russian, Turkish and Iranian presidents, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that agreement had been reached on the makeup of the committee and that it would begin work \u201cas soon as possible in a coordinated manner with the U.N.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Syrian government is satisfied with the agreement that was reached; we are optimistic, and we look forward to good work from this committee,\u201d Mohammed Khair Akkam, a Syrian lawmaker and a member of the government\u2019s delegation to the Geneva talks, said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe consider the formation of the committee and its launch a step or key toward finding a political solution in Syria, a step toward executing international law,\u201d said Yahya al-Aridi, a spokesman for the opposition High Negotiations Committee.\n\n\u201cOur concern is Syrian rights, and if the regime\u2019s concern is to hold on to the seat of power, no effort will lead to any solution.\u201d\n\nNasr al-Hariri, the head of the High Negotiations Committee, said the first meeting could be held in Geneva within a month.\n\nThe committee will be made up of 50 opposition members, 50 representing the government and 50 representing civil society.\n\n[Assad urged Syrian refugees to come home. Many are being welcomed with arrest and interrogation.]\n\nAfter eight years of conflict, the bulk of Syria has returned under government control, with various opposition groups holding parts of the northwest and U.S.-backed Kurdish groups holding the northeast.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northern and eastern Syria issued a statement rejecting the constitutional committee, saying the Kurds had been sidelined in the process.\n\n\u201cThe absence of any side means the absence of democracy in the constitution,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAkkam, the Syrian lawmaker, dismissed the criticism. \u201cThose who are acting at the behest of the Americans do not get to complain about their lack of representation,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nU.N. to investigate accusations that Russia, Syria are deliberately targeting hospitals\n\nAllies decline request to stay in Syria after U.S. troops withdraw\n\n\u2018They screwed this whole thing up\u2019: Inside the attempt to derail Trump\u2019s erratic Syria withdrawal\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The committee, tasked with drawing up a new Syrian constitution, is expected to meet within a month.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East", "Asser Khattab", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RyzAGfiDkSO7bZzjsKUGPcdd2SM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TTXDRSW6EAI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
