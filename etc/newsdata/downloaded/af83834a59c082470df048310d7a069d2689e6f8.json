Its findings highlight CPSC staff\u2019s failure to understand the risk and undercuts arguments from industry officials that the product category could be made safe with minor changes to voluntary safety codes.\n\nThe study, led by Erin Mannen, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences who specializes in infant biomechanics, found that the product\u2019s design is dangerous.\n\nNewborns are especially susceptible to suffocation in an inclined sleeper because the products appear to make it easier for babies to roll into an unsafe facedown position and puts them in an exhausting fight to maintain a safe posture. The study examined how 10 infants moved in the devices and monitored their blood-oxygen levels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNone of the inclined sleep products that Mannen tested were found to be safe for infant sleep.\n\n\u201cI think this confirms what we\u2019ve been saying all along,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of the safety advocacy group Kids in Danger.\n\nInclined sleepers have been controversial since Fisher-Price invented the category 10 years ago. The devices allowed babies to sleep at a 30-degree angle, violating the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe-sleep guidelines that said babies should sleep on flat surfaces. And Fisher-Price had invented its inclined sleeper based on faulty beliefs about infant sleep and without medical safety testing or input from a pediatrician, according to a Washington Post investigation.\n\nAD\n\nMannen was hired by the CPSC last year as the number of deaths associated with inclined sleepers grew, but staff struggled to pinpoint the problem.\n\nHer study was included in a new CPSC proposal for mandatory safety rules for inclined sleepers. The new rules would effectively ban current models of inclined sleepers.\n\nNew sleepers would be limited to a 10-degree incline, the same limit for bassinets. Mannen\u2019s study found that the suffocation risk to infants disappeared below 10 degrees.\n\nAD", "description": "The CPSC has proposed limiting all infant sleepers to 10-degree inclines to prevent deaths.
