In one, top seed Sarah Kaufman takes on No. 4 Larissa Pacheco. And in the other semifinal, No. 2 Kayla Harrison meets Genah Fabian.\n\nMeanwhile, at welterweight, an eight-man bracket will play itself out led by No. 1 Glaico Franca vs. No. 8 Andre Fialho. The winner meets the winner of No. 4 John Howard vs. No. 5 David Michaud. In the bottom half of the bracket, defending champion Magomed Magomedkerimov, who\u2019s seeded No. 2, takes on No. 7 Chris Curtis, with the winner squaring off against the winner of No. 3 Sadibou Sy vs. No. 6 Ray Cooper III, last year\u2019s runner up.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at each bracket.\n\nWomen\u2019s lightweight\n\nWelterweight\n\nPFL 2019, Playoffs 1 takes place at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, and the card streams on ESPN+ and airs on ESPN2.
