Elizabeth Warren wants to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month for roughly 64 million recipients by raising taxes on the top 2% of earners in the country.\n\nWarren, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, announced her plan ahead of Thursday evening\u2019s third presidential debate. She says her proposal would pull some 4.9 million seniors out of poverty and extend solvency of the perennially underfunded Social Security trust fund by 19 years.\n\nThe proposal, Warren said, would lead to a nearly 25% increase in benefits for the bottom half of earners and a less than 5% increase for people in the top 10% of income distribution in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe need to get our priorities straight,\u201d said Warren, touting her plan in a Medium post as the biggest boost to Social Security in nearly 50 years. \u201cWe should be increasing Social Security benefits and asking the richest Americans to contribute their fair share to the program.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during the New Hampshire state Democratic Party convention, Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019, in Manchester, NH. More\n\nWarren has laid out a series of proposals including ones to end college debt, create universal child care and fight the opioid epidemic that she says she\u2019d fund by taxing the mega wealthy through a $2.75 trillion tax on American households making more than $50 million annually.\n\nBut this plan to bolster Social Security, which will pay out more than $1 trillion in 2019, would also impact Americans who are wealthy, but are far from mega-millionaires.\n\nShe unveiled the plan hours before she hits the stage in Houston for the third round of Democratic presidential debates. The proposal comes at a moment where she and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are neck-and-neck in many polls, but behind former Vice President Joe Biden, as they battle for support from the progressive wing of the Democratic party.\n\nLike the other plans Warren\u2019s floated, the proposal would likely face long odds in making its way through the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nHow it would work\n\nSocial Security, which provides 90% of income for 21% of married recipients and 45% unmarried recipients, is funded by mandatory contributions to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or \u201cFICA,\u201d collected from workers\u2019 paychecks.\n\nThe FICA contribution is 12.4% of wages, with employers and employees splitting those contributions equally at 6.2% each. (Self-employed workers contribute the full 12.4%.) If you\u2019re a wage employee, you contribute 6.2% of your very first dollar of wages to Social Security, and 6.2% of every dollar after that -- up to an annual cap, which is set at $132,900 in 2019.\n\nWarren says if she wins the White House she\u2019ll push to impose a 14.8% Social Security contribution requirement on individual wages above $250,000 -- affecting less than the top 2% of earners -- split equally between employees and employers. She would also require a 14.8% contribution on individuals making at least $250,000, or $400,000 for married couples, in net investment income annually.\n\n\u201cWhile most American workers contribute to Social Security with every dollar they earn, CEOs and other very high earners contribute to Social Security on only a fraction of their pay,\u201d Warren writes of her plan.\n\nShe has plans: Elizabeth Warren: Send executives to jail for their role in the opioid epidemic\n\nTexas in play? Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront\n\nMark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, concurred with Warren that the extra revenue from wealthier taxpayers should keep Social Security solvent until 2054 and would also reduce the deficit. Social Security is currently projected to be solvent until 2035.\n\n\u201cThe net macroeconomic impacts of the reform are small but positive in the long run; the economic benefit of smaller federal government deficits and debt load is largely offset as high-income people reduce their own work hours,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe plan results in a much more progressive Social Security system, as high-income people shoulder the financial burden of the plan, while low- and middle income people benefit substantially. \u201c\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Elizabeth Warren: Raise Social Security $200 per month by taxing rich", "description": "\"We should be increasing Social Security benefits and asking the richest Americans to contribute their fair share to the program,\u201d Elizabeth Warren says.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eT9W2grLSd3c4SH89biffQ--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9NTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/2c4b55abcd909b72bc9a7390d7d27124", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
