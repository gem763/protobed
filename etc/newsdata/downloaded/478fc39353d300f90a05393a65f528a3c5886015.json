Today I\u2019m proud to share that our next-generation console will be called PlayStation 5, and we\u2019ll be launching in time for Holiday 2020.\n\nThese updates may not be a huge surprise, but we wanted to confirm them for our PlayStation fans, as we start to reveal additional details about our vision for the next generation. WIRED magazine covered these updates and more in a story that posted this morning.\n\nThe \u201cmore\u201d refers to something I\u2019m quite excited about \u2013 a preview of the new controller that will ship with PlayStation 5. One of our goals with the next generation is to deepen the feeling of immersion when you play games, and we had the opportunity with our new controller to reimagine how the sense of touch can add to that immersion.\n\nTo that end, there are two key innovations with the PlayStation 5\u2019s new controller. First, we\u2019re adopting haptic feedback to replace the \u201crumble\u201d technology found in controllers since the 5th generation of consoles. With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.\n\nThe second innovation is something we call adaptive triggers, which have been incorporated into the trigger buttons (L2/R2). Developers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain. In combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions. Game creators have started to receive early versions of the new controller, and we can\u2019t wait to see where their imagination goes with these new features at their disposal.\n\nWhile there\u2019s much more to share about PlayStation 5 in the year ahead, we have plenty of blockbuster experiences coming your way on PS4, including Death Stranding, The Last of Us Part II, and Ghost of Tsushima. I\u2019d like to thank all PlayStation fans for continuing the journey with us, as we embark on the future of games.", "description": "", "authors": ["Https", "Blog.Us.Playstation.Com Author Jryan", "Tim Turi", "Stephen Turvey", "Taylor Kurosaki", "Neil Druckmann", "Jim Ryan", "President", "Ceo", "Senior Social Media Specialist"], "top_image": "https://blog.us.playstation.com/tachyon/2019/10/ps-featured-image.jpg?fit=1280,720", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
