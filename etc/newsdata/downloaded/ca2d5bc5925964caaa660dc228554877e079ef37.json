The potential applications are huge.\u201d\n\nThe project also raises the prospect that robots could recognise when students are bored, or that customer service robots could identify when people feel angry or stressed.\n\nRobots could also learnt to identify and avoid aggressive humans that might do them harm, try to soothe antagonistic behaviour and even call the police for help if they feel like they are in danger, Dr Edmunds said.\n\n\"Eventually you could expect a robot to understand as subtly as a human could.\"", "description": "Robots can be trained to recognise specific human body language and teach it to children with autism, a new study has shown.", "authors": ["Natasha Bernal", "Robin Pagnamenta", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000188618338-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_MBhvjUqhIfRd2_dxg_gJ28nGi5dnbzU1Uvp1fqu20E.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
