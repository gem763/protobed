If he would like to have the stamps back, he is welcome to buy them at auction.\u201d\n\nThe father and son have been estranged since Nick\u2019s mother, Sue, filed for divorce from Bill in 2016, after more than three decades of marriage.\n\nSue claimed in court papers that her ex, who founded PIMCO \u2014 the Pacific Investment Management Co. \u2014 left their home in Irvine Cove, Calif., a smelly mess at the time, leaving empty bottles of \u201cpuke\u201d and \u201cfart\u201d smells in the garbage and dead fish in the vents. Bill denied the accusation.\n\nBill, who has two other children from a previous marriage, was caught off guard last week when he learned through another collector that Nick was selling the \u201cJennys,\u201d said the source close to his camp.\n\nNick has been the drummer for the rock band Open Air Stereo, which was featured on MTV\u2019s Laguna Beach, and is currently playing with another group, Half the Animal.\n\nHis dad is now \u201cexploring options\u2019\u2019 to keep the stamp sale from going through, the source said.\n\nBill first came to stamp collecting as a child, when his mother had given him a book of stamps that would help him pay for college \u2014 only to find out later that the stamps were worthless, he has said.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s become one of the most well-known stamp collectors in the world, having amassed a collection that included every stamp the United States produced from 1847 to 1869, and five of the six known four-stamp blocks of Jennys, plus singles of the valuable stamp.\n\nBill has been selling off parts of his stamp collection since about 2006 and donating the proceeds to his charity, which is named after himself and his two children from his first marriage, Jennifer and Jeffrey.\n\nBut Bill has had a sentimental attachment to the \u201cInverted Jenny\u201d stamps.\n\n\u201cNever sell the \u2018Inverted Jenny.\u2019 Keep the \u2018Inverted Jenny,\u2019 \u201d he told Bloomberg TV in a 2016 interview.\n\nStill, he has parted ways with a few. In 2005, he bought a block of the Jenny stamps for about $3 million \u2014 only to trade it for a single, rare \u201cZ-Grill\u201d stamp of Benjamin Franklin, only two of which are known to have been made.\n\nA version of this article appears on NYPost.com.", "description": "A billionaire former bond trader once accused of putting dead fish in air vents to get back at his ex-wife is involved in a new stink \u2014 this time with his...", "authors": ["Kevin Dugan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG021_billgr_ZG_20180322110356.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
