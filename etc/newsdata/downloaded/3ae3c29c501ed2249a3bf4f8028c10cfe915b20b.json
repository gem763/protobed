The car is set to hit the market in late 2020, with no price tag yet announced.\n\nThe firm is also boosting production capacity in Japan, with the goal of being able to deliver 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles a year by 2021, which is 10 times more than currently possible.\n\nToyota says fuel-cell technology is \"one approach\" among others that it is pursuing, with applications as much for individual cars as for heavy vehicles, including buses and trucks.\n\nIt may be that latter category where hydrogen technology is most rapidly adopted, particularly in China, analysts say.\n\nAlready a champion of lithium-ion battery electric cars, China last March adopted a hydrogen plan that envisions putting a million fuel-cell cars on its roads by 2030.\n\nAnd Toyota has quickly sought to take advantage, signing a deal in April to supply hydrogen equipment to Foton, a subsidiary of China's Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC).\n\nThe Japanese firm has also sealed similar partnerships in recent months with other Chinese companies including FAW and Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC).\n\nThe deals come against the backdrop of warming ties between Beijing and Tokyo, with China's Xi Jinping expected to make a state visit to Japan next spring.\n\nAnalysts say hydrogen-powered vehicle producers might be smart to focus on commercial vehicles initially.\n\n\"The focus on commercial vehicles makes it easier to deal with the challenge of developing a network of refueling centers, as commercial vehicles typically operate on predictable routes,\" said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Securities in Japan. \"As the infrastructure gets built out, there could be renewed interest... for passenger use, which for now is likely to remain a niche area.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Toyota showcased its next-generation hydrogen-powered Mirai model at Wednesday's Tokyo Motor Show, but with the technology still lagging behind electric, the Japanese firm is hoping for an Olympic boost.
