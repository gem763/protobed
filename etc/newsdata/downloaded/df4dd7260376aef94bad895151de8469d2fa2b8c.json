Valverde\u2019s unrecognisable side never recovered from the early blow, and were full value for the 0-2 defeat which means the Catalan club\u2019s worst start after five La Liga games since 1994/95.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Junior had a nightmare debut \u2013 with his low confidence appearing at least in part due to Valverde having not trusted him at all until first-choice Jordi Alba got injured midweek. But the team have been leaking goals all season \u2013 their nine conceded so far is the joint-worst of all 20 Primera Division teams.\n\nMidfield has been an even bigger mess, something which borders on unforgivable for blaugrana purists. Valverde again rotated his central three on Saturday \u2013 and while Frenkie De Jong impressed in the deepest role, both Ivan Rakitic and Sergi Roberto looked exactly like players who had not been regularly involved so far this season. Up front Luis Suarez was completely swamped by the home defence, while Antoine Griezmann again struggled to get involved from the wing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Arturo Vidal entered as a third substitute on the hour mark, and almost immediately his silly handball brought a penalty converted by Alvaro Vadillo for the killer 2-0.\n\nAt that stage Barca had not even managed one shot on target. As usual everyone looked to Messi to perform a miracle, but he is clearly still not 100 per cent over the calf injury which disrupted his pre-season. The blaugrana talisman drew one decent save from Granada keeper Rui Silva in the 83rd minute, but created little else in a performance in keeping with how Valverde\u2019s side generally have begun the new campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is a defeat with hurts, it is worrying, and we have to be self critical,\u201d said Suarez on Movistar TV afterwards. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long and difficult season ahead of us.\u201d\n\nBarca\u2019s only two wins so far this season have been at the Camp Nou, where they have scored five on both occasions against overwhelmed opponents Real Betis and Valencia. Away from home they have one point from games at Athletic Bilbao and two newly-promoted clubs Osasuna and Granada. Add their results at the end of last season, including the Champions League semi-final second leg collapse at Liverpool, and it is seven away games without a victory for the first time since 2001.\n\nThat points to a lack of character and resolve in the team \u2013 something which is usually blamed on the manager. \u201cYou always feel responsible for what happens,\u201d Valverde said at the post-game news conference. \u201cThe players are the actors on the pitch, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s the coach who is responsible. You can lose a game, but when you lose, you need to do so deserving more. That wasn\u2019t the case today. But credit to Granada. They were intense. They made it uncomfortable for us.\u201d\n\nSaturday evening was also uncomfortable for Barca\u2019s board, who made a surprise decision to back Valverde last summer even when the Anfield disaster was followed by a shock Copa del Rey final defeat to Valencia. The story then was that senior dressing room figures [ie Messi] were happy for him to stay, and confident that this season the team could again retain the La Liga title and also regain the Champions League for the first time in five years.\n\nAs always at Barca, Messi\u2019s situation is the most critical. A calf injury interrupted his pre-season and saw him miss the first four La Liga games. So the club captain\u2019s biggest contribution so far has been an interview with Catalan daily Sport, where he publicly voiced disappointment that Neymar had not returned from Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Speaking just after it had leaked out that his current contract allows him to leave next summer if he chooses to, the 32-year-old said he was fully committed to the Barca cause but then added how important it was to \u201csee that we have a winning project.\u201d\n\nOn that point, new accounts released last week trumpeted Barca\u2019s record revenues of \u20ac990 million for 2018/19, and projected that next season they would become the first sports club ever to pass the \u20ac1 billion turnover barrier. However, a deeper look at the numbers showed just why Neymar\u2019s return last summer was never really financially feasible. And suggested that far from being able to add to the squad in January, they must sell players to balance the books.\n\nMeaning the only big short-term change possible is on the bench. Sunday morning unsurprisingly brought briefings from inside the Camp Nou claiming that a number of unnamed players have \u2018begun to lose confidence\u2019 in Valverde. More than a sign of dressing room unrest, it seemed the notoriously leaky blaugrana board were making sure fans and pundits knew who to blame for the bad start to the season.\n\nUnlike Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, Barca\u2019s hierarchy do not like to sack their managers. The last blaugrana coach turfed out mid-season was Louis Van Gaal, all the way back in 2003, when Joan Gaspart was still president. The policy since then has been against snap decisions, with even a clearly out of his depth Tata Martino allowed to finish the 2013/14 campaign.\n\nCurrent president Josep Bartomeu does have form in taking hasty decisions, with the firing of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta in January 2015. One reading of blaugrana history has that brave call as a catalyst for that season\u2019s \u2018Messi, Suarez, Neymar\u2019 side winning the treble. Although another has Zubizarreta as the architect of the team\u2019s last Champions League-winning squad, and points to erratic transfer decisions as the main reason for their European failures ever since.\n\nEurope remains the main focus for 2019/20. While Barca\u2019s performance was not good in their UCL opener at Dortmund midweek, the 0-0 result was very useful in the immediate objective of getting through a potentially difficult group, which also includes Antonio Conte\u2019s very dangerous-looking Inter Milan.\n\nAn insight into the thinking within the \u2018entorno\u2019 around the Camp Nou came on Spain\u2019s El Transistor radio show Saturday night, when Sport editor Ernest Folch pointed out that \u201cDespite everything, Real Madrid are in an even worse state than Barca.\u201d\n\nLos Blancos\u2019 stubborn 1-0 victory at Sevilla on Sunday evening to move level on points with surprise leaders Athletic Bilbao was a blow for that perspective. Barca are now down in eighth position, four points off the top, and that is a situation which cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nThe tight top of the La Liga table, with four teams a point behind Athletic and Madrid, means that nothing has yet been decided. Barca have been lucky in that their really poor start has not yet cost them. But Valverde needs results and performances to pick up immediately, starting at home to an in-form Villarreal team on Tuesday night at the Camp Nou.", "description": "Barcelona\u2019s 2019/20 campaign, and Ernesto Valverde\u2019s future prospects as blaugrana coach, took a big turn for the worse at Granada on Saturday evening.
