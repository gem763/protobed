Last month, on the presidential campaign trail, former vice president Joe Biden also advocated for creating such an agency.\n\nThe violence detection plan has alarmed experts studying violence prevention, technology, psychology and mental health.\n\n\u201cI would love if some new technology suddenly came along that would help us identify violent risk, but there\u2019s so many things about this idea of predicting violence that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Marisa Randazzo, former chief research psychologist for the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nBeyond the civil liberty concerns about monitoring people through their gadgets, Randazzo said, there\u2019s the problem of false positives.\n\nEven if the technology could be developed, such a program would probably flag tens, or hundreds of thousands, more possible suspects than actual shooters. How, she asked, would you sort through them? And how would you know you were right, given the difficulty of proving something that hasn\u2019t happened?\n\nMost concerning, she said, is that the proposal is based on the flawed premise that mental illness is directly linked to mass shootings. \u201cEverything we know from research tells us it\u2019s a weak link at best,\u201d said Randazzo, who spent a decade conducting such research for the Secret Service and is now CEO of a threat-assessment company called Sigma.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly pointed to mental illness as the cause of the United States\u2019 mass shootings. \u201cMental illness and hatred pull the trigger. Not the gun,\u201d Trump said immediately after last month\u2019s shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Federal health officials have taken steps to make sure government experts don\u2019t publicly contradict Trump.\n\nBut studies of mass shooters have found that only a quarter or less have diagnosed mental illness. Researchers have noted a host of other factors that are more significant commonalities in mass shooters: a strong sense of grievance, desire for infamy, copycat study of other shooters, past domestic violence, narcissism and access to firearms. Experts note that those with severe mental illnesses are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.\n\n\u201cTo those who say this is a half-baked idea, I would say, \u2018What\u2019s your idea? What are you doing about this?\u2019 \u201d said Geoffrey Ling, the lead scientific adviser on the HARPA proposal.\n\nA Johns Hopkins University neurologist, Ling was a founding director of DARPA\u2019s Biological Technologies Office. Ling said having the gumption to tackle really big problems and think creatively is what led to DARPA\u2019s successes.\n\n\u201cThe worse you can do is fail, and failing is where we are already,\u201d Ling said. \u201cYou need to find where the edge is so you can push on that edge.\u201d\n\nLing said he began working with Wright on the idea of creating HARPA shortly after the death of Wright\u2019s wife in 2016 to pancreatic cancer. According to Ling and others who have worked on the project, Wright was frustrated with the lack of major progress in halting illnesses such as his wife\u2019s pancreatic cancer \u2014 which has an overall five-year survival rate of just 9 percent, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nWright was not available for comment while recovering from surgery, said Liz Feld, president of the Suzanne Wright Foundation, the organization Wright has used to lobby for the HARPA proposal. Feld said the foundation has worked methodically to gather support for HARPA in the past two years, meeting with Trump officials and congressional leaders.\n\nThe idea has backers in both parties. During an Aug. 8 speech at the Iowa State Fair, Biden said creating a HARPA agency could help solve health problems including Alzheimer\u2019s and obesity. \u201cThose who have been in the military know there\u2019s an outfit called DARPA,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that allows the military to do advanced research on everything from stealth technology and the Internet and all those other things. . . . We should be doing the same thing with health care.\u201d\n\nThere is a huge gap between government research bodies such as the National Institutes of Health that fund research in its early stages and the private sector that often applies them to problems and brings solutions to market, said Michael Stebbins, former assistant director for biotechnology during the Obama administration, who has been hired as a consultant for the Wright Foundation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the massive hole that HARPA would fill,\u201d Stebbins said. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating new capability, driving innovation.\u201d\n\nAccording to a copy of the SAFEHOME proposal, all subjects involved would be volunteers and that great care would be taken to \u201cprotect each individual\u2019s privacy\u201d and \u201cprofiling of any kind must be avoided.\u201d\n\nLing said that even if SAFEHOME fails to predict mass shooters, it could lead to other advances, such as new ways of predicting and preventing suicides or child abuse.\n\nMatthew Nock, a leading suicide researcher at Harvard University, agreed that a new health research arm like HARPA might be helpful. For decades, Nock said he has tried to find ways to predict and prevent suicides. In an email, Nock said he\u2019d welcome an agency that would apply advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to such efforts.\n\nBut he added that using such a proposed agency to \u201cfind\u201d links that science has shown don\u2019t exist is dangerous. While research shows mental illness is strongly linked to suicide, Nock noted, the link between it and violence toward others is much weaker.\n\nOther researchers pointed to worrisome results from other recent attempts to use artificial intelligence to predict risk of violence. In court decisions on parole and sentencing, for instance, artificial intelligence programs have at times deepened problems of racial bias, overestimating the likelihood of black offenders committing further crimes and underestimating the likelihood of white offenders doing so, said Stephen Hart, a clinical forensic psychologist and researcher on violence risk assessment.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that there are low-tech solutions that already exist for some of these problems that we simply aren\u2019t funding or deploying enough,\u201d said Hart, including research and policies that address the prevalence of guns in the United States.\n\nAnother already existing low-tech solution, Hart said, is threat assessment, which emphasizes preventing violence by identifying and addressing problems flagged by fellow students or co-workers.\n\nThat was also the conclusion of a 2012 study commissioned by the Pentagon after the mass shooting at the Fort Hood military base. The study\u2019s task force surveyed every technology available that might help predict violence \u2014 including DNA swabs, retinal scans and merging big data from military personnel records. Like the HARPA proposal, the task force experts also looked at physical, neurological and genetic biomarkers, but ultimately concluded that predicting violence was a fool\u2019s errand. The study\u2019s panel devoted an entire appendix to dispelling the notion, entitled \u201cPrediction: Why It Won\u2019t Work.\u201d Instead, it recommended approaches such as threat assessment.\n\n\u201cPREVENTION should be the goal rather than PREDICTION,\u201d the task force concluded in its final report.\n\nJacqueline Alemany and Alice Crites contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nAre video games or mental illness causing America\u2019s mass shootings?
