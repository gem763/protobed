Especially when you think about it closely, that\u2019s a lot of people dying in the space of just one football match.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea was for people to ask why I had changed to the number 40 and I could explain to them and start an important conversation. It becomes more impactful too because I don\u2019t think anyone really expected it.\n\n\u201cOne the day it was announced, I had lots of people messaging me asking why I had made the decision. They might go home and tell their family about it and then more people are aware of the issue. I want to normalise it.\u201d\n\nListening to her explain her decision, it\u2019s easy to forget that Startup is still just 20 years old, the goalkeeper having played for England at U19 level last year.\n\nShe\u2019s shown maturity beyond her years, and now the young shot-stopper wants to encourage other athletes to step up and do the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought if I can make a difference, I will,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMental health can be hard to talk about, especially in sports, but as athletes, we have a big platform in society and it\u2019s becoming more and more important for us to speak up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re role models \u2013 if we speak about it, others will copy. I want to make a difference, having a platform seems like a waste otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhen athletes speak about it, it\u2019s more powerful because we are perceived as strong and powerful, but we\u2019re still humans. You can struggle mentally even when you\u2019re physically strong.\n\n\u201cWe need to be honest. It\u2019s ok not to be ok. We all need to be aware of that.\u201d\n\nStartup will be no doubt keen to get the conversation rolling on Saturday when Charlton host Aston Villa at the Valley, the club hoping to follow in the footsteps of the top-flight clubs in drawing in bigger crowds to the women's game.\n\n\u201cLooking back on the success of the World Cup and the crowds in the Women\u2019s Super League, I think we could pull in some good numbers,\u201d said Startup.\n\n\u201cThe Championship is not at the level of the WSL yet, but we\u2019re getting there and it\u2019s going to be fantastic. Even though it\u2019s not our home ground, it still feels like home to us.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got off to the best start this season, but once we find our feet, we know we\u2019re going to launch a real challenge at the top of the division.\u201d", "description": "Football fans don\u2019t tend to like it when players stray from their traditional shirt numbers.
