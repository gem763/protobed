Timberlake only had to deal with the hanger-on for a moment, though. Security quickly removed the culprit, who was none other than serial red carpet disrupter Vitalii Sediuk, according to multiple reports and a photographer who was on the ground. The attacker was wearing glasses and hiding his face.\n\nView photos Justin Timberlake, with Jessica Biel, arrives at the Louis Vuitton fashion show at Paris Fashion Week on Oct. 1.

The supposed Ukrainian entertainment journalist has continued to work his way into VIP events.\n\nThere have been some serious consequences for Sediuk. Pitt punched him when he confronted the actor and his then-wife on the red carpet at the 2014 Hollywood premiere of her movie Maleficent. At Milan Fashion Week in 2016, Hadid elbowed him in the face. Sediuk has been arrested and sentenced to probation, but most celebrities have seemingly declined to press charges against him.\n\nJust before the attack on Timberlake, Biel shared several photos taken at the couple\u2019s opulent hotel room.", "description": "The singer was walking into the stylish event alongside wife Jessica Biel when someone grabbed onto his lower right leg and tried to pull him down.", "authors": ["Raechal Shewfelt", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aRcGqWw8nsmOJfZTkhbvPQ--~B/aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/faee30b0-e488-11e9-bdfd-e7c9a8300144"}
