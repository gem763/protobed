The currency has spent Thursday in a complete tizzy, its emotional state severely tested by the minute-by-minute Brexit updates.\n\nAfter hours and hours (and hours (and hours)) of negotiations, compromises and concessions, Britain and the EU have a Brexit deal. Yet, as ever, things aren\u2019t that simple. In doing so, Boris Johnson seems to have abandoned the DUP, apparently deciding he can do without their support on \u2018super Saturday\u2019 by offering up an agreement the party has refused to back. That makes the deal\u2019s path through Parliament even more difficult, given that the Prime Minister currently has a majority of minus 45.\n\nOn top of all this, Jean-Claude Juncker has claimed \u2018there will be no prolongation\u2019, ruling out an extension if the deal can\u2019t get passed by October 31st.
