(AP) - Widely projected to win four or five games this year, the Miami Dolphins may have been overrated.\n\nThey looked like strong candidates to go winless in their season opener Sunday, losing to Baltimore 59-10. It was the most lopsided regular-season loss in franchise history, and it came in Brian Flores\u2018 first game as an NFL head coach.\n\n\u201cHow this team plays is a reflection of me,\u201d Flores said.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t good. The Dolphins gave up a franchise-record 643 yards, an eye-popping number even for a team that allowed a team-record 6,257 yards last season. The points allowed ranked second only to a 62-7 playoff drubbing at Jacksonville 20 years ago.\n\nThe offense netted 200 yards, and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick spent much of the afternoon running for his life behind a patchwork line.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens - you go out there and don\u2019t execute, you\u2019re going to get beat bad,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nMiami has been hording draft picks during an ongoing roster purge that brought 14 new players to roster just since the end of the exhibition season. But Flores bristled at the suggestion the rebuilding project has left him little talent to work with.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the guys we\u2019ve got. I\u2019m not an excuse-maker. Put that in the excuse bucket and kick it to the curb. I\u2019m not into that.\u201d\n\nPlayers weren\u2019t inclined to alibi either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if the group has been here all together for 10 years or one week. You have to be ready,\u201d center Daniel Kilgore said. \u201cWe have to take ownership of it.\u201d\n\nEmergency repairs will be needed to pull off a turnaround by next Sunday, when the Dolphins host Tom Brady, Antonio Brown and the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cWe dug ourselves a hole,\u201d cornerback Eric Rowe said, \u201cand don\u2019t want to dig it deeper.\u201d\n\nFor Flores, the drubbing was a big change from his previous game, which his defensive play-calling helped New England win the Super Bowl by holding the high-scoring Los Angeles Rams to three points.\n\nHe said the problem against the Ravens was execution, and he was surprised it was so bad.\n\n\u201cWe talked about playing penalty-free, having a clean operation, alignments, assignments, trying to play turnover-free, starting fast,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins were manhandled up front and overmatched in their secondary, giving up six touchdown passes to tie a franchise record.\n\nOn offense, Fitzpatrick was the least of the problems. He went 14 for 29 for 185 yards and a score despite constant pressure, little support from the ground game and at least two dropped passes.\n\n\u201cHe did well trying to move this offense,\u201d Flores said.\n\nJosh Rosen, who lost a battle for the quarterback job in training camp, replaced Fitzpatrick late in the third quarter.\n\nThe reason?\n\n\u201cGet him some work,\u201d Flores said. \u201cGame reps are important.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick will again start next Sunday against the Patriots, Flores said. Expect lineup changes elsewhere.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Widely projected to win four or five games this year, the Miami Dolphins may have been overrated.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/ravens_dolphins_football_00034_c0-195-4664-2914_s1770x1032.jpg?b631eaf7ef4ecd8f67809f43568134660540a5a8", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
