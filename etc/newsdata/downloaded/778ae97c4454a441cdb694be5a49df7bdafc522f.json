Investors can purchase shares before the 10th of October in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of November.\n\nMurgitroyd Group's next dividend payment will be UK\u00a30.1 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of UK\u00a30.2 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Murgitroyd Group has a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current share price of \u00a35.925. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Murgitroyd Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Murgitroyd Group\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Murgitroyd Group is paying out an acceptable 66% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 120% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.\n\nWhile Murgitroyd Group's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Murgitroyd Group's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit Murgitroyd Group paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nAIM:MUR Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That explains why we're not overly excited about Murgitroyd Group's flat earnings over the past five years. Better than seeing them fall off a cliff, for sure, but the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. Earnings have been growing somewhat, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, ten years ago, Murgitroyd Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.8% a year on average.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs Murgitroyd Group worth buying for its dividend? Murgitroyd Group is paying out a reasonable percentage of its income yet an uncomfortably high 120% of its cash flow as dividends. What's more, earnings have barely grown. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It looks like Murgitroyd Group PLC (LON:MUR) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 2 days.
