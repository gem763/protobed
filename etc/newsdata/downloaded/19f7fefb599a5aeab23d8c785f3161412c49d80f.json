Frank Lampard will be hoping his Chelsea side will be the ones to stop Sadio Mane and co from continuing their perfect record, and at least put up a better fight than they did in their last top six-clash, the 4-0 defeat by Manchester United in their first game.\n\nBoth sides will fancy their chances of out-scoring the other. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men have only kept one clean sheet in six matches this season, and conceded first in their 3-1 win against Newcastle last weekend. Norwich are the only team to concede more than Chelsea\u2019s 11 from five league games, so we expect there to be chances aplenty on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But let\u2019s hope not.\n\n2) Pepe hungry to open account\n\nSix games without a goal is never easy for a forward to deal with, but that is exactly how Nicolas Pepe has begun his Arsenal career. Granted, three of those appearances were as a substitute, but he will be conscious of his lack of goals in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nHowever, that is not to say Pepe has performed badly. The Ivorian has looked a threat every time he has taken to the pitch and pundits and Arsenal fans seem happy with his overall contribution \u2013 for now. Considering the Gunners\u2019 attacking threat though, it seems like a matter of when, not if, Pepe will find the back of the net. Once he does, it might be hard to get him to stop again.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Fantasy Premier League tips: Gameweek 6 Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Of course, they want to beat each other as any two sides would do but the game does not have the passion of a classic derby where the teams have a historic distaste for each other.\n\nThe real south coast derby is between Southampton and Portsmouth, a fixture that will take place on Tuesday night in the Carabao Cup for the first time since 2012. Southampton fans have urged Ralph Hassenhuttl not to disregard the game given the disparity in the football pyramid between the clubs, and he has heard them loud and clear, saying he will \u201cpick the best possible side\u201d.\n\nSaints fans will undoubtedly want to win on Friday night against the Cherries, but will be far more worried by the prospect of defeat at Fratton Park next week.\n\n4) Spurs need to mature, fast\n\nAfter taking a 2-0 lead against Olympiakos in midweek, Spurs threw the game away and conceded twice without reply to get their Champions League campaign off to a rocky start. It was a performance very much in character of club that seems to have been building to something for a number of seasons without actually getting anywhere.\n\nMauricio Pochettino said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d, with Harry Kane also admitting that \u201ca bit more maturity\u201d would help the side to stop repeating the same mistakes they have made over the years. Responding with a win and a good performance is crucial, and anything other than that against Leicester this weekend will only further claims that Spurs are still not a side that is capable of competing at the very top level.\n\n5) Like Vardy or Michu\n\nWhen a player takes the early Premier League season by storm, questions are inevitably asked about whether they will be able to sustain their form. Some, like Michu in 2012, burn out and are forgotten. Others, like Jamie Vardy, answer those questions and go beyond, becoming stalwarts of the league.\n\nTeemu Pukki and Norwich City are the latest breathtaking additions to the Premier League, and with their goalscoring exploits it\u2019s not hard to see why. Daniel Farke has Norwich playing great football, and encouragingly plaudits are being shared around the Norwich side, with Todd Cantwell, Emi Buendia and Ben Godfrey also receiving high praise alongside Pukki.\n\nSaturday\u2019s trip to Burnley is the latest stepping stone for Pukki and Norwich on the road to establishing themselves in the Premier League, and not becoming the answer to future pub quiz questions.\n\n6) Leaky Toffees\n\nEverton started 2019 in great defensive form and continued it into the first two games of the season. But they have since conceded seven goals in their last three games and have looked like a side that is struggling for defensive cohesion.\n\nThat in itself is strange, considering the back five were all at the club last year. It is when you look at Marco Silva\u2019s midfield that the problem begins to become clearer. Losing Idrissa Gueye to PSG was pivotal, and his man-of-the-match performance against Real Madrid only served as a timely reminder of what Everton are missing.\n\nGueye\u2019s replacement, John-Philippe Gbamin is as yet untested, having picked up a thigh injury after just 135 minutes of Premier League football. Without him, Everton lack a ball-winning midfielder, something they badly need in the system they employ.\n\n7) City\u2019s missing men\n\nAll eyes will be on Pep Guardiola\u2019s team selection when Manchester City take on Watford, as the Spaniard prepares to deal with having only one senior centre-back at his disposal in the Premier League for the first time.\n\nIn the 3-0 win against Shakhtar midweek, Fernandinho lined up alongside Nicolas Otamedi, and it is expected that this will be the case again at the Etihad. Although it worked in the Champions League, there is a big difference between European competition and the Premier League. Revitalised Watford will be eager to take advantage of any defensive disharmony in the City ranks.\n\n8) Potter stopping the slide\n\nGraham Potter got off to a flying start at Brighton, sensationally beating Watford 3-0 at Vicarage Road in their opening game. That has been the highlight of their season thus far, with the team winless since then.\n\nThey came close last weekend against Burnley, but were denied by a 91st minute Jeff Hendrick equaliser after Neal Maupay had given them the lead. Going five games without a win so early would leave the Seagulls in a very precarious position, given the nature of the Premier League. A win against fellow strugglers Newcastle therefore becomes almost essential \u2013 they face Chelsea and Spurs in their next two fixtures.\n\n9) Greenwood knocking on the door\n\nIn a game that was far from a classic, Mason Greenwood\u2019s well-taken goal against FC Astana was the standout. The youngster showed his quick feet and two-footed abilities to finish well with his weaker right foot, leaving many to assert that the 17-year-old is ready for Premier League football.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Given United\u2019s injuries and uninspiring attacking output this season, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could do a lot worse than call upon Mason Greenwood to inject some life into the side when they take on West Ham.\n\n10) Palace to pile on misery\n\nThe Europa League hangover is real and it is nasty. After Burnley last season, Wolves are the latest casualty to befall the sickness. They are winless in the league, and have suffered two home defeats in a row to Chelsea and Braga.\n\nChelsea\u2019s 5-2 victory last weekend was particularly embarrassing, and a trip to a well-organised Crystal Palace is unlikely to be the game where Wolves stop the rot. Despite a 4-0 defeat at Spurs in their last match, Roy Hodgson has Palace playing exceptionally well given their resources. The trip to Selhurst Park is not likely to be an easy one, even considering Palace are noticeably better away from home.", "description": "1) Goals galore at Stamford Bridge To start the season with six wins in a row would be a huge statement from Liverpool after they came agonizingly close to winning their first Premier League title last season.
