The entrepreneur, 25, opted for a chic tailored gown which showed off her tiny waist and endless legs while her pal Clelia, 24, was larking around in the window of her boutique and acting as a human mannequin\n\nThis old thing? Yazmin looked sensational in her wine coloured gown which boasted an aysymettric hemline and a cinched in waist\n\nYazmin is preparing to open her boutique in Hoddesdon on Friday November 1 where she will sell women's clothes and also offer personal styling sessions.\n\nIt comes after Yazmin's ex James was pictured locking lips with Ellie McKenzie as the duo put on a passionate display during a recent night out in Essex.\n\nThe star has been left less than impressed by his recent antics, due to the fact she is apparently friends with the girl he was seen snogging.\n\nA vision: Clelia looked stunning in her simple yet sophisticated ensemble as she stepped out\n\nHa! Clelia was having a giggle as she stood in the window\n\nThe whole gang: Clelia strutted in with Joey Turner on her arm\n\nDuring a recent episode of TOWIE, Yazmin is set to reveal to a group of her gal pals that she was left upset after seeing snaps of James with his new love interest.\n\nBroaching the topic of James' snog, Courtney Green asks: 'Yaz have you seen those pictures of Locky and that girl online?' While Chloe chimes in: 'I wasn't going to say it to you, was going to wait until you brought it up.'\n\nYaz candidly admits: 'I did get a little bit upset, not because James is moving on with someone, but this girl was messaging me last week asking me to go for dinner and asking for my boob surgeon.\n\nApparently confused over the girls' intentions, she adds: 'What does she want new boobs for James to look at that look exactly like mine? I don't know what this girl's issue is.'\n\nAll white? Hot on her heels was Chloe, who looked stunning in a white shirt, which she gave a sexy touch by tying at her waist to give a hint of abs\n\nHappy days: Chloe Brockett wore head-to-toe black with chic accessories\n\nAttempting to make sense of the situation, Chloe says: 'So you know her?' Yaz replies: 'I know her! I messaged the girl, I maybe said some things I shouldn't have said.\n\n'But we all know what I'm like. She tried to lie and say it was like a drunken kiss thing that they just met out as a group.'\n\nThe brunette beauty goes on to insist that she is fine with James moving on without her, and even adds that the girl is welcome to her plastic surgeon as well.\n\nPain: She has been through her fair share of heartache with beau James Lock", "description": "The entrepreneur, 25, opted for a chic tailored gown which showed off her tiny waist and endless legs while her pal Clelia, 24, was larking around in the window", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/20335054-0-image-a-103_1572365990197.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
