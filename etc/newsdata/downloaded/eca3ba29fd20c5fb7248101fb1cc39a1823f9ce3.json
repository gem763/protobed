Although restaurants have served North Korean dishes, this is the first pub fully decorated in North Korean style.\n\nThe walls are mint and pink, and posters with phrases written in white letters on red background in the style of North Korean propaganda posters adorn the walls.\n\nABC News\n\nABC News\n\nThe posters at first may confuse passersby as they seem so realistic, but a closer look reveals the posters feature satirical phrases like \"let there be more consumption of goods\" or \"more drinks for fellow comrades.\"\n\n\"I think the place seems very real,\" Ji-eun Hyun, 23, who had never eaten North Korean food before, told ABC News while she checked out the pub. \"This is my first time encountering such a unique place.\"\n\nAt the entrance of the pub is a small section decorated as an imitation of North Korean shop with products actually from the North. It displays real North Korean beer bottles as well as cigarettes, candy and snacks. There are also traditional Korean clothes that people can try on and take pictures in.\n\nABC News\n\n\"I wanted to do something new and thought North Korean theme bar would appeal to young people,\" the owner, who asked to be referred to as Kim, said. \"I expect people will be curious over this place that many want to visit.\"\n\nControversy arose when local media first reported on the construction of the bar, showing it had portraits of former leaders of the North. The portraits were eventually taken down -- and replaced with pictures of President Donald Trump and of a local comedian.\n\nABC News\n\nABC News\n\nEven so, the pub faced protests out front as it started a soft opening.\n\n\"I didn't expect to have a negative perspective on the North Korean theme; I hope people to have fun here\" Kim said.\n\nABC News\n\n\"The majority of South Koreans seem indifferent to North Korea.\" Ki-chul Jang, a man in his 50s who visited with his friends, said. \"I think this pub will arouse curiosity in North Korea's culture and people.\"\n\nABC News' Hakyung Kate Lee contributed to this report.", "description": "A North Korea-themed pub opened in Seoul, South Korea, sparking both interest and protests.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/people-pub-seoul-abc-ml-191023_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
