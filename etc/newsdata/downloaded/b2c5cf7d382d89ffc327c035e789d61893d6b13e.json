That's a lie | Trevor Timm", "language": "en", "text": "Ahead of the 50-country Nuclear Security Summit that met in Washington DC this past week, President Obama publicly touted his administration\u2019s alleged progress towards \u201ca world without nuclear weapons\u201d. In reality, his administration\u2019s record on reducing nuclear weapons is largely a dismal failure.\n\nEarly in his presidency, Obama memorably gave a speech in Prague in which he described \u201cAmerica\u2019s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\u201d. Not only has the administration barely made a dent in the gigantic nuclear arsenal the United States has, it has committed more than $1tn over the next several decades to further entrenching the system into permanence, potentially sparking a dangerous new arms race.\n\nObama at nuclear summit: 'madmen' threaten global security Read more\n\n\u201cThe United States and Russia remain on track to meet our New Start Treaty obligations so that by 2018 the number of deployed American and Russian nuclear warheads will be at their lowest levels since the 1950s,\u201d the president wrote in a Washington Post op-ed this week, referring to the unwieldily named Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.\n\nThe only reason he can claim that the number of weapons is as low as it\u2019s been since the 1950s is because the number has been steadily dropping since the last throes of the cold war in the 1980s, when we had well over 23,000 active weapons. But the reduction has almost nothing to do with his administration.\n\nAccording to the Federation of American Scientists, we\u2019ve gone from 4,950 operational nuclear warheads in 2010, the year the New Start Treaty was signed, to 4,700 weapons in 2015. That\u2019s a reduction of about 5%. By the way, 4,700 nuclear weapons are more than enough to destroy the planet several times over). Judging from the numbers collected by FAS, the US reduced our nuclear weapons stockpile at a much faster pace under George W Bush than under President Obama, where the US cut its active weapons from over 10,000 in 2000 to just over 5,000 by the time Bush left office.\n\nSo when Obama says, \u201cI\u2019ve reduced the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy,\u201d like he did in the Washington Post, he\u2019s referring to a drop in the ocean.\n\nIt\u2019s also curious that he\u2019s claiming he reduced the \u201crole\u201d of nuclear weapons in the United States\u2019s national security strategy, considering the administration has indicated that the US government would spend over $1tn over the next few decades to \u201cmodernize\u201d our nuclear weapons program. Instead of retiring or destroying weapons that are out of date, they will be spending a huge amount of money to make sure the mass killing machines survive decades longer and that they are easier to use.\n\nMany experts also think that, by \u201cmodernizing\u201d these weapons of mass destruction \u2013 by making them smaller and more \u201ctargeted\u201d (if that phrase can be used to describe weapons that can level entire cities) \u2013 they will be more tempting to use in future military conflicts. It\u2019s also an underhanded way of violating the president\u2019s vow not to build new warheads while still being able to technically claim that they are abiding by it.\n\nYet President Obama conveniently left any mention of this \u201cmodernization\u201d plan out of his sunny Washington Post op-ed.\n\nCertainly Obama should be proud of the nuclear deal his administration struck with Iran, as the president has repeatedly mentioned in the lead-up to this week\u2019s conference. It\u2019s one of the few positive foreign policy developments in the last several years: a vast majority of nuclear proliferation experts think the deal will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. And, maybe even more importantly, it will severely reduce the chances that the US will go to war in yet another large Middle Eastern country in the near future.\n\nBut to proclaim that we are any closer to a nuclear-free world is just spouting falsehoods.", "description": "When Obama says he\u2019s \u2018reduced the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy\u2019, he\u2019s referring to a drop in the ocean", "authors": ["Trevor Timm"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f70be33903a76e09316080948db2c17c541c5bd/32_0_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3894f79c670fd669c493014973a5cd00", "published_at": "2016-04-01"}
