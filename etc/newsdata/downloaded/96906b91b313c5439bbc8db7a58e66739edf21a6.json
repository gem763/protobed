Alas, that hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nEarly adopters are certainly tempted by the seductive promise of something fresh combined with the privilege of being among the first to have it. Even with its flaws and risks, the Fold represents a bonafide technological breakthrough.\n\nWhen Alexa met Sam: Amazon to offer Samuel L. Jackson voice for Alexa. He'll curse, if you want.\n\nMost everyone I show the Fold to is at minimum curious and at best wowed by an innovative design that transforms a hefty (at more than 9 ounces) and chunky candy-bar shaped smartphone with a 4.6-inch display into a tablet with a 7.3-inch screen that unfolds like a paperback.\n\nHowever cool they think it is, though, none was ready to rush out and buy. And I can't blame them.\n\nI\u2019ve had several days to test the second try Fold in the real world. My chief observations:\n\nUsing the Fold as a tablet\n\nEven in an age in which relatively ginormous smartphone screens are common, I appreciated the extra real estate of the unfurled AMOLED display, especially as I browsed and watched video while commuting. I considered it a plus that, a moment earlier, the folded Fold was stashed in my jacket pocket like any other smartphone, hard to do even with an iPad mini.\n\nYou can open up to three active apps on this screen simultaneously, the Chrome browser, say, to choose a restaurant, your calendar to pick a date, and the Messages app to text the friend who\u2019ll join you for dinner.\n\nA host displays the new Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphone at the 2019 IFA home electronics and appliances trade fair on Sept. 5, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

For the most part, I wasn\u2019t bothered by the \u201ccrease\u201d that\u2019s smack in the middle where the thing folds, even as it becomes more pronounced depending on your viewing angle.\n\nOut in New York\u2019s Bryant Park, the screen was readily visible as I browsed and watched video in direct sun. More distracting than the aforementioned crease was the reflection of my own face and the buildings behind me.\n\nWorth noting: Samsung has wisely split the keyboard that appears on the internal screen in two, which makes it easier when you\u2019re banging out a text.\n\nJudging the outer display\n\nYou may be spoiled by the wider possibilities brought on by the larger screen, but the front screen isn\u2019t nearly as inviting. You can make it out fine outdoors, but it\u2019s small and narrow, and typing isn\u2019t easy. It's adequate for when you're walking holding the device in one hand, and the apps you launch from this external display are there for you to embrace when you unfold the Fold to use the bigger screen.\n\nNew and improved Samsung Galaxy Fold is back, experts give opinions (Photo: Courtesy Samsung)\n\nThe camera: Good pics, awkward shooting\n\nTurning the internal display into a huge viewfinder can be extremely helpful. But unless you\u2019re going to take a moment to properly frame your shots, it\u2019s far simpler, at least for a selfie or those quick pics on the go, to shoot when the phone is closed. Shooting in tablet mode looks and feels weird.\n\nThe Fold has six lenses: three on the back (16 MP ultra-wide, 12MP wide, and 12MP telephoto), a front dual camera and an additional cover camera. I was generally pleased with and didn't detect major differences on the pictures and videos I shot when the Fold was open or closed.\n\nIs the Fold durable?\n\nI'd say Samsung is off to a promising start since nothing has broken so far on my watch.\n\nBut if the \u201cCare Instruction\u201d sheet in the box isn\u2019t enough to give you pause \u2013 you\u2019re told, among other warnings, not to apply excessive pressure to the screen \u2013 a reviewer at TechCrunch reported the appearance of a \u201cbrightly colored amorphous blob,\" a day into his own testing.\n\n(Without directly responding to the TechCrunch complaint, Samsung sent a statement that read in part: \"The Galaxy Fold is a first-of-its-kind device, made with new materials and technologies that allow it to open and close just like a book. We encourage Galaxy Fold owners to read the care instructions included in the box and in the product manual available online.)\n\nIn its closed position, the Fold feels solid and substantial, and while you don\u2019t get the same level of confidence when you open it up, Samsung insists it has fixed the earlier issues that led to the delayed launch. The internal display is protected with what Samsung refers to as tissue-thin bonded layers with an innovative polymer. Plastic caps on the top and bottom of the device are meant to prevent debris from getting in. I repeatedly opened and snapped shut the Fold testing its redesigned dual-axis hinge. I can report it's no worse for the wear.\n\nSamsung is promising premium support to Fold buyers, in which you\u2019ll be able to call or chat with \u201ctrained experts\u201d or even have the person come to your home or office. (This service was not made available to reviewers in advance.)\n\nObserving the battery and more\n\nI didn\u2019t conduct a formal battery test, but the two batteries (of different capacities) on each side of the Fold are meant to work in tandem to deliver all-day juice, which was borne out during my mixed usage.\n\nI was able to take advantage of the Samsung Wireless PowerShare feature that let me charge up the Galaxy Bud earbuds that come in the box by placing them on the back of the Fold. Apple's AirPods charged up, too.\n\nUnlocking with the Fold using both facial recognition or via the fingerprint scanner on the side of the phone proved reliable.\n\nI\u2019m still put off that a phone that costs nearly $2,000 isn\u2019t water- or dust-resistant.\n\nThough I can't recommend that consumers fold at this price, Samsung deserves kudos for proving smartphone innovation is alive and well. I'm looking forward to the next foldable phone from Samsung, and, for that matter, from other phone makers, which, hopefully, ups the phone's capabilities and reduces sticker shock.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2019/09/27/should-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-fold/3776499002/", "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Fold foldable smartphone tablet is finally going on sale in the U.S. From durability to cameras, here's what buyers should consider.", "authors": ["Edward C.
