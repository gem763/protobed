But earlier this year pro-democracy protests broke out after the Hong Kong government sought to pass legislation that would allow for extradition to mainland China. It\u2019s policing around those on-going protests that\u2019s being made visible on HKmaps.\n\nThe app\u2019s developer denies the map enables illegal activity, saying its function is \u201cfor info\u201d purposes only \u2014 to allow residents to move freely around the city by being able to avoid protest flash-points. But the Chinese government is branding it \u201ctoxic\u201d.\n\n\u201cBusiness is business, and politics is politics. Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts. Apple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision,\u201d the China Daily writer warns in a not-so-veiled threat about continued access to the Chinese market.\n\n\u201cProviding a gateway for \u2018toxic apps\u2019 is hurting the feelings of the Chinese people, twisting the facts of Hong Kong affairs, and against the views and principles of the Chinese people,\u201d it goes on. \u201cApple and other corporations should be able to discern right from wrong. They also need to know that only the prosperity of China and China\u2019s Hong Kong will bring them a broader and more sustainable market.\u201d\n\nThe article takes further aim at Apple \u2014 claiming it reinstated a song which advocates for independence for Hong Kong and had previously been removed from its music store.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nA few days ago the company was getting flak from the other direction as Western commentators piled on to express incredulity over its decision, at the app review stage, not to allow HKmaps on its store. The app\u2019s developer said Apple App Store reviewers had rejected it citing the reasoning as \u201cthe app allowed users to evade law enforcement\u201d.\n\n\"Your app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\"@Apple assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case. \u2014 HKmap.live \u5168\u6e2f\u6297\u722d\u5373\u6642\u5730\u5716 (@hkmaplive) October 1, 2019\n\nYet, as many pointed out at the time, the Google-owned Waze app literally describes its function as \u201cavoid police\u201d if you take the trouble to read its iOS listing. So it looked like a crystal-clear case of double standards by Cupertino. And, most awkwardly for Apple, as if the US tech giant was siding with the Chinese state against Hong Kong as concerned residents fight for their autonomy and call for democracy.\n\nWe asked Apple about its decision to reject the app at the App Store review stage last week. It did not provide any comment but a couple of days afterwards a spokesman pointed us to an \u201cupdate\u201d \u2014 where the developer tweeted that the iOS version was \u201cApproved, comming soon!\u201d [sic].\n\nIt's on App Store now https://t.co/bLjjN6yXpA\n\nThere will not be any further comments on this matter unless status changes. We understand @Apple have many business considerations, but since they already make thing right I don't see any point to keep pressing. \u2014 HKmap.live \u5168\u6e2f\u6297\u722d\u5373\u6642\u5730\u5716 (@hkmaplive) October 5, 2019\n\nAt the time of writing the iOS app remains available on the App Store but the episode highlights the tricky trade-offs Apple is facing by operating in the Chinese market \u2014 a choice that risks denting its reputation for highly polished corporate values.\n\nThe size of the China market is such that just \u201ceconomical deceleration\u201d can \u2014 and has \u2014 put a serious dent in Apple\u2019s bottom line. If the company were to exit \u2014 or be ejected \u2014 from the market entirely there would be no way for it to cushion the blow for shareholders. Yet with a premium brand so bound up with ethical claims to champion and defend fundamental human rights like privacy Apple risks being pinned between a rock and a hard place as an increasingly powerful China flexes more political and economic muscle.\n\nWider trade tensions between the US and China are also creating further instability, causing major operating headaches for Chinese tech giant Huawei \u2014 with the Trump administration pressuring allies to freeze it out of 5G networks and leaning on US companies not to provide services to Chinese firms (leading to question marks over whether Huawei\u2019s smartphones can continue using Google\u2019s Android OS, and suggestions it might seek to deploy its own OS).\n\nThe going is certainly getting tougher for tech businesses working from East to West. But it also remains to be seen how sustainable Apple\u2019s West-to-East democratic balancing act can be given heightened and escalating geopolitical tensions.", "description": "Apple\u2019s decision to greenlight an app called HKmaps, which is being used by pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong to crowdsource information about street closures and police presence, is attracting the ire of the Chinese government.
