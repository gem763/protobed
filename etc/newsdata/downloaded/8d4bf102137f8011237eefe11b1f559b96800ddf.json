Nigel Farage could be the UK\u2019s \u2019nuclear weapon\u2019 in Brussels.\n\nLondon may not be planning to nominate a commissioner to Brussels but if it does, some say there\u2019s only one option: Nigel Farage.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told the Telegraph's Chopper Brexit Podcast that the Brexit Party member of the European Parliament would be the obvious choice to be the U.K.\u2019s European commissioner, if Brexit is delayed and the country is able to nominate one.\n\n\u201cI think we should appoint somebody with about twenty years experience ... we should appoint somebody who\u2019s incredibly well-known throughout the institutions, somebody who can be absolutely relied upon at all times to support our exit from the European Union,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore I unashamedly back Nigel Farage to be our next European commissioner in the event, in the unfortunate event, should it transpire, though I think it unlikely, that we have to remain in.\u201d\n\nBaker, who leads the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs in the U.K. parliament, said the idea would be \u201cinspired by the film Armageddon,\u201d referring to a 1998 science fiction movie.\n\nThere is a scene where \u201cthey're trying to save the world, and so what they do is they land on the asteroid, and they put a nuclear weapon in the heart of the asteroid, and Nigel Farage is that nuclear weapon,\u201d Baker said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve reason to think he might say that he would accept such an offer,\u201d Baker added, while noting that \"my sympathy for Nigel Farage, which has not always been at very high levels, has dramatically increased the more that I am demonized.\u201d\n\nFarage, who claims credit for forcing the U.K. government to hold the 2016 Brexit referendum, has earned an unpopular reputation among many MEPs for his efforts to disrupt debates in the European Parliament.\n\nIncoming European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen previously suggested that if the U.K. is granted a Brexit extension by the EU, it would be required to nominate a European commissioner.", "description": "Nigel Farage could be the UK\u2019s \u2019nuclear weapon\u2019 in Brussels.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Thibault Larger"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1145346466-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
