The song dropped just days after Bieber's wedding celebration. USA TODAY\n\nJustin Bieber had a comedic streak over the weekend, taking a light jab at Taylor Swift.\n\nThe 25-year-old Canadian artist went on Instagram Live on Sunday and mocked Swift's epic post-surgery banana meltdown video that was recently shared during Jimmy Fallon's interview with the country star.\n\nBieber filmed his imitation video in his kitchen, where he can be heard reenacting Swift's video.\n\n\"It's not the banana that I wanted,\" the \"Purpose\" artist said. \"It not the right banana. It has no head.\"\n\nHis wife, Hailey Bieber, can be heard from behind the camera saying, \"That was so funny.\"\n\nMore: Justin Bieber shares first photos of 'my bride' Hailey Baldwin from South Carolina wedding\n\nSwift appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" last week, and Fallon surprised her with a hilarious clip that featured her after she had laser eye surgery, courtesy of her mom, Andrea Swift.\n\n\"This is a world premiere, you have to check this out. This is Taylor Swift post-surgery,\" Fallon said through giggles. \"You were, like, freaking out over a banana. Anyway, this is Taylor at home after her Lasik surgery, video taken by her mom.\"\n\nThe video shows a bandaged Swift in the kitchen, holding a banana. \"She found a snack,\" her mom narrates.\n\n\"It wasn't the one I wanted,\" a distressed Swift complains.\n\n\"Stop, you can't cry,\" her mom advises.\n\n\"I tried to get this one, but what do we do with this now? It doesn't have a head,\" Swift says.\n\nBieber and Swift don't have the best track record post-Scooter Braun drama, and a few people thought his video was done with malicious intent.\n\n\"He has no right to even joke about her.
