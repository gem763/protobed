So when my good friend Thierry Dalais of Time + Tide Africa put together a foundation focusing on improving the lives of children where its lodges are situated (in Zambia and Madagascar), I was very keen to contribute.\n\nI get asked to write cheques for a lot of charities and normally try to stay at arm\u2019s length. But with Time + Tide I\u2019m so impressed by what they do, and team leaders such as executive director Elizabeth Ellis, that I want to be involved. I\u2019m on the board as a trustee as well as being a major donor and child sponsor.\n\nMark Carnegie at one of the schools in Zambia funded by the Time + Tide Foundation.\n\nWhat I like about this venture is they know how to get scale, they\u2019re committed and they\u2019re transparent. The figures are fantastic: from the pilot programs that started in 2016 , 96 per cent of the Time + Tide Foundation\u2019s female beneficiaries have advanced to secondary school, and 77 per cent of children in the home-based education programs have registered in primary schools. Visiting the foundation\u2019s office in Zambia is as good as travel gets for me.\n\nA stitch in time\n\nGavin Tollman, The Travel Corporation chairman\n\nAuthenticity is easy to talk about, but not easy to do. We all want to take trips that matter more. A couple of years ago, I met the women of the Iraq Al-Amir Women's Co-Op in Jordan through The Travel Corporation's TreadRight Foundation. The co-op was set up in 1993 by Jordan's Queen Noor Al-Hussein to help these women make a living from ancient craft like fabric, soap, and pottery production.\n\nA village woman works a loom at the Iraq Al-Amir Co-Op in Jordan.\n\nThe challenge when we came into the picture was that they had a strong skills set, but limited distribution channels. The women were trying to do something culturally real, which is very difficult to make work financially when you live in a small community outside of [Jordan's capital] Amman.", "description": "Three leaders in their respective fields share their most life-defining and pivotal moments abroad.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3504%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_361/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b3c1239b4d4a43d98e614b082ad96d40697e4e2", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
