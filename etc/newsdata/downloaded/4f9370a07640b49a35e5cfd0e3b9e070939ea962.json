He said he has several cousins who were at the church and family has been told at least one of them, a woman with three children and pregnant with another, is among the dead. He said he has not heard about the fate of the others.\n\n\"Somebody went in and started shooting,\" he said, shaking his head and taking a long drag on a cigarette.\n\nUS Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents part of the area, said in a statement that he could recall holding fundraisers at the local volunteer fire department \"where basically everyone in the entire area would come out to support those volunteers.\n\n\"The people of Sutherland Springs are as fine an example of Texans and Americans as you will find anywhere in the country,\" Cuellar said.\n\n'God's Blessings'\n\nFrank Pomeroy's wife, Sherri Pomeroy, said in a text message to The Associated Press that her daughter was among the \"many friends\" they lost on Sunday.\n\nBoth she and the pastor were out of town on Sunday.\n\nFirst Baptist Church, according to its website, has a fellowship breakfast on Sunday mornings, followed by Sunday School.\n\nA morning worship service is at 11:00, with a Sunday evening service at 18:00.
