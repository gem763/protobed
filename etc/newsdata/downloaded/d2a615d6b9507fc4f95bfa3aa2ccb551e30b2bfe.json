There are already triggers that allow the league to intervene in a club. We have to look at the whole landscape or we're missing a trick.\n\n'I want to look at what's happened with Bury, but it's not about saying, 'It's this person's fault or that person's fault'.\n\n'It's about saying, 'What did the league do, what rules did it have in place, how did it apply those rules or not apply those rules, is there something more that the regulator could/should have done here, are there other rules, other approaches that could be taken to protect the integrity of the competition and protect community assets so they don't go out of the league and potentially go out of business?'.'", "description": "Updating the EFL owners' and directors' test alone will not prevent other clubs suffering financial difficulties, according to the man leading an independent review into what went wrong at Bury.", "authors": ["Jamie Gardner", "Pa Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19796594-0-image-a-6_1571243208559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
