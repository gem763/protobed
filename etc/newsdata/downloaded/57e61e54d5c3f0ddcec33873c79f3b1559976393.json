Because that's no easy feat! And what if he didn't get away? What if he got busted right around the next corner?'\"\n\n(Image: Ben Rothstein/Netflix)\n\nHe explained that one idea for how his story ended saw Jesse end up in prison.\n\n\"I didn't get super far down the road, but it was probably going to be a young woman who needed some help. He was hiding out by the Canadian border and this woman was working at a motel as a housekeeper or something.\n\n\"[He] goes into the process of saving her, knowing full well that he's going to suffer for it, he's going to get caught for it, but he does it anyway. And the last scene would be maybe him in a jail cell but at peace for the first time since the movie began.\"\n\n(Image: YOUTUBE/NETFLIX)\n\nThankfully, Gilligan was dissuaded, but there was another idea in the offing too, according to Aaron Paul, which saw the audience hear Jesse's letter to Brock Cantillo.\n\nPaul told EW: \"Originally the voiceover of that letter was how the movie ended \u2013 just driving through Alaska and you could hear what was inside of that letter\u2026 It's heartbreaking, it's beautiful, just honest.\n\n\"But Vince just thought, 'You know what? Maybe it's best left unknown'. And we don't need it. He was right.\"\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is available now on Netflix.\n\nDo you think El Camino ended Jesse Pinkman's story in the right way?
