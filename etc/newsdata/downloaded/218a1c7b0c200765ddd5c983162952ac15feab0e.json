Mollie King\n\nTime has not necessarily been kind to late 00s quintet the Saturdays, a sort of Girls Not Quite Loud Enough. But every solid girl band needs a linchpin, someone with the infectious enthusiasm to sell even the ropiest of singles. Step forward Mollie King.\n\n24. Lisa\n\nBlackpink\u2019s Lisa had her defining moment in this year\u2019s hyper-glossy Kill This Love video, causing havoc in what looks like east London\u2019s Cereal Killer Cafe like a perfectly styled anti-gentrification protester.\n\n23. Heidi Range\n\nEarning her girl band stripes the hard way \u2013 she was briefly in Atomic Kitten before, in 2001, Sugababes\u2019 revolving-door recruitment policy let her in \u2013 Range was never the most dynamic pop star, favouring chunky highlights and Girl Next Door energy. But give her a middle eight and \u2013 briefly \u2013 there were few better.\n\n22. Dawn Richard\n\nSugababes aside, Danity Kane are the messiest of modern-day girl bands, with album campaigns often hampered by lineup changes or, as with 2014\u2019s DK3, physical fights. Amid all that drama sits Dawn Richard, who walks the thin line between \u201cmercurial talent\u201d and \u201cloose cannon\u201d perfectly.\n\n21. Keisha Buchanan\n\nEvery girl band needs someone who embodies their unique raison d\u2019etre and during Sugababes\u2019 early career no one quite lived out the trio\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me\u201d attitude quite like Keisha. Also: can still ad-lib like her life depends on it.\n\n20. Sarah Harding\n\nIt is December 2008, Girls Aloud are promoting their single The Loving Kind on GMTV and all is right in the world, when suddenly a sound like a goose passing a jagged boulder unspools from Sarah Harding\u2019s mouth, instantly cementing her status with a bum note so magnificent musicologists are still unpacking it.\n\n19. CL\n\nThe best thing about K-pop\u2019s best girl band, 2NE1, CL managed to embody both the group\u2019s hard-edged futuristic playfulness and their vulnerability. Plus, at a 2012 awards show, she performed with a live parrot sitting on her shoulder. A PARROT!\n\n18. Normani\n\nFifth Harmony had all the chemistry of a Tory party conference, but it was clear almost immediately that one person stood out, with Normani offering up gymnast-level devotion to choreography and the noble girl band art of walking as if you\u2019re the best person on the planet.\n\n17. Nicole Scherzinger\n\nLess a girl band and more a vehicle for Nicole Scherzinger\u2019s impending solo career, the Pussycat Dolls nevertheless still needed to be led, and Scherzinger stepped up to the role with the manic gusto of someone who really, really wanted it.\n\n16. T-Boz\n\nA good girl band needs a good vocal blend, but it also helps if there is a voice that stands out, one that you can easily identify. TLC have that in T-Boz, whose husky, hungover-with-a-hint-of-honey croon works on both the sultry swing of Creep and the cracked vulnerability of Unpretty.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sugababes\u2019s Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\n15. Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy\n\nEven without the heavily mythologised Sugababes\u2019 breakup story (she didn\u2019t climb out of a toilet window to escape), there was always something indescribably cool about Donaghy, all cut-glass vocals (debut Overload is basically a solo single) and porcelain beauty.\n\n14. Melanie Blatt\n\nFor pairing combat trousers with a pregnancy bump on Saturday morning TV. For looking as if she could drink you under the table at the Met Bar any day of the week. For winning Celebrity Spectacle Wearer 2008. And, most importantly, for the celestial verses on Pure Shores.\n\n13. Jesy Nelson\n\nEven in the early days of Little Mix \u2013 well before the Jamaican-accent \u201cBalegdah\u201d meme and the harrowing documentary about online bullying \u2013 Jesy Nelson stood out, co-opting multiple roles as the band\u2019s fearless spokeswoman, ardent defender against morons and low-register vocal pioneer.\n\n12. Alesha Dixon\n\nDuring her time as one third of \u201cM with the I with the S-T double-E Q\u201d, as she put it in garage classic All I Want, Alesha Dixon very much was the UK\u2019s answer to Beyonc\u00e9, singing and rapping her way through a run of forward-thinking R&B bangers.\n\n11. Jade Thirlwall\n\nModern pop\u2019s best girl band member, Thirlwall has taken on politicians, homophobes and Piers Morgan, all while being the vocal glue that holds Little Mix together. Once farted in front of me.\n\n10. Ronnie Spector\n\nThe Ronettes\u2019 Be My Baby basically invented Amy Winehouse circa Back to Black, and in among all the back-combed hair high enough to house a small family of voles was Spector\u2019s immaculate voice, a clarion call for every single emotion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Girls Aloud\u2019s Cheryl Tweedy. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\n9. Cheryl Tweedy\n\nForget the intermittently entertaining solo career, Cheryl was a proper grade-A girl band member, pulling Girls Aloud up by the scruffs of their necks. The perfect mix of dancer, versatile pop vocalist and properly determined girl-next-door glow-up.\n\n8. Shaznay Lewis\n\nAll Saints\u2019 leader co-wrote two of the greatest girl band songs of all time in the shape of Never Ever and Pure Shores. Bonus points for making voluminous cargo trousers and braces (for the mouth) look cool in the 90s.\n\n7. Nadine Coyle\n\nGirls Aloud\u2019s hit factory Xenomania would often get Nadine to demo their gonzo creations, her supple voice being the perfect template for how far they could push pop. She really came into her own during the band\u2019s cruelly curtailed 2012 reunion, threatening to quit when dreary ballad Beautiful \u2019Cause You Love Me was mooted as the comeback single. Famously quite forgetful when it comes to her passport.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Supremes\u2019 Diana Ross. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n6. Diana Ross\n\nEven at the height of the Supremes\u2019 success, Diana Ross was being primed for solo stardom, with Motown boss Berry Gordy even changing their name to Diana Ross & the Supremes. In among all the fallout the top billing created, Ross remained dedicated to the craft of delivering exceptional pop R&B with a voice as pillow soft as a chinchilla in a cashmere sock.\n\n5. Kelly Rowland\n\nSure Destiny\u2019s Child had Beyonc\u00e9 but Beyonc\u00e9 needed Kelly Rowland to elevate them beyond a straightforward star vehicle. It is one of pop\u2019s greatest supporting performances, with Rowland adding a genuine playfulness to the mix on Bootylicious, owning the harder-edged sound of Soldier, and remaining calm during that infamous clip in which she uttered the words \u201csecond lead vocalist\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s eyes burned holes in her flesh.\n\n4. Mel B\n\nSure you can bleat on all you like about the Gallaghers but Mel B was the UK\u2019s best rock star of the 90s, pulling off being one of the most famous people on the planet on minimal sleep, inspiring a new generation with a litany of reckless soundbites while chewing up the scenery left, right and centre. Fuelled their recent reunion on pure passion alone.\n\n3. Geri Halliwell\n\nYes she dresses like a home counties mum now, doling out platitudes to Theresa May, but to a whole generation Geri Halliwell represents girl band incarnate. Halliwell \u2013 who favoured hard work over raw talent \u2013 feverishly pushed the Girl Power ethos, barging her way into male-dominated spaces when no one wanted to listen. She also somehow got Nelson Mandela to say that meeting the group was the one of the greatest days of his life.\n\n2. Mutya Buena\n\nMutya Buena is Sugababes. When they first started as teenagers she was everyone\u2019s cooler older sister, the kind who could destroy you with a withering look while sneaking into school late and very hungover. As the lineups changed and their sound grew more commercial, she remained the group\u2019s anchor, her lived-in voice adding grit to romcom-sized ballads Too Lost in You or Stronger, and a genuine sadness to the anti-bullying anthem Ugly. \u201cShe is undoubtedly the finest female singer this country has produced in years,\u201d mused producer and songwriter Brian Higgins in 2004, a fact that remains true to this day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beyonc\u00e9 ... in the pink.\n\n1. Beyonc\u00e9\n\nDestiny\u2019s Child recalibrated what it meant to be a modern girl band, mixing bootcamp-level work ethic (and a similarly cut-throat attitude to personnel) with a discography full of empowering anthems (let\u2019s ignore Nasty Girl). Beyonc\u00e9 made short work of her role as the group\u2019s all-consuming, once-in-a-lifetime central force, gleefully devouring The Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u2019s futuristic anthems, shadily delivering Survivor\u2019s thinly veiled kiss-offs, and demanding someone say her name with a head-spinning mix of desperate longing and unhinged anger. Her apprenticeship turned into the gold-standard template for everyone else to follow.", "description": "To mark Sugababes\u2019 return, it\u2019s time to rank the 25 greatest female pop-group performers", "authors": ["Michael Cragg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b47fffaebae72114d56fe1241ea92e2e74749981/0_9_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa09a99c794a7d67ffb9a15a1c10ce6b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
