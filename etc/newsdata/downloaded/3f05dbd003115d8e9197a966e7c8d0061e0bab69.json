Good thing Friday night\u2019s Nats didn\u2019t take him to the moon all those years ago. They would have stranded him right there. Or, worse, halfway home.\n\nThe numbers from this 4-1 Astros victory are grisly, and they\u2019re the reason Washington\u2019s first home World Series game in 86 years became a loss: 0 for 10 with runners on second or third base on the night. In each of the first six innings, at least one Nat reached second. One scored. They didn\u2019t go down in order until the seventh, when they might have been leading but instead trailed by three. Those are ingredients that will break an eight-game postseason winning streak. Those are ingredients that make up a loss and, in the week before Halloween, are magnified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get those hits,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not, what we have now is what anyone would have wanted before these teams opened in Houston: a full-on, anything-can-happen series. In that way, Friday night served as a pivot point. A Nationals win, and we\u2019re wondering whether the clinch would be Saturday or Sunday and when Constitution Avenue should be closed for the parade. A Houston victory, and \u2014 oh, no \u2014 anything is possible.\n\nWhat this guarantees is a fifth game Sunday night \u2014 at least. What it guarantees is three District World Series games \u2014 exactly the number in 1933, when the Senators couldn\u2019t push the series back to New York and the Giants wrapped things up in five.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNobody thought this was going to be easy,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nWhat it guarantees are nerves. Everyone with a bounce in her or his step walking around, decked out in red, all day Friday strides a little more hesitantly Saturday in the long, slow hours before Game 4. Is Nats left-hander Patrick Corbin a good pitcher? Certainly. Will the Astros throw some combination of relievers together to try to cobble a win? Yes. On paper, the Nats could be favored. Your stomach doesn\u2019t settle down because of what it says \u201con paper.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMan, how things might be different \u2014 for the series, for your stress level \u2014 had one of a billion Nats delivered in the moments they have all postseason.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of traffic on the bases,\u201d cleanup hitter Juan Soto said. \u201cWe just missed it when we needed it.\u201d\n\nBreak down any of these at-bats, and there are layers. Zack Greinke\u2019s constant change of speeds and angles and even windups mattered. The strike zone of home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom, which could generously be labeled \u201cinconsistent,\u201d mattered. Some instances of impatience mattered. Even an injury mattered. And the Nats flat-out missing some hittable pitches \u2014 yeah, that mattered, too.\n\nA primary reason the Nationals arrived in Washington with a commanding lead is because their at-bats with runners on second or third were both well thought-out and productive. In Games 1 and 2, they were 7 for 21 in such instances, scoring 10 of their 15 runs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday night, that average \u2014 one hit every three times up with ducks on the pond \u2014 might have won the game. It\u2019s not sustainable, of course, and the small-sample-size police will point out that 21 at-bats over two games prove nothing. Think of it this way: During the 162 games of the regular season \u2014 by definition, an appropriate sample size \u2014 the Nats posted an .887 on-base-plus-slugging percentage with runners in scoring position. That led the National League. Only the New York Yankees were better and only by one point (.888).\n\nAnd yet in baseball, there are always nights when strengths become weaknesses, when up becomes down. So here was Friday.\n\nWhere to start? Well, it\u2019s actually pretty easy. Because it happened over and over, why not the first inning? Anthony Rendon, two-out double. Soto, first-pitch bouncer to first. Missed chance. At that point, no big deal. There were still four hours of baseball to come.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDo you really want to relive these? Is it worth going over \u2014 with no outs and runners on first and second \u2014 Kurt Suzuki\u2019s look at a third strike and Victor Robles\u2019s hard grounder to third that became an inning-ending double play?\n\nThat got it started but was a mere preview.\n\n\u201cToday, we were a little bit aggressive outside the strike zone,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe took some balls I think we could hit. Uncharacteristic.\u201d\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s a one-night thing. But on this night, yikes. They loaded the bases in the third, bringing up Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, inserted into the lineup in place of Howie Kendrick, the MVP of the National League Championship Series. The reason: Cabrera\u2019s solid, if mostly long ago, history against Greinke \u2014 16 for 37 (.432). Indeed, when Cabrera singled in the second, the move looked reasonable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut with the bases juiced and the count full, Greinke mustered up a 3-2 curveball. Cabrera waved through it.\n\nIn his next at-bat, in the fifth, Cabrera doubled with a man on first. There\u2019s the Nats\u2019 night in the nutshell you\u2019re looking for: two hits with no one in position to score sandwiched around a strikeout when a hit would have made Nationals Park lose its mind.\n\nThe struggles in this regard presented an early decision point for Martinez. In the fourth, Robles\u2019s triple scored Zimmerman and cut Houston\u2019s lead to 2-1. Starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez had only thrown 65 pitches, but you might have a better chance of laying down an effective bunt or hitting a run-scoring flyball than S\u00e1nchez does. He\u2019s that bad with the bat.\n\nAD\n\nSo chase the game early? Or have faith that S\u00e1nchez could hang some more zeros? Martinez went with the latter. Reasonable. S\u00e1nchez saw three pitches \u2014 a foul bunt, a swinging strike and another foul bunt \u2014 and Trea Turner then tapped back to the pitcher to leave Robles on third.\n\nAD\n\nThe last, best chance: two down, runners on second and third and Zimmerman up in the fifth. Astros Manager A.J. Hinch made the move to pull Greinke in favor of right-handed reliever Josh James. Zimmerman worked a spectacular at-bat, falling behind 0-2, working the count even, fouling off a pair of two-strike pitches and taking a change-up a hair inside to get it full.\n\n\u201cI like my at-bat right there,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nAD\n\nAgain, reasonable. Other than the result. James came with another change-up. Zimmerman swung through it.\n\nSo, now, a series.\n\n\u201cAnything is possible in October,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cI see a lot of different ways to the finish line.\u201d\n\nThe finish line now can\u2019t come Saturday. It could still come Sunday. If that\u2019s to happen, Friday night must be a blip. World Series don\u2019t come around these parts too often. Neither do that many chances to blow a game open. Take advantage Saturday, and no one will remember this long slog Friday night.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Washington\u2019s struggles with runners in scoring position Friday night was a problem the team must solve, and fast.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nzrd1ql8ONjQh0YBziyxytR5fAU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UQG7DBXXU4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
