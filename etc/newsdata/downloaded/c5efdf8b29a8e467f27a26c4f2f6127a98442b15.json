Hollis Johnson\n\nSenior finance reporter Meghan Morris joined Business Insider in October 2018 to cover the asset-management industry. Since then, she's been pulled into several of Business Insider's biggest and most high-profile investigations, including those on the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and the downfall of the coworking company WeWork.\n\nHere she speaks with Business Insider Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell about her latest feature with tech reporter Julie Bort in which the two talked to 20 current and former WeWork employees, executives, and business partners about the wild culture inside one of the most controversial and fastest-growing startups of all time. She shares how she ended up covering WeWork, getting strangers to spill their secrets, and what gets her excited about investigative reporting.\n\nAlyson Shontell: Your day job is covering asset management \u2014 big firms like BlackRock and Pimco. How'd you end up covering a real-estate company like WeWork?\n\nMeghan Morris: Out of graduate school, I started out at a magazine covering private-equity real estate. WeWork started popping up the second year I was at this magazine as this weird upstart \u2014 it was a new business model that no one really wanted to touch. I didn't cover it a lot. That changed when I got to Business Insider and we realized there was a lot more to cover. I started to reach out to former employees via LinkedIn. A lot of people I spoke with had signed extensive NDAs and were scared of talking to the press. I explained to them why they should talk to us and why we'd take them seriously and help them with security. There's a lot of confidentiality and trust involved.\n\nShontell: Convincing strangers to talk to you about sensitive topics is really tough. How'd you do it?\n\nMorris: With a lot of these people, I'd make clear that I was already speaking with WeWork employees so they didn't feel like they were employee No. 1. And I'd say, \"Can I do a gut check with you?\" and, \"Can I check with you to see if I'm on the right track?\" That was a good way to get people to open up. They felt like they were confirming something, rather than telling me new things. After that, they became more comfortable about sharing their experiences.\n\nSome people talked to me for an hour and said it felt like therapy to them \u2014 because of their NDAs they hadn't been able to share these experiences with their families. People are really scared about talking, and having the opportunity to vent a little and explain the inner workings of a company their friends didn't really understand felt cathartic to them.\n\nBut yes, when people sign NDAs it can be hard to get to them to talk. I'd say to them, \"I totally understand you're taking a big risk by talking to me, but here are some examples of where I've taken source security really seriously, and we haven't had legal issues.\" I also assured them we have a legal team in-house to deal with these types of issues if they were to come up.\n\nShontell: You were up at all hours working on this big feature to get it across the finish line. What's the time commitment like if you're sprinting to finish an investigation?\n\nMorris: Often for investigations, potential sources can't meet you during 9 to 5. I'd try to meet them on their own turf, like a coffee shop near their apartment. Showing people you're willing to go where they are, whenever works for them. The job is more \"always on\" because as you start publishing stories, more sources should start coming to you ... it feels like a snowball. Once we started publishing, more people started coming out of the woodwork.\n\nShontell: You and Julie talked to dozens and dozens of people for this story, which ended up being over 5,000 words. How did you pull the draft together?\n\nMorris: I took the lead on trying to organize the story and broke that up into sections like partying and nepotism \u2014 things that seemed to be themes where we could slot in individual anecdotes, and Julie did the same. There were so many crazy stories that didn't make it into the story \u2014 we really had to prioritize what anecdotes showed something about the future of the company and the leadership versus just being a fun one-off story. We tried to think about things that could have ramifications in the future, like a lawsuit attached or something that could have serious financial consequences for the company going forward.\n\nEditors (like West Coast bureau chief Alexei Oreskovic) were also incredibly valuable when we pieced everything together.\n\nOnce we had a general outline of the story, I took a writing day where I holed up in my apartment and wrote about 5,000 words between 9 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. I stepped outside for a quick run to clear my head but, otherwise, wrote straight through the day. Luckily, I had a women-in-financial-journalism happy hour to get me out of the apartment that night, where I could commiserate with fellow writers. Over the weekend, while Julie and I were finishing up the story, I didn't leave the apartment while we edited on Saturday and Sunday, except briefly going to church and for a run. I was also fielding calls from public relations through the evening on Saturday.\n\nShontell: Was there a time when you felt really stuck with your reporting? How did you overcome that?\n\nMorris: At the beginning of this reporting process, few people responded to me. But eventually, a few things changed my feeling: Overall sentiment on WeWork shifted as it became clear the company would not have a straightforward IPO, and people started recommending others to talk to. From there, things snowballed, and eventually, I had to stop taking interviews to focus on writing.\n\nShontell: What gets you excited about these investigative stories?\n\nMorris: So much attention is shone on the very top players, but I hope my stories show that there are whole networks enabling the people at the top, and cultures that are hard to change after they've been set one way. The spotlight needs to move beyond just the leader to who's playing a supporting role, whether we're talking about experienced business people and VCs enabling founders, or billionaires befriending Jeffrey Epstein.", "description": "Business Insider is taking you behind the scenes of our best stories with our new series \"The Inside Story.\"", "authors": ["Olivia Oran", "Alyson Shontell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9393d62e22af3f53201493?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
