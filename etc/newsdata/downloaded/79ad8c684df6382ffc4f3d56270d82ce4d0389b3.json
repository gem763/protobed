It said 12 of them were Syrian nationals and that proceedings were underway to deport them. The other 14 suspects were sent to the police, it added.\n\nTurkish police later said a further 14 suspected jihadists, three of them Turkish nationals, were detained in Istanbul. It said the suspects were planning to attack the celebrations in Istanbul following al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, but did not elaborate.\n\nTurkey has said it shared information with the United States, its NATO ally, ahead of Sunday\u2019s raid in northern Syria and that it is proud to have helped bring \u201ca notorious terrorist to justice\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday Turks were marking the 96th anniversary of the founding of the secular Turkish republic on the ashes of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday the U.S. military had also killed the person who would likely have succeeded al-Baghdadi as the leader of Islamic State, without identifying him.\n\nIslamic State has carried out atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of an ultra-fanatic version of Islam that has horrified mainstream Muslims.\n\nThe death of Baghdadi is a severe blow to the group, which has been in disarray and has no declared successor as leader yet. But it has in the past proved resilient, continuing to mount or inspire attacks in the region and beyond despite losing most of its territory in recent years.", "description": "Turkish authorities have detained 43 people suspected of belonging to Islamic State and of plotting attacks targeting celebrations of Turkey's national day on Tuesday, police and state media said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
