She beat defending champion Nafi Thiam by 304 points to start the countdown to next summer\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cThis a dress rehearsal for next year but I don\u2019t want to think about it, I just want to have a break and reflect,\u201d said Johnson-Thompson. \u201cThis is my fourth World Championships and I\u2019ve not medalled in any of them before, so this is crazy for me.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I thought I was going to run off the line in the 800m and get disqualified. I didn\u2019t take anything for granted until I saw my name on the scoreboard. Just because the timetable was bang, bang, bang, nothing sunk in.\u201d\n\nJohnson-Thompson set four new personal bests in the 100m hurdles, shot put, javelin and 800m in a dominant performance. She held a 96-point overnight lead over Belgium\u2019s Thiam and never looked in danger as the reigning Olympic champion failed to keep up.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 26-year-old moved to train in France in 2017 and had also failed at the World Championships in Beijing and London.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, three-time world heptathlon champion Ennis-Hill said: \u201cTo come back and deliver in this way with all these personal bests is incredible.\n\n\u201cYou have to get to the lowest point, the breaking point. She got to that and she made big changes and decisions and they are the reason she has gone on to improve and become the world champion now.\n\n\u201cShe was so fixated on winning and breaking the 7,000 points that it took away from her performance. Now she has put it to one side it will happen naturally.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "New world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson admitted her stunning heptathlon victory in Doha was a dress rehearsal for the Olympics.
