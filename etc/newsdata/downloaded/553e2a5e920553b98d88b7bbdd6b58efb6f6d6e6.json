Creating Anti-Bullying Comics.", "language": "en", "text": "Jennifer Gilbert was there with her son Jackson, 9, a seasoned fan of Star Wars and Marvel Comics. Mrs. Gilbert discovered Loot over Labor Day weekend, and Jackson has become a once-a-week regular. She has seen the benefit of him finding peers with common interests. \u201cIt has built his confidence,\u201d she said.\n\nLong gone are the days when comic books were seen as a bad influence on young readers.\n\nLast year, annual sales of comics and graphic novels in the United States and Canada reached just over $1 billion, according to estimates by ICV2, an online publication that covers pop culture, and Comichron, an online resource for comics research. Part of the $80 million increase from 2017 was attributed to sales outside of comic stores, which includes chain bookstores and major online retailers, with sales of graphic novels for young readers the biggest factor.\n\n\u201cGraphix, the imprint from Scholastic, has really turbocharged that part of the market,\u201d said Milton Griepp, the chief executive of ICV2. The Graphix library includes \u201cBone\u201d by Jeff Smith, \u201cDog Man\u201d by Dav Pilkey and the memoirs of Raina Telegemeier. Her latest, \u201cGuts,\u201d about tackling fourth grade and coping with anxiety, has an initial print run of one million copies.\n\nAnother significant factor, Mr. Griepp said, are libraries, which have added more graphic novels to their collections over the years. \u201cWe in the comics business owe a huge debt of thanks to the librarians who have helped make this possible.\u201d\n\nPaul Levitz, a former president of DC Comics, has seen the industry go through many changes. Last weekend, he happened to be dining downstairs at Frank\u2019s when he learned about Loot and ventured to the second floor to take a look. \u201cLoot isn\u2019t really a comic shop \u2014 at least not yet,\u201d Mr. Levitz wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a great art experience. With arts education in public schools fiscally challenged, it\u2019s great to have folks like this stepping up to fill the gap .\u201d\n\nSince stepping down from his role at DC, Mr. Levitz has been teaching graphic novel courses at colleges. He said he was impressed by some of the material on offer for Loot\u2019s cartoonists in training, including a binder of instructions for drawing facial expressions. \u201cI wish I had some of those tools for my college course on writing graphic novels,\u201d he added.", "description": "Loot, a new store in Brooklyn, is encouraging children to tell their stories.
