The pics come as Jim's wife, Meghan King Edmonds, has allegedly accused him of having an affair with Carly, leading to their reported split.\n\nBoth Carly and Jim have denied the alleged affair on social media, and now Jim is speaking out in regard to the photos of him with Carly, 22, at the sporting event.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t take her to an event by myself. Get your facts straight,\u201d the 49-year-old former baseball player replied to a commenter on Monday (via Us Weekly). \u201cI was with my best friend and his child. I was trying to do something nice for the girl who just had her boyfriend dumped [sic] her.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time Jim has done something nice for his former nanny. Back in May 2018, Carly shared several shots of herself and her then-boyfriend, Eric, at a country music showcase, praising her boss for getting her the tickets.\n\n\"Hands down the MOST amazing concert experience ever!! Thank you, @jimedmonds15\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc97Not only were we able to have amazing seats, but we got to go backstage and met Jason Aldean, Deejay Silver and Lauren Alaina\ud83d\ude0d #happybirthdayEric #jasonaldean#summerconcert #bestnightever#bestbossever,\" she wrote at the time.\n\nIn September, Carly also posted a pic on Instagram of her hugging Jim's eldest daughter from a previous relationship, Hayley, writing, \"Hi, can you stay here forever? @hayleyedmonds15 \ud83d\udc95#imadopted #thenewEdmondstwins.\"\n\nOn Monday, Carly denied the cheating claims on Instagram, writing, \"I have not and never would participate in any action involving infidelity.\"\n\nJim himself wrote on Monday, \"I did not sleep with our nanny. She\u2019s not just a nanny, she is someone that we brought into our house and promised to protect and look after while she was in our home. We have been treating and raising this young girl like she is our own child! For someone to accuse me of sleeping with her is not only wrong, it\u2019s disgusting and irresponsible.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMeghan King Edmonds and Jim Edmonds\u2019 Nanny Denies Affair\n\nMeghan King Edmonds' Husband Jim Calls Cheating Allegations 'Disgusting and Irresponsible'\n\nMeghan King Edmonds Gets Support From Friends Amid Reported Split From Husband Jim Edmonds\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "He explains the photos of him and his nanny, Carly Wilson, at a hockey game together amid Meghan King Edmonds split rumors.", "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HH2RG58Gq_Nq6yZCydixZQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/d98b2a073b6e1abb19d3e2f2724709ce", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
