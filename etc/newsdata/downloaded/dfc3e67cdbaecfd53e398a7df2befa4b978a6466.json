McConnell has previously supported addressing election security through appropriations.\n\nMcConnell added that the amendment brings the total funding for election security to $600 million since fiscal year 2018.\n\nSenate Democrats have pressed McConnell to bring election security legislation to the floor, citing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But McConnell and many Republicans oppose that legislation, noting that 2018 was a more secure election year and citing concerns about centralizing the U.S. election system. That reluctance has prompted critics to label the Kentucky Republican \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d \u2014 a nickname the majority leader has made clear he disdains.\n\nAfter McConnell\u2019s announcement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Republicans \u201chave finally relented and taken a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats believe this new funding is not a substitute for passing the comprehensive bipartisan election security legislation that experts say is desperately needed,\u201d Schumer's spokesperson wrote in an email to reporters.\n\n", "description": "The amendment brings the total funding for election security to $600 million since fiscal year 2018.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7f/dc/e8566b5a421dbf4d96762cca4149/190919-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
