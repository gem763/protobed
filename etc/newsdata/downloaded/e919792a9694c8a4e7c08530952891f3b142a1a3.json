(Jeronimo Nisa/The Decatur Daily/AP)\n\nWhom do American adults trust the most when it comes to providing fair and accurate information, caring about people and responsibly managing resources?\n\nA new survey by the nonprofit Pew Research Center has an answer that may \u2014 or may not \u2014 surprise you. It\u2019s not military or religious leaders.\n\nThe most trusted are K-12 public school principals, according to the survey and report with its details, titled, \u201cWhy Americans Don\u2019t Fully Trust Many Who Hold Positions of Power and Responsibility.\u201d The report, which you can see in full below, says:\n\nGenerally, the public has the most confidence in the way K-12 public school principals, military leaders and police officers operate when it comes to caring about people, providing fair and accurate information to the public and handling resources responsibly. Some 84% think principals care about the students they serve \u201csome of the time\u201d or \u201call or most of the time,\u201d 79% think police officers care about them at that level of frequency, and 73% have the same level of confidence in military leaders.\n\nReligious leaders, journalists and local elected officials did somewhat worse, but even lower results came in for members of Congress and leaders of technology companies.\n\nThe survey looked at Americans\u2019 views on eight groups of people who hold powerful positions: members of Congress, local elected officials, K-12 public school principals, journalists, military leaders, police officers, leaders of technology companies and religious leaders. In all three categories \u2014 empathy, transparency and ethics \u2014 public school principals came out on top.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n\n\nResults of a new poll released in September 2019 by the Pew Research Center on who Americans trust \u2014 and don't. Some figures were rounded off. (Pew Research Center) (Pew Research Center)/Pew Research Center))\n\nThe survey was taken between Nov. 27-Dec. 10, 2018, and the 10,618 respondents were a nationally representative panel of randomly selected U.S. adults, Pew said. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.\n\nQuestions were focused on public judgments about members of each of the eight groups regarding:\n\nLevel of empathy\n\nAdequacy in performing a specific part of their job\n\nStewardship of resources\n\nAbility to provide fair and accurate information to their constituents\n\nWillingness to admit mistakes and take responsibility for them\n\nFrequency with which they behave unethically\n\nFrequency with which they face serious consequences when they act unethically\n\nThe results showed partisan and demographic differences in opinions about power and responsibility. Some of the results show:\n\nRepublicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party are less likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to believe journalists perform key parts of their jobs \u201call or most of the time\u201d or \u201csome of the time.\u201d For instance, three in 10 Republicans and Republican leaners (31 percent) believe journalists fairly cover all sides of an issue at least some of the time, while about three-quarters of Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party (74 percent) say the same \u2014 a 43-percentage-point difference in opinion between the two groups.\n\nDemocrats and those who lean Democratic are more likely than their Republican counterparts to think K-12 public school principals consistently perform key aspects of their jobs. For instance, Democrats and leaners are more likely than Republicans and their leaners to believe that principals handle resources in a responsible way (87 percent vs. 76 percent) and to think that principals do a good job ensuring that students are developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills (76 percent vs. 68 percent).\n\nRepublicans generally give higher marks to military leaders than Democrats. For example, Republicans are 20 points more likely than Democrats to say military leaders handle the resources available in a responsible way some of the time or more often (89 percent vs. 69 percent).\n\nBlack Americans and Hispanics are more skeptical than white people about the performance of police officers. Roughly seven in 10 white Americans (72 percent) say police officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally at least some of the time. In comparison, half of Hispanics and 33 percent of black adults say the same.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to have confidence in members of Congress and journalists doing their jobs much of the time.\n\nEighty-four percent of respondents said public school principals care about the students in their schools at least some of the time; 81 percent said school principals mostly handle their resources responsibly; 79 percent said they provide fair and accurate information to the public at least some of the time.\n\n\u201cK-12 public school principals do stand apart from some other powerful cohorts in the eyes of the public when it comes to admitting and taking responsibility for mistakes,\u201d the report said. \u201cBy a two-to-one margin, more U.S. adults say school principals take responsibility for their mistakes \u201call or most\u201d or \u201csome of the time\u201d (65 percent) than say that principals take responsibility for mistakes \u201conly a little\u201d or \u201cnone of the time\u201d (32 percent).\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full report:", "description": "These are the results of a new national poll.", "authors": ["Valerie Strauss", "Reporter Covering Education", "Foreign Affairs", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_e3o7xlCgl_asERNnejMAK-njPQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/72FPSHGJBMI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
