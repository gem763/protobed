But when I'm watching them, they remind me of Argentina.\n\n\"That is one side where if they have time, they can be dangerous.\n\n\"We must make sure we are at our best with our defensive systems, because they are very skilful and have quick players.\n\n\"Jamie Joseph compared their two wings to Ferrari cars, so we have to not allow those Ferraris to go to fifth gear or sixth gear.\"\n\nStick added that the Boks would have to be on their toes throughout the contest.\n\n\"We must make sure we don\u2019t underestimate anything,\" he said.\n\n\"They are a proper side at the moment. We don't talk about a Tier 2 side anymore, because they are ranked seventh. Whatever surprises they throw at us on the day, we must make sure we can handle those.\"\n\nKick-off is at 12:15 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Springbok assistant coach Mzwandile Stick has warned against underestimating Japan in Sunday's World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7801/c3400fe6ce914531995d39f1c08f0bef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
