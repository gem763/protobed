(Amy Sancetta/AP)\n\nQ: Are there laws that govern rodent control for condos?\n\nMy neighbor feeds birds 50 pounds of bird food at a time, and now I have squirrels in my unit. Mice and chipmunks are everywhere, and there are root-eating vermin in the ground. My homeowners association refuses to do anything about it.\n\nWe are a 55-plus self-managed community. I paid an exterminator $300 last year to help me control the problem, but he explained that the entire complex has to be treated to eliminate the issue. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated for our 30-unit homeowners association.\n\nA: We don\u2019t understand why the condominium association board refuses to take action. If what you describe is correct, you have an infestation of rodents in and around your building, which is a health hazard for all residents.\n\n[Matters: Solar panel leases can be very tricky. Make sure your buyer takes over the lease after sale --otherwise you\u2019ll be stuck.]\n\nWe\u2019re pretty sure that the governing documents for the condo association require it to keep and maintain the property in good condition. Part of the condo association board of directors\u2019 or property managers\u2019 duties is to make sure that the building\u2019s common elements are maintained. The grounds of the property are considered to be part of the common elements that they must keep in good shape.\n\nSome governing documents should specifically mention that the condo association will take care of rodent and other infestations. What if you had a termite or other wood-boring pest infestation? You'd rightly expect the condo association to take care of that problem, for the good of the entire community.\n\n(Let us just add the caveat that many condo associations have the obligation to maintain everything but the interior space of the condominium units, and others may leave some of the repairs to the unit owners. The governing documents will detail the obligations for unit owners and the association.)\n\nWe think that an issue like the one you describe, that can (and does) affect multiple units, should be addressed by the condo association. We're aware that some homeowners may consider some birds, chipmunks and squirrels to be part of the landscape and the cost of living in most places. But not when they're in your attic, walls and basement.\n\n[More Matters: Yes, you need your own insurance policy for your condo unit beyond the association\u2019s policy]\n\nSeveral years ago, Sam put out a bird feeder and quickly found that there were quite a number of squirrels that figured out how to get at the bird seed. It wound up attracting more squirrels and chipmunks than birds.\n\nSo how do you get the condo association to take action? You can document the damage being caused to your unit and the larger property with photos and videos. You can consult with your expert, who can provide a written opinion to the condo board or property manager that testifies to the problem. And lastly, you can contact your city or village animal control department to see if they view the issue as a growing health hazard.\n\nThe more information you have, the more likely you can convince the board that something must be done if something needs to be done. Having said that, these people are your neighbors; and unless the situation is urgent, you'll need to help them understand the growing nature of the problem so you win their help in fixing this for the long run.\n\nIlyce Glink is the author of \u201c100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask\u201d (4th Edition).
