He was given the heart of a 14-year-old girl who died in 1984.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nIt gave David a new lease of life. He returned to work for another two years and helped probe 23 murders.\n\nWidowed David said: \u201cPeople asked why I was coming back. I\u2019d done 28 years, what was another two?\n\nBut I wanted to complete my 30 years \u2013 and there was nothing wrong with me. I had a donor heart but I felt the same and just wanted to get on with life.\u201d\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar/Sunday Mirror)\n\nThirty pals and ex-colleagues\n\nwill join David for a party near his home in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, tomorrow. And sending best wishes is Sir Magdi \u2013 who has performed more than 2,000 transplants and carried out nearly 40,000 open heart surgeries.\n\nSir Magdi is thrilled by David\u2019s story and said: \u201cAt that time we did not expect people would live more than five to 10 years.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar/Sunday Mirror)\n\nA lot of people who receive organs, like David, go on to do very good things\n\nfor their communities. David was doing massive good as a police officer. I was full of admiration for what he does.\n\nOrgan donation is absolutely essential if we are to realise the full potential of transplantation in the future. This treatment is limited by a shortage of donor organs.\n\n\u201cThis can only be addressed by letting the public know there is a really massive need for increasing organ donation.\u201d\n\nHe said life expectancies for patients like David had increased thanks to better drugs and about 35 per cent now live more than 20 years after surgery.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar/Sunday Mirror)\n\nFrom next spring, Max\u2019s Law \u2013 championed by the Mirror \u2013 will mean everyone is considered an organ donor unless they opt out.\n\nThe law is named after 11-year-old Cheshire lad Max Johnson, who was saved by a heart transplant. Sir Magdi added: \u201cThe opting out law is a fantastic thing.\n\nMy brother died in an accident. He never registered, but told his family he wanted to be an organ donor. When the time came they implemented his wishes. Assumed consent is just that. People should please express their wishes.\u201d\n\nAndre Simon is director of transplantation at Harefield Hospital, Middlesex, where David had his op. He said: \u201cThis shows how a person\u2019s life can be completely transformed through the gift of organ donation.\n\nWe\u2019re really pleased that he is doing so well and are proud to carry on Professor Yacoub\u2019s legacy.\u201d", "description": "Ex-Scotland Yard chief David Aggat was told the transplant could buy him 10 more years when he was given heart of a 14-year-old girl", "authors": ["Eleanor Perkins", "Alan Selby", "Image", "Humphrey Nemar Sunday Mirror", "Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565300.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HN-SM101019oldesthearttransplant05JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
