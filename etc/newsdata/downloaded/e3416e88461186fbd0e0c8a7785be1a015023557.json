No 10 sources said his gambit was designed to make clear the choice facing MPs when they vote on Tuesday, and confirmed that any Tories failing to back the PM will be stripped of the party whip and barred from fighting the next election for the Conservatives.\n\nThe dramatic move came after a rebel alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties as well as Tories fighting a no deal, published a bill which would require the PM to seek an extension of Brexit negotiations to the end of January.\n\nUnder the terms of the legislation, released under the names of Labour\u2019s Commons Brexit Committee chair Hilary Benn and Tory former minister Alistair Burt, Mr Johnson could only avoid an extension by reaching a deal with Brussels or winning MPs\u2019 support for no-deal by 19 October.\n\nTo the fury of Brexiteers, the bill also says that if the EU rejects the new proposed deadline of 31 January, Mr Johnson \u201cmust\u201d accept their preferred date unless the Commons rejects it.\n\nSources close to the rebel alliance said the legislation was crafted to provide Mr Johnson with time to make a genuine attempt to secure and ratify a withdrawal deal, but also to allow sufficient space for litigation in the final weeks of October if he refuses to abide by its terms.\n\nAnti-no deal MPs aim to use an emergency motion on Tuesday, when Westminster returns from its summer break, to seize control of the Commons agenda for the following day in order to force the legislation through both Houses before Mr Johnson suspends sittings next week.\n\nBut the PM made it clear he would not comply with their demands, declaring that there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d in which he would ask Brussels to delay Brexit beyond Halloween.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is not going to happen \u2013 categorically.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to do it by email. He is not going to do it by phone call. He is not going to do it by text. He is not going to do it by tweet. This prime minister is very clear that we are leaving on 31 October. That\u2019s what is going to happen and he will take every step to make sure it happens.\u201d\n\nOfficials said that the 14 October election date had been chosen to allow the victor to attend a crucial EU summit on 17 October at which Mr Johnson hopes to secure a new withdrawal agreement allowing a smooth exit two weeks later. Sherpas will carry on negotiating with Brussels and no-deal preparations will continue through any election campaign period, they said.\n\nBut they brushed aside any suggestion of an electoral pact with the Brexit Party, whose leader Nigel Farage made clear he intends to stand candidates against Tories, saying: \u201cWe are ready for an election. It\u2019s time for a clean break Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe PM said he believed that the chances of a Brexit deal were \u201crising\u201d, but officials said other EU leaders had made it clear that they would not engage until they were sure that parliament would not rule out a no-deal outcome.\n\nDowning Street\u2019s hopes of securing the necessary two-thirds majority for an election were bolstered when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said earlier in the day that he would back an early poll in any circumstances.\n\nAddressing a Labour rally in Salford, he said: \u201dI will be delighted when the election comes, I\u2019m ready for it, you\u2019re ready for it, we\u2019re ready for it, we\u2019ll take that message out there and above all we will win.\u201d\n\nBut the party\u2019s former PM Tony Blair urged Mr Corbyn not to fall into the \u201celephant trap\u201d set by Brexiteers of an election which he predicted would produce a \u201ccomfortable\u201d Tory victory.\n\nMr Johnson did not mention the election plan in his statement following an unscheduled meeting of cabinet ministers in Downing Street.\n\nIn it, he said that the chances of a deal were rising because EU leaders now recognised that the UK was ready to leave on Halloween \u201ccome what may\u201d.\n\nAnd he warned that a Commons vote for further delay would \u201cchop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible\u201d.\n\nUrging MPs to vote with the government against \u201cCorbyn\u2019s pointless delay\u201d, he said: \u201cI want everybody to know \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\u201d\n\nBut a source close to the so-called \u201cGaukeward squad\u201d of senior Tories opposed to no deal said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rich for the prime minister to point the finger at colleagues who plan to defy the party whip \u2013 colleagues who voted for a deal three times while he voted with Jeremy Corbyn to inflict the two biggest parliamentary defeats on a government in British history.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister seems to be doing everything he can to bring about an election, while claiming it\u2019s the last thing he wants.\u201d\n\nScottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \u201c(It\u2019s) plainly obvious ... That Johnson has no plan to get a deal. If MPs blink tomorrow, he will drive the UK off the no-deal cliff on 31 October. He must not get away with it.\u201d\n\nAnd Labour\u2019s Dame Margaret Beckett, a prominent supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said Mr Johnson\u2019s actions betrayed \u201chis fear that he does not have a majority for his scorched-earth Brexit \u2013 either in parliament or in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is now trying to force an undemocratic Brexit through parliament by threatening One Nation Conservatives with deselection, hinting at a snap election or even allowing aides to say he might break the law by refusing to obey legislation passed by MPs,\u201d said Dame Margaret.", "description": "Boris Johnson will call a general election for 14 October if he loses a crunch\u00a0vote designed to block a no-deal Brexit in the House of Commons on Tuesday, senior government officials have said.
