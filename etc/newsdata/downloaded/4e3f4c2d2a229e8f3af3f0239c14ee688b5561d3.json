Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme\u2026.\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!", "description": "", "authors": ["Donald Trump", "Twitter.Com Realdonaldtrump Status"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
