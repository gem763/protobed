The last time the rate was that low was in June 2016.And yet the decision, which was in line with a market consensus, faced two dissenting votes from board members Lim Ji-won and Lee Il-houng.Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the move was justified because of the uncertain trajectory of economic growth and stubbornly low inflation.\u201c[The BOK] cut the benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent in the face of anticipated lower economic growth and low inflationary pressure on the supply side,\u201d he said.As noted by Lee, Korea is facing a multitude of economic headwinds at home and abroad, ranging from weak exports, tepid investment and persistently low inflation to external uncertainties stemming from the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China, Britain\u2019s Brexit and Japan\u2019s export restrictions on Korea.The market is anxiously wondering if a further rate cut is on the cards, which would put Korea on uncharted territory.The governor said that there is still \u201croom for maneuver\u201d in monetary policy.But Lee hinted that the central bank will take a cautious approach given that the bank already used the monetary policy weapon twice in a relatively short time.\u201c[The BOK] will factor in the impact that major external conditions have on the economy and consumer prices, changes in financial markets and the effects of two cuts in July and this month when determining [a further rate cut],\u201d Lee said.Analysts expect that the next cut could come as early as the first half of next year.\u201cThe latest monetary policy meeting was more hawkish than expected,\u201d said Baek Yoon-min, a fixed income analyst at Kyobo Securities, \u201cTherefore, we maintain the previous view of a cut in the first half of next year since it would take a while for the external risks such as the U.S.-China trade dispute to be eased.\u201dHuh The-o, an analyst at Samsung Securities, projected that the next cut could come in February.\u201cThe unexpected dissenting votes limited the impact of a rate cut, but the probability of another cut in the first quarter stands at 60 percent,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the uncertainties surrounding external conditions won\u2019t likely be resolved soon, and even if they are resolved, it will take time to translate into higher inflationary pressure and improvement of economic growth.\u201dThe International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lowered its growth projection for this year to 2 percent, a sharp drop from 2.6 percent expected six months ago.The BOK also slashed its 2019 growth outlook by 0.3 percentage points from 2.5 percent to 2.2 percent.As for next year, the governor painted a positive picture.\u201cNext year\u2019s growth will likely fare better than this year, based on the assumption that global economic and geopolitical conditions will improve,\u201d the governor said.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/16200043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
