Their approach has helped determine which interventions work to impact health and educational outcomes, the committee said, and has \u201ccompletely reshaped\u201d development economics research over the past two decades.\n\nBut Duflo, 46, the second woman and youngest-ever recipient of the economic sciences prize, earned a stream of fierce defenders on social media Monday after a major business publication seemed to downplay her accomplishments \u2014 mirroring the indignities that women in economics have long faced. \u201cIndian-American MIT Prof Abhijit Banerjee and wife wins Nobel in Economics,\u201d read the headline of a story by India\u2019s Economic Times.\n\n(The story later appeared to have been updated with a new headline including all of the recipients\u2019 names: \u201cAbhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer win Nobel in Economics.\u201d Much of the article currently focuses on Banerjee and Duflo.)\n\n\u201cAwful journalism from @EconomicTimes, which is India\u2019s largest selling business and economics newspaper, on today\u2019s @NobelPrize in Economics to Esther Duflo,\u201d tweeted Raju Narisetti, a professor at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cAll they had to do was to not write a stupid headline on the wires story they picked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is awful, @EconomicTimes. Excited about Abhijit Banerjee\u2019s Nobel but mention Esther Duflo as \u2018wife,\u2019\u201d wrote CNN associate producer Aditi Sangal. \u201cShe is an accomplished economist. Name her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name is Esther Duflo. She is the youngest woman to win the Nobel Prize for Economics. AND only the second woman to do so. And still the @EconomicTimes doesn\u2019t think she be called anything other than \u2018wife,\u2019\u201d added lawyer Prachi Tadsare.\n\nThe Economic Times and its parent company, Times Internet, did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nDuflo, 46, acknowledged in a phone interview released alongside the announcement that she was the second woman to be awarded the prize in 50 years \u2014 and the only one still living. The first was Elinor Ostrom, who won in 2009 and died three years later.\n\n\u201cHopefully, it\u2019s onward and forward from now on,\u201d Duflo said. \u201cI think it does reflect the fact that there are not enough women in the economics profession, period.\u201d\n\nWomen are too scarce at all levels, she said: as economics graduate students, assistant professors and beyond. A 2017 Federal Reserve Board study found that women made up just 31% of economics majors between 2011 and 2015, compared to 57% of all majors.\n\nThe field of economics has long been viewed as inhospitable to women. A professional climate survey conducted by the nonprofit, non-partisan American Economic Association, released last month, concluded that women in the field were far more likely to experience discrimination on the basis of sex. \u201cBut women are also substantially more likely to experience discrimination based on marital status/caregiving responsibilities, age, place of employment, and based on research topics,\u201d the report said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it added, \u201cfemale respondents are also much more likely to report having experienced discrimination or unfair treatment as students with regard to access to research assistantships, access to advisors, access to quality advising, and on the job market.\u201d\n\nThe report further found that over the past 10 years, nearly six in 10 female economists felt that the subject or methodology of their research wasn\u2019t taken as seriously as those of their colleagues. Some 43% of female economists reported that a colleague had displayed \u201cinappropriate sexual or suggestive materials,\u201d made offensive sexual remarks, or made gestures of a sexual nature.\n\nEven worse, 3% indicated they had been sexually assaulted by another economist or economics student, while 6% said they had been the victim of an attempted assault.\n\nThe status quo for women in economics \u201cis going to change,\u201d Duflo predicted, even if that change isn\u2019t happening quickly enough.\n\n\u201cI think the profession is starting to realize that \u2026 the general climate and the way we treat each other is not conducive for having more women in the profession,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about promotion, but it\u2019s about the general environment and how people talk to each other and address each other in seminars and things like that.\u201d", "description": "Duflo won the award alongside fellow economists Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT263_duflo_ZG_20191014132522.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
