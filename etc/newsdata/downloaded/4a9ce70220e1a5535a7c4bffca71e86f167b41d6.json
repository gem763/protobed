Now, its supporting the recent impeachment inquiry raised against Trump.\n\nOn October 22, Lipslut launched its \"Impeach\" lip gloss. The peach shade of lip product is expected to ship in November, and as the brand's website explains, half of the proceeds from its sale will go towards organizations empowering marginalized communities to run for political offices. As the brand writes on its website, its hope is that \"someone like Trump never gets elected again.\"\n\nUpon adding the product to your cart, you'll be prompted to choose a charity, with options including The Human Right's Campaign and TIME'S UP. The most popular charity, as chosen by the shoppers, will then receive the profits.\n\nIn an emailed press release, Sones explained that shoppers have long asked for an Impeach-inspired lip gloss, and with Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, now is the time.\n\nThe newest shade in the Lipslut family joins past colors including a berry named \"Notorious R.B.G.\" for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a nude pink named \"Fck Trump\" and a deep red named \"Fck Kavanaugh.\"\n\nIn addition to giving its proceeds to a good cause, the lip product is also cruelty-free and vegan. Made with Vitamin E, the gloss is perfect for looking good, and feeling good about taking a stand on an issue that matters to you.
