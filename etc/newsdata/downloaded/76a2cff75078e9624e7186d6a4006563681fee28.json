The dollar fell.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose for a second day after hiring figures slightly missed estimates for September, while August\u2019s reading was revised upward. Wage gains cooled and the unemployment rate fell, forcing traders of fed funds futures to trim the amount of easing they expect from the Federal Reserve this month. The two-year Treasury rate spiked past 1.40%, and the dollar declined for a fourth straight day.\n\n\u201cThis one comes in pretty close to neutral in terms of the slowdown. It\u2019s not encouraging, it doesn\u2019t look like a re-acceleration in growth, but it also probably puts at bay some of the fears that have come in around the ISM manufacturing and ISM services numbers,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at money manager Wilmington Trust Corp. in Delaware. \u201cThis should make people and investors comfortable that we still have enough job growth to keep consumer spending on the positive side.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s job numbers follow a string of disappointing economic data this week that ratcheted up bets that the Fed will reduce rates this month. The burst of rate-cut optimism helped snap a two-day losing streak in the S&P 500 Index Thursday. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks Friday afternoon -- giving him the opportunity of either validating market expectations or walking them back.\n\nElsewhere, the pound fell as a court heard that Boris Johnson promised to send a letter delaying Brexit if he can\u2019t get a deal by Oct. 19. India pulled the trigger on another rate cut on Friday, the fifth in the cycle so far. China remains closed for a holiday.\n\nHere are the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 Index rose 0.3% at 9:30 a.m. New York time.\n\nThe Index increased 0.1%.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.1%.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Market Index gained 0.2%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%.\n\nThe euro increased 0.1% to $1.098.\n\nThe British pound slid 0.2% to $1.2304.\n\nThe Japanese yen lost 0.1% to 106.99 per dollar.\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries rose one basis point to 1.54%.\n\nThe yield on two-year Treasuries added two basis points to 1.41%.\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced less than one basis point to -0.58%.\n\nJapan\u2019s 10-year yield sank two basis points to -0.211%.\n\nCommodities", "description": "Stocks Gain, Treasuries Fall After Jobless Rate Hits 50-Year Low", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf762701c3c6fba426c418c63e2a6f38e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
