They assert that several leaders who served Chavez and remain in key posts in Venezuela\u2019s regime today wielded cocaine trafficking as a weapon against their ideological adversary, the U.S.\n\nIn 2005, Ch\u00e1vez convened a small group of his top officials to discuss plans to ship cocaine to the U.S. with help from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said a participant in the meeting who, at the time, was a justice on Venezuela\u2019s supreme court, according to the papers. The Bush administration was strongly criticizing his governing style then and had publicly approved of a 2002 coup that failed to oust him.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, Ch\u00e1vez urged the group, in substance and in part, to promote his policy objectives, including to combat the United States by \u2018flooding\u2019 the country with cocaine,\u201d said an affidavit in the documents written by a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent. The former supreme court justice was identified as Eladio Aponte, who fled to the U.S. in 2012 and has been a witness on drug cases, said a person familiar with his role in the investigations.\n\nThe Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro, who was handpicked by Ch\u00e1vez to succeed him, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe documents were filed in a court in Spain by U.S. officials who are seeking the extradition of Hugo Carvajal, a former general who headed Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s military intelligence directorate, on drug trafficking charges. Mr. Carvajal, who was briefly detained in Aruba in 2014 on a U.S. indictment, was arrested in Madrid in April while traveling there on a false passport, officials say.\n\nFirst reported by El Mundo, a Madrid newspaper, the documents assert that Ch\u00e1vez and other leaders in the government collaborated with high-ranking military and judicial officials to ease the movement of cocaine from Colombia through Venezuela and on to the U.S. The documents don\u2019t lay out if a specific delivery of cocaine ordered by Mr. Chavez made it to U.S. shores, but the prosecutors allege that Venezuelan officials took actions that greatly enabled drug traffickers.\n\nAs part of an alliance with the FARC, the affidavit says Venezuela\u2019s government discussed dividing drug profits while providing the rebels with weapons to fight the Colombian government. The American officials characterized the Venezuelan military officers as a gang called the \u201cCartel of the Suns\u201d\u2014a reference to the insignia used by Venezuelan generals.\n\n\u201cThe objectives of the Cartel of the Suns included not only enriching its members but also using cocaine as a weapon against the United States due to the adverse effects of the drug on individual users and the potential for broader societal harm,\u201d said a superseding indictment against Mr. Carvajal, one of the documents sent to the Spanish court.\n\nFormer Venezuelan intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal stands during his extradition hearing to the U.S. in Madrid, Spain, on Sept. 12.

The Colombian cocaine was shipped out from Venezuela via its airports and ports, said Zair Mundaray, the prosecutor. He said politics was a motivating factor for the Venezuelan leadership.\n\n\u201cCh\u00e1vez was very orthodox from the perspective that everything was on the table in the fight against the enemy,\u201d said Mr. Mundaray, once the No. 2 in the Venezuelan attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nA former senior U.S. official who was shown the documents filed in Spain said it was the first time he had seen American authorities alleging that Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s sponsorship of drug trafficking constituted a formal strategy to debilitate the U.S. \u201cThat said, it makes sense for a regime that has long seen itself in an asymmetric war with us,\u201d said the former official.\n\nThe affidavit says that coordination between the guerrillas and the Venezuelan government to traffic cocaine was discussed in meetings with Mr. Carvajal that included Diosdado Cabello, a close Ch\u00e1vez ally now considered to be the Maduro regime\u2019s second most powerful man, and Tareck El Aissami, also a current top official. At one meeting, Mr. Cabello described sea and land drug trafficking routes through Venezuela, the documents showed. At another, Mr. Carvajal said coordination with the \u201ccomrades,\u201d meaning the FARC, was going well.\n\nMr. Carvajal and Mr. Cabello in 2013 sent off speed boats loaded with what appeared to be cocaine from a beach in western Venezuela, according to another witness in the papers identified as Leamsy Salazar by a person familiar with the investigation. Mr. Salazar, then part of Mr. Cabello\u2019s security detail, defected to the U.S. in 2015.\n\nMr. Cabello and Mr. El Aissami, who have both been blacklisted by the U.S. for alleged drug trafficking, have publicly said they are innocent. They didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\n\nThe documents outline how one drug shipment involving 5.6 tons of cocaine was carefully planned but ended in disaster in 2006 when a DC-9 ferrying the drugs en route to the U.S. was forced to land in Campeche, Mexico, because of mechanical problems. Police arrested the pilots and seized the cocaine.\n\nAt a 2008 meeting at a ranch in which Ch\u00e1vez was meeting with FARC guerrilla commander Luciano Marin, the president called Mr. Carvajal by phone and told him to provide weapons to the guerrillas, according to Mr. Salazar, the former bodyguard.\n\nAt the meeting, Ch\u00e1vez also told Mr. Marin that funds provided by Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the country\u2019s state oil company, would pay for uniforms, computers and boats needed by the guerrillas. Mr. Salazar said he also overheard Ch\u00e1vez on the call with Mr. Carvajal say that some of the weapons to be provided to the guerrillas had been used previously be the Venezuelan army while others had been acquired from Russia. Requests for comment at the oil company weren\u2019t returned.\n\nLast month, Mr. Marin, a top negotiator of the peace agreement signed between the guerrillas and the Colombian government in 2016, publicly announced he was again taking up arms against the Colombian government. Shortly before Mr. Marin\u2019s announcement, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had publicly declared that he and another guerrilla commander were \u201cleaders of peace\u201d who would be welcomed in Venezuela.\n\nWrite to Juan Forero at Juan.Forero@wsj.com and Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com", "description": "Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in the mid-2000s ordered his top lieutenants to work with Colombian Marxist guerrillas to flood the U.S. with cocaine in his government\u2019s efforts to combat the Bush administration.", "authors": ["Juan Forero", "Jos\u00e9 De C\u00f3rdoba", "Juan.Forero Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107250/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
