The snap poll will take place between Dec. 9 and Dec. 12 (the haggling on the precise date is testament to the political dysfunction). The idea is that the third general election since 2015 can finally settle Brexit. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nBoris Johnson wants an early vote to restore his Conservative Party\u2019s majority in the Parliament\u2019s lower house, the Commons, even though the next election isn\u2019t scheduled until 2022. Battles over Brexit means the Tories have lost or expelled many of their parliamentarians and if every opposition MP voted against the government, it would lose by 45 votes. Johnson calculates an election could end the political stalemate over Brexit. The last time Britain went to the polls in December was 1923.\n\nWho\u2019s battling?\n\nExpect to hear most from the two biggest parties -- the Conservatives, also known as the Tories, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party -- during the five-week battle. The other parties are the Liberal Democrats, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party alongside the pro-environment Green party and independent candidates. There are also smaller parties linked to particular countries within the U.K. that win seats in the constituencies in their regions: the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru in Wales and four parties in Northern Ireland.\n\nHow are elections won in the U.K.?\n\nA candidate, usually representing a political party, simply needs the most votes to win a seat in Parliament, under Britain\u2019s first-past-the post election system.\n\nTechnically, the party with the most seats wins the election and forms the government, with the magic number at 326 MPs -- half of all of them plus one more. The bigger a party\u2019s winning margin, the more opportunity it has for effecting its agenda. Johnson will be hoping for a sizable majority to force his Brexit deal through, alongside his other domestic priorities on the National Health Service, education and caring for an ageing population. While Britain\u2019s political system mostly used to deliver up majorities for the Conservatives and Labour, that\u2019s not the case any more.\n\nWhat happens if no party wins outright?\n\nA hung Parliament. When this happens, negotiations kick off between the parties. Johnson, as head of government in power before the election, would get the first crack at creating a formal coalition. He could also try to enter into so-called confidence and supply arrangement with a smaller party, with support supplied for budgets and other key votes. This is the kind of agreement the Tories have had for the past 18 months with the Democratic Unionist Party, but that arrangement has now expired, meaning negotiations would have to start again.\n\nA third option under a hung Parliament is for the party that won the most MPs without gaining an overall majority to try to rule on their own as a minority government. This would require ad hoc agreements with smaller parties, and risks repeated defeats and another general election.\n\nHow could tactical voting affect the outcome?\n\nThis has been happening in areas where the opposition vote is usually split, and it could alter results on a national scale because party leaders could be denied the majority they seek if one of the smaller parties agrees not to field a candidate to allow a two-way battle.\n\nWhere does the Queen fit in?\n\nAs monarch, Queen Elizabeth II is head of state, and the government is formed in her name. But with no president, the prime minister holds the highest executive office. Palace officials have worked very hard to keep the Queen out of politics.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson must apply formally to the queen for an election to be held, and the winner must visit the monarch before Parliament starts afresh. No government decisions can be made during an election campaign as the civil service enters a period of so-called purdah.\n\nWhy is a December vote unusual?\n\nIn short -- British weather. Conventional wisdom holds that election campaigns should be conducted in the spring or fall to allow canvassers the maximum daylight to speak to potential voters after working hours and for better weather to encourage a higher turnout. With rain, floods, fog and even snow forecast for November and December by the country\u2019s weather forecasters, the Met Office, voter turnout could be far lower than usual.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The last thing most people want for Christmas is an election, but that is exactly what U.K. voters are going to get.
