The towns of Ras al-Ain and Darbasiya, some 60 km to the east, have been largely deserted as a result of the attack.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his AK Party in Ankara that 109 militants had been killed so far in the two days of fighting, while Kurds said they were resisting the assault.\n\nAccording to a senior Turkish security official, armed forces struck weapons and ammunition depots, gun and sniper positions, tunnels and military bases.\n\nJets conducted operations up to 30 km (18 miles) into Syria, and a Reuters witness saw shells exploding just outside the town of Tel Abyad.\n\n\u201cThe operation is currently continuing with the involvement of all our units... 109 terrorists have been killed so far,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech to members of his AK Party in Ankara.\n\nNATO member Turkey has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for the return of millions of refugees to Syria.\n\nBut world powers fear the operation could intensify Syria\u2019s eight-year-old conflict, and runs the risk of Islamic State prisoners escaping from camps amid the chaos.\n\nErdogan sought to assuage those concerns, saying that militants from the jihadist group would not be allowed to rebuild a presence in the region.\n\nTaking aim at the European Union and Arab powers Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which have voiced opposition to the operation, Erdogan said those objecting to Turkey\u2019s actions were dishonest.\n\nHe threatened to permit Syrian refugees in Turkey to move to Europe if EU countries described his forces\u2019 move as an occupation. Turkey is hosting around 3.6 million people who have fled the conflict in Syria.\n\n\u201cThey are not honest, they just make up words,\u201d Erdogan said in a combative speech, singling out Saudi Arabia and Egypt. \u201cWe, however, take action and that is the difference between us.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish operation began days after a pullback by U.S. forces from the border, and senior members of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s own Republican Party condemned him for making way for the incursion.\n\nThe decision has been widely criticised as an abandonment of Syrian Kurds.\n\nAnkara brands the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists because of their ties to militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey. But many members of Congress, and U.S. officials, credit the Kurds with fighting alongside American troops to defeat Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cBAD IDEA\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria said a prison struck by Turkish shelling holds \u201cthe most dangerous criminals from more than 60 nationalities\u201d and Turkey\u2019s attacks on its prisons risked \u201ca catastrophe\u201d.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the situation in the prisons from Turkey.\n\nTrump called the Turkish assault a \u201cbad idea\u201d and said he did not endorse it. He said he expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and prevent a humanitarian crisis - as Turkey has said it would.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a vocal Trump ally, has criticized his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria and unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nTheir proposed sanctions would target the assets of senior officials including Erdogan, mandate sanctions over Turkey\u2019s purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defence system and impose visa restrictions.\n\nThey also would sanction anyone who conducted military transactions with Turkey or supported energy production for use by its armed forces, bar U.S. military assistance to Turkey and require a report on Erdogan\u2019s net worth and assets.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday to discuss Syria at the request of the five European members, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland. [nL2N26U0WH]\n\nIn a letter to the 15-member Council seen by Reuters, Turkey said its military operation would be \u201cproportionate, measured and responsible\u201d.\n\nThe 22-member Arab League said it would hold an emergency meeting on Saturday. [nL5N26U54A]\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Turkey\u2019s military incursion and cautioned about the possibility of ethnic cleansing.\n\n\u201cIsrael is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nRussia said it planned to push for dialogue between the Syrian and Turkish governments following the incursion. [nR4N26T000]\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nItaly condemned the offensive as \u201cunacceptable\u201d, saying military action in the past always led to terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe intervention risks greater humanitarian suffering and undermines the focus on countering Daesh (IS),\u201d said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.", "description": "Turkey pressed its military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria on Thursday, shelling towns and bombing targets from the air in an operation that has forced thousands of people to flee their homes.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439288635&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991DJ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
