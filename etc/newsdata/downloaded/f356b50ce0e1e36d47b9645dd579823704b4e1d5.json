Only four of the current squad know what knockout World Cup rugby feels like, while it has been even longer since Eddie Jones had that quarter-final feeling. From here on in, it doesn\u2019t get much bigger than this.\n\nDreams will be ended, jobs will be lost and careers ended among the eight teams left at the big-stakes table. On Thursday, Jones compared the World Cup so far to a game of poker, suggesting England can only play the hand they\u2019ve been dealt after their last pool game was cancelled. Is it the winning hand? Only time will tell.\n\nBut it was a different analogy that revealed the magnitude of knockout rugby ahead of Saturday\u2019s match against his former team, Australia.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In the hills of Beppu, north of Oita where England will take on the Wallabies, Jones drew on the history of the samurai spirit to make it abundantly clear that he is aware of what is at stake.\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s do-or-die time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see those hills at the back of us? That\u2019s where all the samurais lived. Every time the samurais fought, one lived and one died. It will be the same on Saturday; someone is going to live and someone is going to die.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Marler stood up to take on responsibility in the absence of first-choice Mako Vunipola, and ensured that his absence did not become a weakness. AFP via Getty Images 3/16 2. Shota Horie (Japan) Arguably the player of the pool stage. Horie\u2019s familiar locks have made him famous for more than just his rugby skills, but it is what he is doing on the field that he deserves praise for. Standout performances against Ireland and Scotland tell you all you need to know about his form so far. Getty Images 4/16 3. Tadhg Furlong (Ireland) Furlong was outstanding against Samoa and has provided strong consistency across the pool stage to help Ireland get back on their feet. With most tighthead props being rotated game by game, it makes selection rather tricky to look for standout moments, but Furlong\u2019s two crunching runs in his most recent outing see him stand out from the rest.

His defensive effort has been supreme with the numbers to back it up, while he is also a key reason why Japan now have a strong set-piece. AFP/Getty Images 6/16 5. Lood de Jager (South Africa) Has stood out from the shadow of Eben Etzebeth to be South Africa\u2019s leading second row so far this tournament.

Slow him down and teams will work out how to beat Japan, but so far no one has managed to do that and Nagare has punished them for it. AP 11/16 10. George Ford (England) A bright light in what has not been a shimmering campaign so far for England, but the way he has surged back into the mix after losing his place to Owen Farrell last year has been impressive.

Kotaro Matsushima (Japan) Five-try Kotro leads the way at the Rugby World Cup, with only Wales\u2019s Josh Adams able to match his haul at the tournament so far.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the game is about and that\u2019s the excitement of the game. You get the best eight teams, all playing for their lives.\u201d\n\nThe may seem a tad dramatic had it not been for the tragic circumstances that have surrounded this match. The death toll of Typhoon Hagibis in Japan reached 74 on Thursday, with Jones starting his press conference with a message of condolence to the victims, read out in Japanese. The 59-year-old was almost in tears again minutes later when the name of his late coach and friend Jeff Sayle was brought up, and given the role he played in not just Jones\u2019s life but opposite number Michael Cheika\u2019s as well, this quarter-final will be an emotionally charged one for the Randwick alumni.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Jones withheld his punches when discussing Cheika \u2013 even commenting that he is \u201cproud\u201d for what the Wallabies coach has done to restore Australian rugby\u2019s reputation \u2013 in order to leave the fighting to his players. There is no doubt that the England squad will have to up their level of performance from what they have produced do far if they are to beat a battle-hardened Wallabies outfit, which has led to Jones calling on his \u201cwarriors\u201d.\n\nHis most loyal of warriors is of course Owen Farrell, the captain who moves back to fly-half at the expense of the unlucky George Ford. Farrell has been far from his best so far at this World Cup, but the prospect of Jones axing his captain was as likely as him failing to make a cricket reference this week: it just wasn\u2019t going to happen. So even if Ford has been one of England\u2019s standout performers so far, moving Farrell back to No 10 was always going to be Plan B.\n\nBut Jones is no fool, and when quizzed on how to get Farrell back to the talismanic figure that he has become, the head coach revealed he took matters into his own hands to ensure that the 28-year-old is looking after himself just as much as he is the team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got quite a big job for us. He\u2019s captain and he\u2019s goal-kicker,\u201d Jones explained. \u201cThe responsibility of being captain at the World Cup is much larger than normal Test matches, because you\u2019re bringing a group of 31 players together for \u2013 how long have we been together now? Eight or nine weeks?\n\n\u201cYou get all the family issues. You go to the dinner table, one brother is happy, one brother is unhappy. Someone doesn\u2019t know if they are happy or not. He\u2019s the father of that group, so to speak. His ability to delegate, to know what to say to players is a challenging experience for a young guy like him. He\u2019s coping with it really well. But I feel like sometimes, maybe earlier in the tournament he spent too much time in the captaincy area and not enough on his own individual prep, but I\u2019ve seen a real change in that this week.\n\n\u201cWhy was Steve Smith so successful in the Ashes? One of the reasons was he didn\u2019t have to worry about the bowling team, he didn\u2019t have to worry about setting fields. All he had to worry about was batting. It\u2019s much simpler when you\u2019re just a player \u2013 when you\u2019re captain you\u2019ve got more responsibilities and as you go on as a captain you learn how to get the balance right.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a warrior. He leads from the front. He competes, he\u2019s tough, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to produce in this team. We\u2019ve got a tough team who competes hard. That\u2019s how we want to play. That\u2019s the England style of playing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting Farrell\u2019s toughness \u2013 Wallaby lock Izack Rodda will remember all too well how much of a punch the fly-half can pack from last year\u2019s shoulder charge that went unpunished \u2013 but questions of his mental fortitude when the pressure is on his team do remain. But it is fair to say that this quarter-final will be the biggest game of Farrell\u2019s career so far.\n\nAfter what has been an incredibly slow-burn of a World Cup so far for England, suddenly the samurais are needed to spring into life. This Saturday we will learn everything about Farrell\u2019s captaincy, Jones\u2019s grand plan and England\u2019s warrior spirit and the stakes could not be any higher. Four years comes down to one match that will confirm whether England extend their stay in Japan until November or are sent tumbling out by a resurgent Wallaby team for the second World Cup in succession. It is do-or-die time, and one team will not survive.", "description": "For the first time in eight years, England\u00a0will tomorrow go into the unfamiliar territory of a Rugby World Cup quarter-final, and few \u2013 if any \u2013 know what will happen.
