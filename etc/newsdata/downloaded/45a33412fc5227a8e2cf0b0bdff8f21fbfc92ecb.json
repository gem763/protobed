The Independent launched a campaign called Cut the Cup Waste to back the move in 2017.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, just before Mr Hammond\u2019s budget, Costa claimed the government would be \u201cdeliberately targeting coffee drinkers\u201d and questioned whether cups made from plastic and paper could be deemed single-use plastic, according to documents seen by The Independent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The government must act on this evidence and introduce a charge without delay,\u201d she said.\n\nA trial latte levy scheme carried out earlier this year by the universities of Sussex and Winchester showed the UK nationally could save in excess of 700 million cups every year.\n\nInstead of applying a tax, ministers decided it was better for shops to offer voluntary discounts. The EAC said at the time the decision showed the government was not serious about reducing plastic waste.\n\nIn its submission to the Treasury in May last year, Costa said: \u201cCosta does not support a tax on single-use cups. Taxation of cups would only add an additional unwelcome tax burden on UK consumers and currently there is no clear evidence as to how a tax will improve the recycling infrastructure or affect behaviour of those who litter.\u201d\n\nThe business also said the government should be wary of \u201cpromoting the view that single-use plastics are not recyclable\u201d, arguing this could lead to consumers just throwing cups away.\n\nCosta said the main barrier to making cups 100 per cent recyclable is poor infrastructure and \u201cconsumer behaviour\u201d.\n\nCoffee cups are 95 per cent paper but the thin lining inside the cup (which prevents leakage) makes them extremely hard and expensive to recycle. There are currently three specialist recycling facilities in the UK that can separate the plastic lining from the paper, meaning just 4 per cent of cups get recycled.\n\nIn its response to the consultation, McDonald\u2019s said consumers \u201cshould not suffer financial consequences as a result of any tax system changes\u201d.\n\nThe fast food chain also said the definition of \u201csingle-use\u201d plastic should be based on how recyclable the plastic is and not the number of times it is used, and argued that plastic bottles are \u201cby far the most effective way of supplying water to consumers\u201d and \u201cplay a vital role in society\u201d.\n\nIn response to this story, McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cSince these comments were made, in response to the government consultation, we\u2019ve swapped plastic for paper straws, signed the UK Plastics Pact, and our customers can have their own water bottles refilled in our restaurants.\u201d\n\nIn its submission, Coca-Cola \u2013 which brought Costa in January this year \u2013 acknowledged that \u201cpublic awareness of the potential negative impacts of single-use plastics has risen considerably in the last 12 months\u201d, but added: \u201cHowever, the benefits of plastics cannot be ignored.\u201d A spokesperson told The Independent: \u201cWe support the introduction of a well-designed deposit return scheme, and reform of the producer-responsibility system to ensure that more of our packaging is recovered and recycled.\u201d\n\nStarbucks did not provide a comment on the latte levy but said it was organising a scheme so cups could be separated from general waste.\n\nCosta declined to comment on this story.\n\nAwareness of plastic pollution has rocketed over the past few years following Sir David Attenborough\u2019s Blue Planet documentary in 2017, but many feel political action to cut plastic is lacking.\n\nIn his budget speech last year, Mr Hammond announced plans to tax all plastic packaging containing less than 30 per cent recycled content, from April 2022. At the time he said the UK would be \u201ca world leader in tackling the scourge of plastic littering our planet and our oceans\u201d.\n\nLeaked documents showed the UK\u2019s leading plastic trade group, the British Plastics Federation (BPF), pushed to weaken the tax despite its own analysis showing a levy would significantly increase the use of recycled materials in packaging.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These are due to food safety laws and the need to keep packaging as resource-efficient as possible.\u201d\n\nHe argued that using recycled content could sometimes \u201cresult in using more plastic, not less\u201d and said that it could make products \u201cextremely difficult to recycle\u201d.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cIt is for these reasons that the plastics industry is providing detailed information to the government to ensure the best environmental outcome, and that the money is invested in improving our national collection and recycling infrastructure.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
