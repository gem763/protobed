Footage from a nearby security camera showed she had been smashed against a building by strong winds, national broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nAnother woman in her 20s was rescued from her house in Ichihara, east of Tokyo, after it was partly crushed when a metal pole from a golf driving range fell on it. She was seriously injured.\n\n\u201cThere was a huge grinding noise, I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. Then I looked up and saw a big hole in the roof, but I was so keyed up I couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened,\u201d a neighbor said.\n\nSome minor landslides occurred and a bridge was washed away, while as many as 930,000 houses lost power at one point, NHK said, including the entire city of Kamogawa. But the number of homes without power had dropped to 840,000 by early Monday afternoon, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said.\n\nSome concrete electric poles were snapped off at their bases, while electricity towers in Chiba were toppled over. Some panels of a floating solar power plant southeast of Tokyo were on fire.\n\nHouses damaged by a collapse of the perimeter netting of a golf training field due to strong winds of Typhoon Faxai are seen in Ichihara, east of Tokyo, Japan September 9,, 2019, in this photo taken by Kyodo.

The company could not say when the plant, which assembles PlayStation gaming consoles, would reopen, he said.\n\nTwo Nissan plants west of Tokyo, including its Oppama plant, suspended operations, suspended operations due to flooding, NHK said.\n\nDESERTED STREETS\n\nThe weakening storm had headed out to sea by mid-morning but authorities warned that heavy rain was likely for some hours, including in Fukushima, the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\n\nAbout four to five typhoons make landfall in Japan every year, but it is unusual for them to do so near Tokyo. NHK said Faxai was the strongest storm in the Tokyo area in several years.\n\nStreets normally busy with commuters walking or bicycling were deserted.\n\nMetal signs were torn from buildings, trucks overturned, the metal roof of a petrol station torn off and glass display cases destroyed, scattering sidewalks with broken glass. Twenty-four hour fast food restaurants in central Tokyo closed, protecting their windows with plywood.\n\nTrees were uprooted throughout the metropolitan area, some falling on train tracks to further snarl transport.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nSome 2,000 people were ordered to leave their homes because of the danger of landslides, NHK said.\n\nParts of the high-speed Tokaido Shinkansen train line were halted but service resumed after several hours. It took hours for other lines to resume, packing stations with impatient commuters fanning themselves in the humid air.\n\nTemperatures were set to shoot up to unseasonably hot levels in the wake of the storm, with 36 Celsius (96.8 Fahrenheit) forecast in Tokyo, prompting authorities to warn of the danger of heatstroke.", "description": "One of the strongest typhoons to hit Japan in recent years struck just east of the capital, Tokyo, on Monday, killing one woman, with record-breaking winds and stinging rain damaging buildings and disrupting transport.", "authors": ["Elaine Lies", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427803229&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8808L", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
