REUTERS/Joshua Roberts (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told lawmakers in a private meeting this week that its controversial digital currency would not launch anywhere in the world until it receives the backing from regulators in the United States.\n\nThe comment about Libra came during a Wednesday night dinner in Washington with top Senate Democrats, one of the Facebook chief\u2019s many stops during a rare visit to the nation\u2019s capital that has brought him face to face with policymakers who have been loudly skeptical of the tech giant\u2019s business practices, including its efforts to protect privacy and stop the spread of disinformation.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, who organized the dinner at Ris, an upscale American restaurant, and serves as the top Democrat on the chamber\u2019s banking committee, said in an interview Thursday that Zuckerberg said the Libra Association, the entity managing the cryptocurrency, \u201cwould not be launching its product without the buy-in from U.S. regulators.\u201d\n\nFacebook confirmed the details of the exchange. Zuckerberg \u2014 who spent Thursday meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2014 declined to answer questions as he navigated past a throng of reporters.\n\nBehind the scenes, Zuckerberg heard an earful from lawmakers about the need for his company to better protect the data it collects and guard against political interference in the 2020 election, members of Congress later revealed. Democrats and Republicans also raised competition concerns with Facebook and its sprawling empire, which also includes WhatsApp and Instagram, at a moment when state and federal regulators are amid antitrust probes.\n\n[Facebook unveils charter for its \u2018Supreme Court,\u2019 where users can go to contest the company\u2019s decisions]\n\nThe criticisms about privacy and competition even led one of Facebook toughest foes, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.), to request during his private meeting with Zuckerberg that Facebook sell WhatsApp and Instagram, an audacious proposal that the company executive did not support.\n\n\u201cI think he was a little taken off guard,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI think that he felt it was not a great idea.\u201d\n\nSince Facebook unveiled Libra in June, the company has faced skepticism from lawmakers who are wary of the tech giant -- in light of recent scandals -- and its ability to mange a monumental change to the financial system.\n\nThe Trump administration expressed early concerns that Facebook has not fully grappled with the threats of money laundering and other risks associated with Libra. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell has said the cryptocurrency poses \u201cserious concerns.\u201d Even President Trump has weighed in, tweeting that Libra lacked \u201cdependability\u201d before suggesting it should be subject to banking regulations.\n\nThe criticisms set the stage for two tense congressional hearings in July with David Marcus, who oversees Facebook\u2019s work on blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrency. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, blasted Facebook as \u201cdangerous,\u201d adding that it would be \u201ccrazy to give them a chance to experiment with people\u2019s bank accounts,\u201d given the company\u2019s previous missteps.\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawmakers including Warner said they had received mixed signals from Facebook about what would happen with Libra in other countries if U.S. regulators sought to stop its launch. Facebook said in written replies to the Senate earlier this month that it believed the Libra Association, which technically operates independently, \u201cwill not offer the Libra digital currency in any jurisdiction until it has fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals in that jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s assurances on Wednesday that Libra hinges greatly on U.S. support, however, cleared up some of the doubt, said Warner, who stressed lawmakers believe Facebook has \u201cgot to get it right before you launch it upon a society.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s visit to the Capitol marks his first known trip here since he testified last year for roughly 10 hours in front of lawmakers furious with Facebook over its privacy scandals. On Wednesday, the tech giant said the purpose of the visit is to discuss the \u201cfuture of Internet regulation,\u201d months after Zuckerberg called on regulators to take a \u201cmore active role\u201d on issues related to Internet policy, including areas such as online extremism, political advertising and data privacy.\n\n\u201cThe rules governing the Internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post in March. \u201cIt\u2019s time to update these rules to define clear responsibilities for people, companies and governments going forward.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Zuckerberg met with top Democrats including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who has sharply criticized Facebook for the way it collects and monetizes user data. His agenda Thursday included sessions with leading Republicans, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the leader of a key antitrust subcommittee, who later said the duo discussed competition issues.\n\n[House lawmakers ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google to turn over trove of records in antitrust probe]\n\nZuckerberg is set to huddle Friday with Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has investigated Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to defend U.S. elections from foreign interference. And he\u2019ll pay a visit to Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the leader of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of its top antitrust committee, according to a person familiar with the matter not authorized to speak on record. The panel has embarked on a broad antitrust review of the tech industry. Last week it issued sweeping demands for documents from Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies.\n\nIn an interview, Blumenthal said he pressed Zuckerberg on the importance of protecting users\u2019 privacy and lawmakers\u2019 work to write the country\u2019s first-ever consumer privacy law. Neither lawmakers nor the Facebook executive committed to specific legislation, but Blumenthal described Zuckerberg as \u201creceptive.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal said he sought to impart a \u201cstrong sense of urgency about the need to safeguard our democratic institutions,\u201d particularly after Russian influence during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cMy feeling from what he said is Facebook shares that sense of urgency,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cBut again these sentiments and perspectives were not specific action, and we\u2019ll see where it goes.\u201d", "description": "Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged in a private meeting with lawmakers that the company would not launch its controversial digital currency, called Libra, anywhere in the world until it receives approval from regulators in the United States.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "September At Pm", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
