The mission aimed to shield the White House from similar foreign threats, Axios reported.\n\n\u201cMeasuring the success of your security staff by the frequency major compromises are identified versus the duration of time since the last compromise is absurd,\u201d Vastakis wrote. \u201cAllowing for a large portion of institutional knowledge to concurrently walk right out the front door seems contrary to the best interests of the mission and the organization as a whole.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey say that history repeats itself. Unfortunately, given all of the changes I\u2019ve seen in the past three months, I foresee the White House is posturing itself to be electronically compromised once again.\u201d\n\nVastakis also used the letter to announce his resignation, citing new leadership\u2019s \"staple tactic\" of \"habitually being hostile to incumbent OCISO staff\" as the \"very reason\" he is leaving.\n\nThe memo comes after Russia and Iran have already attempted to interfere in the 2020 elections.", "description": "An internal cybersecurity memo made public this week warns that the \u201cWhite House is posturing itself to be electronically compromised once again.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cyberhack_053018getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
