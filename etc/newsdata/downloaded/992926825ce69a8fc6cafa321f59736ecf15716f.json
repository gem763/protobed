But while the usual splendour unfolded \u2013 think street stylers praying they get papped outside shows and celebrities pursing their lips at VIP parties \u2013 there was something rather atypical about this season.\n\nFashion, you see, is a mirror of our times and right now, we are in the midst of an awakening.\n\nAs the world contemplates the impact of climate change and the UK ponders the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, this has been a month in which the fashion industry has been forced to consider its impact on both people and the planet.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Getty Images for Prada\n\nBowring believes that every fashion month that passes improves upon the last in terms of increasing positivity towards these poignant messages, but just how did the last four weeks of shows really deliver?\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, many consider the concept of fashion houses presenting new collections of clothes while simultaneously despairing at the state of the environment to be problematic.\n\nAs an industry that thrives on promoting a constant churn of trends, fashion\u2019s rapid turnover means that each year we consume approximately 80 billion pieces of clothing \u2013 a volume which is inevitably putting strain on the planet. Meanwhile, global textile production emits 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases annually, more than international flights and maritime shipping combined.\n\nIt is for this reason that the world at large is condemning the industry for not doing enough and calling on designers to use their influential voices to campaign for change.\n\nEnvironmental activist group Extinction Rebellion (XR), who called for London Fashion Week to be cancelled earlier this summer, began their protesting activities at the bi-annual event by gluing themselves to the doors of the British Fashion Council\u2019s (BFC) main show space and pouring fake blood on the pavement \u2013 a statement intended to represent the consequences of the industry\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nThe group continued to protest over the course of the weekend, culminating in a funeral march designed to show the industry that \u201cenough is enough\u201d.\n\nAlice Wilby, a sustainable fashion consultant and spokesperson for XR, says the group chose to target the event to help communicate the climate and environmental crisis the world is currently facing.\n\n\u201cChange is not happening fast enough,\u201d Wilby says, before imploring brands to encourage their customers to buy less clothing. \"Stop advertising and selling people a vision of a life that doesn\u2019t exist, on a planet that is being destroyed in front of our very eyes.\u201d\n\nWhile XR insists that sustainable efforts by the few are dwarfed by the rest of industry, credit should still be given to those addressing the issue when so many are not.\n\nThis season alone has seen the BFC launch the Institute of Positive Fashion (IBF) \u2013 an initiative designed to champion greener business models and enable positive change \u2013 and designers including Preen by Thornton Bregazzi and Marni produce high fashion garments made from recycled plastic bottles.\n\nElsewhere, Dior presented a green show space decorated with 164 trees in a bid to highlight the need for bio-diversity, while Kering \u2013 the international conglomerate which owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent \u2013 announced that it is going entirely carbon neutral by offsetting its annual greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cKering is committing to become completely carbon neutral as a group across all our operations and supply chains,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we focus on avoiding and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to meet our science-based target, we will offset all our remaining emissions and support the conservation of vital forests and biodiversity around the world.\u201d\n\nDespite Kering\u2019s good intentions, not everyone is convinced that carbon offsetting \u2013 a way of compensating for emissions by making an equivalent carbon dioxide saving elsewhere \u2013 is effective.\n\nSara Arnold, an organiser and activist with XR, says that there is little the industry is doing that is genuinely regenerative and that the only way to avoid irreversible climate change and ecological collapse is through systematic change.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about excessive waste, this shouldn\u2019t be a discussion of eliminating single use plastic at events, but about over-consumption,\u201d Arnold says.\n\nSamantha Conti, London bureau chief at Women\u2019s Wear Daily (WWD) agrees, adding that while many are making strides in sustainability, brands and companies need to push themselves further and ensure that they\u2019re not \u201cgreen-washing or playing to a fad\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe key for brands and companies is to keep up the momentum and to ask more and more questions about the volume of clothing produced each year, the frequency with which that clothing is showcased and sold, and the business models driving the constant churn,\u201d Conti says.\n\nAlongside sustainability, there have also been heightened conversations surrounding diversity this season.\n\nAccording to The Fashion Spot\u2019s annual Runway Diversity Report, autumn/winter 2019 featured the most diverse cast of models since it started keeping a record in 2015.\n\nAnd, while we are still waiting for this season\u2019s figures, a number of designers responded to the heightening social awareness surrounding inclusive representation \u2013 whether that be in terms of ethnicity, gender identity, age, physical ability or body type \u2013 through their spring/summer 2020 offerings.\n\nNew York Fashion Week is well-known for outshining its European counterparts in terms of diversity, and this season was no different.\n\nWhile young models were expected to walk for luxury childrenswear label Lulu et Gigi, this year the brand attracted extra attention for sending nine-year-old double amputee Daisy-May Demetre down the runway.\n\nMeanwhile, swimsuit brand Chromat, an avid supporter of diversity, celebrated 10 years in the fashion industry by casting models of a range of body types, races and ages, including body positivity campaigner Tess Holliday who walked the runway in a white, floor-length dress scrawled with the words \u201csample size\".\n\nAnd then there was the Rihanna Savage x Fenty collection. A show that had been shrouded in secrecy, with guests asked to hand phones in at the door to keep everything under wraps until it was broadcast on Amazon Prime.\n\nModels on the catwalk included Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid and Laverne Cox, while Big Sean and Halsey were among the high-profile performers in addition to Rihanna herself, who opened the show. But the thing that made Savage x Fenty so unique was its representation of women of all shapes, sizes, identities, ethnicities and physical abilities.\n\n\u201cI'm looking for unique characteristics in people that aren't usually highlighted in the world of fashion as it pertains to lingerie and sexy\u2014what society sees as sexy,\u201c the singer said at the beginning of the 50-minute documentary.\n\nDesigners also made a deliberate attempt to be more age inclusive this season with Kate Spade, Rixo and Simone Rocha choosing to celebrate the beauty of all women, from the young to those in their early seventies.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have a broad range of women,\u201d Nicola Glass, creative director at Kate Spade, told CNN Style. \u201cKate Spade as a brand has always shown a diverse range of women in their marketing, but this is the first time we've really reflected that in a runway show.\u201d\n\nCarla Buzasi, managing director at WGSN, believes this shift is a direct result of consumer demand, with increasing numbers of people expecting brands to do more than just a nod to diversity and inclusivity.\n\nBowring agrees, adding that runway diversity should not feel like a \u201csocial requirement\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is more to be done in order to represent an \u2018all-inclusive cast\u2019, from New York, London, to Milan and Paris, there have been many joyous and uplifting shows that have celebrated diversity and inclusivity by encompassing models of all types \u2013 although the fact it still garners comment shows it is the exception rather than the rule,\u201d Bowring says.\n\nShe continues by explaining that while these steps may appear small, they are still significant, particularly when reading the positive impact that these shows have on the next generation of consumers on social media.\n\nWhile the challenges facing the fashion industry may seem insurmountable, it is important to remember that much progress has been made over the last 12 months.\n\nFrom Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg becoming a spokesperson for a new generation who refuse to compromise on their ethics to XR tapping into consumer consciousnesses and two of the industry\u2019s biggest powerhouses pledging to stop using size zero models, the industry is finally undoubtedly advancing towards a greener and more inclusive future.", "description": "After four months of catwalk shows, presentations and sartorial peacockery, Fashion Month is finally drawing to a close.\u00a0But while the usual splendour unfolded \u2013 think street stylers praying they get\u00a0papped\u00a0outside\u00a0shows and celebrities pursing their lips at VIP parties \u2013 there was something rather atypical about this season.
