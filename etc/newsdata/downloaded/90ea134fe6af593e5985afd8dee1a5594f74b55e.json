Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.\u201d\n\nIn line with Uefa\u2019s anti-racism protocols, an announcement was made in the 28th minute of Monday\u2019s fixture, warning fans that any further racist abuse could result in the game being abandoned, while there was another pause shortly before half-time.\n\nA three-step protocol from Uefa would have allowed officials to take the teams off the pitch for a break in play as a second measure, with the final step being to call off the game.\n\nInfantino, who introduced the protocol while at Uefa., also said: \u201cSo many times we say there is no place for racism in football, but nonetheless we still face challenges to tackle this problem in our sport, as we do in society.\n\n\u201cWe will need the support of public authorities to help us identify and punish the culprits, but we probably also need to think more broadly on what we can do to fix this.\n\n\u201cWhen we proposed the three-step procedure in 2009 when I was at Uefa, and then made the regulations even tougher a few years later, we could not have imagined that so shortly thereafter we would again be having to think of how to combat this obnoxious disease that seems to be getting even worse in some parts of the world.\u201d\n\nThe cases against the FA and BFU are to be dealt with by Uefa\u2019s control, ethics and disciplinary body, though the date of the meeting has not yet been confirmed. Fifa said it would extend any sanctions to a worldwide level.\n\nAn FA spokesperson told the PA news agency: \u201cWe acknowledge the charges, but will not be commenting further as it is an ongoing process.\u201d\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate said he believed his players and staff made a \u201cbigger statement than any team ever has done within international football\u201d with their actions in Sofia.\n\nThe England players and staff decided to finish the match during a half-time talk, but 10 minutes before the break Southgate spoke to assistant coach Steve Holland about the likelihood of the match being abandoned given the racist abuse in the Vasil Levski National Stadium.\n\nWhen asked which sort of punishment should be dealt, Southgate said: \u201cI really think other people have got to deal with that.\n\n\u201cWith respect, the amount I\u2019ve had to deal with is remarkable and other people are in positions to be able to affect that.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you what would be the right answer for that, so I think clearly it has got to be dealt with differently.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that we weren\u2019t able to stop incidents happening, and so now something clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step with regard to that, because it\u2019s remarkable to have such a spotlight on a game and for that all to happen.\n\n\u201cBut sadly, from a societal perspective, that seems to be what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nUefa president Aleksander Ceferin urged the \u201cfootball family\u201d to \u201cwage war on the racists\u201d.\n\nCeferin blamed a \u201crise in nationalism\u201d across Europe for fuelling racism at matches and said football had become \u201ccomplacent\u201d in tackling the problem.\n\nSports minister Nigel Adams has written to Ceferin on behalf of the government, urging Uefa to take \u201curgent action to ensure that all football authorities and fans are clear that the consequences of failing to tackle this issue will be severe\u201d.\n\nThe Slovenian, though, believes Uefa has some of the toughest sanctions in sport in dealing with racist supporters and feels criticism of the governing body\u2019s handling of the issue is unfair.\n\n\u201cAs a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some of the views expressed about Uefa\u2019s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark.\n\n\u201cUefa\u2019s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches.\u201d\n\nCeferin pointed out that Uefa was the only football body to ban a player for 10 matches for racist behaviour, the most severe punishment in the game.\n\nWithin minutes of Ceferin\u2019s statement on Tuesday, the BFU announced the resignation of its president Borislav Mihaylov, saying the current position was \u201cdetrimental to Bulgarian football\u201d. Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borissov had earlier called for Mihaylov to step down.\n\nPA", "description": "Fifa president Gianni Infantino has called for \u201cnew, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football\u201d following the abuse aimed at England\u00a0players during their Euro 2020 qualifier\u00a0in Bulgaria\u00a0on Monday.", "authors": ["Alex Pattle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/05/14/Gianni-Infantino-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
