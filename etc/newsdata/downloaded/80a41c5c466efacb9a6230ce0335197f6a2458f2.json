For me at least, it was the most addictive yet also most unsatisfying social medium. If lushly illustrated sites like Instagram are the equivalent of a fancy Las Vegas casino with chandeliers, free champagne and elegant carpeting, Twitter is the social media equivalent of a row of gas station slot machines being repetitively worked by emaciated, chain-smoking senior citizens.\n\nFor other people, the most stress-inducing platform might be Instagram \u2014 everyone looks so beautiful and fit, even it if is partly due to Photoshop \u2014 or maybe Facebook \u2014 why are their kids doing so much better than mine? Or maybe it\u2019s Tinder, for reasons that should be obvious. These don\u2019t particularly bother me, because I don\u2019t compare myself with other people much, but others\u2019 experiences are different.\n\nAnd that\u2019s my first piece of advice: Pick the social media platform that you find most stressful, and quit it. Don\u2019t quit social media or your phone cold turkey. Just quit one platform. If you\u2019re like me with Twitter, you\u2019ll be surprised how your stress level drops.", "description": "", "authors": ["Glenn Reynolds", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Attention-Monetized-Consumers-Make-Reasonable-Limits-Supply-Column"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
