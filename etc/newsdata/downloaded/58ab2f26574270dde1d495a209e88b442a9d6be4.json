(Picture: WUSA9/Dignity Health)\n\nA tiny baby born so prematurely she was shorter than a Barbie doll has finally gone home after 150 days in hospital.\n\nBaby Kallie Bender was born more than three months premature on May 24 in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nShe weighed just 0.8 pounds at birth, making her one of the smallest babies ever born in Arizona, according to Dr Vinit Manuel.\n\nDr Manuel said Kallie\u2019s chance of survival was very low. But she spent five months gradually improving at St\u2019s Joseph Hospital and Medical Center\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit and is now set to be discharged to join the rest of her family.\n\n\u2018Now she weighs more than seven pounds and is ready to go home today,\u2019 Dr Manuel said, according to AZ Central.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Just to tell you briefly about babies who are born so small, there is something called a tiny baby registry and worldwide there are about 225 babies in that registry since 1936,\u2019 Dr Manuel continued to say, adding that Kallie was on that list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKallie\u2019s mom, Ebonie Bender, said she had an ultrasound appointment on May 20, which is where she learned she would need emergency surgery to save her daughter\u2019s life.\n\nDonald Trump branded 'grotesque' for comparing himself to victims of racist lynchings\n\nHer pregnancy was considered high-risk because of her blood pressure. There was also a lack of fluid around the baby causing a condition called absent end diastolic flow.\n\nDr Manuel wrote in a press release: \u2018Absent end diastolic flow occurs when the blood flow is reduced or reversed from the placenta to the unborn baby, preventing them from getting the nutrients they need.\u2019\n\n\u2018This condition can affect the baby\u2019s growth in utero and impact their lung and gastro-intestinal development.\u2019\n\nKallie\u2019s father, Dameon, holds his daughter as nurse Becky Cole examines her.

Although she\u2019s going home with oxygen and her feeding tube, she\u2019s still doing an amazing job at fighting..\u2019", "description": "Baby Kallie Bender was born more than three months premature on May 24 in Phoenix, Arizona and will return home after 150 days in hospital.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571751674_1571759532.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
