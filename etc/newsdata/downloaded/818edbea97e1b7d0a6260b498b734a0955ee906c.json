A day later, the actress posted a photo of her with family and friends from a private jet and wrote \"Bye bye Dorian.\"\n\nVergara was criticized for her posts with users saying that Hurricane Dorian has forced many people out of their homes and others have died and that her photos and captions make light of a grave situation.\n\n\"Hey Sofia. Have some respect. Plenty of hard folks trying to make it out of their homes safely prior to the hurricane coming ashore,\" wrote one user under Vergara's photo. \"No need for your privileged and tone-deaf statements.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Vergara did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nIn a now deleted photo, \"beauty influencer inferencer\" Natalie Romo, posted a picture of herself in a purple bikini with the water as a backdrop and tagged her location as Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nMore: Disney Cruises responds amid backlash for leaving 'some of our crew' in Bahamas for hurricane\n\n\"Using a tragedy for likes on Instagram and an opportunity to post a bikini picture. Classy. So pathetic and insensitive,\" remarked a follower.\n\nRomo responded saying that she loves the Bahamas and its people and that the photo wasn't meant to offend anyone.\n\n\"I took this photo last week and I thought I would share. I don\u2019t mean to offend you or anyone what\u2019s happening at the Bahamas is a tragedy im spreading awareness,\" she responded.\n\nA woman who goes by Isabelle Shee on Instagram also shared a photo of herself in a bikini on the beach in Nassau, Bahamas. A few people noted that it was an \"interesting way of sending, prayers and love,\" and another sarcastically remarked that she looked \"devastated.\"\n\nHer caption was updated in response to criticism she was receiving.\n\n\"Devastated to hear about the impact of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas... Praying for a quick recovery,\" Shee wrote with a praying hands emoji. \"*disclaimer: this was taken AT the Bahamas back in January. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have any un-happy photos in the Bahamas as all my memories there are good.\"\n\nFitness model Tatiele Polyana and Gleicy Santos also received backlash for sharing bikini photos coupled with heartfelt captions about the Bahamas.\n\nHurricane Dorian technically diminished to Category 2 status Tuesday as it slowly turned to the northwest, but the historic and violent storm was growing in size as it moved away from the Bahamas and grazed the Florida coast.\n\nThe storm lingered over the Bahamas after making landfall three times on Sunday, triggering severe flooding. At least five people died in the Bahamas and thousands of homes are in ruins, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.\n\nHurricane Dorian isn't the first time social media users have been slammed for using a tragedy to gain likes or attention.\n\nLast year, Raline Shah and author Kimberly Williams-Paisley were among many who were criticized for posting photos during the California wildfires and using hashtags related to the tragedy to gain traction.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Janine Zeitlin\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hurricane Dorian: Sofia Vergara, IG users criticized for 'tone-deaf' posts", "description": "Sofia Vergara and several Instagram influencers have been criticized for their social media posts during Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HgbTefW1Tt6rSCqMDPpxgw--~B/aD0yODU2O3c9NDI4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_life_698/17f191d1363927fb7280d2935b8df083"}
