A recent study quantifies the absurdity: U.S. drug costs are almost four times higher than the average in 11 similar countries.\n\nWhat to do about it, of course, is the hard part. But there are signs of a bipartisan consensus forming.\n\nThe most logical first step is to give the government power to negotiate on behalf of the 45 million Medicare prescription beneficiaries, and to use average international drug prices as a ceiling. That\u2019s what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is suggesting in a plan she recently introduced, and what President Donald Trump has also said he favors. Such a reform would mean prices more accurately reflect a drug\u2019s true value \u2014 and could lead to savings of $49 billion annually just on Medicare prescriptions, not to mention a significant reduction in insurance premiums.\n\nPelosi\u2019s proposal would offer other benefits besides. It includes a stiff fine for drug companies that won\u2019t negotiate, which is a simpler and more easily enforceable penalty than earlier versions had envisioned. It would also extend the negotiated prices to everyone, not just Medicare participants, which should prevent companies from gouging the private market to make up for lost revenue.\n\nAnother useful provision would limit drug-price increases to the rate of inflation. That\u2019s something the speaker and some Republican senators can agree on. A bipartisan plan hatched by the Senate Finance Committee includes a similar provision. Clearly it\u2019s needed: For the 12th year in a row, the retail price of prescription drugs commonly used by seniors has increased faster than the general inflation rate.\n\nThat said, the plan isn\u2019t perfect. Some key details \u2014 such as how many drugs should be subject to the price index, and what the grounds would be for inclusion \u2014 need to be ironed out. There\u2019s also the risk that such an index could lead to a circular effect, with countries basing prices more on what their neighbors are doing than on the true value of the drugs.\n\nBut the goal of getting U.S. prices in line with global norms is surely right: Why should Americans pay for 70% of global biopharmaceutical profits when they account for only half of the world market?\n\nThe drug industry says subjecting U.S. prices to international caps will stifle innovation and prevent investors from taking chances on important drugs. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said, those are \u201ctired talking points\u201d that generally don\u2019t reflect reality. Studies have shown that when drug prices increase, the additional money doesn\u2019t necessarily go toward research and development. In fact, drug companies on average spend less than 25 percent of their revenue on R&D. More to the point, companies that don\u2019t innovate won\u2019t be around for very long.\n\nThe fact is, the current system is failing. At an otherwise polarized moment in Washington, controlling drug prices is an issue that can command rare bipartisan support. It\u2019s an opportunity America can\u2019t afford to miss.\n\n--Editors: Alexis Leondis, Timothy Lavin.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the few things Democrats and Republicans can agree on these days is that drug prices are out of control.
