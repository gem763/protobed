Jonas is set to join the singing competition in spring 2020. USA TODAY\n\nGrab the tissues!\n\nTuesday's episode of \"The Voice\" was a tearjerker, leaving contestants and coaches sobbing during the fifth night of Battles on the NBC show.\n\n\"I said from the beginning that I wasn't going to be up on this TV crying in front of y\u2019all,\" singer Rose Short said. Well, she was wrong. \"I\u2019ve cried this whole journey. \u2026 Tears of gratitude.\"\n\nShort went head-to-head with Jessie Lawrence during their playfully sexy rendition of The Weeknd's \"Can't Feel My Face,\" but it was about more than just their vocals.\n\n\"How proud do I feel right now? I knew you were magical, but I didn\u2019t know you were going to fire up the room,\" coach Gwen Stefani told the pair. \"You have something special and you need to own it. It\u2019s not even just your voice, it\u2019s you.\"\n\nLast night on 'The Voice': Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson are hot and bothered by this 'crazy sexy' duet\n\nBlake Shelton said Stefani has been raving about the duo. \"This may come as a shock to the both of you, but Gwen spends a lot of time with me when we aren\u2019t working on the show. \u2026 She has talked a lot about the two of you and this pairing.\"\n\nStefani made the \"unbelievably heart-wrenching decision\" to crown Short the winner, but she had no doubt that Lawrence would stay in the competition and on her team.\n\nThe \"No Doubt\" rocker instantly saved Lawrence, prompting a congratulatory bear hug from Kelly Clarkson. Shelton then stole her thunder (literally) by hitting his steal button.\n\n\"Blake wants to sleep alone tonight,\" host Carson Daly joked. But Shelton's uncharacteristically sweet message may actually earn him some extra cuddles.\n\n\"Let me say my piece,\" Shelton said. \"I\u2019m not going to make a pitch to you, because (Stefani) is the coach for you. But I wanted to show you how much respect I have for you and how much you deserve to be on this show, dude.\"\n\nLast week on 'The Voice':Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani break up over this (double) steal-worthy duet\n\nI can\u2019t tell u how HAPPY I am right now!! Yay Rose and Jessie!! gx \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 #TeamGwen#VoiceBattles \u2014 Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) October 23, 2019\n\nShelton's touching words made Clarkson and Stefani burst into tears, along with Lawrence, who battled homelessness on his pursuit of music.\n\n\"I was the only one who turned for you, because I heard something that was raw and cool in your voice. It makes me feel so good to hear everyone recognize that in you,\" Stefani said. Lawrence chose to stay on her team.\n\n\"Who isn\u2019t in tears?\" Daly added.\n\nWhen an artist moves you to tears \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d #VoiceBattlespic.twitter.com/ikylRhP6Fk \u2014 Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson) October 23, 2019\n\nStefani \u2013 who lost singer James Violet earlier in the night to John Legend \u2013 said it was \"God's plan\" for her to hang onto her save for Lawrence.\n\n\"I\u2019m so happy I stole James,\" Legend said. \"Jesse was supposed to be on Team Gwen. I\u2019m happy for him and I\u2019m happy for her that it all worked out.\"\n\n\"The Voice\" continues Monday at 8 EDT/PDT on NBC with the help of \"mega-mentor\" Taylor Swift.
