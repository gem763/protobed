But just how powerful is it, and how exactly did it get there in just under two and a half decades? To fully understand the company\u2019s trajectory, and what it\u2019ll mean for future antitrust regulation, I recommend reading former New York Times reporter Charles Duhigg\u2019s new profile of the company, published in The New Yorker this morning. It\u2019s aptly titled \u201cIs Amazon Unstoppable?\u201d\n\nIt features an exhaustive collection of intricate details about the company\u2019s operations and history, combined with smart analysis and some telling on-the-record and anonymous quotes from current and former executives. But primarily, Duhigg explores the scary notion that Amazon may be impossible to rein in, whether through regulation or standard capitalist competition.\n\n(Interestingly, it pairs nicely with this feature in The Atlantic published today titled, \u201cJeff Bezos\u2019s Master Plan,\u201d which takes a more personal look at the upbringing and beliefs of the enigmatic CEO; Bezos declined to be interviewed for both articles. It ends on a particularly chilling kicker that everyone should read.)\n\nAmazon\u2019s growth has come at great cost to other companies and human workers\n\n\u201cIs Amazon Unstoppable?\u201d smartly starts from a position of praise. It follows Ian Freed, an early Amazon employee who helped oversee the company\u2019s Kindle, Fire Phone, Fire TV, and Alexa and Echo projects. One particularly interesting anecdote is how Freed\u2019s failure with the Fire Phone gave birth to Amazon\u2019s far grander ambitions in the artificial intelligence and smart home markets.\n\nOne of Freed\u2019s standout ideas was a feature that would let you, using your voice, ask your phone to play a song. The feature became the foundation for Alexa and the Echo speaker, and Freed was given a substantial budget from Bezos himself to build the technology in house, instead of licensing it from a third-party company, as was the case with the Fire Phone.\n\nThe results have been staggering: Alexa is now in tens of millions of homes around the world, and it underpins Amazon\u2019s continued expansion into the smart home and appliance markets. Alexa has also made Amazon a major player in artificial intelligence. Freed\u2019s other successes have similarly helped Amazon dominate the market for e-readers and ebooks and digital set-top boxes and streaming devices. \u201cNo other tech company does as many unrelated things, on such a scale, as Amazon,\u201d Duhigg writes.\n\nBut Duhigg\u2019s examination of Freed \u2014 how passionate he was about Amazon\u2019s internal company culture and how his dedication to Bezos\u2019 infamous \u201cLeadership Principles\u201d gave birth to world-changing ideas and products \u2014 transitions to a more sinister look at the cost of Amazon\u2019s growth. It\u2019s here that the article\u2019s main theme shines through. What, if anything, can stop a company that\u2019s expanded this far and in such a short time, and how do we begin to calculate the damage left in its wake?\n\nThe article clocks in at more than 14,000 words, and it includes a thorough examination of all of the company\u2019s most high-profile controversies that lays out with clinical precision the case against Amazon from the perspective of its fiercest critics. But it\u2019s well worth every sentence to understand the breadth of Amazon\u2019s business and what it could spell not just for the future of American commerce, but the dozens of other industries and product categories Amazon now engages in.\n\nHere, again, is the link to \u201cIs Amazon Unstoppable?\u201d Go read it.", "description": "Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most powerful corporations on the planet.
