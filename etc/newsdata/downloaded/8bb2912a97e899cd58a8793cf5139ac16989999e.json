However, at the end of 2015, OCM had received assistance from Glencore.\n\nMarsden said on December 1, 2015, he told Eskom that Optimum was removed from business rescue and no longer faced being liquidated and would honour its coal contract with the power utility.\n\nThis came after Glencore promised that it would assist Optimum with funds monthly to honour its contract with Eskom, after Optimum rejected an offer from Tegeta to buy its mine.\n\nEvidence leader, advocate Vincent Maleka SC, read a letter which Koko wrote to the former Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources Dr Thibedi Ramontja about the business rescue practitioners.\n\nKoko claimed he was perplexed by this about-turn by Optimum and Glencore, and said Optimum shouldn't be perceived as operating in the nation's interests.\n\nIn that letter, Koko didn't mention at any point that Tegeta intended to buy Optimum and its holding company, Optimum Coal Holdings (OCH).\n\nMarsden testified that he was perplexed as to why Koko wrote to the DG.\n\n'Clear misrepresentation'\n\n\"By the time he wrote the letter, the mine was being removed from business rescue and could not be liquidated. There was a clear misrepresentation of the facts. I see no reason why Koko wants intervention from the department because we were honouring our contract with Eskom.\n\n\"It is quite disturbing that Eskom wanted to play the hardball and they achieved that following our December 1, 2015 meeting,\" he said.", "description": "Business rescue practitioner Piers Marsden expressed shock and dismay on Wednesday regarding a letter written by former Eskom executive Matshela Koko to the department of mineral resources.", "authors": ["Ntwaagae Seleka"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7886/5468b4040b6646bf8d3ddf377ca19cce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
