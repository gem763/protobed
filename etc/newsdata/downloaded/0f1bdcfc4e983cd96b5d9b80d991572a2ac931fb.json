Frankfurt's main stock index .GDAXI, seen as sensitive to trade wars because of its export-oriented components, ended up 2.9% for its biggest daily gain since January 4.\n\nThe U.S.-China deal agreed on Friday covers agricultural purchases, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections, and it averted a tariff hike scheduled for next week, though there was no mention of tariffs set to rise in December.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose as much as 1.9% but ended the day up 1.1% after the agreement announcement triggered selling.\n\n\u201cAnything that was less than a comprehensive agreement was likely to see some degree of market selloff,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe timing had a lot to do with the volatility. There were 15 minutes to go in the trading day on a Friday,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors had said they were hoping for, at best, a deal limited in scope, and noted that rhetoric had in the past failed to translate into meaningful action.\n\n\u201cWe have been here before, where we have seen positive talk. It\u2019s possible they will be able to do a smaller deal around tariffs, where there is some room for movement,\u201d said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 390.17 points, or 1.47%, to 26,816.59, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 32.14 points, or 1.09%, to 2,970.27 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 106.27 points, or 1.34%, to 8,057.04.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 2.31% and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.38%. Emerging market stocks rose 1.51%.\n\nPOUND RALLIES\n\nSterling jumped 2.55% versus the dollar this week, its largest weekly gain in more than two years. The EU Brexit negotiator reported a \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting with his British counterpart.\n\nSterling GBP= ended the session at $1.2647, up 1.66%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve said it would begin buying about $60 billion per month in Treasury bills to ensure \u201cample reserves\u201d in the banking system, a program that will continue at least until the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe dollar fell toward its session lows after the Fed announcement.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.37%, with the euro EUR= up 0.33% to $1.104.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.40% versus the greenback at 108.43 per dollar as its global safe-haven luster faded.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices rose after Iranian media said a state-owned oil tanker had been attacked in the Red Sea near Saudi Arabia, raising the prospect of supply disruptions, but bearish oil demand forecasts are seen keeping a lid on gains.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 rose 2.54% to $54.91 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 traded at $60.69, up 2.69% on the day.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 9, 2019.
