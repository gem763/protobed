And who loses as a result? Americans.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), is the new face of the administration's immigration policy. He has called immigrants \u201cinvaders\u201d and said the sonnet at the base of the Statue of Liberty is really just about people coming from Europe, is the new face of the administration\u2019s immigration policy. In fact, last week he reportedly pushed out John Lafferty, the head of the USCIS asylum office who last year won a leadership award.\n\nYOO AND PETERSON: TRUMP CAN MOVE FUNDS FOR BORDER WALL \u2014 AND THE SUPREME COURT WILL BACK HIM\n\nJust last week we learned about a new administration policy to use videos instead of human interpreters in immigration court, which has delayed asylum proceedings by adding steps and in some cases extraneous information. Furthermore, the videos focus on voluntary departures and criminal penalties, not asylum seekers\u2019 legal right to apply for protection. Subtlety is not a characteristic of the administration\u2019s approach.\n\nOn Monday, the administration is expected to publish a proposed rule that would make it harder for asylum seekers to work. The rule would eliminate a requirement that USCIS process asylum seekers\u2019 initial work permit applications within 30 days, potentially leading to lengthy delays in work authorization.\n\nIn addition to putting up a roadblock to integration, the move would shrink a pool of workers in an already tight labor market, reduce tax revenue, and potentially encourage asylum seekers to work without authorization.\n\nWhile the economic impact of Trump\u2019s changes to immigration policy are remarkable, the moral collapse of our role in the world is most striking.\n\nAnd, later this week, the administration is due to determine the Fiscal Year 2020 refugee cap. Reports are that the cap could fall to 15,000 refugees granted admission per year. Numbers like this would decimate cities and towns throughout the Midwest that have grown increasingly dependent on refugee contributions to grow labor forces and tax bases.\n\nWhile the economic impact of Trump\u2019s changes to immigration policy are remarkable, the moral collapse of our role in the world is most striking.\n\nPutting families in danger \u2014 ones fleeing violence, persecution and destitution \u2014before they come to America or after they\u2019ve arrived hurts our standing on the world stage. It\u2019s bad policy. It\u2019s morally bankrupt. It runs counter to the country we should continue to be. It also runs counter to United Nations tenets of asylum \u2014 that countries should not turn away \u201ca refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d\n\nBut this is exactly what the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy does: it prevents migrants from countries south of Mexico from entering the U.S. until they have sought asylum in one of the nation\u2019s they\u2019ve first traveled through, which is simply an effort to prevent Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Hondurans \u2014 who represent the vast majority of asylum seekers, and 75 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions \u2014 from ever entering the U.S.\n\nThat leaves them in border towns in Mexico, which are unsafe. Last week the Los Angeles Times reported that asylum seekers awaiting U.S. immigration court hearings in these towns are increasingly becoming targets for kidnapping by cartels, which seek ransoms from migrants\u2019 American relatives. More and more, migrants are returning to the danger and poverty they fled.\n\nDoes every person requesting asylum deserve protection? No.\n\nBut the courts, not the cartels, should determine whether or not someone lives in the U.S.\n\nAsylum seekers do not pose a threat to us: people who request asylum go through a comprehensive process that includes background checks and screenings.\n\nThe thousand-cuts campaign against asylum seekers also contributes to the administration\u2019s message to talented foreign-born students, innovators and entrepreneurs, as well as hardworking laborers and many others, that America isn\u2019t open to newcomers. That we no longer wish to give people a chance to lend their talents, passion and creativity to enrich our communities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere is a better way forward, both morally and from a policy perspective. Instead of punishing people from Northern Triangle countries, we could partner with their governments to prevent human smuggling operations and provide critically needed aid and investment to spur economic growth and create new jobs \u2014 so people find opportunity in the place they call home.\n\nThis isn\u2019t wishful thinking, it\u2019s based on what has worked in the past. Migration to the U.S. from Mexico dropped a whopping 90 percent over the last two decades, as the U.S. worked with Mexico to ensure stronger economic growth, more visas for temporary work, and better border enforcement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast week\u2019s developments and reports weren\u2019t the first evidence that the Trump administration is closing the doors on those most in need, just the latest.\n\nDoing so not only harms vulnerable men, women and children. It ultimately weakens the idea of America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ALI NOORANI", "description": "While the economic impact of Trump\u2019s changes to immigration policy are remarkable, the moral collapse of our role in the world is most striking.", "authors": ["Ali Noorani", "Ali Noorani Is The Executive Director Of The National Immigration Forum", "Author Of", "There Goes The Neighborhood", "Host Of The Podcast", "Only In America.", "He Can Be Found On Twitter At"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/06/694940094001_6083982490001_6083977380001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
