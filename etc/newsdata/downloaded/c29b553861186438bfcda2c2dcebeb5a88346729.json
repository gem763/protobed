(AP) - Jonathan Taylor rushed for two touchdowns, Wisconsin\u2019s defense posted its fourth shutout of the season and the No. 8 Badgers cruised to a 38-0 win over Michigan State on Saturday.\n\nThe Spartans\u2019 defense held Taylor to 80 yards on 26 carries, marking the first time this season the Heisman Trophy hopeful was held under 100.\n\nBut Michigan State was held to 149 yards, 30 rushing, and couldn\u2019t find any rhythm as the Badgers dominated time of possession 39:10 to 20:50.\n\nJack Coan completed his first seven passes for Wisconsin (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) and finished 18 of 21 for 180 yards and a touchdown to win his eighth straight start since last season.\n\nThe Spartans (4-3, 2-2) lost back-to-back games against AP top-10 Big Ten opponents. Michigan State lost at then-No. 4 Ohio State 34-10 last week.\n\nBrian Lewerke was 7 of 16 for 53 yards and an interception and sacked twice before getting pulled in the fourth quarter for backup Rocky Lombardi. Lombardi went 5 for 14 for 66 yards and was picked off by Rachad Wildgoose in the end zone late in the fourth quarter to preserve the shutout for Wisconsin\u2019s top-ranked defense.\n\nThe Badgers last had four shutouts in 1930, when they had five.\n\nWisconsin did not score a touchdown on its opening drive for the first time this season. Taylor had scored touchdowns on the Badgers\u2019 opening possession in five straight games.\n\nTaylor scored from a yard out, Coan threw a 19-yard touchdown to Quintez Cephus and Collin Larsh kicked a 29-yard field goal to put the Badgers ahead 17-0 at the half.\n\nMichigan State had the ball for less than 7 minutes in the first half and managed just one first down and 38 total yards the first two quarters.\n\nThe Spartans got a little momentum when Tyriq Thompson ran for 20 yards and a first down on a fake punt on Michigan State\u2019s first drive of the second half. But back-to-back sacks by Chris Orr and Isaiahh Loudermilk forced yet another Spartans punt.\n\nTaylor opened the fourth with his second touchdown, a 1-yarder than made it 24-0.\n\nZack Baun picked off Lewerke and returned it 34 yards for a fourth-quarter touchdown. The score marked the fourth by the Badgers\u2019 defense this season. The unit has only allowed four touchdowns all year.\n\nKendric Pryor scored the final touchdown on a 66-yard run.\n\nMichigan State\u2019s Darrell Stewart Jr., the Big Ten\u2019s leading receiver, had five catches for 59 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans were completely overmatched offensively, defensively and on special teams. Coach Mark Dantonio\u2019s group has to hit the reset button during its bye week after getting outscored 72-10 against two of the top teams in the Big Ten.\n\nWisconsin: The Badgers padded its resume with another dominant performance. With the win, Wisconsin is bowl eligible for the 18th consecutive season. The Badgers run of 17 straight bowl games is the longest streak in the Big Ten and is tied with Boise State for fifth nationally.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWisconsin should move up. Its defense backed up its No. 1 national ranking. After a game at Illinois, the Badgers go to Columbus for a showdown with Ohio State in a likely meeting of unbeatens.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan State hosts No. 10 Penn State on Oct. 26.\n\nWisconsin plays at Illinois on Oct. 19.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonathan Taylor rushed for two touchdowns, Wisconsin's defense posted its fourth shutout of the season and the No. 8 Badgers cruised to a 38-0 win over Michigan State on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/michigan_st_wisconsin_football_64976_c0-143-3430-2143_s1200x700.jpg?4e88558fbd9ebadee0101967d0aa0b0ec999de73", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
