European diplomats said a draft text had been completed and was in the U.K. government's hands to decide whether to sign off on. If approved by EU leaders, any agreement would still need to be ratified in the U.K. and European parliaments.\n\nElsewhere, markets wavered. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and the Shanghai Composite benchmark were almost flat.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index swung between gains and losses before edging up 0.2%, with telecommunications companies leading the gains.\n\nShares in Ericsson rallied 6.7% after the Swedish telecom-equipment maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its sales target. Elisa Oyj, the Finnish telecommunications group, rallied 5.8% after the company boosted its earnings guidance.\n\nWH Smith gained 4.7% after the U.K. retailer agreed to buy Marshall Retail Group for $400 million.\n\nLater in the day, investors will be watching for further signals on the strength in the world's largest economy as the Federal Reserve releases industrial production figures for September. Economists forecast overall industrial output declined in September, after rising 0.5% in August.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 05:31 ET (09:31 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
