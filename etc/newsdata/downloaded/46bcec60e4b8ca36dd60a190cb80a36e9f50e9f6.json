NOW! host Laura Whitmore, who the Beeb say will speak to \u2018big-name guests from the worlds of politics, music and showbiz\u2019.\n\nSportsweek on BBC Radio 5 Live will be replaced by a show hosted by Laura Whitmore\n\nAn early peace in the War of the Roses is declared by The Hundred\n\nYou would imagine that two of the biggest rivals in The Hundred will be the franchises based in Manchester and Leeds. Interesting then, that both will be promoted by the same \u2018fan engagement manager\u2019.\n\nSports Agenda can disclose that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who have hardly covered themselves in glory when it comes to the new competition, have employed four marketing types to look after eight clubs and have lumped Manchester Originals and Northern Superchargers together.\n\nPresumably, the new staffer in question will be permitted to blast both of their sides, while also declaring them the best in the competition. The ECB say the four, taken on in July, are \u2018agnostic\u2019 and add \u2018therefore we don\u2019t believe there is any conflict\u2019.\n\nPerhaps the doubling up explains Gary Kirsten\u2019s embarrassing blunder this weekend when the Welsh Fire coach tweeted: \u2018Can\u2019t wait for The Hundred Draft and to pick the [insert team name] squad on Sunday at 7pm. #TheHundredDraft\u2019\n\nKate Cross and Saqib Mahmood of Manchester Originals will play for Manchester Originals\n\nMark Alford shock candidate to become head of Sky Sports News\n\nMark Alford is the surprise choice to replace Andy Cairns as head of Sky Sports News.\n\nThe 39-year-old, formerly of this parish, saw off internal competition from interim boss Steve Scott and chief reporter Bryan Swanson in a five-month recruitment process.\n\nSky insiders say that Alford\u2019s digital skills and impressive plan for the future are what got him over the line.\n\nThe new man, highly regarded despite his affection for Leeds United, will face a long list of tasks which may include getting to grips with his presenters\u2019 off-message social media posts.\n\nTransfer presenter Anton Toloui has criticised boxer Tyson Fury, while Michael Bridge likened a flag of the Pope to comedian Russ Abbot. Both tweets were subsequently deleted.\n\nAlford, whose job title will be director of Sky Sports News, moves from head of digital at Sky News and is unlikely to start until January.\n\nLiverpool still playing catch-up to Manchester United off the field\n\nWhile it is clear that Liverpool are some distance ahead of longstanding rivals Manchester United in the Premier League table, it would appear to be a different matter for the clubs off the field.\n\nThe European champions are in the High Court amid a kit supply row with Nike and New Balance.\n\nCentral to the argument \u2014 and Liverpool\u2019s preference to ditch their current partners \u2014 is the claim by Nike that they can put LFC-branded gear in 6,000 outlets around the world, which Liverpool say New Balance cannot match.\n\nIndustry insiders say that figure falls well short of the 20,000 stores across the globe in which punters can buy United merchandise made by the club\u2019s kit partner adidas.\n\nAs reported by Sportsmail, United are seeking a new shirt sponsor to replace American car maker Chevrolet and believe such global power will stand them in good stead, despite the team\u2019s under-performance in recent seasons.\n\nLiverpool are still some way behind Manchester United in terms of their popularity off the field\n\nUEFA officials surprised at criticism over punishments for racism\n\nOfficials at UEFA, whilst acknowledging the severity of the racist abuse suffered by England\u2019s players in Bulgaria, were surprised at the level of criticism and allegations of leniency from certain quarters here.\n\nThey wonder if partial and full stadium closures penalties, which can cost international federations millions, are a punishment the Premier League or Football Association would ever consider on these shores.\n\nNFL games in London includes specialist dogs being flown over\n\nThe incredible logistical operation that surrounds bringing NFL games to London includes the Americans flying over around 40 specialist dogs for each series of matches to ensure they pass off without incident.\n\nThe canines are specially trained in spotting signs of suspicious behaviour and insiders say they are at a standard not readily available in the UK.\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic, the dogs play a key role in the security operation and their presence may be something Premier League clubs consider in the future.\n\nAustralian rugby bosses livid at reporting on team news\n\nIt would appear Australian rugby bosses have taken a leaf out of former England football regimes.\n\nSources in Japan say that officials accused journalists of being \u2018un-Australian\u2019 for reporting on team news ahead of their World Cup quarter-final thrashing by England.\n\nApparently, the consequences of the Wallabies\u2019 ludicrous policy to run the ball regardless of field position played no part in the crushing defeat.\n\nDeparting coach Michael Cheika could not hide his disappointment following the pasting, telling Australian television: \u2018I\u2019m f****** so disappointed\u2019 in an interview sadly not seen on these shores.\n\nDeparting Australia coach Michael Cheika was left livid following the loss to England\n\nSarah Lewis OBE attends 'Play the Game' conference\n\nIt was interesting to hear that Sarah Lewis OBE, International Ski Federation (FIS) general secretary, was a visible presence at the recent \u2018Play the Game\u2019 conference in Colorado Springs.\n\nSome have taken the Englishwoman\u2019s visit as a sign that she has now embarked upon a mission to raise her profile ahead of a potential presidential campaign should Gian-Franco Kasper step down from the role.\n\nIf that is the case, Lewis is likely to need backing from GB Snowsport, which sources have disclosed is \u2018far from a sure thing\u2019.\n\nViewing figures for NFL clash at Tottenham's stadium concerning\n\nViewing figures for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers versus Carolina Panthers match at Tottenham\u2019s stadium marked the lowest for an NFL match since 2013.\n\nThe fixture was broadcast on subscription channel NFL Network across the pond, which will have had an impact. Sources say the early kick-off \u2014 9.30am in America\u2019s East Coast \u2014 also played a part but insist the disappointing figures will not hinder future decisions on games being held in Britain.\n\nViewing figures for the game at Tottenham's stadium were the lowest for an NFL fixture since 2013\n\nContributor: Matt Hughes", "description": "SPORTS AGENDA BY MIKE KEEGAN: Those hoping Garry Richardson's Sportsweek would be replaced by another hard-hitting sports journalism show on BBC Radio 5 Live have been left frustrated.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/19/19962810-0-image-a-90_1571595762711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
