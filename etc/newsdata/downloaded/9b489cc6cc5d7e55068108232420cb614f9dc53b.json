Robberies were up to a 12-year high, while firearms, rape, vehicle theft and fraud also increased.\n\nPolice and crime experts blamed the fall in charges on shortages of detectives, the increasing complexity of investigations and forces screening out high-volume offences unlikely to be solved at an earlier stage.\n\nLord Stevens, former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said: \u201cIt\u2019s because of the decimation of the detective force needed to investigate some of these offences, as well as the lack of neighbourhood policing.\n\n\u201cThe other issue is the judicial system and ability to prosecute. It\u2019s taking time to take these cases through court, and cover the discovery of documents. The whole criminal justice system has slowed down and is in trouble.\u201d", "description": "Police are solving half as many crimes as four years ago with under one in 13 offences leading to a prosecution, official figures reveal.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Ashley Kirk", "Home Affairs Editor", "Allister Heath", "Fraser Nelson", "Jacob Rees-Mogg", "Madeline Grant", "Iain Duncan Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/18/TELEMMGLPICT000194414441-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
