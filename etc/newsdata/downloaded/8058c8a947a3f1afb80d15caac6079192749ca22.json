As for their female classmates, it turns out Mias are made for mischief and Ellas are known troublemakers.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, if you have a little boy called Arthur or Noah or a sweet little Leo, you can rest easy: it turns out your kids are absolute angels. As for girls, teachers and parents agreed that Islas were delightful and Avas adorable. Emily could go either way - a little bit sweet, a little bit salty - so if you\u2019re hedging your bets, maybe that\u2019s the name for your little girl.\n\nRELATED: Bogan baby names: Top picks of 2019\n\nThe survey also found that many girls named Grace are shy in class while Charlie\u2019s and Olivia\u2019s need no encouragement to speak their mind, with the popular names often belonging to confident kids.\n\nARE YOU RAISING A LITTLE ANGEL OR A DEVIL IN DISGUISE?\n\nHere\u2019s the full list.\n\nNAUGHTIEST BOYS\n\n1.
