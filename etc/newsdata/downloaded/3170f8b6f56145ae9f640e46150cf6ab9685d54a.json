But in 2014 two landmark Supreme Court rulings declared that carriers should pay out when a delay was caused by a technical fault.\n\nWe explain below when you're entitled to compensation, how to claim it, what to do if your claim is rejected and we have included template letters for you to use.\n\nWhile these are the current rules under EU law, your rights will remain the same after Brexit according to the Government, whether we exit with, or without, a deal.\n\nWhat exactly are my rights?\n\nAirlines must compensate passengers if their flight is cancelled or heavily delayed.\n\nThey must also offer you meals, refreshments and hotel accommodation as appropriate whilst you wait for a rearranged flight.\n\nThere are no time or monetary limits on the provision of this assistance but if your airline does not provide assistance, then keep your spending to a minimum, and make sure you get receipts and claim reimbursement from your airline when you get home.\n\n\u203a\u203a Download Regulation (EC) 261/2004\n\nWHAT IF EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES DO OCCUR? Airlines have a duty of care to look after stranded passengers, even if cancellations are due to extraordinary circumstances out of their control. If you have been left stuck and out of pocket by your airline, then you will need to keep a record of what you have spent, including receipts and try to reclaim from airline using the EU rule.\n\nHow does compensation work for delayed flights?\n\nUnder the rules, airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights, but how much you\u2019re entitled to depends on the flight you booked and the amount of time you\u2019ve been delayed by.\n\nAt present, the flight must have departed from an EU airport, operating by any airline, or it must be arriving into an EU airport and be operated by an EU airline. The 'EU airport' also includes the following countries; Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nIt also needs to have been at least three hours late arriving at your destination to be eligible for compensation.\n\nThe amounts available start from \u20ac250 (\u00a3223) for flights of less than 1,500km long which are delayed by at least three hours and go up to \u20ac600 (\u00a3536) for flights of more than 3,500km between an EU and non-EU airport, delayed by at least four hours.\n\nHOW MUCH YOU'RE ENTITLED TO IF YOUR FLIGHT IS DELAYED Delay to your arrival Flight distance Amount of compensation At least three hours Less than 1,500km \u20ac250\n\nBetween 1,500km and 3,500km \u20ac400 More than 1,500km and within the EU \u20ac400 Three to four hours More than 3,500km, between an EU and non-EU airport \u20ac300 At least four hours More than 3,500km, between an EU and non-EU airport \u20ac600\n\nHow to claim compensation for a delay\n\nPassengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names of passengers and the reason for the delay (we have included template letters at the end of this guide).\n\nIf you can\u2019t remember how long the delay was, the website Flightstats.com is free to use and will show you how long a flight has been delayed for, although it won\u2019t state what the delay was for.\n\nIf the claim is rejected, but you believe it's valid you can escalate it to the ombudsman or the relevant regulator (this will depend on the airline). If you still don\u2019t get the answer you believe is right it is possible to take the airline to the small claims court.\n\nHow to claim compensation for a cancelled flight\n\nIf a flight is cancelled you should be offered an alternative flight with the same airline to your destination either on the day or the day after, if there is room, or a full refund for the flight you booked.\n\nBut if neither of these are possible you should be given the option of a flight with a different airline to your destination, if there\u2019s space. If you end up paying for this separately you should be able to claim any extra money paid back \u2013 if you can prove no other suitable option was given by the original airline.\n\nIf you were given more than 14 days\u2019 notice about the cancellation, you will only be entitled to a new flight or a refund for your original flight. But if you were given 14 or less days\u2019 notice, you might be able to claim compensation on top of a refund or alternative flight.\n\nThe amount of compensation of offer differs depending on when you were told about the cancellation, the length of the flight, and how long you had to wait for a new flight.\n\nThe cancellation also needs to have been something which could have been avoided by the airline so you won't be able to claim for reasons such as a crew strike or extreme weather conditions.\n\nTo apply for compensation, which can be from \u20ac125 to \u20ac600, contact the airline directly and outline what has happened and why you are entitled to it. There are free template letters for you to use at the end of this article.\n\nRules: You should be able to claim compensation for flight delays dating back six years.\n\nCan my airline turn down my claim?\n\nAirlines don't have to accept every claim and they can turn them down if 'extraordinary circumstances' apply. However if this is the case, the airline still has a duty of care to passengers.\n\nThe rules state that airlines must provide passengers with accommodation, meals and refreshments and transport between the airport and accommodation. Airlines are breaking the rules if they shirk this obligation.\n\nIf your airline turns down your claim under extraordinary circumstances you can challenge this if you do not believe it to be true. Write back to them explaining why this is not the case and explain that you will take the matter up with the Civil Aviation Authority if it is not settled properly.\n\nThe problem is that many airlines are still trying to wriggle out of such claims and a classic example of this is airlines claiming technical faults as extraordinary circumstances. This is because the regulation gives no definition of exactly what extraordinary circumstances are, but does give some examples.\n\nIt says: 'As under the Montreal Convention, obligations on operating air carriers should be limited or excluded in cases where an event has been caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.\n\n'Such circumstances may, in particular, occur in cases of political instability, meteorological conditions incompatible with the operation of the flight concerned, security risks, unexpected flight safety shortcomings and strikes that affect the operation of an operating air carrier.'\n\nThe crucial part of this is that it says 'which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken'.\n\nThis means that you can challenge the technical fault defence on the basis that an airline should have reasonable expectation that things can go wrong on an aircraft and should have contingency plans in place, such as having replacement parts or access to them where it operates.\n\nIf your flight is delayed by more than three hours you should be able to claim from your airline\n\nIf your airline tries to claim extraordinary circumstances, challenge them to explain exactly what they were and why they could not have been reasonably avoided. The onus is on them to prove this.\n\nHow far back can I claim?\n\nRegulation (EC) 261 does not set a time limit on how far back claims can go, instead stating that this should be determined by the laws in respective EU countries.\n\nIn the UK, the statute of limitations law is six years, so by this logic an airline should consider claims for delays dating back six years from the time the claim is submitted.\n\nSome airlines have used legal loopholes to avoid paying out here too. In 2014 we reported the case of a Monarch passenger who found the airline was delaying their claim while it waited for a court ruling.\n\nWhen that ruling arrived in the passengers' favour, the This is Money reader tried to claim only to be told that he was out of the six years.\n\nWhen he contested this on the basis it was Monarch that delayed things not him, he was told that despite having been in touch regularly over the years, as he had not made a court claim within the past six years he was outside the allotted time period.\n\nMonarch said: 'If a customer presents their claim to an airline within six years but does not issue court proceedings and the six years have now expired, they are unfortunately unable to claim.\n\nYou will not be able to claim compensation if you are delayed because of bad weather\n\n'It is our customers' responsibility to seek legal advice from either the Citizen's Advice Bureau, Civil Aviation Authority, or otherwise in order to find out if they need to take any action to stop time running out under the Limitation Act.'\n\nWhat will happen when I ask for compensation?\n\nIf you are not given the assistance that you are due, you will need to make a claim against the airline. You will need receipts and proof of expenses and they must be reasonable.\n\nWhat about travel insurance? Most travel insurance policies should cover passengers for extra expenses incurred if they are stuck. Depending on the policy, this could cover the knock-on effects of not being able to fly. Cancelled hotels, trips and other expenses already paid out could be reclaimed under your travel insurance. It is important to check your policy carefully to see what is covered, any exclusions and the relevant excesses. Once again keep any extra spending to reasonable level, hold onto receipts and if in doubt, call your insurer before paying for anything. Travel insurance does not override airlines duty of care, but you cannot claim for the same thing twice.\n\nIt is always unclear what airlines will do when faced with claims. Some may try and refuse to pay and stave off claims.\n\nIf this happens passengers need to use the courts to force payment.\n\nThe best way to do this is through the small claims track of the county court.\n\n\u203a\u203a How to use the small claims court\n\nWhat can't I claim?\n\nYour expenses should be reasonable such as a hotel similar to the standard of the one you were staying in or a simple meal.\n\nLiving it large and then trying to charge it to the airline is unlikely to work.\n\nYou are also unlikely to find airlines paying for the expense of you abandoning your flight and navigating your way home yourself.\n\nAlthough, if you have taken the simplest and best-value route you may be covered and if you had been advised to get yourself home and that you would be reimbursed by the airline, then you should state this and claim.\n\nThis is Money has heard a lot of reports of airlines trying to fob off passengers, deny they are issuing reimbursements or claim that this is not the law. That is untrue and while you may need to be persistent, you should get your money.\n\nIf your airline does claim extraordinary circumstances, they need not pay the compensation amounts above but still have a duty of care to look after you and get you where you are meant to be going.\n\nYou should tell them that under Regulation (EC) 261/2004 Article 5 you are entitled to be reimbursed or re-routed under Article 8 and also offered assistance, including accommodation, meals and transport under Article 9.\n\nReclaim: The sample letter below can be copied and pasted to help you with your claim.\n\nYou should also state that under Article 5, airlines are able to not pay compensation in accordance with article 7 in the case of 'extraordinary circumstances', but crucially that this extraordinary circumstances clause does not apply to the entitlement to assistance under Article 9.\n\nThe sample reclaim letters\n\nWe have provided a sample paragraph and letter for you to use. Either copy and paste the paragraph into your letter, or use the letter template and add your personal details into it.\n\nCopy and paste the text, as needed, adding in your details.

I enclose receipts.\n\nThe EU rules that state that I should have been assisted by yourselves are in Regulation (EC) 261/2004. In this Article 5 states that in the case of cancellation or delay of more than one day I am entitled to be reimbursed or re-routed under Article 8 and also offered assistance, including accommodation, meals and transport under Article 9.\n\nArticle 9 states:\n\n1. Where reference is made to this Article, passengers shall be offered free of charge:\n\n(a) meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time;\n\n(b) hotel accommodation in cases\n\n\u2014 where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary,\n\nor \u2014 where a stay additional to that intended by the passenger becomes necessary; (c) transport between the airport and place of accommodation (hotel or other).\n\n2. In addition, passengers shall be offered free of charge two telephone calls, telex or fax messages, or e-mails.\n\n3. In applying this Article, the operating air carrier shall pay particular attention to the needs of persons with reduced mobility and any persons accompanying them, as well as to the needs of unaccompanied children.\n\nUnder Article 5 part 3, airlines are able to avoid paying compensation in accordance with Article 7 in the case of 'extraordinary circumstances', but this extraordinary circumstances clause does not apply to the entitlement to assistance under Article 9.\n\nA 2014 ruling ratified by the Supreme Court, in the case of Huzar vs Jet2, says that European airlines can no longer claim technical faults as extraordinary circumstances, so must pay out compensation for flight delays of longer than three hours such cases.\n\nI thank you for your assistance with this and await your response,", "description": "Passengers who are on a flight which is heavily delayed or cancelled have the right to compensation under European law.
