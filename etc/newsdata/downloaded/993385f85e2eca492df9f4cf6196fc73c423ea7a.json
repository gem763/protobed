And White House aides said Trump would once again hammer away on a theme of sovereignty when he addresses the General Assembly on Tuesday.\n\nBut as he breezed into the U.N. complex Monday and up to the cameras, there was an ominous sign for the president. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist, was seen glowering in the background of the camera frame. She wouldn't stay there for long.\n\nThunberg drew worldwide headlines for her remarks at a Climate Action Summit that some read as a sign that other leaders were getting on with the work of hashing out the world's problems, with or without Trump.\n\nCLOSE Environmental activist Greta Thunberg called out world leaders for coming \"to us young people for hope.\" USA TODAY\n\nTrump has been pushing the U.S. to the sidelines of the U.N., questioning the institution's value while reinforcing Washington's supremacy in the world, experts say. But that has left other leaders with an opportunity to pick up the ball themselves, said Stewart Patrick, an expert on global governance at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\"They've heard his talking points,\" Patrick said.\n\n\"But it turns out that the people on the field would like to continue playing the game.\"\n\nTrump first arrived at the U.N. in 2017, threatening to upend relations with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Last year he urged the world to step up pressure on Iran and join him in abandoning the nuclear agreement signed with Tehran in 2015. He has also lamented what he describes as unfair trade agreements with allies and foes.\n\nAll of those problems still remain today.\n\nTrump will address the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday in what will be one of the summit's most closely watched speeches. Last year Trump faced an awkward moment when the hall erupted into laughter \u2013 and later applause \u2013 when he trotted out a campaign-trail line about his accomplishments.\n\nThe president said Monday that Iran will be a major focus of his address.\n\nTrump is also set to meet with several world leaders , including new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the president of Iraq, Barham Salih.\n\nClimate stage\n\nThunberg was solemn and grim-faced as she delivered harsh words to the U.N. Climate Action Summit. She spoke moments after U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres delivered an impassioned plea to the world to rein in carbon emissions.\n\nThunberg: 'The eyes of future generations are on you,' activist tells UN Climate Summit\n\n\"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here, I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" the Swedish teen said.\n\nAfter signaling for weeks that he would skip it, Trump unexpectedly showed up at the climate summit. The president didn't speak and stayed for about 14 minutes, sitting next to Vice President Mike Pence as other world leaders talked from the podium. Trump then left to host an event on religious freedom, which appeared to be aimed as much at his supporters in battleground presidential states as a global audience.\n\nTrump and White House aides billed the event as the first time an American president convened such a meeting at the U.N. Critics scoffed because of Trump\u2019s immigration travel restrictions against predominantly Muslim countries and other policies.\n\n\u201cThe United States is founded on the principle that our rights do not come from government,\u201d Trump said in remarks that lasted 12 minutes. \u201cThey come from God.\u201d\n\nThe climate summit wasn't the only U.N.-organized event that put Trump in an awkward spot. A summit on universal health care came despite the Trump administration's years long effort to repeal Obamacare. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar joined with other countries at that event to argue abortions are not a universal right.\n\nEuropean leaders, meanwhile, will gather Thursday for a summit focused on multilateralism \u2013 or the idea of countries working together to solve global problems. Trump has derided the idea of multilateralism in favor of one-on-one negotiations.\n\nepa07864519 US President Donald J.

Edwards, associate professor and chairman of Seton Hall University\u2019s School of Diplomacy and International Relations, said the U.N. and its member countries are not letting Trump steal the show \u2013 at least not entirely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the UN has normalized this president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Secretary General Guterres and other members are aggressively moving ahead on their agenda whether the U.S. wants to participate or not,\" Edwards said.\n\nTrump's supporters argue the president's moves are disorienting for some world leaders because his approach is so different from the one they would take. Of course, that was part of the reason the president got elected in the first place, they said.\n\n\u201cYou have a president now who has completely personalized foreign policy,\u201d Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and one-time Trump adviser, said at a forum on leadership taking place alongside the U.N. meeting in New York.\n\n\"He believes that if he gets into any room with any person in the world, that he can convince them of his point of view, regardless of what the history is, regardless of what the current circumstances are, regardless of what he may have said in the past,\" Christie said. \"And this is I think very different than any foreign policy we\u2019ve had in the past.\u201d\n\nBut Edwards argued that Trump's unusual approach, and the sense that some have that it amounts to U.S. disengagement, may come at a price. He noted that China has ramped up its U.N. diplomacy as American influence in New York recedes.\n\n\u201cIt leaves the playing field open for other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise, Janet Wilson, Maureen Groppe\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/24/donald-trump-united-nations-did-greta-thunberg-upstage-trump/2373240001/", "description": "Is Donald Trump pushing the U.S. to the sidelines of the U.N.?
