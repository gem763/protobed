It is the fourth wettest tropical cyclone to hit the state of Texas.\n\nThe severity of the flash floods are reminiscent of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which was the last time a named storm hit the Houston area. Some homes that weren't flooded by Harvey's rains are being impacted by Imelda, a Jefferson County judge told the Associated Press.\n\nHundreds of people are being rescued\n\nBeaumont Police told CNN that they are responding to hundreds of calls for rescues, as people are left either stranded in their homes or on top of cars. Police are asking people not to drive at all as most streets are flooded.\n\nOne man was electrocuted and drowned while trying to move his horse during the storm, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office wrote in a statement on Facebook. It is the first reported death connected to the storm.\n\nRead more: A tropical storm is striking Texas with flash floods 'worse than Harvey' rising up to 35 inches\n\nPhotos and videos of the flooding in Houston are inundating social media, showing submerged cars and people with water up to their waists.
