Farmers have complained about attacks on their sheep.\n\nNaya, who was born in east Germany, had been joined by a male wolf, named August, who became her companion and brought food to their den.\n\nBut neither Naya nor her cubs have been seen since May, when a night-vision camera operated by ANB near the Dutch border captured images of them.\n\nThe batteries in her electronic collar later stopped working.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
