Britain was due to make new proposals in an attempt to break the Brexit deadlock, RTE said.\n\nThere was no comment from Johnson\u2019s office and the British mission to the EU declined to comment.\n\nA British government source said separately that new texts have been shared repeatedly with Brussels during talks.\n\nThe main obstacle is around customs, with London proposing that Northern Ireland stays in the UK customs area but that EU tariffs are applied on all goods crossing from mainland Britain to the island.\n\nBusinesses would be eligible for a refund if it turns out their goods stay in Northern Ireland under the plan, which the EU has many doubts about, saying the system is too complicated, untested and not detailed enough at this stage.\n\nThe EU believes the only possible deal to be had at the summit is a return to a solution - already rejected by Britain previously - of keeping Northern Ireland in the bloc\u2019s customs union.\n\nIt would require a major shift from London and Johnson will face his factious parliament at a rare Saturday session after the summit.\n\nDeal or no deal, the EU believes another delay to Britain\u2019s Oct. 31 departure date will be needed. Extension options range from as short as an extra month to half a year or longer. The other EU states would need to agree unanimously to grant it.\n\n\u201cTime alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it,\u201d France\u2019s Amelie de Montchalin said.\n\nEU's Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier talks to the media as he arrives to take part in General Affairs council addressing the state of play of Brexit, in Luxembourg October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\n\u201cA significant political change is the prospect of an election, a referendum, something that changes the political dynamic so that the triangle between the government, parliament and the British people could align with each other a bit more.\u201d\n\nShould no final resolutions come at the summit later this week, the EU is mulling an extraordinary one in late October to approve any deal or a delay, or give marching orders for a damaging no-deal split.", "description": "Britain's latest proposals on the terms of its departure from the European Union are still not enough for an agreement and a legal text is needed by the end of Tuesday for a deal to be agreed at a leaders' summit this week, three diplomatic sources said.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441053044&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0A3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
