That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s statement, which followed reports that the White House was shocked by his comments at the news conference, contradicts that.\n\n\u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d\n\nBut in his earlier remarks, Mulvaney said Trump told him he was concerned about corruption related to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server, the key element of a debunked conspiracy theory that Trump and others close to him have pushed. The baseless claim is that the DNC server has gone missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia\u2019s hack of the DNC\u2019s servers, is now framing Russia for election interference.\n\nIn reality, the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cserver\u201d is actually a system of 140 individual servers, none of which are missing.\n\nThis article has been updated with details on the news conference and the server conspiracy theory.", "description": "\"Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\" the White House chie...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8e5eb210000a615ad3228.jpeg?cache=osyoyxai4c&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
