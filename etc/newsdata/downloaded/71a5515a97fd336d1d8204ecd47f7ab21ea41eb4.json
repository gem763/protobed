Pictured, leaves with La Roya, or coffee rust\n\nThe disease, which has been exacerbated by climate change, covers the leaves with orange dust and causes them to fall off, stopping the plant from turning sunlight into the chemical energy that it needs to grow.\n\nFarmers in the region have replaced many of their crops with the so-called catimor variety, which is resistant to the rust.\n\nHowever, these are vulnerable to the brown eye fungus, which has also become more common as a result of rising temperatures.\n\nOver the last five years, coffee production in the area has shrunk from 80 to 20 per cent, with many farmers choosing to turn their hand instead to growing sugar cane, which is more-resilient.\n\nThe family of Segundo Alejandro Guerrero Mondragon, part of the Norandino co-operative, has been experimenting with new coffee varieties.\n\nThis summer has been unusually cold, meaning that the coffee has not been drying out properly, while an outbreak of coffee rust last year has led to lower yields this harvest.\n\nThe family has started planting higher up in the steep valley, as plants are no longer able to thrive at the altitudes once perfect for their growth, and have been replacing the lower coffee plants with sugar cane.\n\nYet there is only so much hillside left, however, before the land runs out.\n\nSegundo Alejandro Guerrero Mondragon, his wife Laura Alberca de Guerrero and sons Omar Guerrero Alberca and Hugo Javier Guerrero\n\nThe 72-year-old was one of the founders of the organisation that became Norandino. His family has been farming coffee for more than 100 years.\n\n'Our area used to be free of all types of disease,' he told the PA.\n\n'There was no rust, there was no brown eye, there was no borer.'\n\nThe borer is a beetle that is an aggressive coffee pest.\n\n'Lately we were managing to partly control brown eye, but when we got rust it was a largely unknown disease and really concerned us, it hit us really hard and there was a huge drop in production.'\n\n'For me it was very disappointing, we had coffee plantations with a really good crop and we were left with next to nothing, it was almost completely destroyed.'\n\nThe family have invested in machinery and a concrete platform which helps the beans dry to a better quality\n\n'I was a little bit lucky because of my children who helped to manage the crop and for the greater part managed to control the fungus. Others were left with nothing.'\n\nHis agronomist sons Hugo, 33, and Omar, 35, are helping him experiment with new varieties of coffee in a protected nursery.\n\nThey are aiming to produce a more resilient bean without compromising on quality.\n\nOrganic fertilisers and irrigation have meant the plants are healthier than their poorer neighbours\u2019, but with little to no boundaries between plantations, disease is just a boot print away from being spread.\n\nThe family has been able to invest in production facilities to speed up their coffee farming due to being members of the co-operative.\n\nSefelmira Alberca Pangalima rakes coffee beans laid out to dry in the sun\n\nPoorer farmers who are not members can use their machinery, while the family is providing seasonal employment for students and women and sharing their technical knowledge.\n\nOne of those they have been helping is Sefelmira Alberca Pangalima, a single mother who cannot support her daughters with her dwindling, disease-ridden coffee crop.\n\nThe 50-year-old inherited a quarter of a hectare of land after her father\u2019s recent death, but has found it difficult to become a member of a co-operative as she does not hold the legal rights to her share of the farm.\n\nShe is hoping to obtain the correct documents and join Norandino.\n\nIn the meantime, she has been securing extra income by helping the family harvest, as well as by cooking meals and sewing.\n\nHugo Javier Guerrero smells freshly-roasted beans at the family farm in Piura\n\n'Sometimes we plant coffee but a disease that comes in on the wind or something, I don\u2019t know, they dry out,' she told the PA.\n\n'We plant them, and they start well and then they wither.'\n\n'But in the future, I hope to produce enough coffee and then perhaps join an organisation and sell at a better price.'\n\nThose worst hit are adamant they want their children to be spared their struggles, and it is an increasing challenge to encourage the younger generation to stick with the industry.\n\n'TIME IS RUNNING OUT': DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S WARNING TO HUMANITY Sir David urged action against global warming and called it a man-made disaster that poses 'our greatest threat in thousands of years' Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. 'We the peoples of the United Nations'. These are the opening words of the UN Charter. A charter that puts people at the centre. A pledge to give every person in the world a voice on its future. A promise to help protect the weakest and the strongest from war, famine and other man-made disasters. Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate Change. If we don't take action the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon. The United Nations provides a unique platform that can unite the whole world. And as the Paris agreement proved, together we can make real change happen. At this crucial moment, the United Nations has invited the world's people to have their voice heard, by giving them a seat. The People's Seat; giving everyone the opportunity to join us here today, virtually, and speak directly to you the decision makers. In the last two weeks, the world's people have taken part in building this address, answering polls, sending video messages and voicing their opinions. I am only here to represent the 'Voice of the People': to deliver our collective thoughts, concerns, ideas and suggestions. This is our 'We the peoples' message. The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision makers, to act now. They are behind you, along with civil society represented here today. Supporting you in making tough decisions but also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives. To help make change happen, the UN is launching the Act Now bot. Helping people to discover simple everyday actions that they can take, because they recognize that they too must play their part. The People have spoken. Leaders of the world, you must lead. The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands.\n\n'If Fairtrade did not exist [\u2026] we would not now be growing coffee,' said Omar.\n\n'Or perhaps only about one third of what we grow now, just enough to meet the demand of the small plant we have. It would not be profitable.'\n\n'Or maybe everything that is now coffee would instead be cane, because it is an easier crop to tend, and is more profitable than coffee.'\n\n'Without the coffee, professional people like me would not be here, we would be working in the city or elsewhere.'", "description": "Experts call for businesses to invest more to help coffee growers purchase new tools and plants to continue cultivating their crops in the face of changing climates, disease and pests.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/10/19146370-0-image-a-9_1569920505165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
