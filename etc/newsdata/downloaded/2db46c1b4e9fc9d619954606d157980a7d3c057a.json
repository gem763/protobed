The probe was sparked by a whistleblower who revealed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2014 potentially in exchange for military aid money. Trump, who has defended his conduct as \u201cperfect,\u201d publicly called on China last week to investigate the Bidens, too. Calls to investigate the Bidens have come without evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in either country.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, says the calls for investigations are perfectly kosher, telling Fox News that the \u201cpresident of the United States has every right to ask countries to help us in a criminal investigation that should be undertaken.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the administration is continuing to offer mixed signals as it struggles to respond to the barrage and as the president lashes out by tweet.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming next:\n\nMORE DEPOSITIONS\n\nStaff and lawmakers from the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee will continue to hear from witnesses throughout the week. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who has become a key figure in the probe, will be deposed on Tuesday. And Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from the post early, will be speaking Friday.\n\nIt is uncertain whether two additional figures \u2014 George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, and Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor \u2014 will be making requested appearances, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo objected to the timing.\n\n___\n\nMORE WHISTLEBLOWERS\n\nA lawyer representing the original intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry said Sunday that a second whistleblower has come forward and spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, further complicating the president\u2019s case.\n\nAttorney Mark Zaid said the second person has information that corroborates the original whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and has \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d of key events. That threatens to undermine arguments made by Trump and his allies that the original complaint was politically-motivated and unreliable because it was based on secondhand or third-hand information.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump and his allies from continuing to try to undermine the source of the probe, while criticizing the way House Democrats are handling the inquiry.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of Trump\u2019s most vocal backers, argued that there was nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s July conversation with Zelenskiy. In an interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d he said the accusation look like a \u201cpolitical setup.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMORE DEADLINES\n\nThe House committees have requested a slew of documents from the White House as well as top officials including Pompeo, Giuliani and Vice President Mike Pence. Pompeo blew a Friday deadline for complying with a subpoena, but said over the weekend that the State Department had sent a letter to Congress Friday night as its initial response to the request. He also indicated a new willingness to comply, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously do all the things that we\u2019re required to do by law.\u201d\n\nGiuliani and Pence have been given until Oct. 15 to turn over their documents, while the White House subpoena deadline is Oct. 18.\n\nDemocrats are moving swiftly and have said they hope to finish the investigation in a matter of weeks \u2014 perhaps even before Thanksgiving.\n\n___\n\nWHITE HOUSE RESPONSE\n\nTrump has offered a series of contradictory statements when it comes to whether or not his administration plans to comply with the House subpoena.\n\nAsked about the prospect Wednesday, Trump offered an inaccurate, though conciliatory response, telling reporters, \u201cI always cooperate.\u201d A day later, however, Trump had a different answer for the same question, saying he would instead leave the matter to his lawyers.\n\nBy Friday he had changed his tune again, confirming reports the White House was preparing a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., arguing that Congress cannot undertake an impeachment investigation without having a formal vote to authorize it. Pelosi has resisted taking that step, insisting the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the Constitution.\n\nIt remains unclear when or even if the White House letter will be sent \u2014 but Democrats do not appear to be budging, even as they insist they have the needed votes.\n\n\u201cIf Speaker Pelosi did in fact move forward with a floor vote on actually proceeding with an investigation \u2026 there\u2019s no question in my mind that she would have the votes,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWILL MORE REPUBLICANS SPEAK OUT?\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, became just the third Republican senator to publicly question Trump\u2019s conduct when she said over the weekend that \u201cit\u2019s not OK\u201d for a president to encourage a foreign state to investigate a political rival.\n\nThe others are Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mitt Romney of Utah. Romney\u2019s sharp criticism has sparked a furious response from Trump, who took the extraordinary step Saturday of calling for Romney\u2019s impeachment after labeling him \u201cpompous\u201d and \u201ca fool.\u201d The Constitution doesn\u2019t call for impeachment of a senator and Utah\u2019s laws don\u2019t have a provision for recalling one.\n\nIt appears unlikely many more Republicans will choose to choose to take a stand against the president, who remains deeply popular with Republican voters. That\u2019s something one of the Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, Joe Walsh of Illinois, called on fellow Republicans to do.\n\n\u201cThis president needs to be impeached, just based on what he himself has said,\u201d Walsh said on CNN. \u201cAnd Republicans better get behind that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSLOWER SENATE\n\nIf the House does vote to approve charges against Trump, it would then be up to the Republican-led Senate to decide whether to dismiss the charges or hold a trial. Some Senate Republicans have expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, but there are few signs there would be enough discontent to convict.\n\nIf Trump were impeached, it would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict him and remove him from office. That has never happened. Only two presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998; both won acquittal in the Senate.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned from office in 1974 while facing impeachment proceedings.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats are marching forward with their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, with more depositions coming this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/10f6d5_trump-impeachment-38397-donald-trump-gordon-sondland-in-tuesday-10-2018-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
