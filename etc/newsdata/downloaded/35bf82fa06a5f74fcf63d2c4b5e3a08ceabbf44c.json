However, the housing loan interest rate also counts in and eats your savings if proper planning has not been done while taking the loan.\n\nBelow we have a 3 point checklist coordination, development, and evaluation of, adhering to which will ensure a better home loan interest rate.\n\nBorrowing Capacity and Loan Tenure\n\nOne of the golden rules while taking a home loan is never take a loan that cannot be paid back comfortably. More the loan amount, the higher would be the rate of interest on the principal amount. It will definitely eat your spending and leave you in a financial mess.\n\nIn case the home loan EMI takes up a significant part of the income and you fail in meeting other financial obligations like saving for the retirement fund or the education of the children, it will definitely hit, and you would end up borrowing more money from different sources. Thus, have a realistic vision and plan your life according to the amount you earn every month and plan your loans accordingly.\n\nLoan tenure is also a binding factor when it comes to balancing the monthly EMI. Most of the banks offer schemes in which housing loans can be repaid over a term of 30 years. Though it seems that the EMI would be lower in case of longer loan duration, however, you would end up paying more money as interest on the home loan.\n\nIn cases when it becomes imperative to take a loan with a longer repayment duration due to financial crunch, it is always advisable that the EMI amount is increased with time. Therefore, the overall interest rate applicable comes down.\n\nTimely repayment and loan switching\n\nBeing disciplined in loan repayment is key to ensuring that the interest amount is in check. You should never miss the EMI repayment date else not only your credit score will take a hit, but the bank will also get a chance to increase the rate of interest applicable on the home loan. The bank will definitely charge a penalty when you pay the pending EMI. It will eat your earnings and will cause unnecessary hassle. Thus, always try to be honest while repaying the loan EMI.\n\nSwitching the bank can also be considered when it comes to reducing the interest applicable to the home loan. Sooner the decision of switching the home loan is taken, the better it will be to manage financial liabilities. Keep track of the options available in the market; when you get a better deal, do not hesitate to switch the bank. After all, your hard-earned money is at stake!\n\nRead between the lines and keep the family informed\n\nBanks usually charge upfront interest charges and annual insurance premium in home loans. However, such finer details are only mentioned in small font in the terms and conditions. Make sure to read those lines. Otherwise, you may uncover something in the future which was not in your best interest, but you have signed for it.\n\nKeep your family, and particularly only the spouse informed on the loan terms and conditions. The bank might flatter in case of a mishap with the lender, and the family will have to bear the brunt.\n\nKeep these points in mind while processing your home loan and make your dream of building the home, you always desired a sweet reality.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Tushar Sharma covering: .
