No major injuries so we are pretty good. We are getting used to the conditions - 27 degrees, 75 per cent humidity - the ball was like a cake of soap. We wanted to be on 10 points after two games so we are perfect. (On Piers Francis' tackle) We leave the calls up to the referee, we are quite happy to take part in the judicial process and we have no qualms one way or the other, we will trust the World rugby process. [Lewis Ludlam] is an incredible player who's only going to get better. He's one of the most impressive young forwards out there. We'll give the boys a bit of a break in a one-off game against Argentina. they are playing for their life and we are playing to beat Argentina so it's going to be a hell of a game.\n\nCredit: GETTY IMAGES\n\n1:53PM\n\nFull-time stats\n\nMost metres: Joe Cokanasiga (90); prop Ellis Genge was second with 60\n\nMost carries: Lewis Ludlan (14)\n\nMost clean breaks: Jonathan Joseph (4)\n\nMost defenders beaten: Anthony Watson (7)\n\nMost tackles: Tony Lamborn (16)\n\n1:45PM\n\nFull-time: England 45 USA 7\n\nUSA got their consolation score in the end, but it was an efficient performance from England, better than Sunday against Tonga, with man-of-the-match Ford at the helm.\n\n1:44PM\n\n80 min: CON MACGINTY England 45 USA 7\n\nFrom in front of the sticks, MacGinty has no problem.\n\nAnd that is that.\n\n1:43PM\n\n80 min: TRY CAMPBELL England 45 USA 5\n\nUSa are looking to end on a positive so run from deep.\n\nAnd Te'o bursts through, but he cannot control.\n\nThen England fumble on the counter, then USA fumble on the counter, but advantage was always over and we are continuing into over time.\n\nDe Haas breaks through!

Joseph dummies silkily through before offloading to Curry.\n\nEngland work through the phases with Curry and Sinckler carrying. Daly takes a delightful outside line, too, as England approach the 22.\n\nBut Berry pings USA for not rolling on the way on their own 22 and Ford will go to the corner.\n\n12:49PM\n\nEngland changes\n\nGenge, Sinckler and Wilson are on for Marler, Cole and Vunipola respectively.\n\nUSA unchanged.\n\n12:45PM\n\nOne of our men in Kobe is a fan of England's set-piece work\n\nExcellent start from England's pack, and Joe Marler in particular.

It starts on the 22 and gets up to the 10 before the USA infringe and Ford advances England into the USA's half.\n\nThis is a set-piece massacre from England currently.\n\n12:28PM\n\n34 min: MISSED CON FORD England 19 USA 0\n\nFord hits the post - it's the first time he's missed an international kick this year!\n\nIf USA cannot sort out their tight game - set-pieces and mauls - then this is going to be a very long afternoon. England's forwards were almost jogging as they approached the line in that maul.\n\n12:27PM\n\n32 min: TRY COWAN-DICKIE England 19 USA 0\n\nBrache spills the ball after the scrum and so England will now put in. Another huge shove from an Cole leads to Kilifi being penalised once again.\n\nFord drives England up to USA's 22 and they start another driving maul from the lineout.\n\nAnd it is too much for USA; they completely splinter and Cowan-Dickie is in control of the ball and scores.\n\n12:23PM\n\n30 min: England 14 USA 0\n\nKruis steals the lineout and Curry tidies up the loose ball. Heinz puts in a great box-kick, and McConnochie gets first to it, but he can't gather cleanly and USA will have the scrum on halfway.\n\n12:21PM\n\n28 min: England 14 USA 0\n\nAn outstanding clearance from Ford gives the USA the lineout on halfway following the restart.\n\nCokanasiga can't take the box kick and Quill laps up the ball as USA launch an attack on England's 22.\n\nMacGinty tries an attacking bomb cross-field to Iosefo, who leaps higher than McConnochie to take the ball, but the Bath wing tackles Iosefo into touch.\n\nEngland have the lineout and clear up to the 10-metre line.\n\n12:18PM\n\n25 min: CON FORD England 14 USA 0\n\nEasy for Ford and he makes no mistake.\n\n12:18PM\n\n25 min: TRY VUNIPOLA England 12 USA 0\n\nCowan-Dickie throws to Curry and it's the swiftest of lineout drives that leads to a Vunipola try.\n\nThat was ruthlessly ferocious from England. Smash and grab.\n\n12:16PM\n\n23 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nLasiske clears for USA once more before Daly returns, back to Lasike.\n\nThe USA centre clears up to halfway and England have a lineout, which they drive aggressively, Kruis the conductor.\n\nThe maul approaches the USA 22 before the backs get a go. Ford jinks through before Curry is smashed by Lasike.\n\nNo advantage, however, from a ruck infringement and Ford will put the ball in the corner.\n\n12:13PM\n\n20 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nLasike clears from USA's five-metre scrum, that was on the verge of creaking, and England have a lineout just outside the USA 22.\n\nFord is picking out some lovely passes, finding Joseph on an outside fade, and then Francis on a more direct angle. Cowan-Dickie has been a willing carrier, too.\n\nBrache then nails Launchbury and the Wasps lock knocks on. He's not had the best of starts, to be honest.\n\nThe USA's defence has been pretty ferocious in the contact, if at times disorganised.\n\n12:10PM\n\nOne of our correspondents cracks a funny...\n\nUSA teamsheet in. No late changes. pic.twitter.com/6G9EJnUKf8 \u2014 Charlie Morgan (@CharlieFelix) September 26, 2019\n\n12:09PM\n\n18 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nEngland launch an attack from the lineout with Cowan-Dickie, Vunipola and Francis carrying dangerously.\n\nEngland get to within six metres following another Francis burst, orchestrated by Ford, but Heinz is caught at the base by Davies and knocks on.\n\nIf he could have got the ball away there I'm sure England would have scored. That's an opportunity missed.\n\n12:07PM\n\n16 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nUSA's maul is strong and they make good yardage, but it collapses and is unplayable, so England get the scrum.\n\nKilifi cannot handle Cole and splits from his hooker, so England win the penalty which Ford prods down to the USA 22.\n\n12:04PM\n\n14 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nEngland's lineout is sloppy but they just about manage to claim possession. Then USA fly into a ruck in the midfield, Launchbury is caught a bit high and USA win the ball, but they knock-on as they try to play it.\n\nEngland attack left from the scrum, Francis prominent again, before Ford stabs a grubber to the USA line. Cokanasiga and Heinz put the pressure on, but the Gloucester man is pinged for hands on the floor.\n\nMacGinty clears up to the USA 22, and England illegally collapse the maul from the resulting lineout so MacGinty will push USA to halfway.\n\n12:01PM\n\n10 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nUSA can't control the lineout and England clear through Ford up to the USA 10-metre line.\n\nEngland win the ball back from the lineout and Marler carries strongly, before Ford puts a bomb up for Hooley. Daly competes well but can't take, and McGinty clears.\n\nDaly returns with interest but McGinty cleans up well, but the England defence is sharp. Curry and Ludlam combine to win a penalty after Landry's illegal clearout.\n\n11:58AM\n\n8 min: England 7 USA 0\n\nEngland reclaim a superb Heinz kick from the restart, and then Cokanasiga is unleashed down the left. He's tackled superbly by Scull - ouch! Cokanasiga was at full tilt.\n\nEngland try to carry through the forwards in midfield but the clearout is poor and Lamborn wins a holding on penalty.\n\n11:56AM\n\n6 min: CON FORD England 7 USA 0\n\nBang in front for Ford, no worries.\n\n11:56AM\n\n6 min: TRY FORD England 5 USA 0\n\nIt is baking in Kobe, as MacGinty pushes the USA just into England's half from the penalty.\n\nUSA strafe from side-to-side before MacGinty prods in behind, but it wasn't a great kick and Ford clears downfield.\n\nMcGinty clears to touch again and England have the lineout on halfway.\n\nA lovely nudge from Ford puts Iosefo under pressure on his line, chased down by Joseph and McConnochie.\n\nFrancis breaks following the USA clearance, with Curry and Launchbury with strong bursts.\n\nWhen the ball comes back to Ford, however, he spots a gap and saunters under the sticks untouched.\n\n11:52AM\n\n3 min: England 0 USA 0\n\nHeinz is offside at the scrum and USA will be able to clear with a penalty. Ainuu was under pressure from Cole in that scrum and he seems to be struggling with his ankle - he's having to be carried off.\n\n11:49AM\n\n2 min: England 0 USA 0\n\nPiers Francis puts a huge hit in from the kick-off but USA manage to clear.\n\nEngland go quickly from the lineout and Cowan-Dickie carries powerfully. The attack stalls, however, following a poor Joseph pass to Cokanasiga.\n\nVunipola then gets held up and USA will have the scrum.

This comes just four days after their 35-3 opening win against Tonga.\n\nThere are two schools of thought regarding that victory. One, that it was a gritty we-did-what-we-had-to type win against tough opponents who on their day are capable of creating a shock. And two, that, despite it being the opening match of a long tournament against a more than capable side, England's error and penalty count, alongside the inability to finish the Pacific islanders off until well into the final quarter, doesn't bode well for the the side's chances come the knockout stages.\n\nWherever you stand on that debate there is little doubt that both England fans and the coaching team would like to see the side play with a bit more authority and, for want of a better term, calm than on Sunday. Eddie Jones' men gave away too many penalties, were too rushed, too edgy and the coach will doubtless have told the side to impose themselves and look more like possible tournament winners than they did against Tonga.\n\nSo who are the potential banana skins today? The USA are one of the world's best sides in sevens but are yet to really make a mark in XVs. They have played in all but one World Cup (1995, in case you were wondering) and are without a win since 2011 - they have three victories in 25 World Cup matches. However, the sport in the Gridiron-focused country is on the up. Major League Rugby (MLR) launched in in 2018, with seven teams, finally providing a professional stage for the full format to prosper.\n\nThe chances of an upset are slim, but after yesterday's shock win for Uruguay over Fiji and, more pertinently, Japan's victory over South Africa four years ago anything can happen.
