At least five people have died there, reportedly including an 8-year-old boy. The Red Cross said that as many as 13,000 homes might have been destroyed. Once search-and-rescue teams can venture out and anecdotal reports can be confirmed, the official death toll and damage report are likely to rise.\n\nOne hundred eighty-five miles an hour is a devastating wind speed. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew essentially flattened the city of Homestead, Florida, after making landfall with winds at just 165 miles an hour.\n\nBut as my colleague Robinson Meyer has reported, and as the Western Hemisphere has repeatedly learned over the past few years, the wind isn\u2019t a hurricane\u2019s only threat. Nearly half of all hurricane-related deaths in the United States from 1963 to 2012 were caused by storm surge, including the vast majority of the 1,000-plus lives lost in Hurricane Katrina. Two years ago, freshwater flooding from Hurricane Harvey killed 65 people in Texas\u2014all but three of the official casualty count.\n\nIn the Bahamas, people in Dorian\u2019s path were told to expect 18 to 23 feet of storm surge; for reference, the Louisiana coast suffered 10 to 20 feet of surge during Katrina. Dorian was also forecast to dump 30 inches of rain on the Bahamas. On Sunday, Hubert A. Minnis, the Bahamian prime minister, described the streets of Abaco Island as indistinguishable from the ocean. He also said that parts of Marsh Harbour\u2014the main city on Abaco, with a population of 6,000\u2014were \u201cunder water.\u201d On Grand Bahama, Grand Bahama International Airport is similarly inundated.\n\nThe 2019 Atlantic hurricane season was originally forecast to be a relatively average one, and it had a slow start. After El Ni\u00f1o ended, along with its moderating influence on Atlantic storms, the season\u2019s prospects started to look more worrisome. Still, until last week, this year\u2019s accumulated cyclone energy\u2014a measure of the combined strength and duration of all tropical storms and hurricanes\u2014was below normal for the North Atlantic. Dorian has more than made up that deficit.\n\nRead: What Dorian could do\n\nSome of the storm\u2019s most frightening attributes, though, are on a par with recent trends. Dorian made 2019 the fourth year in a row that spawned at least one Category 5 hurricane; that\u2019s the longest streak on record. Dorian\u2019s rapid jump in wind speed is in line with the major storms of 2017 and 2018; Hurricane Maria, for example, jumped from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 within 24 hours. And Dorian\u2019s devastating stall over the Bahamas\u2014the National Hurricane Center has listed the storm\u2019s \u201cpresent movement\u201d as \u201cstationary\u201d since 5 p.m. yesterday\u2014matches Harvey\u2019s in 2017, Florence\u2019s in 2018, and even Tropical Storm Barry\u2019s earlier this year.", "description": "Its record-breaking power is in line with recent, worrisome trends.", "authors": ["Rachel Gutman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19245608969723_toned/facebook.jpg?1567520426"}
