Retirees often think they need to downsize for financial security, but that\u2019s not always true, one expert says. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nRobin and Stefanie Wohnsigl, a couple who recently moved to the Four Seasons at Kent Island active-adult community in Chester, Md., have been on a four-year journey to find the right place for their retirement.\n\n\u201cWe sold our big house in Great Falls four years ago and downsized to an apartment in Reston,\u201d says Robin Wohnsigl, a retired Air Force colonel and airline industry executive. \u201cThe apartment was great, it had indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and we loved Reston, but we had downsized too much plus we wanted a backyard for our dog.\u201d\n\nThe Wohnsigls moved from an 8,000-square-foot house to a 1,500-square-foot apartment before their recent transition to a 3,700-square-foot single-family home on Kent Island.\n\n\u201cNot only did we want more space and wanted to get back to owning a home, but we realized that every time we crossed the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to visit our daughter in Dover, Del., we felt this complete decompression,\u201d says Robin, who is 76. His wife, who retired about 20 years ago, is 74.\n\nFor empty nesters transitioning out of their longtime houses, making the choice of a new place to buy in a 55-plus community doesn\u2019t always mean downsizing.\n\n\u201cOlder home buyers today are \u2018smart-sizing\u2019 rather than just downsizing,\u201d says Mollie Carmichael, a principal with Meyers Research, a housing research firm in Costa Mesa, Calif. \u201cAffordability is a big priority before and during retirement, so people think they need to downsize for financial security, but that\u2019s not always true.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Four Seasons at Kent Island is an active-adult community in Chester, Md. For empty nesters transitioning out of their longtime houses, making the choice of a new place to buy in a 55-plus community doesn\u2019t always mean downsizing. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn active-adult communities, where typically residents must be 55 or older, the average home size is 1,500 to 1,800 square feet, Carmichael says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that about 30 percent of people who move to age-restricted communities move to a larger place within the community after they\u2019ve lived there for a while,\u201d Carmichael says. \u201cThey just want a little extra space and yet want to stay in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\n[Making the case for cottage neighborhoods]\n\nWhen Kevin and Sue Hanrahan retired at age 55, they fully intended to downsize from their three-level house in Ashburn, Va. But like other older buyers, they found something better than downsizing: a \u201cright-size\u201d home.\n\n\u201cOur priority was not having three levels,\u201d Sue Hanrahan says. \u201cWe would have been fine with a one-level house with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, but we ended up buying a house that also has a lower level with a third bathroom and the option for a third bedroom.\u201d\n\nThe Hanrahans purchased their home from Shea Homes at Trilogy at Lake Frederick in Lake Frederick, Va., four years ago to be closer to their two adult daughters. The basement level is primarily used as a playroom for their three grandchildren.\n\nRhea Jacobson, a home buyer at the Atrium at MetroWest being built by Pulte near the Vienna/Fairfax-GMU Metro station, downsized once already and plans to downsize a little more to move into the new active-adult community adjacent to her current home at MetroWest.\n\n\u201cTwo years after my husband passed away, I moved from King Farm in Rockville to a two-level townhouse at MetroWest to be closer to my daughter and my grandkids,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cMy two priorities were to buy something new so I didn\u2019t have to do maintenance and to be near Metro so I could get downtown. My friends are scattered around the area and so my social life is more downtown than anywhere else.\u201d\n\n\n\nRobin Wohnsigl looks out from his backyard as potential home buyers tour the Four Seasons development by golf cart.

Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nHer first move cut her living space in half. Her next move, into an active-adult community where she plans to live in a one-level condo, will reduce her space by about 150 square feet.\n\n\u201cI love my location, so I am happy to be moving just one block away,\u201d she says. \u201cI really want to be all on one floor instead of climbing stairs every day.\u201d\n\nJacobson is also looking forward to the social life in the active-adult community, the yoga room and an indoor swimming pool.\n\nResizing your lifestyle\n\nFiguring out where to go and what to buy for the preretirement-into-retirement life phase can be complicated by finances and careers as well as lifestyle choices, says Alison Bernstein, president and founder of Suburban Jungle, a national real estate advisory service based in New York City that recently opened a \u201cReSizer\u201d division aimed at people in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\u201cThe people we work with aren\u2019t retiring yet, but they are in a \u2018now what\u2019 phase where they can choose where they want to be based on their lifestyle rather than on their kids\u2019 schools,\u201d Bernstein says. \u201cWe talk to them about what they want out of their next home and provide them with free advice and then recommend our partner real estate agents to help them find a specific home.\u201d\n\n[Today\u2019s active-adult communities are stepping up their games]\n\nSome of Bernstein\u2019s clients stay in their same region to maintain close ties to friends and family, while others are ready to move someplace where it\u2019s easier to travel and experience new things.\n\n\u201cWe take a personal inventory of what people hope to accomplish with their move, such as reducing their commute, eliminating home maintenance or downsizing to something less expensive so they can use their cash for something else,\u201d Bernstein says.\n\nThat evaluation of finances as well as emotional goals is an important element for buyers and can help them decide if they need to move to a smaller or larger home.\n\n\n\nA billboard for future condos is seen from a window of the Wohnsigl's house in the Four Seasons development in Chester, Md. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nMark Ash, national director of design at PulteGroup, said consumer research helped it develop 13 GenYou floor plans ranging from 1,400 to 3,000 square feet.\n\nThe GenYou floor plans, available at the Del Webb Nocatee active-adult community in Ponte Vedra, Fla., and Del Webb eTown in Jacksonville, Fla., will eventually be introduced at Del Webb communities nationwide.\n\n\u201cThese new floor plans cater to all sorts of buyers, including those who want to downsize, right-size and upsize,\u201d Ash says. \u201cThey\u2019re all single-family homes designed with large sliding-glass doors that link to a covered patio, which addresses the need for more living space. And these designs have the flexibility to accommodate families with aging parents or boomerang adults living with them.\u201d\n\nFor Kari Peterson, a 62-year-old ReSizer client who now rents a townhouse in Haymarket, Va., the decision to move was triggered by her realization that her consulting business allows her to live anywhere. She chose Haymarket to be closer to her children and grandchildren.\n\n[For some in 55-plus communities, townhouses with elevators meet all their needs]\n\n\u201cHaving family nearby means a lot to me, but I also don\u2019t want to just follow my kids everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cI like being nearby but not involved in their daily life. I want to be happy in my own life.\u201d\n\nPeterson, who lives about four miles from her daughter, downsized from a larger home in an active-adult community in Atlanta into her townhouse, which has two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a garage.\n\n\u201cI right-sized to where I am now,\u201d she says. \u201cI found it liberating to get rid of things like lawn equipment, a desk and a fire pit. I plan to buy in a year or so.\u201d\n\nThe right-size home depends on your family needs, budget and location.\n\n\u201cPeople need to figure out what they can afford and what they can find in their market,\u201d Carmichael says. \u201cIn Texas, for example, most 55-plus buyers choose something equal or bigger than their current home, but in more expensive markets like California you\u2019re likely to see more people downsizing.\u201d\n\nFor the Wohnsigls, the readjustment back to a home that\u2019s more than double their apartment but about half the size of their original home means sorting through the belongings the couple had stored while living in Reston.\n\nBut they have plenty of time now that their lawn care \u2014 and future snow removal \u2014 will be handled by their homeowners\u2019 association.\n\nThen again, an active social life with their new neighbors at brunches and wine tastings has already kicked into high gear for the retirees.\n\nDisover more:\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, keep going with this curated list of stories from around The Washington Post.\n\nWhy climate change is a boon for ticks\n\nWith a wetter and warmer climate, Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis could become more common as the number of tick bites increase.\n\nUnderstanding a different kind of gender gap\n\nHistorically, men are more likely to work than women for myriad reasons. But the opposite is true of men and women in poverty.\n\nHow stadiums can change a neighborhood\n\nEconomists often disapprove of using government funds to build sports facilities.
