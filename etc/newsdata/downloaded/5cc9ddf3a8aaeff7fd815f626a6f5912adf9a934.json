This packaged food and beverage company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4% in the last reported quarter.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see what\u2019s in store for the company this time around.\n\n\n\nWhat to Expect?\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has been stable over the past 30 days at 53 cents, which suggests a slump of 32.1% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is $6,096 million, indicating a drop of more than 4% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company price-eps-surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company Quote\n\nFactors at Play\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz is likely to have benefited from focus on innovation, product development and other efforts to enhance the performance of its brands. Also, marketing and distribution initiatives are likely to have yielded favorable results for the company in the third quarter. Additionally, efforts to improve pricing might have aided the company.\n\n\n\nHowever, inventory reductions by retailers in the United States and Canada are likely to show on the company\u2019s organic sales as well as overall performance. Also, volatile currency movements have been a concern for Kraft Heinz\u2019s top and bottom lines.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Kraft Heinz\u2019s bottom line is expected to reflect the impacts of escalated key commodity costs in the quarter to be reported. Moreover, increased fixed cost investments and elevated supply-chain costs (packaging, freight and more) most likely continued being threats. Also, in its last earnings call, management guided a high effective tax rate for the third quarter, which is likely to have weighed on the bottom line.\n\n\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\n\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Kraft Heinz this time around.
