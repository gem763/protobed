Jones, one of the best receivers of his generation, agreed to a contract extension with the Falcons.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free on your phone with the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport reported the extension was close to being finalized on Saturday morning, and Jones will be paid about $66 million over three years. Early Saturday afternoon, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter said the two sides agreed to the deal, and all $66 million is guaranteed. Of that $66 million, $64 million was due at signing, Schefter said.\n\nThere never seemed to be a real concern that Jones wouldn\u2019t get the big deal he wanted from Atlanta. But it took a while, and the Falcons got it done just before the regular season started.\n\nJulio Jones believed the Falcons\u2019 promise\n\nJones wanted an extension last year, but settled for a raise instead. He also got a promise that his contract would be addressed this offseason. And Jones took a surprisingly calm approach to it all.\n\n\u201cNah, man, as far as the contract thing, Mr. Blank has spoken,\u201d Jones said this offseason, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cAt the end of the day, his word is gold. He said they are going to get something done between them and my agency. As far as me, I just hold up my end and stay ready.\u201d\n\nBlank\u2019s word did end up being good. One of the greatest Falcons players ever will be in Atlanta for a long time, and he should be happy.\n\nJones is one of the NFL\u2019s best\n\nStory continues\n\nJones is on a clear path to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He\u2019s a six-time Pro Bowler. He has had at least 1,400 yards in five straight seasons. Last season he led the NFL with 1,677 yards, the second time he has been the NFL\u2019s receiving yards champ.\n\nWaiting to extend Jones probably didn\u2019t save the Falcons any money. When New Orleans Saints receiver Michael Thomas signed a five-year deal worth more than $96 million, including almost $61 million guaranteed, that set a huge market for Jones\u2019 extension.\n\nJones did turn 30 in February so at some point relatively soon he\u2019ll start to slow down. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be any danger in that happening right away. Jones is still one of the best in the game, and just got paid as such.\n\nAtlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones led the NFL in receiving last season.
