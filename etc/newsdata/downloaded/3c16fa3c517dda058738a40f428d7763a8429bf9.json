Thank you, Corey,\u201d the president tweeted shortly after the hearing began.\n\nMr. Lewandowski\u2019s lack of cooperation wasn\u2019t good enough for Democrats.\n\nSEE ALSO: Corey Lewandowski gambles on Trump ties to excite GOP for potential Senate bid\n\n\u201cYou are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon. It\u2019s very hard to get an answer out of you,\u201d said Hank Johnson, Georgia Democrat.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, Rhode Island Democrat, called on committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to hold Mr. Lewandowski, who has not worked in the White House, in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate.\n\nMr. Nadler, New York Democrat, said he would \u201ctake it under advisement.\u201d\n\nThe chairman invoked the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon, which were based partly on obstruction, while reprimanding Mr. Lewandowski.\n\n\u201cWhen you refuse to answer these questions you are obstructing the work of this committee. You are also proving our point to the American people to see \u2014 the president is intent in obstructing our oversight. You are aiding in that obstruction,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats pressed Mr. Lewandowski on conversations he had with the president about ordering then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end ex-special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian election interference and whether any members of the Trump campaign were involved.\n\nDemocrats have said Mr. Trump\u2019s order amounts to obstruction of justice.\n\nMr. Lewandowski did confirm the account, which was detailed in the special counsel\u2019s report. But he said he didn\u2019t deliver the message because he was out of town, vacationing with his kids.\n\nHe denied that he was \u201csqueamish\u201d about confronting Mr. Sessions and said it was inaccurate that the president followed up to ensure the message was delivered.\n\nMr. Lewandowski eventually asked former Trump deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn to deliver the message, according to the Mueller report.\n\nDuring his roughly four hours of testimony, Mr. Lewandowski insisted he was not pressured to break the law.\n\n\u201cCongressman, the president didn\u2019t ask me to do anting illegal,\u201d he said in a particularly contentious exchange with Rep. Steve Cohen, Tennessee Democrat.\n\nFor their part, Republicans bemoaned the hearing, saying the time would be better spent holding hearings on the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general report on former FBI Director James Comey. The report found that Mr. Comey violated FBI policies when he leaked a set of memos detailing his conversations with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that you\u2019re here, Mr. Lewandowski,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz, Florida Republican. \u201cJim Comey should be sitting in that chair, he should be answering questions about why he did so much damage to the FBI and our country.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was the first by the committee since it passed a measure defining the parameters of investigating possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump as part of whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House.\n\nTwo former top White House aides were scheduled to appear Tuesday, but they defied congressional subpoenas at the instruction of White House counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\nThe White House maintains the aides \u2014 Mr. Dearborn and Rob Porter \u2014 have absolute immunity from answering congressional questions. Steven Groves, White House deputy press secretary, said Tuesday \u201cthe same legal position has been followed consistently\u201d by administrations of both parties.\n\nMr. Nadler said the White House\u2019s effort to stop or limit former staff from testifying is \u201can absolute coverup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a coverup, plain and simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were to prevail, it would upend the separation of powers envisioned by our founders.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Lewandowski came out swinging, telling Democrats they were wasting their time. He quickly pointed finger a finger at the Obama-era intelligence community for failing to stop Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe Obama-Biden administration and the intelligence community, overseen by James Clapper, Jim Comey and John Brennan had the responsibility to the American people to ensure the integrity of the 2016 election,\u201d he said. \u201cI leave it to this committee and the American public to decide how successful \u2014 or not \u2014 they were in doing their jobs.\u201d\n\nHe also blamed Democrats, accusing them of taking the nation down a \u201crabbit hole\u201d of Russian collusion allegations fueled by \u201cTrump haters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for actual \u2018collusion\u2019 or \u2018conspiracy\u2019 there was none,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat there has been, however, is harassment of the president from the day he won the election.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
