She and her husband went to the restaurant for the first time on her due date, July 12th.\n\n\"When we walked in they had a sign about [the burger] and it felt like a sign from the universe,\" she said. \"I had no idea they would have that there.\"\n\nEngler had gone to her 40-week doctor's visit the day before and was told she showed no signs of labor. Since her doctor would not induce until 41 weeks, Engler said she went to dinner resigned that she would be pregnant for another week.\n\nInstead, she ate the Labor Inducer that evening and, just like Quarberg, started feeling contractions about six hours later, around 2 a.m.\n\nShe went to the hospital and gave birth to Elise on July 14.\n\nKaty Engler\n\n\"At the time [of Elise's birth] I was just tired and in pain but later on we couldn\u2019t help but think it was an interesting coincidence,\" Engler said. \"So a few weeks later we went back to the restaurant with our parents and Elise.\"\n\nThe Suburban shared the two birth stories on social media and pregnant women have been coming in ever since, according to Quarberg.\n\n\"We were eating there last night and every time we looked at the door a very pregnant woman would walk through,\" she said. \"Statistically, if women are coming around their due date, it\u2019s got to have happened more.\"\n\nWhile there is an old wives' tale that eating spicy food -- like the two sauces on the Labor Inducer -- could cause contractions and induce labor, an OBGYN told \"GMA\" earlier this year there is \"no evidence whatsoever\" for that theory.\n\nQuarberg said she has thought that maybe just eating some \"good greasy food\" prompted her body to say, \"Let's do this.\"\n\nEngler said whether or not there is actual science to back up whether a food can induce labor, she understands on a very personal level why pregnant women are willing to try the Labor Inducer.\n\n\"I think at the very end of pregnancy, especially anyone who has gone up to their due date or after, is pretty desperate, at least I was,\" she said. \"I think people will try just about everything as long as it\u2019s safe and this is a fun and delicious thing to do.\"", "description": "Two women had contractions just hours after eating the burger.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/burger-ht-jt-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
