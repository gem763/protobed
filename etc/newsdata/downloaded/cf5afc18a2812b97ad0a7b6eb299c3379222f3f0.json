Investors were cheered overnight by positive data on the U.S. economy and the Trump Administration\u2019s plans to resume negotiations with China.\n\nAmong the region\u2019s individual markets, Germany\u2019s DAX DAX, +0.61% was the strongest gainer, rising 0.3% in early trading, despite continuing indications the country\u2019s economy may be weakening. Poor July data for the country\u2019s total industrial production on Friday followed similarly lackluster numbers on manufacturing the day before.\n\nWith German exporters starkly exposed to uncertainty over trade, stock investors may be hopeful that the latest move to restart U.S.-China talks will end up boosting Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nElsewhere, there was a slight fall for Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB index I945, +0.21%, while France\u2019s CAC 40 PX1, +0.15% and the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 were treading water. Investors are awaiting a key indicator of the health of the U.S. economy, the August jobs report, with economists predicting unemployment will stick near 50-year lows.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.0634% was also flat against the U.S. dollar, while the British pound GBPUSD, -0.1784% fell back 0.3% following a week of gains, as several defeats for Britain\u2019s government meant the prospect of a rapid, disorderly EU exit on October 31 appeared to recede.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Paris-listed catering group Sodexo SW, -3.94% was one of the region\u2019s biggest fallers today, slumping more than 4% after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock. Norwegian telecoms firm Telenor TEL, -3.91% also slid more than 4%, after it confirmed that a potential deal to merge its Asian operations with rival Axiata was off.\n\nShares in U.K.-listed security group G4S GFS, +6.11% , meanwhile, soared almost 9% on a report that the U.S.-listed Brinks Company is planning a \u00a31bn bid for part of the business. British network Sky News said the two firms are in talks but other bidders might yet emerge.", "description": "European stocks were holding near month-long highs on Friday morning, having now made up all their losses since global markets plunged in early August on...", "authors": ["Mark Cobley"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP370_german_ZG_20190814041013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
