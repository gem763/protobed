But they are worth taking a second look at, Morgan Stanley says.\n\nThe company's shares slipped 1.2% Monday after the aerospace giant said Saturday that it had suspended load testing of its new 777X aircraft. That was the latest blow for Boeing, whose 737 MAX is facing delays that threaten to prevent it from resuming flight in North America during the December holiday season.\n\nYet not all firms are souring on the stock. Morgan Stanley, which has taken a cautious stance on U.S. stocks overall, says Boeing has become its top pick in the aerospace and defense industry.\n\nThe plane maker's valuation looks relatively attractive, Morgan Stanley said in a research note. And although some investors worry the fallout from the two fatal crashes tied to Boeing's 737 MAX will weigh on orders over the long haul, Morgan Stanley believes the company still has \"considerable\" growth potential.\n\n\"We believe the 737 MAX grounding creates a buying opportunity in a steady aerospace cycle,\" the firm said, adding that it was setting a price target for Boeing of $500. The shares closed at $358.78 Monday.\n\nIt is likely too early to call the stock's rebound. Boeing shares are still down 19% from their March 1 closing peak of $440.62. Reports about unexpected delays, regulatory scrutiny and competition from Airbus have sent the stock tumbling -- only for them to recover -- over the past couple of months.\n\nAnd there are some signs that, at least among short-term traders, sentiment remains bearish. Schaeffer's Investment Research said in a note Monday that options activity suggests traders are leaning more toward puts, bets that pay out if the Boeing's price declines.\n\nBut count Morgan Stanley as one firm that thinks Boeing shares can break out of their rut.\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 09, 2019 17:03 ET (21:03 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
