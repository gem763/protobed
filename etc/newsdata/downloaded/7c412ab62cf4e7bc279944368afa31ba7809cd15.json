We don\u2019t think it is something that had worked for the United Nations, keeping in mind Srebrenica and what had happened in the past,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was referring to the slaughter by Bosnian Serb troops of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995 in a U.N.-declared \u201csafe zone\u201d where Dutch peacekeepers were unable to protect civilians.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there is going to be some kind of security zone which will be very specifically targeted to a military operation or to an area where there has to be some clearance,\u201d Moumtzis said.\n\n\u201cSo our hope is that there will be full cooperation by all to make sure that it happens as smoothly as possible, without resulting in displacement, and ensuring protection of civilians, ensuring that the basic principles of humanity will be respected on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations is in contact with all sides to explain where clinics, schools, water points, markets and residential areas are located, and to urge them \u201cto stay away from civilian people\u201d, Moumtzis said.", "description": "Civilians must be spared in any Turkish military operation in northeast Syria, where the United Nations hopes that mass displacement and Srebrenica-like killings can be prevented, a senior U.N. aid official said on Monday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
