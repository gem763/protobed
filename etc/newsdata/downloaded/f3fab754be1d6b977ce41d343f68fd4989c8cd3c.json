I'm so tired. You look so bad but I guess I love you in some ways.\"\n\nHe responded: \"You know what Elise, you know what? You just waking up to tell me how bad I look every morning is not good.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"It's not good. Behave yourself... naughty girl.\"\n\nSusanna gasped before giving Piers a telling off of her own.\n\nShe said: \"You can't admonish your daughter live on television.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nUnfazed, Piers replied: \"I absolutely can.\"\n\nAlso on the show, Piers defended his thoughts that fat-shaming \"worked\" after a guest lost half his body weight in just a year, transforming from 40 stone to 20 stone.\n\nDarren McClintock, known as Dibsy, insisted he wasn't body-shamed though, and was instead supported after his personal trainer had him banned from all the takeaways in his town.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "Piers Morgan's seven-year-old daughter Elise emailed in to Good Morning Britain with a confession for her dad", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_piers-tells-off-daughter-on-gmb-after-she-says-he-looks-bad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
