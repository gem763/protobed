His article prompted responses from readers pointing out that this is not limited to the capital, Harare.\n\nPip Curling wrote in:\n\nI worked at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and was on the board of trustees there too. I personally collected a body of work that told the story of the country from the late 1980s to probably 2007 when hyperinflation hit. My collection is sometimes the work of rural, self-taught and unsung artists which have never been seen because of the political situation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest This painting by the Zimbabwean artist Misheck Gudo is apposite given that Mugabe has recently died. The central figure is the owl and is easily recognised as a caricature. Photograph: Givas Mashiri\n\nMisheck Gudo came as a young man from a small village in the eastern districts of Zimbabwe to try his luck in Harare. Often the self-taught artists tell a narrative more than they might attempt to expose an emotion or a feeling. The works are usually self-explanatory and require no verbal input from the artist. Myth, legend and proverb sometimes play their part. Misheck made this painting after the heavily contested general election in Zimbabwe in 2005.\n\nArt gives us that chance to stand back, take stock, see the context, the wider picture \u2013 a vital safety valve in societies that are seething with antagonism and dispute. In another furious week in the UK, the Turner prize comes as welcome relief. In Latvia, they\u2019re trying to use culture as a unifying force.\n\nAnd as highlighted in this newsletter back in the summer, some even believe that art and culture can improve mental health. It can certainly improve your wealth if you find something valuable in the kitchen.\n\nOther Upside treats this week:\n\n1. What is to be done if your country only has one practising psychologist for every million people? Three-minute read.\n\n2. The quest for a forgiveness emoji.

Local models showcased outfits that had been created from clothes and accessories from charity shops, with one or two eco-items thrown into the mix. The show was part of the launch of Refashion My Town, with Chippenham being chosen as the pilot town for the campaign.\n\nKatherine Conway wrote:\n\nI think in this current consumer climate it would be great to do a story on Aaron Feuerstein whose company, Malden Mills, made Polartec fabric, and when the mill burned down in the 1990s Feuerstein continued to pay employees until the mill could reopen.\n\nAnd Chared Verschuur-Ballo got in touch from the Netherlands.\n\nI thought that you would probably be interested in a story where pastoralists in low-income countries are using geo-satellite to find food (grass and water) for their livestock. This is quite groundbreaking. Some more stories here.\n\nWhere was the Upside?\n\nIn Gaza, with a rare glimpse of the light.\n\nAnd of course back on the streets, after an important week for the climate movement.\n\nThanks for reading.
