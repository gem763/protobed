The case made widespread headlines, particularly when the county judge, Aaron Persky, sentenced Turner to just six months in jail, despite facing up to 14 years.\n\nPersky believed that Turner was \u201cremorseful,\u201d even though he never admitted guilt in raping Miller. Turner, who had been a star swimmer at Stanford, only ended up serving three of the six months.\n\nMiller\u2019s victim impact statement, which she read at Turner\u2019s sentencing hearing, went viral and drew attention from around the world, including from lawmakers in Congress. Miller\u2019s powerful remarks and Turner\u2019s lenient sentence sparked new conversations about rape culture and white male privilege, and led California to pass minimum sentencing requirements for sexual assault cases. In 2018, voters recalled Persky, the first judge in California to be successfully recalled since 1932.\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d announced that it will air Miller\u2019s first interview on Sept. 22 and released a clip of her reading her impact statement.\n\nShe has been known to the world as \u201cEmily Doe,\u201d the sexual assault victim of Stanford swimmer Brock Turner.
