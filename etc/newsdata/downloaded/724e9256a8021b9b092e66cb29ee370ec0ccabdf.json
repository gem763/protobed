The question of what you feed your dog should take into account its age, size, breed, and any health issues your dog may have. But none of that will matter if he or she doesn\u2019t like the way the food tastes. Veterinarian Stephanie Liff of Pure Paws Veterinary Care explains that palatability is a vital part of deciding what to feed your dog. \u201cI want my patients to like eating it,\u201d says Liff, who feeds her three-year-old Labradoodle a combination of human-grade and air-dried raw food as well as kibble. One way you know your dog is eating the right food, according to Liff, is if he produces \u201cgood, quality (easy to pick up) stool.\u201d Other important things to look for are a brand\u2019s recall history and an AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) statement on the bag, box, or can. The AAFCO statement is a sign that the food is nutritionally complete and balanced, explains Zay Satchu, the co-founder and chief veterinary officer at Bond Vet.\n\nBefore getting into the list of recommended dog foods, it should be noted that the FDA recently put out a warning about certain grain-free dog foods, which the agency thinks may be linked to an increase in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs. According to veterinarian Sara Ochoa, \u201cLarge and giant breed dogs are predisposed to this disease,\u201d so Ochoa says that if she had a large or giant breed dog, she would avoid grain-free diets. The majority of the vets we spoke with explained that the correlation isn\u2019t from the lack of grains in these foods, but rather from the legumes or peas that have been added as a replacement. Veterinarian Angie Krause says, \u201cWhen a dog\u2019s diet gets so high in legumes as a protein source, it may change their uptake of certain amino acids.\u201d This is thought to be the correlation between grain-free foods and DCM.\n\nTo get a better idea of what foods the experts (human and canine) like, we talked to Liff, Satchu, and eight other veterinarians about the foods they recommend to their patients as well as what they feed their own dogs at home. And since every dog is unique, if you\u2019re thinking about changing your dog\u2019s diet, it\u2019s a good idea to consult with your veterinarian before doing so.\n\nBest overall dog food\n\nRoyal Canin Size Health Nutrition Mini Mature 8+ Dry Dog Food Of the ten veterinarians we spoke to, seven of them said that Royal Canin\u2013brand dog food is their top pick for both their own pets and the dogs they treat at work. Gregory Gstrein, an associate veterinarian at VCA Animal Hospital in Crown Valley, California, says that \u201cthe best foods are backed by actual research and feeding trials. Royal Canin does the extensive work needed to prove their foods yield excellent real-world results.\u201d Catriona Love, an associate veterinarian at Heart of Chelsea Veterinary Group, feeds Royal Canin to her five-pound, 11-year-old Chihuahua rescue, and says that of the three dog-food brands she recommends to her patients, Royal Canin is the most palatable. \u201cI think the animals tend to like it more,\u201d she says. $14 at Amazon Buy $13 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest wet dog food\n\nRoyal Canin Veterinary Diet Gastrointestinal Low Fat Canned Dog Food Veterinarian Jeff Werber also likes Royal Canin because it\u2019s a brand with a positive track record and a trusted name, and its products are readily available. He told us that he\u2019s always been a fan of mixed feeding, meaning a little of both dry and wet foods. Werber explains that, because a lot of dogs don\u2019t drink enough water, adding moist canned food (which also has less carbs and more flavor) to their dry food is a win-win. He says that his dogs \u201clove with a capital L\u201d Royal Canin\u2019s low-fat canned dog food. $77 for 24 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest dry dog food for sensitive stomachs\n\nHill's Science Diet Dry Dog Food Sensitive Stomach & Skin When it comes to dog-food brands, three of the vets we spoke to recommend Hill\u2019s Science Diet, which meets AAFCO nutritional standards and comes in a wide variety of breed, size, and age-specific formulas. Its more specialized formulas include products for dogs who need help managing their weight, or have sensitive skin or stomachs \u2014 the latter being what Ochoa feeds her eight-year-old schnoodle every morning. Ochoa also told us that all the dogs who stay at her practice\u2019s boarding facility eat Hill\u2019s Science Diet Sensitive Stomach, and Love adds that \u201cHill\u2019s is a company I have always trusted, mostly because I was really exposed to it when I was in vet school.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest dehydrated raw dog food\n\nStella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw Stella's Super Beef Dinner Patties Grain-Free Dog Food When it comes to raw-food diets for dogs, there are some strong opinions in the veterinary community. Unsurprisingly, many vets feel that feeding your pet raw food can lead to potential health risks for both the dog and the humans who live with that dog. Others, including Krause, Liff, and veterinarian Marty Goldstein (who literally wrote the book on holistic medicine for pets and has his own line of dog food) explain that there are extra hygienic precautions you need to take with raw food, but that those are worth the added nutritional benefits, such as improved digestion and immune system function as well as less inflammation and allergies. Liff says she has patients that do well on raw diets, but she always has \u201ca lengthy discussion with owners about how to feed safely, and food handling, to prevent food-borne illness.\u201d According to Goldstein, freeze-dried raw foods have less risk of food-borne illnesses and can be stored without refrigeration. Krause says that if her own dog didn\u2019t have specific food sensitivities, she would feed him a raw diet. She specifically recommends these Stella & Chewy dehydrated raw turkey patties, which meet AAFCO standards and can be served dry or mixed with a little warm water to rehydrate them. She also told us that she likes literally everything the brand makes, saying \u201cStella & Chewy has never put out anything I haven\u2019t liked.\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest dog foods for large or giant dogs\n\nAccording to our experts, owners of large and giant breed dogs should avoid dog foods that contain legumes as a protein source. Nicole Goudey-Rigger, the owner and CEO of Pets a Go Go, told us she took her two purebred Akitas and two medium-size mixed breeds (a golden retriever\u2013Chow Chow mix and an Australian shepherd mix) off their low-grain diet after the connection between DCM and grain-free food was first raised; now, she feeds her four big dogs Purina Pro Plan Salmon Sensitive Stomach, which contains brewers\u2019 rice and barley and no legumes. She and two other experts we spoke with like Purina Pro Plan foods because, as Gstrein points out, the recipes (like Royal Canin\u2019s and Hill\u2019s) meet AAFCO standards and are formulated by a veterinary nutritionist. Goudey-Rigger also likes the Purina Pro Plan line because of its wide variety of proteins, which include chicken, beef, salmon, duck, lamb, pork, and even quail. Looking for a variety of proteins in a brand\u2019s product line is important, she says, because \u201cnot all proteins agree with all dogs.\u201d Ochoa\u2019s dog also likes Purina Pro Plan, and gets a small portion of its shredded chicken food (a legume-free mix that includes chewy pieces and crunchy pieces) as a complement to Hill\u2019s Science Diet.\n\nBest prescription dog food for allergies\n\nRoyal Canin Veterinary Diet Ultamino Dry Dog Food 8.8 lbs bag Though Krause is a fan of minimally processed or raw-food diets for dogs (and a brand ambassador for freeze-dried raw dog food brand I and Love and You), her own pup is \u201callergic to life.\u201d Because of his allergies, Krause\u2019s pug is on a super-hydrolyzed diet, which means the proteins he eats are broken down into the individual amino acids. She says the diet \u201cis so far from natural, but he does great on it and he\u2019s happy on it.\u201d Both Liff and Gstrein also recommend this particular hydrolyzed diet for dogs with allergies, and veterinarian Jennifer Coates feeds it to her elderly boxer Apollo who has severe inflammatory bowel disease. A note: While this and the dog food below are for sale online, you do in fact need a vet\u2019s prescription to purchase it. $50 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest prescription dog food for weight loss\n\nHILL'S PRESCRIPTION DIET Metabolic Chicken Flavor Dry Dog Food In addition to its over-the-counter line of dog food, Hill\u2019s makes a range of prescription diet foods. Liff recommends this specific product for overweight dogs, saying that \u201cfor significant weight loss, I usually use the prescription Hill\u2019s Metabolic Diet to take the weight off.\u201d Gstrein and Ochoa also like Hill\u2019s prescription dog foods, saying its Derm Defense formula is great for dogs with itchy skin due to allergies (it would make a great alternative to try if your pooch doesn\u2019t like the above Royal Canin allergy diet). $35 at Chewy Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
