I think there is a gaping hole in the centre...\n\n'I'm obviously not a partisan of Sadiq Khan's or indeed of any political party - I think that mayoral roles can be done very well by independents.\n\nMr Stewart has been highly critical of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit\n\n'And I think the danger of mayors being part of political parties is they carry the whole damage and the baggage of those manifestos with them.\n\n'I would like to be a mayor of London that can really focus on London's interests rather than being tied to Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson.'\n\nIn a swipe at the incumbent Mr Khan, Mr Stewart said he did not think he had 'made the most' of the role and that it was 'not clear' what his dreams are for London.\n\nHe added: 'I can make the role of mayor something bigger than it's been in the past - I think there's huge potential in the role of mayor of London.\n\n'I think it's something that we see in cities like New York, I don't think we've begun to see the potential of it.'\n\nThere was anger today toward the BBC Today presenter Justin Webb who suggested Rory Stewart should not stand for mayor because he is a white man and an Old Etonian.\n\nHe went on to suggest that Mr Stewart standing in the race was not 'really 2020'.\n\nDespite this, over the coming weeks, the 46-year-old intends to emulate his walk across Afghanistan in 2002 by touring each borough of London on foot as part of a listening mission before the campaign kicks off.\n\nThe Remain campaigner has been highly critical of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit and voted against a no-deal exit.", "description": "The ex-Tory Cabinet minister said mayors who were part of political parties carry the 'baggage' of their manifestos with them and that Sadiq Khan had not 'made the most' of the role.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/19/19339938-0-image-a-38_1570301359693.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
