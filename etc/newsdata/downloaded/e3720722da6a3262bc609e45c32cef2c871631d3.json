Mike Cannon-Brookes\n\nMike Cannon-Brookes now backs up his advocacy with a net worth valued at about $13.5 billion. Steven Siewert\n\nThe co-founder of US-listed tech giant Atlassian has a profile that seems to grow in sync with his company\u2019s share price.\n\nWhether through his regular public speaking engagements or his near-daily stream of posts to 46,000 Twitter followers, Sydney-based Cannon-Brookes has become a powerful voice on issues such as technology policy, skills, corporate governance and, especially, climate change.\n\nHis \u201cfair dinkum power\u201d campaign to promote clean energy might have failed to do much damage at the election, but his plain-speaking approach \u2013 not to mention a fortune of about $13.5 billion \u2013 ensures his views are always heard.\n\nCannon-Brookes\u2019 economic influence is magnified by his investments in a broad set of companies seeking to disrupt various sectors, including payments group Tyro, superannuation fund Spaceship, autonomous vehicles start-up Zoox and solar finance group Brighte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Ian Silk\n\nIan Silk heads up AustralianSuper with its 2.3 million members. Wayne Taylor\n\nAs the chief executive of $171 billion superannuation powerhouse AustralianSuper, Silk stands central to several themes of the Australian business community, including the distrust of the traditional banking and wealth sector, the rise of private equity and the ever-growing focus on environmental, social and governance issues. Silk is never short of a strong view on everything from bank bonuses to the importance of compulsory super, and rarely misses an opportunity to defend and promote the cause of union-based industry super funds. But he has also shown an ability to remain admirably above the fray and sharply focused on the interests of his 2.3 million members.\n\n4. Lindsay Maxsted\n\nLindsey Maxsted has become a leading defender of the banking sector as it endures fallout from the Hayne royal commission. Tash Sorensen\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough year to be the chairman of an Australian bank.\n\nBut with NAB in disarray, and ANZ and Commonwealth Bank chairmen David Gonski and Catherine Livingstone keeping lower profiles, Westpac chairman Maxsted has emerged as one of the sector\u2019s prominent defenders, walking the delicate line between taking responsibility for the mistakes of his bank and sector and promoting the roles they play in the community.\n\nMaxsted also chairs sprawling toll road giant Transurban, which fought off competition concerns and rival bids to grab control of Sydney\u2019s WestConnex project. Drivers already take more than 2 million trips on the group\u2019s roads in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane each day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Geoff Wilson\n\nGeoff Wilson led protests against Labor's proposed changes to the tax rules of dividend imputation last year. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nWhen you\u2019re playing politics, it helps to have as little shame as the politicians you\u2019re up against.\n\nSo it proved for Wilson, who might be the only fund manager ever to organise a protest march on a parliamentary inquiry.\n\nWilson\u2019s long campaign against Labor\u2019s proposed changes to tax refunds from franking credits veered from the sublime into the ridiculous at times, but his ability to mobilise a big chunk of Wilson Asset Management\u2019s 80,000 investors helped the Coalition keep the issue on the agenda throughout the election campaign and contributed to the shock defeat of Labor leader Bill Shorten.\n\nWilson still winces at his experience during the battle. \"When we got dragged into the politics, that was painful. It was brutal,\" he said on the morning after the election.\n\n6. Peter Coleman\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodside Petroleum's Peter Coleman is taking on proposed new restrictions on emissions.\n\nIt was exactly the sort of crisis that Woodside Petroleum didn\u2019t need.\n\nWith key decisions in the development of the company\u2019s Browse and Scarborough LNG projects edging closer, chief executive Coleman has been forced to lead the energy sector\u2019s protests against radical new emissions reductions proposals from the independent West Australian Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThere was no consultation with industry on the draft guidelines released in March and Coleman railed against the \u201cholding of secret meetings with selected authorities\u201d.\n\nWA Premier Mark McGowan eventually reassured the resources sector the EPA\u2019s recommendations were not government policy and it would consult widely on whatever changes would be made.\n\nBut Coleman\u2019s battle might not be over.\n\n7. Andy Penn\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTelstra chief executive Andy Penn has presided over a revitalisation of the telecommunications giant. Peter Braig\n\nWhen the Telstra chief executive took the stage at Canberra\u2019s National Press Club on July 31, he was the first chief executive of a major listed company to do so in more than 18 months.\n\nThat says much about how hard Penn has worked to change the narrative around Telstra in the past few years.\n\nWith his dramatic plan to slash costs and simplify operations resonating with Telstra investors \u2013 who have pushed the stock up 28.5 per cent this year \u2013 Penn has gone on the attack on a range of policy issues, led by the NBN rollout that has radically reshaped the profitability of his business.\n\nIf a government eventually writes off part of the value of the NBN (which would pave the way for fees charged to telcos to fall, finally) then Penn will be entitled to take a bow.\n\n8. Hamish Douglass\n\nHamish Douglass's Magellan has shined at a time when most active fund managers have struggled. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarket volatility and falling bond yields have made life tough for most of Australia\u2019s active fund managers.\n\nBut not for Douglass, who has emerged as one of the most powerful voices in the investment community.\n\nHis flagship Magellan Global Fund had a stellar year, returning 22.4 per cent after fees in the year to July 31, beating its benchmark by 10.6 per cent.\n\nAs his funds under management rapidly approach $100 billion, Douglass is shaking things up again, launching a new listed investment fund that will be sold directly to retail clients, bypassing the traditional broker channel.\n\nLater in the year, Magellan is tipped to launch a post-retirement product \u2013 just as the government\u2019s retirement income inquiry is likely to get underway.\n\n9. Andrew Forrest\n\nA $1.2 billion dividend payout made it a stellar year for Fortescue's Andrew Forrest. Paul Jones\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been a watershed year for Forrest. An extraordinary rise in the iron-ore price has boosted his fortune, his philanthropic power and his broader influence.\n\nThe $1.2 billion in dividends that flowed to Forrest from iron-ore giant Fortescue Metals Group allowed him to pump $655 million into his Minderoo Foundation, which tackles issues from slavery to cancer research and marine pollution.\n\nForrest, who regularly visits the Coalition\u2019s top brass in Canberra, has also emerged as a kingmaker in Australia\u2019s energy wars with his plans for a floating LNG import terminal.\n\n10. Amanda Lacaze\n\nLynas boss Amanda Lacaze has successfully lobbied the government of Malaysia over regulations for the company's operations there. Peter Braig\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to wield power in Australia, but it\u2019s another thing entirely to sway the policy of a foreign government. That\u2019s exactly what the chief executive of rare earths miner Lynas appears to have done in Malaysia. The future of Lynas\u2019 processing plant in Kuantan was uncertain when a group of long-time critics of the facility swept to power in May last year as part of the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nBut Lacaze\u2019s lobbying, which included an extended audience with Mahathir early on in a review of the plant, proved successful in August when the PM confirmed Lynas wouldn\u2019t have to export radioactive waste stored near the plant. To top it all off, Lacaze also fought off a takeover offer from Wesfarmers in August.\n\nThe 2019 corporate power list was compiled by AFR editor-in-chief Michael Stutchbury, editor Paul Bailey, Chanticleer columnists Tony Boyd and James Thomson, companies editor Ben Potter and national affairs columnist Jennifer Hewett.\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
