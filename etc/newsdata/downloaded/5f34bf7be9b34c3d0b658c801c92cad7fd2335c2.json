Yet she still finished with a leading score of 14.633 on the apparatus.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I wonder how I do it,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI wish I could have like an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d\n\nIt was her second world title of the week in Stuttgart, having already helped the U.S. to their fifth consecutive team title on Tuesday.\n\nThe 22-year-old is now just one short of Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s record haul of 23 medals - a milestone she could surpass by the end of the individual events at the championships this weekend.\n\nSUPER SUB TANG\n\nTang, making her championships debut, was not even supposed to be on the start list for the final, but went on to clinch China\u2019s first all-around medal in eight years.\n\nIn the qualifying round, costly mistakes on the balance beam left her as the third-best Chinese in 21st place, with only the top-two gymnasts per country eligible to participate in the all-around final.\n\nHowever, China decided to draft in the 16-year-old to replace captain Liu Tingting, who suffered three falls in Tuesday\u2019s disappointing team final.\n\nTang responded under pressure with solid routines across all apparatus, including a near flawless set on the balance beam for 14.600 - only 0.033 off Biles\u2019 score.", "description": "American Simone Biles became the first woman to win five all-around titles at the gymnastics world championships in Stuttgart on Thursday, building on her legacy as one of the greatest of all time.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439602176&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0KY-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
