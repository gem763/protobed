Shults admitted to Elle.com. 'After my talk, she came up to me and said, \"Actually Sully is no you.\" It's all about perspective and how much information you have.\n\nTammie Jo Shults (left) says her landing in Philadelphia on April 17, 2018 hasn't received the same attention as Captain Chesley Sullenberger's (right in 2017) 2009 landing\n\nAn engine exploded on the April 2018 flight from New York's La Guardia Airport and Shults carried out an emergency landing in Philadelphia\n\n'Other people have said, \"The only reason people are making a big deal about this is because you're a woman. You weren't even successful, because somebody died on the plane.\" I landed the plane safely though and I don't need to address it further. I did it. People can take the facts and work it out for themselves. Let them connect the dots.'\n\nJennifer Riordan died after she was partially sucked through a smashed window. One person told Shults: 'You weren't even successful, because somebody died on the plane'\n\nShults had a phone conversation with Captain Sullenberger the day after the incident involving the Dallas-bound plane and the pair spoke about what she could expect in the future in terms of media.\n\nShe tells her story in new book Nerves of Steel: How I Followed My Dreams, Earned My Wings, and Faced My Greatest Challenge, which was released this week.\n\nShults also told Elle.com: Sully faced the same media onslaught we did when he landed his flight. We had reporters coming to our house and calling us nonstop, so I asked Sully, \"What did you wish you knew that you figured out later?\" Then we just talked about our experiences and what I could expect in the future in terms of media.'\n\nDespite regretting 'not a thing' in terms of response to the emergency where Jennifer Riordan, 43, died, the pilot wishes she had given her sweater to the victim.\n\n'The only regret I have is that when they brought Jennifer forward, instead of sitting back to let the medical team just do what they do, I wish I could have helped cover her a little better,' Shults admitted.\n\n'I prayed there was still life in her, and I remember thinking, \"She has got to be freezing.\" It bothered me that I didn't go get my sweater to put on her. It's small, but stepping in and extending a hand to help always makes a big difference.'\n\nDespite regretting 'not a thing' in terms of response to the emergency, the pilot wishes she had given Riordan her sweater to stay warm\n\nPresident Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Tammie Jo Shults on May 1, 2018. She said people have told her: 'The only reason people are making a big deal about this is because you're a woman'\n\nWhen they reached the ground she continued as normal by putting away her oxygen mask, collecting her headset and other belongings, then shaking hands with the passengers as they exited\n\nThe harsh comments are some of 'a thousand sexist things said to me in 35 years of flying,' Shults said\n\nShults added: 'It's difficult, because when you lose a passenger, it has a completely different posture than when you don't. I was grateful that we made a successful landing and I was in a position to know, more than anyone, that that wasn't a guaranteed fact when everything happened, even until we touched down. When there's a loss of life, it isn't eclipsed by all the good that happens.'\n\nShults doesn't claim all the credit for her life-saving actions in the event where she and First Officer Darren couldn't even hear each other after the aircraft was struck by a violent shudder and they couldn't focus their eyes as smoke filled the cockpit.\n\nThe pilot said a retired nurse on board gave a fellow passenger CPR and another traveler tied the shoelaces of someone who had their hands full.\n\nShe tells her story in new book Nerves of Steel: How I Followed My Dreams, Earned My Wings, and Faced My Greatest Challenge, which was released this week\n\nShults said that after a burst of adrenaline she was determined to land the plane safely and when they reached the ground she continued as normal by putting away her oxygen mask, collecting her headset and other belongings, then shaking hands with the passengers as they exited.\n\nShults' pilot husband Dean was supposed to fly that day but she switched with him so he could attend their son's game.\n\n'Then I texted [my husband] Dean a picture of the busted engine and said, 'I flew this',' she shared.\n\nThree weeks later she was back in the cockpit and flew to Puerto Vallarta and back.\n\n'It was great,' she said about her return to work. 'They gave us as much time as we wanted, but sometimes you need a slice of normal in life.'\n\nI had this burst of adrenaline that made me think so fast and remain so calm. I was thinking to myself, 'I don't think everything is going to stay on this aircraft for us to land, but I'll do everything in my power to make sure we land safely.'\n\nShults' pilot husband Dean was supposed to fly that day but she switched with him so he could attend their son's game", "description": "Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 pilot Tammie Jo Shults says her landing in Philadelphia on April 17, 2018 hasn't received the same attention as Captain Chesley Sullenberger's 2009 New York landing.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19501922-0-image-a-75_1570640344213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
