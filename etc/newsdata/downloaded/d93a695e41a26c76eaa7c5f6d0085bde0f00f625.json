Far from it: throughout September and October, police-protester clashes have continued to escalate, with levels of violence intensifying on both sides.\n\nIn recent weeks, the protesters\u2019 tactics have now extended to vandalising metro stations and shops owned by mainland Chinese capital. Some have also started to embrace a tactic they call \u201cprivate resolution\u201d: the idea that given the untrustworthiness of the police, protesters should defend themselves and use proportionate violence against counter-protesters who assaulted protesters. This has been condemned in some quarters as plain and simple vigilantism.\n\nAnd yet, over the past three months, public opinion toward protesters\u2019 use of violence has hardly changed.\n\nOver the last few months, the Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey of the Chinese University of Hong Kong have conducted a series of representative surveys of public attitudes toward the current protests. In our survey conducted in early August, only 39.5 per cent of 842 respondents agreed that the protesters have used excessive force; in our September survey of 623 people, which was conducted right after chief executive Carrie Lam withdrew the extradition bill, that figure held steady at 39.4 per cent.\n\nAnd in our survey of 751 respondents conducted between October 8 and 14 \u2013 a particularly violent moment \u2013 the figure rose only slightly to 41.4 per cent.\n\nOne clear explanation for this stability is that the public have consistently viewed the police as far more violent and abusive. As protesters have graduated from simply throwing bricks to using petrol bombs and vandalising targeted shops, police tactics have escalated in parallel, going beyond tear gas and rubber bullets to deploying specialised crowd management vehicles and firing live rounds. In one incident during the protests on China\u2019s National Day, a police officer beset by several protesters fired at the chest of an 18-year-old protester at close range (fortunately the youngster survived).\n\nSure enough, the same series of surveys found that through the last three months, 68 per cent, 72 per cent, and 69 per cent of the respondents agreed that the police had used excessive force.\n\nBesides decrying the police\u2019s increasingly harsh tactics in the streets, protesters who\u2019ve been arrested have accused the police of meting out physical and sexual abuse on people in custody. The police were also seen as violating a range of norms and rules supposedly regulating their conduct.\n\nThis in turn helps explain why the public so strongly support several of the movement\u2019s core demands, among them universal suffrage, amnesty for arrested protesters, and the guarantee that the protests will not be classified as \u201criots\u201d.\n\nAnother demand, the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry to look into police misconduct as well as the protest movement at large, was supported by 80 per cent, 80 per cent, and 88 per cent of the respondents in the August, September, and October surveys respectively.\n\nAfter the demonstrations on China\u2019s National Day, which were among the most violent since the protests took hold, some of the movement\u2019s supporters adjusted their slogan from \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d to \u201csix demands, not one less\u201d, the additional demand being the dissolution of the entire police force. CUHK\u2019s October survey asked the respondents whether the police force needs a major restructuring: close to 70 per cent replied affirmatively.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Hong Kong government continues to reject the movement\u2019s broadly popular demands and the police continued their hardline approach, the general public\u2019s trust in both the government and the police force has continued to deteriorate to the lowest of levels.\n\nIn August, asked to indicate how much they trusted the government and police on a 0-to-10 scale, 44 per cent of the Hong Kong public gave the Hong Kong government a score of 0, while 43 per cent gave 0 for the police, putting the mean scores for the government and the police were 2.77 and 3.08 respectively. In the October survey, 49 per cent of the respondents gave the Hong Kong government a score of 0, and 52 per cent gave the police a score of 0 \u2013 taking their mean scores down to 2.32 and 2.60.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Even though the Hong Kong government has withdrawn the controversial extradition bill that roused the largest protest movement in the region\u2019s history, the uprising it triggered has yet to die down.
