Anybody can tell you to start Deshaun Watson, Dalvin Cook, and Mike Evans. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing here. I\u2019m looking deeper at legitimate mostly-borderline candidates who owners may truly be contemplating using in lineups.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nStory continues\n\nStart of the Week: Jameis Winston vs. 49ers: Maybe the best quarterback in the league last preseason, Winston opened 2018 on the suspended list. Ryan Fitzpatrick dominated that first month of the season and kept the gig before getting yanked late in Week 4 at Chicago. Winston went on to start Weeks 6-8 before getting benched himself. Despite the turnovers, Winston was the overall QB11 in fantasy points per game during that span. He reclaimed the starting job Week 12 and was the overall QB7 the final six weeks of the season. Fitzpatrick was let go in the offseason, and new coach Bruce Arians has committed to Winston for 2019. The \u201cgoal\u201d is for Winston to be more consistent and take what the defense gives him, but it\u2019s hard to take the gunslinger out of him. Especially in an Arians offense that wants to push the ball downfield through the air and light teams up via the pass. This Niners-Bucs game is the one everyone is talking about from a fantasy lens due to its 49.5-point total -- the fourth-highest of Week 1 -- and pick\u2019em spread. Neither team projects to be all that good defensively, especially in the secondary, and both offenses played at a top-10 pace a season ago. San Francisco was dead last in the NFL with two measly interceptions in 2018 and did absolutely nothing to upgrade its secondary aside from signing CB Jason Verrett, who hasn\u2019t played a down since Week 1 of the 2017 and has only been available for five games since the end of 2015. LCB Richard Sherman turned 31 in the offseason, and RCB Ahkello Witherspoon was Pro Football Focus\u2019 worst coverage corner out of 123 qualifiers last season. Nickel CB K\u2019Waun Williams missed the entire preseason recovering from a knee scope and allowed nearly-three quarters of the passes thrown his direction to be completed in 2018. The Niners wanted to upgrade on FS Jimmie Ward by chasing Earl Thomas in free agency but eventually came back around and re-signed Ward. The Niners need No. 2 pick Nick Bosa and trade pickup Dee Ford to get after quarterbacks if this secondary is gonna cut it. Winston is a top-six fantasy passer Week 1.\n\nStarts\n\nMatthew Stafford at Cardinals: After finishing 2017 as the overall QB7, Stafford\u2019s numbers fell off a cliff under first-year coach Matt Patricia last season. Stafford attempted just 10 fewer passes in total but saw his touchdown rate dip to a four-year low 3.8% and lost close to 750 yards off his 2017 total. The Lions played methodically on offense at the fourth-slowest pace under Patricia, and that doesn\u2019t seem all that likely to change under new OC Darrell Bevell, who was the Seahawks\u2019 play-caller during their Super Bowl window. Stafford tumbled all the way to QB19 a year ago. He\u2019s going to need to work some Russell Wilson-type magic with his TD rate to return fantasy numbers. But the Lions simply couldn\u2019t ask for a better Week 1 draw offensively. The Cardinals showed no semblance of a defense in the preseason. The Raiders did whatever they wanted on offense in the second exhibition, and Vikings Nos. 2 and 3 QBs Sean Mannion and Kyle Sloter did the same the following week. Arizona has been churning its defensive line all summer, looking for capable bodies, and now its secondary is in shambles. Patrick Peterson is suspended the first six games and No. 2 CB Robert Alford suffered a broken leg. The Cardinals are down to 31-year-old Tramaine Brock as their default No. 1 cover man. Behind him is second-round rookie Byron Murphy, who tested as a 33rd-percentile SPARQ athlete at the Combine. Then there is a trio of former UDFAs in Chris Jones, Kevin Peterson, and Charles Washington who combined to play a whopping zero defensive snaps in 2018. If not now for Stafford, then it\u2019s gonna be never for him this season. All the Lions\u2019 main offensive cogs are in play for this one, including Kerryon Johnson, Kenny Golladay, and Marvin Jones. If the Cardinals can\u2019t move the ball against Detroit\u2019s underrated defense, Stafford could have the ball in his hands quite a bit Sunday afternoon. More opportunities leads to more fantasy points.\n\nDak Prescott vs. Giants: Prescott was the overall QB13 in fantasy points per game a season ago, but following the acquisition of Amari Cooper in Week 9, Prescott was the overall QB6 and QB9 in points per game. He looked phenomenal this preseason, going 11-of-14 for 109 yards and a touchdown under first-year play-caller Kellen Moore. And that was without Cooper (foot) in the lineup all summer. Dallas is in one of the best Week 1 spots, at home against a Giants Defense that just doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of talent. The G-Men jettisoned their best pass rusher in Olivier Vernon as part of the Odell Beckham trade to Cleveland, lost CB Sam Beal (hamstring) to injured reserve, and let All Pro S Landon Collins leave as a free agent. Top CB Janoris Jenkins turns 31 next month and hasn\u2019t been an upper-echelon cover man since 2016. Opposite him is first-rounder Deandre Baker, who missed a chunk of camp with a knee ailment. Second-year UDFA Grant Haley will cover the slot. Last Week 2, Prescott attempted his fewest passes of the season (25) against the Giants but still posted 160 yards and a score with 45 yards rushing. DC James Bettcher runs a man-coverage scheme, which is vulnerable to quarterbacks who can run. The Giants coughed up the seventh-most rushing yards to QBs. And in Week 17, Prescott touched up this New York defense for 387 yards and four touchdowns on 44 attempts, his second most of the season, en route to a QB2 finish. Prescott now gets stud C Travis Frederick back after he missed all of 2018 with an autoimmune disease. With Moore calling the shots and putting his players in better position for success, Prescott should get off on the right foot in 2019. Dallas\u2019 implied total of 26.25 points is sixth-highest of Week 1.\n\nNick Foles vs. Chiefs: Foles started the final three regular-season games for the Eagles last season and was the overall QB10 in that window. He obviously gets a downgrade in terms of surrounding talent going from Philadelphia to Jacksonville, but he and new Jaguars OC John DeFilippo won the Super Bowl together with Philly in 2017. Foles should be familiar with the offense, and DeFilippo knows Foles\u2019 strengths after serving as his QBs coach two years back. Drawing the Chiefs at home in Week 1 is a plus spot for this offense to start hot. Kansas City was 29th in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks and 31st in opponent plays per game in 2018. No team faced more pass attempts. The Chiefs played at the sixth-quickest pace a year ago, and their overall efficiency leads to the opposing offense running a ton of plays. When the Jaguars and Chiefs met last Week 5, Jacksonville ran 83 offensive plays, their highest mark of the season. If nothing else, volume should be on Foles\u2019 side in this one. He\u2019ll also be protected by a now-healthy offensive line that gets LT Cam Robinson, LG Andrew Norwell, and C Brandon Linder all back from injuries that cost the trio a combined 25 games in 2018. Chiefs-Jaguars has a 51.5-point total, the second-highest of Week 1. Foles should be a lock for 30-plus attempts. That\u2019s more than enough to put him on the two-QB league radar and potentially into the top 12 for the week. He won\u2019t be ranked there, but Foles has a non-zero chance of finishing there.\n\nSits\n\nJared Goff at Panthers: The overall QB10 in fantasy points per game a year ago, Goff was dynamite in home games but struggled badly away from the L.A. Coliseum. Goff attempted five fewer passes per game on the road, saw his completion percentage drop from 68.3 at home to 60.8 away from it, and his yards per attempt was a full 1.5 yards worse. On top of that, Goff\u2019s passer rating was 116.7 in home efforts and 82.7 on the road. He tossed 22 touchdowns in home game and just 10 on the road for an average of 1.25 per contest. Goff\u2019s fantasy finishes in his eight road games, starting with Week 1, were QB15 > QB20 > QB26 > QB18 > QB2 > QB27 > QB39 > QB14. That QB2 game was the shootout at the fantasy-friendly Superdome with the Saints. And the QB39 day was the Rams\u2019 dreadful performance against the Bears. Goff is no better than a two-QB league play this week against a much-improved Carolina front that added DT Gerald McCoy and first-round EDGE Brian Burns. Goff\u2019s LT Andrew Whitworth openly contemplated retirement after the Super Bowl loss and turns 38 this year. New LG Joseph Noteboom and C Brian Allen combined to play 114 snaps as 2018 rookies with no starts. RG Austin Blythe was a 2018 liability in pass protection. I really don\u2019t like this spot for the Rams in the trenches on either side of the ball, particularly on offense. Carolina was 24th in pass-defense DVOA and 23rd in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks a year ago, but this team got better up front, which should help the secondary. I honestly don\u2019t hate running out the Panthers\u2019 defense as a Week 1 streaming option, especially in daily leagues.\n\nEditor's Note: Drafting is only half the battle.

Click here for more!\n\nKyler Murray vs. Lions: The No. 1 overall pick in April\u2019s draft has been drafted to start for most fantasy teams. I saw him going in the QB7 range in most drafts I was in over the summer. The preseason offered a mixed bag of results for Murray. The Raiders blew his doors off in the second exhibition, but Murray ended up completing two-thirds of his passes against the Vikings the following week. All preseason, coach Kliff Kingsbury ran a milquetoast offense with no creativity or pace. That\u2019s expected to change significantly when the games matter. My issue is whether the Arizona offensive line can give Murray time to make plays. This line projects to be one of the worst units in the league, and they open against a talented Lions front that includes newcomers DE Trey Flowers and DT Mike Daniels. The Lions were also No. 1 in opponent plays per game a year ago, so it\u2019s fair to wonder just how many plays the Cardinals are going to be able to fire off against this defense, especially when Arizona\u2019s defense has shown no hope in stopping opposing offenses. The Lions\u2019 offense operated at the fourth-slowest pace a season ago, so they could conceivably flat-out dominate time of possession Sunday. Arizona\u2019s implied team total of 22.5 points is middle of the road for Week 1. The under on that is very much in play. The good news is Murray\u2019s rushing ability should help his floor. I\u2019m treating him as a borderline QB1/2 rather than the mid-range QB1 and surefire starter he was drafted as this summer.\n\nSam Darnold vs. Bills: Darnold started his rookie season on fire with a lighting-up of the Lions in Week 1, then he injured his foot and missed four games, before then finally showing big-time growth Weeks 14-16 to close out the year. In that three-week span toward the end of 2018, Darnold was the overall QB6 and sliced up the Packers for 341 yards and three scores in the home finale. New coach Adam Gase is expected to install more no-huddle and pace to the offense, and Darnold had a glowing preseason, going 17-of-25 for 211 yards and a pair of scores with no picks. Unfortunately, Darnold is greeted with a brutal Week 1 draw. The Bills were No. 1 in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks and No. 2 in pass-defense DVOA a year ago. They faced the second-fewest pass attempts, behind only the Raiders. Darnold missed one of the two matchups with Buffalo last season. In Week 14, he was just 16-of-24 for 170 yards, one touchdown, and one interception at Buffalo. Darnold was the overall QB26 that week. Bills-Jets has a 41-point total, the second-lowest of Week 1.\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nStart of the Week: Matt Breida at Bucs: With Jerick McKinnon set to again miss the season following complications with his surgically-repaired knee, this Niners backfield has become much more clear. Beat writers have suggested a timeshare between Tevin Coleman and Breida. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess as to who will draw the \u201cstart,\u201d but both are certain to be involved on game day. And this spot looks incredibly juicy for both backs. Coleman and Breida are very much on the RB2/3 map and come with loads of upside in a game many will be stacking. The 49.5-point total for Niners-Bucs is the fourth-highest of the week and features a pair of offenses that were top-10 in pace last season. This game is also currently a pick\u2019em, suggesting things could go back and forth with each offense throwing haymakers. San Francisco RBs averaged a shade over 26 touches per game in 2018. If Breida can handle 12-14 against the Bucs, that could be enough to net him a top-25 finish for the week. The Bucs were flat-out dreadful against running backs a year ago, hemorrhaging the fifth-most fantasy points to the position. Opposing runners averaged a crisp 4.56 yards per carry versus the Bucs, and only the Bills and Cardinals surrendered more touchdowns on the ground. Since then, Tampa has lost edge presence Jason Pierre-Paul (neck), NT Vita Vea (knee), and cut penetrating DT Gerald McCoy. The Niners return all five offensive line starters and graded out 10th in Football Outsiders\u2019 adjusted line yards created in the run game a year ago and third overall in second-level yards. The Niners and Bucs clashed last Week 12. Breida was in on just over 48% of the snaps that day en route to a 14-106-0 rushing line and 3-34 as a pass-catcher. He doesn\u2019t need to be a true lead dog to produce fantasy points.\n\nStarts\n\nAustin Ekeler vs. Colts: Melvin Gordon is dragging his holdout into the regular season after skipping all of training camp and the preseason. Beat writers have projected a \u201csplit\u201d between Ekeler and Justin Jackson in Gordon\u2019s absence, but if the preseason was any indication, Ekeler should handle roughly 60-65% of the workload. He also got most of the red-zone and scoring area reps with the starters during the summer. Ekeler can function as an early-down runner and is exceptional in the pass game. He has three-down traits. Many point to his rough stretch sans Gordon last year when Ekeler started three games in his place Weeks 7, 13-14. He drew two tough cards against the Titans and Steelers in that span and a third against the Bengals. But in those games, Ekeler dominated touches over Jackson. Ekeler had touch counts of 17 > 18 > 17 to Jackson\u2019s 3 > 9 > 9 in those three games. The coaches love Ekeler\u2019s all-around ability. And this spot sets up well for him to have success. The Chargers are seven-point home favorites over the Andrew Luck-less Colts. Jacoby Brissett might be better than most are giving him credit for, but the Chargers should still win this game. The LT Russell Okung-less offensive line is concerning for the Bolts, but Ekeler can still do damage in the short passing game where Philip Rivers thrives. The Colts surrendered the second-most catches to running backs a year ago. However is shakes out, Ekeler should flirt with 15-18 touches between carries and catches. That\u2019s more than enough to put him on the RB2 map and makes him a strong DFS option.\n\nLatavius Murray vs. Texans: Signed away from the Vikings to replace Mark Ingram as Alvin Kamara\u2019s big-back sidekick, Murray has entered a glorious situation. Coach Sean Payton doesn\u2019t want to put too much on Kamara\u2019s plate and prefers to keep him around 55% of the snaps. Ingram was in on 45% of the downs a year ago. If we plug Murray into Ingram\u2019s role, that comes with a strong enough snap share and 12.9 touches per game. Murray isn\u2019t given much credit for his pass-game chops, but he showed this preseason he can catch the ball. Kamara is still expected to get a ton of goal-line work, but Ingram also got his fair share. The Texans were No. 1 in run-defense DVOA and No. 5 in fantasy points allowed to running backs in 2018. But they traded away stud DE Jadeveon Clowney and let middle-field playmaker Tyrann Mathieu walk as a free agent. Brennan Scarlett is a special-teamer who is expected to play more on defense in Clowney\u2019s old spot, and Mathieu was replaced by centerfield-type FS Tashaun Gipson. This matchup isn\u2019t scary when we account for the Saints\u2019 offensive line being one of the best in the game. It returns four starters after finishing No. 2 in adjusted line yards created last season. Murray\u2019s gets a big upgrade in terms of his supporting cast. This game has the highest total of the week at 52.5 points, so we want pieces here. Murray is a cheap way to that on the Saints\u2019 side in DFS and makes for a strong RB2/FLEX play in season-long leagues.\n\nMiles Sanders vs. Redskins: Sanders was by all accounts the Eagles\u2019 best back this summer, and it wasn\u2019t particularly close. The second-round pick is someone the Eagles traded up for in April, and acting GM Howie Roseman described Sanders as someone Philly has been looking for for years in terms of a running-back talent. Sanders may not get the actual start against the Redskins, as that could go to veteran Jordan Howard or Darren Sproles, but there\u2019s no question Sanders should be pretty involved Sunday. Both he and Howard are in play in this spot as whopping 10-point home favorites against a Washington defense that was 28th in DVOA versus the run last season. Opposing backs averaged a healthy 4.56 yards per carry against the Skins. If we can project Sanders for 12 touches or more, that would be enough to put him on the FLEX map. The Eagles are going to put up points Sunday; the question is just who will be doing it, as individual touchdowns are the hardest thing to project in football. I\u2019m letting Sanders ride where I own him in season-long leagues. Philly\u2019s implied team total of 28 points is the week\u2019s third-best.\n\nSits\n\nJames White vs. Steelers: It was a tale of two halves of the season for White in 2018. Before the Week 11 bye, White was in on 60% of the snaps. After the bye, White played just 41.5% of the downs. Weeks 1-10, White was the overall RB8 in half-PPR leagues. From Week 12 on, White tumbled to the RB24. That\u2019s still serviceable RB2/FLEX status, but White got by on a career-best 12 touchdowns in 2018. He had never scored more than six in a season previously. The Steelers were No. 9 in fantasy points allowed to running backs last season and surrendered the second-fewest catches to the position. The pass game is where White is going to have to make his hay when Sony Michel and Damien Harris are both healthy, which they are entering Week 1. When these two teams faced last Week 15, White was in on 41.3% of the snaps and produced just 37 scoreless yards on seven touches. White\u2019s floor is the basement in this spot. Low volume is not what I\u2019m looking for Week 1 when there are no players on bye. White doesn\u2019t belong in fantasy lineups to start the season unless something changes.\n\nKalen Ballage vs. Ravens: The 2018 fourth-rounder wasn\u2019t drafted as a fantasy starter by many, if any, this summer, but he was the subject of a ton of offseason hype. Ballage opened camp with the starters and stuck there much of the summer as Kenyan Drake battled a foot injury. Drake is back and ready to roll for the opener and was listed as the starter on the unofficial Week 1 depth chart. Both backs are going to play, but Drake looks like the better back to own both this week and over the course of the season for the tanking Dolphins. Miami fields the league\u2019s worst offensive line by a long shot, especially after trading premier LT Laremy Tunsil last weekend. Ballage is the better bet for carries on early downs, but he\u2019s going to be slamming into brick walls all year. The Ravens also present maybe the toughest matchup after coming in at No. 6 in run-defense DVOA in 2018. Opposing backs averaged just 3.5 yards per carry versus Baltimore. Stud ILB C.J. Mosley left as a free agent, but lane-pluggers Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are the backbone of this run defense. Ballage is an easy fade in this spot with the Dolphins also implied at just 15.25 points, easily the lowest mark of Week 1.\n\nDerrius Guice at Eagles: Back after missing his entire rookie year to a torn ACL, which then required multiple corrective surgeries to combat an infection, Guice made his preseason debut in the third preseason game, rushing 11 times for 44 yards while catching his lone target for four yards. Guice was overall impressive in that exhibition, but he still didn\u2019t look like the Ezekiel Elliott-level player many compared him to coming out LSU. Adrian Peterson will likely draw the \u201cstart\u201d against the Eagles, but Guice is certain to be mixed in, along with pass-down specialist Chris Thompson. That\u2019s just too many bodies in an offense that projects to be one of the season\u2019s worst. On top of minimal talent, the Redskins also are going to be without stud LT Trent Williams for the foreseeable future as he continues his holdout. 36-year-old swinging gate Donald Penn will start in Williams\u2019 place, while mega-bust Ereck Flowers is the left guard. That\u2019s the worst left side of an offensive line outside of Miami. The Redskins are the biggest underdogs of the week, getting 10 points at Philly. It\u2019s not a script that figures to be favorable for Guice and Peterson as early-down workhorses who will be splitting the load. Guice is a mere RB4.\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nStart of the Week: Dede Westbrook vs. Chiefs: Westbrook was the talk of Jaguars camp among wideouts and seems to be the only one that had an overall consistent summer. Offensive coaches praised his route-running chops multiple times with OC John DeFilippo labeling Westbrook the \u201cbest he\u2019d ever seen\u201d in that area. In the Jaguars\u2019 third preseason contest, the lone game action Nick Foles saw in August, Westbrook was targeted on seven of Foles\u2019 10 pass attempts and produced a 4-29-1 line in a little over a quarter of work. Westbrook will man the slot for the Jaguars this season and settle in as Foles\u2019 safety blanket on high-percentage throws. Chiefs-Jaguars features a 51.5-point total, the second-highest of Week 1. The Chiefs were 31st in opponent plays per game in 2018, so the Jacksonville offense figures to see plenty of volume Sunday. When these two teams met last Week 5, the Jaguars ripped off 83 offensive plays, their highest mark of the season. This year\u2019s Jacksonville pass offense figures to go through Westbrook. He\u2019s a legitimate candidate for 110-plus targets while Chris Conley and D.J. Chark serve as outside lid-lifters on shot plays and sporadic volume. Westbrook will do battle with Kansas City slot CB Kendall Fuller in this one. Among qualified slot corners last season, Fuller yielded the most catches for the most yards and a 110.5 passer rating in his coverage. Only the Jets, Saints, and Eagles surrendered more catches than the Chiefs to opposing wideouts. Westbrook was a college dominator and is poised for a third-year lift-off.\n\nStarts\n\nMarvin Jones at Cardinals: When he went down with a knee injury following Week 10 last season, Jones was the current WR26 at the time. In that span, Jones commanded 18.7% of the target share in Detroit, averaging 6.9 targets per game. While Jones was targeted 62 times Weeks 1-10, teammate Kenny Golladay saw 61 looks. This Detroit offense projects to be pretty narrow again this season; for the most part, we know who is going to get the football, and that\u2019s going to predominantly be Kerryon Johnson, Jones, and Golladay. The Cardinals have the sorriest group of cornerbacks in football right now with Patrick Peterson suspended the first six games and No. 2 CB Robert Alford out indefinitely with a broken leg. That leaves 31-year-old journeyman Tramaine Brock as the de facto top cover man and second-round rookie Byron Murphy opposite him. Murphy tested relatively poorly in the pre-draft process as a 33rd-percentile SPARQ athlete. Behind them is a trio of former undrafted free agents in Chris Jones, Kevin Peterson, and Charles Washington. The three combined for a whopping zero defensive snaps a season ago. If the Cardinals play fast offensively and run into problems sustaining drives behind a Swiss-cheese offensive line, the Lions could have the ball a ton Sunday. The core four Lions of Matthew Stafford, Johnson, Jones, and Golladay are all in play this weekend. Detroit\u2019s implied team total of 25 points is 11th-highest of the 32 teams in action.\n\nMichael Gallup vs. Giants: As a rookie, Gallup commanded just 12.9% of the Cowboys\u2019 targets, but his game went to another level when Amari Cooper came to town. From Week 9 forward, Gallup had four 50-plus-yard games and drew four-plus targets in 7-of-9 games. Gallup could have had a much bigger season if Dak Prescott wouldn\u2019t have missed him on a number of deep shots where Gallup separated from the defense. Gallup has been talked up as a year-two breakout candidate and draws a juicy Week 1 date with a Giants Defense that already lost CB Sam Beal (hamstring) to injured reserve. With Janoris Jenkins likely to see a lot of Cooper, Gallup should draw first-round rookie CB Deandre Baker plenty Sunday afternoon. Baker missed a chunk of training camp with a knee issue. Gallup had a 3-50 afternoon with a two-point conversion on six targets in the season finale against the Giants last year. Dallas\u2019 implied team total of 26.25 points is sixth-highest on the week. Gallup is in play as a WR3/4 for season-long leagues and a cheap option in daily formats. Gallup is just $5,600 on FanDuel.\n\nMarquise Goodwin at Bucs: This is a deep-dive season-long play and potential tournament option on daily sites. But Goodwin has been the constant among Niners\u2019 receivers all summer. He ran with the first-team offense all preseason. And while coach Kyle Shanahan was prodding sophomore Dante Pettis via the media, Goodwin was just going about his work on the outside. One of the fastest men in the sport, Goodwin is enticing in this Niners-Bucs game with a 49.5-point total that is frankly too low. The game has shootout written all over it. Neither team has a strong secondary, and the Bucs have a bottom-five cornerback group. Goodwin is likely to draw plenty of former first-round bust CB Vernon Hargreaves\u2019 coverage Sunday. Hargreaves tore his labrum in his shoulder last season opener and missed the remainder of the year. All Goodwin has to do is get loose behind the defense for a big play, and anything else on top is gravy. Goodwin has been healthy for six games with Jimmy Garoppolo in San Francisco. Goodwin\u2019s receiving lines in those games, starting with the most recent: 3-30-1 > 2-28-1 > 3-37 > 10-114 > 6-106 > 8-99. Goodwin was targeted a total of 47 times in those five games. The two have a good rapport. The Niners have obviously added talent to the position since those days, namely with Pettis and Deebo Samuel, but Goodwin will have a role until Pettis and/or Samuel earn theirs. Goodwin is a good bet to lead the 49ers\u2019 wideouts in snaps Sunday. He\u2019s dirt cheap on daily sites and likely sitting on the waiver wire in many season-long leagues.\n\nSits\n\nCorey Davis at Browns: Davis was targeted on a robust 25.6% of the Titans\u2019 passes last season. Considering that, his 65-891-4 line was a massive disappointment. A lot of the blame obviously doesn\u2019t go on him considering the Titans\u2019 quarterback play, but he still underachieved. And now the Titans have added a healthy Delanie Walker (ankle) back to the team after he went down last Week 1, signed Adam Humphries to play the slot, and drafted A.J. Brown to compete with Tajae Sharpe for snaps. That\u2019s far more competition than Davis had to deal with a year ago, and yet the quarterback situation remains largely the same with consistently inconsistent Marcus Mariota dispensing the rock. Late last year the Titans also altered their offensive game plan and leaned heavily on Derrick Henry. That\u2019s the plan for 2019 if all goes as planned. Coupled with all of those factors working against Davis is he\u2019ll be matched up with CB Denzel Ward Sunday. Ward was Pro Football Focus\u2019 No. 7 cover corner out 123 qualifiers as a rookie. Davis has an extremely low floor in this spot between two of the lower play-volume offenses.\n\nChristian Kirk vs. Lions: The Cardinals kept things extremely vanilla in the preseason, opting not to show their hand with new coach Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offense. They played slowly and deliberately in August, but that\u2019s not what the plan is when the games count starting this Sunday. The problem is we just don\u2019t have much of an idea of what to expect when it comes to Arizona\u2019s wideout rotation. Kingsbury kept seven receivers on the 53-man roster. He\u2019s expected to use plenty of four-wide sets, which will include two slot receivers, and play way up-tempo. During the preseason, Kingsbury rotated all of his receivers through with the first-team offense, and that led to Kirk playing under 50% of the snaps with Kyler Murray\u2019s group. Expect that to change starting this week, but I would just prefer to have a better idea of what things are going to look like before running Kirk out there as a WR3 in season-long lineups. On top of the uncertainty, this isn\u2019t even a great matchup on paper. The Lions were No. 1 in opponent plays per game a season ago, and Detroit\u2019s offense played at the fourth-slowest pace. That\u2019s a good way to keep other teams off the field. Arizona\u2019s offensive line also has the makings of being one of the two- or three-worst units in football. It\u2019s unclear if the Cardinals are going to be able to sustain drives against a strong defensive front that features free-agent pickups DE Trey Flowers and DT Mike Daniels to go with NT Damon Harrison and DE Da\u2019Shawn Hand. I\u2019d be taking a wait-and-see approach with Kirk if I have other candidates to run out there as a WR3/FLEX option.\n\nMike Williams vs. Colts: A popular year-three breakout candidate, Williams is someone I certainly like over the long haul of 2019. But I think he could start slow in this home-opener spot. While Keenan Allen works against slot CB Kenny Moore inside, the expectation is Williams will see plenty of Pierre Desir and Quincy Wilson on the outside. Both have the size to compete with Williams (6\u20194/218). Desir stands 6\u20191/211, and Wilson is similarly-big at 6\u20191/198. Desir was Pro Football Focus\u2019 No. 21 cover corner out of 123 qualifiers last season. And the Colts as a whole did a great job limiting big plays and receiver production. Only the Jaguars and Vikings allowed fewer fantasy points to wideouts. Indy surrendered the fifth-fewest completions of 20-plus yards and second-fewest of 40-plus yards. The Chargers are also seven-point home favorites and could lean more on their running game in the second half if things go as planned for them. Williams is fine to roll out there in season-long leagues, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to play a comparable WR3 over him. Williams is unlikely to see heavy volume behind Allen and Hunter Henry, while Austin Ekeler is also no slouch in the short passing game.\n\nTIGHT END\n\nStart of the Week: Jared Cook vs. Texans: Coming over as a free agent following a career year in Oakland that saw Cook set single-season bests in targets (101), catches (68), yards (896), and touchdowns (6), Cook has ingrained himself as a go-to option for Drew Brees. Cook dazzled at training camp all summer and is enjoying a late-career resurgence after escaping Jeff Fisher. By most accounts, Cook has emerged as the Saints\u2019 No. 3 pass-game option behind Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara. He gives coach Sean Payton and athlete at the position the Saints have been missing since Jimmy Graham\u2019s heyday. A season ago, the Texans surrendered the third-most catches, second-most yards, third-most touchdowns, and second-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. And they\u2019ve also lost ballhawking S Tyrann Mathieu, who left as a free agent. Texans-Saints sports the week\u2019s highest total at 52.5 points.\n\nStarts\n\nVance McDonald at Patriots: McDonald was one of the most hyped tight ends of the summer. The Steelers lost a boatload of targets off last year\u2019s team with the ousting of Antonio Brown and free-agent exit of Jesse James. Steelers OC Randy Fichtner tried to throw cold water on McDonald\u2019s potential breakout by saying McDonald playing a full game is \u201cnever going to happen.\u201d But we really don\u2019t need that kind of snap share from McDonald for him to build on his 50-610-4 line from 2018. McDonald was in on just under 55% of the downs last season. If he can push 70% this year, the sky's the limit for McDonald as a receiver. And if we\u2019re to read into preseason usage, that\u2019s realistic for McDonald after he played nearly every snap while the first-team offense was on the field. Xavier Grimble didn\u2019t impress in practices, according to beat reporters, and he\u2019s expected to be a mere blocker even when he does play. At tight end, we want guys on the field playing in strong offenses with not a lot of competition for looks ahead of them. McDonald fits that billing and faces a Patriots team that was middle of the pack in fantasy points allowed to tight ends a year ago, coming in at No. 18. Only 14 teams allowed more yards to the position. Patrick Chung was Pro Football Focus\u2019 No. 12 cover safety a year ago and missed the bulk of the offseason recovering from shoulder surgery before then dealing with cocaine possession charges. McDonald caught a touchdown last Week 15 vs. New England.\n\nMark Andrews at Dolphins: Lamar Jackson took over under center for good last Week 11. In eight games with Jackson, Andrews was targeted on 13.4% of the throws and drew a team-high seven looks in the playoff loss. Andrews showed a knack for the big play and drew raves in training camp this summer as one of the best players on the field. His playing time is a bit of an issue because the Ravens use three tight ends pretty heavily, including blocker Nick Boyle and former first-rounder Hayden Hurst. But Andrews and Jackson have a legit connection. The Dolphins figure to bleed points all season. This defense has so pass rush whatsoever. Miami surrendered the third-most touchdowns to tight ends in 2018. It\u2019s hard to find serviceable tight ends outside of the big names at the position, but Andrews should flirt with backend TE1 stats.\n\nDelanie Walker at Browns: Walker broke his ankle and tore some ligaments in the season opener against the Dolphins a year ago. Prior to his injury, he was targeted seven times in that game and produced a 4-52 line. He\u2019s long been Marcus Mariota\u2019s safety valve. Walker has made a flawless recovery and is ready to roll for his age-35 campaign. He\u2019s surpassed 100 targets each of his last four healthy seasons. Last season, the Browns allowed the second-most catches, eighth-most yards, and seventh-most fantasy points to tight ends. That was under old DC Gregg Williams. New DC Steve Wilks\u2019 Cardinals were great against tight ends last year, but Walker\u2019s snap share and Mariota\u2019s trust in him over the middle certainly put him on the TE1 map. He\u2019s someone Mariota routinely looks to in the red zone.\n\nSits\n\nDavid Njoku vs. Titans: Njoku averaged just 4.6 targets per game the final seven weeks last season after Freddie Kitchens took over play-calling duties. With Hue Jackson at the helm Weeks 1-9, Njoku was targeted 6.2 times per game and that included a zero-target week. With Odell Beckham now in town to command the biggest piece of the pie, Njoku could have a tough time returning to that six-plus targets per week volume. He\u2019s got touchdown-or-bust written all over him, especially in a matchup with Titans All Pro S Kevin Byard over the middle of the field and down the seams. Tennessee kept opposing tight ends in check in 2018, allowing the second-fewest fantasy points and seventh-fewest yards to the position. The Titans also play at a molasses-slow offensive pace, limiting the amount of plays for the opposing offense.\n\nKyle Rudolph vs. Falcons: Rudolph\u2019s targets last season (82) remained in line with his 2017 number (81), but his touchdown total was cut in half from eight to four. He finished as the mere TE12 in fantasy points per game among tight ends who played at least 10 contests. Rudolph will never again see the 132 targets he drew in 2016. And with second-round rookie Irv Smith also now in the picture at tight end with the Vikings, there\u2019s reason to believe Rudolph\u2019s targets will actually go down than up. Rudolph may be tasked with even more blocking duties to help out a still-weak offensive line, while Smith flares out in space essentially as the No. 3 receiver. The Vikings project to be one of the heaviest users of 12 and 13 personnel, featuring two and three tight ends at a time. Owners who play Rudolph are always on their own with this one; if he catches a touchdown, he\u2019s fine, but the floor is scary-low for Rudolph.\n\nEric Ebron at Chargers: Teammate Jack Doyle appeared in six games for the Colts last season. In those six games, Ebron played just 40.3% of the snaps, which is a severe downgrade from Ebron\u2019s season total of 56.5% of the downs. Ebron\u2019s receiving lines in those six games were, starting with the most recent, 5-45-2 > 0-0 > 3-69-2 > 3-37-1 > 3-26-1 > 4-51-1. Ebron\u2019s touchdown rate of 18.9% last season was out of this world. It\u2019s going to be nearly impossible to replicate that, especially with Jacoby Brissett now the full-time quarterback, return of Doyle to the lineup, and additions of Devin Funchess and rookie Parris Campbell. Ebron was an easy fade in fantasy drafts this summer. The Chargers suffocated tight ends in 2018, but they did lose stud S Derwin James to a broken foot that will keep him out the first half of this season. That\u2019s a feather in Ebron\u2019s cap, but the snap uncertainty, downgrade at quarterback, and more competition for targets leaves me off him for fantasy purposes until further notice.", "description": "Nick Mensio dives into the matchups and highlights some of his favorite starts and sits for Week 1.
