According to People, the two will tie the knot at Belcourt of Newport, one of the lesser-known \u201csummer cottages\u201d that have dotted the Rhode Island coast since the Gilded Age. Belcourt of Newport stayed family-owned longer than many of the other Newport mansions, in part by hosting buckwild parties as it fell into ruin. One such fete was a \u201cNo Underwear Allowed\u201d party, where female guests had to stand over a mirror to prove they were following the dress code. The estate also held ghost tours.\n\nWhen Belcourt Castle was bought by New Age jeweler to the stars Carolyn Rafaelian, she worked diligently to bust any and all ghosts from the premises. \u201cThere were energies and entities, some not pleasant. I had a shaman perform ceremonies. We did a major cleansing, energy-wise,\u201d Rafaelian told the New York Times in 2013. \u201cThere was a lot of heaviness, but we took care of that. Now the house has a different vibration.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, about 150 people will be partaking of Rafaelian\u2019s hard-won good vibes this weekend. A menu obtained by the site says guests will enjoy such delicacies as brussel sprouts with cured egg yolk, smoked pork belly with pickled apple, wood-roasted fish, heirloom roast carrots, and something called a \u201ccauldron fritter.\u201d S\u2019mores will also be available for dessert, for those looking for a less spooky subtlety.", "description": "Everything we know about Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s wedding to Cooke Maroney: It\u2019s in Rhode Island, reportedly at Belcourt Castle.
