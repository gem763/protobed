At this point, illnesses have occurred in almost every state.\n\nThe confirmed deaths include two in California, two in Kansas, and one each in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri and Oregon. The Mississippi death was announced by officials in that state Thursday.\n\nOver the summer, health officials in a few states began noticing reports of people developing severe breathing illnesses, with the lungs apparently reacting to a caustic substance. The only common factor in the illnesses was that the patients had all recently vaped.\n\nAs a national investigation started and broadened, reports have increased dramatically.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many of the 275 added cases occurred in the last week, and how many are being logged long after they happened. The CDC has not released details on when symptoms began in each case.\n\nThe agency\u2019s count includes only illnesses that have met certain criteria. Other illnesses are also being investigated.\n\nMost patients have said they vaped products containing THC, the ingredient that produces a high in marijuana. The investigation has been increasingly focused on products containing THC, with some attention on ingredients added to marijuana oil.\n\nBut some patients have said they vaped only nicotine. Currently, health officials are advising people not to use any vaping product until the cause is better understood.", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the latest numbers are up 52% from last week.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS091_Vaping_ZG_20190926064857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
