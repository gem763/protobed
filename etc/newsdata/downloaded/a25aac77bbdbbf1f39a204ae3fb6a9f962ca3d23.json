More than \u00a31 billion has just been spent on a massive revamp of the airport, which is now unlike any other on the planet. Changi has decided to bring the jungle of South-East Asia into the terminals.\n\nThe result is the Jewel, a new landside central area of tropical foliage with the thickest jungle in a section beneath a high glass dome referred to as Shiseido Forest Valley. This is spread over five floors and contains 3,000 trees, 100,000 shrubs and an abundance of orchids.\n\nThere are 220 species of plants flourishing in an atmosphere cleverly maintained at constant a temperature of 23c and humidity of 65 per cent. Forget stale, stuffy lounges, a whole new ecosystem seems to have sprung up.\n\nTree and easy: The Jewel is a new landside central area of tropical foliage with the thickest jungle in a section beneath a high glass dome referred to as Shiseido Forest Valley\n\nIt is all part of Changi\u2019s strategy to wrest away passengers from the likes of Dubai, Doha, Bangkok and Hong Kong in the lucrative \u2018stopover\u2019 market, where planes land to refuel and passengers take a break on long trips across the globe, often heading Down Under.\n\nChangi already attracts 65 million passengers a year on 100 airlines at a rate of more than 7,400 arrivals and departures a week, and it wants more. But do all the fronds and butterflies \u2014 yes, real butterflies \u2014 work?\n\nInto the jungle\n\nFirst port of call is Shiseido Forest Valley. After my long flight from the UK and a night in the airport\u2019s Crowne Plaza, I go to the green heart of the place to find a quiet space surrounded by dense undergrowth. The first feeble rays of sunshine light up a lofty canopy. A butterfly drifts off into a plume of mist and is that the throaty warble of a bird of paradise greeting the murmurings of dawn?\n\nNo sign of a WHSmith. It feels more likely that you\u2019ll meet a Japanese soldier left over from World War II or Dr Livingstone than a newspaper vendor or burger-flipper.\n\nThe world\u2019s tallest indoor waterfall\n\nUp ahead through the trees, a ghostly shimmering and pulsing tube of water arises like some giant extraterrestrial emanation. The noise of gushing water gets louder and there it is: the Vortex (officially the HSBC Rain Vortex). This is a striking waterfall in which the water cascades from an oculus at the top of a 130 ft high concave glass tube.\n\nIt is the world\u2019s tallest indoor waterfall, pumping 500,000 litres of rainwater from bottom to top. This most recent project, opened in June, has created a whole new world under glass.\n\nChangi is now far removed from the fishing village it was until 1981, when the airport opened.\n\nThe airport has become a tourist attraction in its own right with its myriad retail outlets and vast food halls attracting locals on short staycations\n\nTarzan vines and rubber trees\n\nFurther on, there are Tarzan vines, little waterfalls and rubber trees. This is a place to breathe in the oxygenated air and admire the giant orchids. It is simply baffling to consider that the runways of one of the world\u2019s biggest airports are little more than a stone\u2019s throw away: a flight every 80 seconds.\n\nStillness and silence, not the faintest breath of air. But then, from beyond a silky bamboo thicket and tumbling bougainvillea, comes a rumble of falling water. This is bizarre.\n\nBirdsong and butterflies\n\n\u2018The concept was really the Garden of Eden,\u2019 says Moshe Safdie, the architect behind the Jewel. \u2018Concepts can be quickly dated and people can get bored so we came up with something timeless. A living space.\u2019\n\nIt is a fascinating place and I spend two days roaming around Changi, hopping on the skytrain or walking between terminals, via Jewel, to check out the birdsong garden where you can listen to the Greater Racket doing just that.\n\nOr visit the butterfly garden where an extravagant collection feed off sliced pineapple in their very own paradise.\n\nNature trails\n\nA walk through the intimate depths of the forest along one of two \u2018trails\u2019 that snake from the bottom of the crater to the top level is a good way to loosen muscles after a flight.\n\nThis top section is known as the Canopy Park. If the term is a little overblown to describe a cunningly disguised series of stairs and terraces, no matter.\n\nWalk in the shade of lataniers and ficus, while admiring flowerbeds of arums, taros or ferns. It is a curious triumph of endeavour over practicality. The plants came from China, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and the United States.\n\n\u2018Most have spent four years in our nursery to get used to the air conditioning,\u2019 says Khaja Nazimudden, the head horticulturist who has a team of 30 gardeners.\n\nChangi continues in the tradition of Singapore, the garden-city state where there are 18 nature reserves. Such is the devotion to greenery that vertical gardens, planted on walls and the sides of buildings, are springing up all over.\n\nJolly J-apes: Topiary orang-utans are a big distraction\n\nTourist attraction\n\nMany thousands of Singaporeans have already visited the tropical gardens of the Jewel just to be here. The airport has become a tourist attraction in its own right with its myriad retail outlets and vast food halls attracting locals on short staycations. Conspicuous consumption? Yes, there is plenty of that: 155 shops altogether and 105 dining options.\n\nBest for families\n\nAs well as the nature trails, attractions for children include an area where mist is sprayed and an elevated area of netting for clambering about and bouncing in. There are also mazes, slides and a high-level canopy bridge.\n\nTickets are required for some of these ranging in price from \u00a33 for the slides to \u00a312 for the netting, and details are online (see below).\n\nThe verdict\n\nThis year, for the seventh consecutive year, Changi has won the prestigious Skytrax World\u2019s Best Airport award.\n\nThe former swamp that was also once a Japanese prisoner of war camp from 1942-45 has come a long way.\n\nFrom a jungle, back into a jungle, Changi has gone full circle. I\u2019ve never liked airports but this one is a headturner.", "description": "More than \u00a31 billion has just been spent on a massive revamp of Changi Airport in Singapore, which is now unlike any other on the planet, writes the Daily Mail's Mark Porter.", "authors": ["Mark Porter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/09/19327634-0-image-a-9_1570263975594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
