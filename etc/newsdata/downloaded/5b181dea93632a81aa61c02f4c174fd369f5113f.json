It\u2019s so solved even though a vast majority of voters in awards groups are men. It\u2019s so solved even though actresses have absolutely no shortage of important and fascinating things to say about the way gender inequities persist in the industry.\u201d\n\nMelissa Silverstein, the publisher of the site Women and Hollywood agreed, noting that in prize categories that are nongendered, like director, producer and cinematographer, very few women are recognized. In 2017 , Steve Pond of The Wrap found that in fields where acting awards divided by gender were scrapped, men indeed disproportionately bagged more nominations and wins. At the gender-neutral awards handed out by the Television Critics Association, Pond determined that over two decades, men won the individual drama and comedy acting awards seven times out of 10.\n\nBut Dillon and other nonbinary actors argue that gendered categories give the false appearance that prime roles for women are far more prevalent than they actually are. If the best actress category was axed and the vast majority of the nominations went to cisgendered men, Dillon said, \u201cWe would have to deal with the inequality that still is in Hollywood and always has been when it comes to gender as well as race.\u201d", "description": "Asia Kate Dillon of \u201cBillions\u201d is calling on the Television Academy to scrap gendered categories.
