Struggling to make an analogy, Colbert finally concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s like that. That is only that. Nothing else is like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Donald Trump not know what 9/11 is?\u201d Colbert asked in disbelief before cutting to the infamous clip of Trump referring to the \u201c7/11\u201d attacks. \u201cAh, 7/11, way to use the old Slurpee, sir.\u201d\n\nOf course, when Trump announced the existence of the meeting he simultaneously revealed that he had canceled it, tweeting, \u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, the Taliban?\u201d Colbert responded.\n\nFrom there, the host went on to note that Trump \u201cwanted the praise for a diplomatic achievement that he didn\u2019t achieve,\u201d adding, \u201cClearly he\u2019s a shoo-in for the Nobel Participation Prize.\u201d", "description": "\u201cDoes Donald Trump not know what 9/11 is?\u201d the \u201cLate Show\u201d host wondered.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1422,w_2528,x_103,y_17/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568091032/SC_1_qhbakr", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
