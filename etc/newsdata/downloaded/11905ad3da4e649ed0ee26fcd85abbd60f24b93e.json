It was a very difficult time in South Africa, so to be a little girl and push yourself in this type of dancing, where there are no other black girls, was really tough.\u2019\n\nShe said she had a difficult childhood (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe added: \u2018And when we did get the chance to learn the waltz and the cha cha cha, at a weekend club, we were soon better than the teacher.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the duo have managed to come through their darker days and can now be found spinning around the ballroom on the BBC show.\n\nJust last week, Motsi was left in tears following Paralympian Will Bayley and his pro partner Janette Manrara\u2019s routine.\n\nHowever, it looks as though they won\u2019t need the tissues tonight, as the star pulled out of this week after medical advice.\n\nClaudia Winkleman made the announcement at the beginning of the live show, revealing that he had injured himself in rehearsals.\n\nThe dancer cried over Will\u2019s performance last week (Picture: PA)\n\nThe 31-year-old table tennis player who won gold at the Rio 2016 Paralympics, was born with arthrogryposis \u2013 a condition which causes curved joints affecting all four of his limbs.\n\nHe was later diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, aged seven, and was treated at Great Ormond Street Children\u2019s hospital who helped him through rehabilitation.\n\nTaking to Twitter ahead of the show, he wrote: \u2018Hi everyone, I am absolutely gutted I cannot be performing tonight on strictly with Janette, sadly I\u2019m injured and not fit to dance.\n\n\u2018I hope to be back on the dance floor next week. Good luck to everyone tonight. Thanks for all your messages guys, I\u2019ll be back!!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanette later told Claudia: \u2018Things happen and we will move forward and be back.\u2019\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues Sunday night on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
