Wool is just as cruel as fur. Go wool-free this winter.\"\n\nThat's from a Peta advert which ran on the sides of buses in February - and has been banned for being \"misleading\".\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 10 complaints which said sheep shearing was vital for sheep's' health so couldn't be compared to fur.\n\nThe ASA ruled the UK's safety rules around sheep prevented cruelty so Peta's claims were incorrect.\n\nWhat do Peta claim?\n\nPeta says the animal abuse that happens in the fur industry also happens in the wool industry - but it isn't as well known by the public.\n\nIn its evidence to the ASA, Peta provided comparisons between cruelty in both the fur and wool industry.\n\nThey claimed in the fur industry - animals were grown to be overweight so their skins would be bigger and fetch more money.\n\nThey say in the wool industry there's genetic manipulation to increase the amount of wool available - causing sheep to be sheared more often.\n\nThey also stated that in both industries, many animals died far short of their natural life expectancy. Peta say sheep normally live to around 15 years of age - but in the wool trade, they are commonly killed between four and eight years old.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Peta says the wool industry causes animals pain and suffering\n\nBut the ASA disagree.\n\nThey say it's inaccurate to directly compare the two industries in the \"factual\" way that Peta did - with the \"wool is just as cruel as fur\" claim.\n\nThe ASA say in the UK, there are \"specific\" laws for sheep shearing and preserving animal welfare, such as ensuring that sheep's skin is not cut, meaning that method of getting wool would not be regarded as cruel.\n\nIn its ruling, it added that sheep were not killed for their wool as animals were in the fur industry, and there were \"standards in place\" for their general welfare.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When a vegan met a sheep farmer...\n\nIn response, Peta's Director Elisa Allen described the decision by the ASA as \"confusing and disappointing\".\n\nShe added: \"Nevertheless, we'll continue to urge decent people to steer clear of wool, and we have plans to run a modified version of the ad in numerous cities this winter.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The Advertising Standards Authority has banned an advert by Peta which compared fur and wool.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E1D3/production/_108611875_gettyimages-1074475292.jpg"}
