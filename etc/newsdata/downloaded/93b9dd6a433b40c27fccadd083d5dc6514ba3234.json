Look no further than your significant other. Sam Asghari has found his swolemate in his girlfriend, pop star Britney Spears, and they have so much fun working out that he thinks more couples should hit the gym together.\n\n\n\nSpears often shares clips of their shared workouts to social media, and Asghari, who works as a fitness trainer, believes it has been good for their relationship.\n\n\"I think couples should definitely work out together,\" he said during a recent interview on The Doctors. \"I think it\u2019s great, I think it\u2019s fun. You can inspire each other... She inspires me on a daily basis when she works out.\"\n\nHe went on to say that his nickname for her is \"Lioness,\" explaining that he has always hugely admired the strong women in his life: \"If you guys watch the Geography channel, I watch it all the time. The female lion inspires the male lion all the time... The female lion, I give props to you guys. I have three sisters, and so they inspired me. I was raised by women, and I think you guys are amazing, so that\u2019s where that came from. The lioness is a strong, strong animal and yeah, that\u2019s it.\"\n\nAsghari makes a good point about working out with your partner: after all, a gym buddy has to be reliable, know your strengths and weaknesses, and be someone you can trust. They also need to be able to support and encourage you \u2014 all qualities that you will ideally have found in your significant other.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"I think couples should definitely work out together,\" says trainer Sam Asghari.", "authors": ["Philip Ellis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zxVOLROblkbupKYpcgieFw--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_mens_health_171/20e249b440e14bfd32ab81a1d6010a56", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
