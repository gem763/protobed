The new research shows that some 150 million people are now living on land that will be below the high-tide line by midcentury.\n\nLand underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 20 MILES CAMBODIA CAMBODIA Ho Chi Minh City Ho Chi Minh City VIETNAM VIETNAM South China Sea South China Sea Populated area Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 20 MILES CAMBODIA Ho Chi Minh City VIETNAM South China Sea New projection for 2050 CAMBODIA Ho Chi Minh City VIETNAM South China Sea Land underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 20 MILES CAMBODIA CAMBODIA Ho Chi Minh City Ho Chi Minh City VIETNAM VIETNAM South China Sea South China Sea\n\nSouthern Vietnam could all but disappear.\n\nThe first map shows earlier expectations of submerged land by 2050. But the new outlook, the second map, indicates that the bottom part of the country will be underwater at high tide.\n\nMore than 20 million people in Vietnam, almost one-quarter of the population, live on land that will be inundated.\n\nMuch of Ho Chi Minh City, the nation\u2019s economic center, would disappear with it, according to the research, which was produced by Climate Central, a science organization based in New Jersey, and published in the journal Nature Communications. The projections don\u2019t account for future population growth or land lost to coastal erosion.\n\nLand underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 20 MILES THAILAND THAILAND Bangkok Bangkok Gulf of Thailand Gulf of Thailand Populated area Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 20 MILES THAILAND Bangkok Gulf of Thailand New projection for 2050 THAILAND Bangkok Gulf of Thailand Land underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 20 MILES THAILAND THAILAND Bangkok Bangkok Gulf of Thailand Gulf of Thailand\n\nStandard elevation measurements using satellites struggle to differentiate the true ground level from the tops of trees or buildings, said Scott A. Kulp, a researcher at Climate Central and one of the paper\u2019s authors. So he and Benjamin Strauss, Climate Central\u2019s chief executive, used artificial intelligence to determine the error rate and correct for it.\n\nIn Thailand, more than 10 percent of citizens now live on land that is likely to be inundated by 2050, compared with just 1 percent according to the earlier technique. The political and commercial capital, Bangkok, is particularly imperiled.\n\nClimate change will put pressure on cities in multiple ways, said Loretta Hieber Girardet, a Bangkok resident and United Nations disaster risk-reduction official. Even as global warming floods more places, it will also push poor farmers off the land to seek work in cities.\n\n\u201cIt is a dire formula,\u201d she said.\n\nLand underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 CHINA CHINA Shanghai Shanghai East China Sea East China Sea 20 MILES Populated area Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 CHINA Shanghai East China Sea 20 MILES New projection for 2050 CHINA Shanghai East China Sea Land underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 CHINA CHINA Shanghai Shanghai East China Sea East China Sea 20 MILES\n\nIn Shanghai, one of Asia\u2019s most important economic engines, water threatens to consume the heart of the city and many other cities around it.\n\nThe findings don\u2019t have to spell the end of those areas. The new data shows that 110 million people already live in places that are below the high tide line, which Mr. Strauss attributes to protective measures like seawalls and other barriers. Cities must invest vastly greater sums in such defenses, Mr. Strauss said, and they must do it quickly.\n\nBut even if that investment happens, defensive measures can go only so far. Mr. Strauss offered the example of New Orleans, a city below sea level that was devastated in 2005 when its extensive levees and other protections failed during Hurricane Katrina. \u201cHow deep a bowl do we want to live in\u201d? he asked.\n\nBuildings Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 INDIA INDIA Mumbai Mumbai Arabian Sea Arabian Sea 5 MILES Buildings Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 INDIA Mumbai Arabian Sea 5 MILES New projection for 2050 INDIA Mumbai Arabian Sea Buildings Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 INDIA INDIA Mumbai Mumbai Arabian Sea Arabian Sea 5 MILES\n\nThe new projections suggest that much of Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital and one of the largest cities in the world, is at risk of being wiped out. Built on what was once a series of islands, the city\u2019s historic downtown core is particularly vulnerable.\n\nOver all, the research shows that countries should start preparing now for more citizens to relocate internally, according to Dina Ionesco of the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental group that coordinates action on migrants and development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to ring the alarm bells,\u201d Ms. Ionesco said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s coming.\u201d There is little modern precedent for this scale of population movement, she added.\n\nLand underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 Mediterranean Sea Mediterranean Sea Alexandria Alexandria EGYPT EGYPT 10 MILES Populated area Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 Mediterranean Sea Alexandria EGYPT 10 MILES New projection for 2050 Mediterranean Sea Alexandria EGYPT Land underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 Mediterranean Sea Mediterranean Sea Alexandria Alexandria EGYPT EGYPT 10 MILES\n\nThe disappearance of cultural heritage could bring its own kind of devastation. Alexandria, Egypt, founded by Alexander the Great around 330 B.C., could be lost to rising waters.\n\nIn other places, the migration caused by rising seas could trigger or exacerbate regional conflicts.\n\nBasra, the second-largest city in Iraq, could be mostly underwater by 2050. If that happens, the effects could be felt well beyond Iraq\u2019s borders, according to John Castellaw, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general who was chief of staff for United States Central Command during the Iraq War.\n\nLand underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 IRAQ IRAN IRAQ IRAN Basra Basra Persian Gulf Persian Gulf KUWAIT KUWAIT 20 MILES Populated area Land underwater at high tide Old projection for 2050 IRAQ IRAN Basra Persian Gulf KUWAIT 20 MILES New projection for 2050 IRAQ IRAN Basra Persian Gulf KUWAIT Land underwater at high tide Populated area Old projection for 2050 New projection for 2050 IRAQ IRAN IRAQ IRAN Basra Basra Persian Gulf Persian Gulf KUWAIT KUWAIT 20 MILES\n\nFurther loss of land to rising waters there \u201cthreatens to drive further social and political instability in the region, which could reignite armed conflict and increase the likelihood of terrorism,\u201d said General Castellaw, who is now on the advisory board of the Center for Climate and Security, a research and advocacy group in Washington.\n\n\u201cSo this is far more than an environmental problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a humanitarian, security and possibly military problem too.\u201d", "description": "Scientists devised a better way to calculate land elevations and their findings are dire: Far more cities will be inundated by climate change than previously thought.", "authors": ["Denise Lu", "Christopher Flavelle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/us/coastal-cities-underwater-promo-1572323472312/coastal-cities-underwater-promo-1572323472312-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
