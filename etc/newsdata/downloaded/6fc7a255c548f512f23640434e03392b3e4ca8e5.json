It is definitely a difficult moment, but Ole hasn\u2019t got his team yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s had three players (signed), you need more than three to be the manager of your own team.\n\n\u2018We can build on something, I think. Ole just needs that opportunity to create the culture again.\u2019\n\nPhelan served under Sir Alex Ferguson, playing a crucial role in the club\u2019s 2008 Champions League success but admitted he was nervous about returning to Carrington following a five-year absence.\n\nHe added: \u2018I was down at Burnley College doing a coaching day and out on the pitch. About 3 o\u2019clock, I finish and turn my phone on.\n\n\u2018There is a call from Ole and another from Ed Woodward. Ole offered me the job and there was no real discussion. \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Going back into Carrington, I was really, really nervous. We\u2019d won the league by a canter when I left. But I didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n\n\u2018I had heard a lot of things in my time out about how it was operating. I just thought, \u2018I\u2019ll be myself.\u2019 And it was like I\u2019d never been away. Surreal. We just brought back a bit of a feelgood factor.\u2019\n\nMORE: The two reasons Manchester United expect to sign James Maddison from Leicester City\n\nMORE: Manchester United handed Jesse Lingard injury boost ahead of Partizan clash \u2013 but David de Gea misses training", "description": "Mike Phelan insists it was inevitable Manchester United's form would deteriorate under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer given how hard the pair worked the squad following their returns to the club.
