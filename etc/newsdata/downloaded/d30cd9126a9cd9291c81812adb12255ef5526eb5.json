I had it. I lost my balance. I had nothing left at the end. All my form went out of the window.\n\n\"I ran like an amateur, I cannot believe it, I came so close, this was such a good chance.\n\n\"My body feels good, I ran well through the heats. I let it go. I am sorry, I feel like I have let down so many people. So many people sent me messages. The team know I have been plagued with injuries.\n\n\"To not break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands.\"\n\nEarlier, Great Britain team-mate Dina Asher-Smith underlined her favourite tag by powering through to the 200m final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 23-year-old clocked 21.16 seconds - the fastest time of the night - to comfortably win her semi-final in Doha.\n\nAsher-Smith, who holds the British record in the 200m after her European Championships victory in Berlin last year, is expected to take the title on Wednesday.\n\nMajor rivals including defending champions Dafne Schippers and the Ivory Coast's Marie-Josee Ta Lou have pulled out injured.\n\nNew 100m world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is not running while Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare was disqualified in the heats and reigning Olympic champion Elaine Thompson also withdrew.\n\nAsher-Smith is looking to add to the 100m silver she claimed on Sunday after setting a new British record of 10.83secs.\n\nBeth Dobbin and Jodie Williams both failed to reach the final at the Khalifa International Stadium.\n\n\"It always feels like a blur,\" said Dobbin. \"There is something missing. I don't know what it is but I've just not found the shape I was in during July.\"\n\nMeanwhile, European 400m champion, Matthew Hudson-Smith, came off the track in a wheelchair after pulling up 20m into the first heat with a hamstring issue.\n\nThe 24-year-old has suffered hamstring injury problems this year but team-mate Rabah Yousif automatically reached the semi-finals in 45.40s.\n\n\"I gave it my heart and soul. I feel like I could have set it up a little bit better but I definitely can improve for the next round,\" said Yousif.\n\n\"I did enough to make it to the next round and it's about trying to make it to the final.\"\n\nJess Turner and Meghan Beesley also reached Wednesday's 400m hurdles semi-finals while Nick Miller qualified for the hammer final with Zak Seddon through to the 3000m steeplechase final.\n\nLaviai Nielsen and Emily Diamond missed out on the 400m final.\n\nPA", "description": "Adam Gemili suffered more 200 metres heartbreak after coming fourth at the World Championships.
