The fact is that they blasted their way into the house and a very heavy wall, and it took them literally seconds,\u201d Trump had announced in his speech.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Noah mocked. \u201cInstead of knocking on the door and asking ISIS if they could come in, the special forces instead chose to blow a hole through the wall, which must have been traumatizing for Trump to watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just sitting there like, \u2018No, why did you damage that beautiful wall? ... Now Mexicans are going to pour into al-Baghdadi\u2019s house and take all ISIS\u2019 jobs.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoah also pointed out Trump\u2019s \u201cmixed messages\u201d about dogs in the speech.\n\nCheck out the clip below for the rest of Noah\u2019s roast:\n\nTrump announces the killing of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi, then manages to turn the whole thing into a dick-measuring contest with Obama. pic.twitter.com/aWdgnkjyEx \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 29, 2019", "description": "\"The Daily Show\" host dissected the president's announcement.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db7beeb2000003f325070e7.png?cache=bxdcjhs9bt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
