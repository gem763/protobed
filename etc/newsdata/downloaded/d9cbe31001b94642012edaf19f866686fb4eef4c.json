The communication was a phone call, one former official said, according to the Post.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, determined that the complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d, a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees, the Post said.\n\nBut the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share details about the complaint with lawmakers, the paper reported. Maguire has defended his refusal by asserting that the subject of the complaint is beyond his jurisdiction, it said.\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, has sought to compel US intelligence officials to disclose the full details of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nAtkinson is scheduled to appear at a closed hearing of the committee on Thursday morning and Maguire has agreed to testify before the panel in open session a week later, Schiff said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe IC IG determined that this complaint is both credible and urgent, and that it should be transmitted to Congress under the clear letter of the law. The committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistleblowers and their complaints to Congress,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives of the office of the director of national intelligence could not be reached.", "description": "Details are unclear, but Washington Post reports intelligence official considers complaint \u2018urgent concern\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e3d715aa2cdcc1dda4a0a542ebe70c7754df8b2/0_44_4411_2647/master/4411.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7a8e09c49027e8f6988c9050a71829f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
