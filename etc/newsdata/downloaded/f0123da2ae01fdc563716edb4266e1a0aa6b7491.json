This would also free up NSW funding to allow progress for critical town water projects across the state.\n\n\u201cWe want to get these projects under way because this is about water supply and security,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThese projects don\u2019t happen overnight but we\u2019re working as quickly as possible to get all the necessary work done so we can start digging.\u201d\n\nThere would also be an initial $24m 50/50 investment for the proposed 100,000-megalitre Border Rivers project on the Mole River, near the Queensland border.\n\nThe NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklan, described these announcements as \u201chistoric\u201d given the last dam built in NSW was in 1987.\n\n\u201cDams and other water infrastructure are an important part of the mix when it comes to increasing supply and reliability so that NSW\u2019s water supply is more resilient to the terrible drought being experienced across the eastern states,\u201d she said in the joint statement.\n\nHowever, the Nature Conservation Council warned the NSW government to retain thorough assessment of water infrastructure projects to avoid further ecological catastrophes, like the mass fish kills earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe need thorough assessment of water infrastructure projects now more than ever to ensure we don\u2019t make matters worse,\u201d the chief executive, Chris Gambian, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe problems we are facing today are a direct result of this government refusing to listen to its own planning experts, who warned of this looming water crisis six years ago.\u201d\n\nThe council said it feared the measures would open the door to the state\u2019s water minister sidelining the planning department and leaving decisions to WaterNSW.\n\n\u201cBypassing proper environmental checks will compound the ecological and social disasters the NSW government\u2019s has already helped to create,\u201d Gambian said.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a devastating summer across NSW and no amount of political chest beating is going to make it any more manageable.\n\n\u201cWe need to reduce our water use, and the best way to do that is by slashing the amount of water allocated to big irrigators and to stop undermining the Murray Daring Basin Plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernments stopped building dams 30 years ago for a very good reason. Dams fail to provide water security for local communities, they degrade river systems and cause a host of environmental problems.\n\n\u201cAnd in the era of climate change and higher evaporation, new dams are unlikely to fill.\u201d\n\nAustralian Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Conservation groups denounce plan, saying dams don\u2019t provide water security and slashing water allocated to big irrigators is the best way to tackle shortages", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd3ad1cbe3a6178c032581e3851f1d18383970a7/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df1c3815892a84bffb0bbc27f1990fca", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
