To avoid cutting the trip short and missing out on the swell, Neumann had a WeWork employee fly out to brief him, according to the report.\n\nThe surf trip came as WeWork seemed to be barreling toward a giant public offering that would value the company at as much as $100 billion and make its thousands of employees rich. But the S-1 prospectus that was eventually released revealed a company that was losing billions of dollars and let Neumann run things in questionable ways.\n\nThe paperwork that was publicly filed on August 14 disclosed that Neumann owned many of the buildings WeWork rented and that he made millions by leasing the company his own buildings. He also trademarked the word \"We\" and had the company pay him nearly $6 million to use it, though he eventually gave the money back after criticism.\n\nSince then, the IPO has been shelved, Neumann has been replaced as CEO, and SoftBank has taken control of the company.\n\nWhat happens next is anyone's guess. But WeWork's new owners have a lot of work to do, including figuring out what to do with some of the companies Neumann invested in or acquired on WeWork's behalf. Among those is Wavegarden, a Spanish wave-pool company WeWork put nearly $14 million into, presumably because Neumann wanted WeWork to embody the type of community in surfing.\n\nWeWork declined to comment.", "description": "Neumann's love of surfing kept him away from an important S-1 meeting, so he had an employee come to him instead, The Wall Street Journal reported.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db33ec5dee0197429510472?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
