(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nIf you\u2019re going to put your family\u2019s company on blast, you might as well go all-in.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what New Orleans Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball did this week during an appearance on the LightHarted Podcast with Josh Hart. Ball revealed his Big Baller Brand signature ZO2 sneakers would rip apart and his manager was prepared to swap them out every quarter with a backpack full of more shoes.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cIf you literally have those shoes from those games, they\u2019re exploded,\u201d Ball said.\n\nEver wonder why @ZO2_ switched up his shoes every game during summer league rookie year? LightHarted gives you the exclusive look \ud83d\ude02. Presented by @venmo\n\n\n\nFULL VIDEO HERE\ud83d\udc49: https://t.co/aGZsTg5mZD pic.twitter.com/qq03jqZdRY \u2014 LightHarted Podcast (@lighthartedpod) September 4, 2019\n\nBig Baller Brand debuted the rookie\u2019s shoes in May 2017, before he played a minute with the Lakers. The $495 signature \u201cZO2 Prime\u201d had an underwhelming debut with 263 sold on the first day.\n\nTwo years later it\u2019s overwhelmingly clear the people who stayed away made the right choice.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cause they were my shoe. I had to debut them,\u201d Ball told the podcast about why he continued to wear them. \u201cWe went so far with it. I\u2019m like, \u2018Cool, I can get a quarter in, but that\u2019s it. We gotta switch them every quarter.\u2019 \u201cAnd it\u2019s crazy because right when I\u2019d switch my shoes, and then all of a sudden I got good again.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe clip talks only about the shoes during summer league 2017. Earlier this year, the Lakers reportedly expressed concern about his Big Baller Brand shoes after a third ankle injury.\n\n\"Yeah, they talked to me,\" Lonzo Ball told ESPN. \"They asked me about it, and I told 'em, 'I feel comfortable. If I wasn't comfortable, I wouldn't play in 'em. If I didn't play in [the signature BBB shoes], I'd play in Kobe [Bryant's signature Nike shoe]. I work out in [LeBron James' signature Nike shoe], but that's because they're heavier.\"\n\nThe podcast reveal is the latest move by Ball as he distances himself from the family brand. Ball reportedly cut ties with co-founder Alan Foster in March when he found $1.5 million missing from his personal and business accounts. Ball reportedly owns 51 percent of the company.\n\nHe went a step further later that month by covering up the Big Baller Brand logo tattoo on his arm. It was replaced with dice featuring the numbers 1, 2 and 3, likely in reference to the Ball brothers\u2019 jersey numbers.\n\nBall has said he\u2019s ready for his \u201cfresh start\u201d in New Orleans, away from his roots in Los Angeles and college career at UCLA.\n\nHe\u2019ll certainly have something in common to talk about with new teammate and No. 1 pick Zion Williamson.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Turns out the Los Angeles Lakers were right to be worried about his shoes earlier this year, based on Ball's description of his rookie league sneakers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ABJ6_BvIba9yROYNPOrjAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bKHY8qKa583NlioKA4AAnw--~B/aD0zMTcwO3c9NDc1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/12628d60-cf51-11e9-b879-ba57eea2c8c2"}
