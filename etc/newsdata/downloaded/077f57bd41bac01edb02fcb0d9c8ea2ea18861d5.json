Some felt the House was bailing out the Senate for not completing its appropriations bills on time, while others just opposed the overall spending levels \u2015 even if they\u2019re levels supported by President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the real surprise was the level of Democratic support. Just three Democrats voted no \u2015 Juan Vargas (Calif.), Filemon Vela (Texas) and Vincente Gonzalez (Texas) \u2015 and considering that the bill didn\u2019t rein in Trump in any meaningful way, it\u2019s a major show of unity for Democrats.\n\nJust before the vote, the Congressional Progressive Caucus had discussed whether members should oppose the legislation. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who met with the CPC, seems to have convinced the group to come along.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told HuffPost Thursday afternoon, reporting at the time that he was still undecided. (Khanna ended up voting yes.) \u201cThere\u2019s things in there I don\u2019t like, but, you know, it\u2019s tough, I also don\u2019t want government coming to a halt.\u201d\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also reported Thursday afternoon that she was undecided just before the CPC meeting. (She also ended up voting yes.) But she said Democrats not standing up to the administration was a \u201cmacro-level issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even about stooping as low as Republicans do,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we play hardball.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez cited the emergency border supplemental bill that passed in June as an example of Democrats\u2019 refusal to fight for progressive priorities. \u201cThat multibillion dollar blank check that we wrote to cage kids was effed up,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are a number of ways Democrats could have hampered Trump. They could have restricted his border policies, or his plans to build a wall without appropriated money, or his ability to fight a trade war, or even addressed the administration\u2019s refusal to comply with congressional investigations.\n\nInstead, Democrats are letting the president continue as is \u2015 at least, for seven more weeks.\n\nPelosi told Democrats during a closed-door meeting earlier this week that now was not the time to have a fight over policy riders. This bill is supposedly just meant to bridge the gap between now and when Democrats can have those fights.\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) had threatened to omit language the administration wanted to continue its farmer bailout, but relented in exchange for new reporting requirements on the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut by going along with the president\u2019s plans, even temporarily, Democrats are making it harder to stand tall in November. For instance, much of the money originally allotted for military construction that is now being transferred to build the border wall will be used in the coming weeks.\n\nStill, Democrats apparently didn\u2019t see much of a choice, since they pride themselves on not being the party that toys with government shutdowns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the party that has always fought against shutdowns,\u201d Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re the party that has always created shutdowns.\u201d\n\nRep. John Larson (D-Conn.) told HuffPost that he was on the side of not closing down government, and he said the question was whether Democrats wanted to be like Trump.\n\nBut Democrats simply granting Trump a government funding extension without new restrictions seems particularly weak at this moment, especially considering that Trump is funding his border wall by taking money from individual military projects \u2014 blatantly disregarding the will of Congress.\n\nThe Progressive Caucus had discussed funding the government with the exception of the projects that Trump is transferring money from to build his wall. The idea never gained traction, however.\n\nDemocrats say they want to fight Trump\u2019s misappropriation of military funds. They\u2019re just not sure now is the right time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have those fights,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said Thursday. But he said he didn\u2019t see it as a huge deal if Democrats waited another handful of weeks to really duke it out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been taking our lunch money pretty regularly, and there comes a time when you have to stand up to the bully,\u201d Huffman said.\n\n\u201cBut I think he gets the lunch money this one more time,\u201d he said.\n\nArthur Delaney contributed reporting.", "description": "Democrats could have used the short-term funding extension to pass restrictions on Trump priorities.
