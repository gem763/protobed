( DIS ) , and author of the new book \"The Ride of a Lifetime.\" The segment was definitely interesting but the entertainment company was not discussed.\n\nLet's check out the charts of Action Alerts PLUS holding DIS to see what Mickey and Minnie are up to.\n\nIn the daily bar of DIS, below, we can see how prices gapped higher in April but have since \"rolled over.\" The $130 level has been acting as support since May but that could change. Prices have been trading below the declining 50-day moving average line since early August.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been inching higher since May and still higher in August and September when prices have been weak. In other words, the aggressive buying has not been able to push DIS higher.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bearish mode below the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of DIS, below, we see a mixed to bearish picture. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line, unlike the daily line, has been weak since April. The MACD crossed to a take profits sell signal in early July.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of DIS, below, we can see an upside price target of $156 but prices are at the bottom end of their recent range. A trade at $128.71 will be a new low for the move down. The volume by price data on the left scale tells us that a big drop is possible.\n\nBottom-line strategy: DIS is at a crossroads on the chart. The $130 area could hold and the uptrend could resume or we could see a breakdown.
