A professor in college first introduced me to Morrison\u2019s writing; we read Beloved in his American Literature class. Morrison\u2019s masterfully woven stories are frank explorations of the lives of fierce women. For me, she\u2019s an author to come back to time and time again.\n\nLike our favorite authors, there are some companies whose stocks are worth coming back to. These large companies with familiar and entrenched brands, solid management, and predicable cash flows continue to innovate to remain competitive. You could plausibly hold these companies forever--but you probably don\u2019t. Why? Because their stocks inevitably hit your sell targets. Nevertheless, the stocks of these companies should pretty much always be on your radar, if they\u2019re not still in your portfolio.", "description": "These wide-moat, large-cap names have staying power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltd5a8b50e71781435/5d321dda6e329a11cbb64231/Premium_StarRating_1x1.svg"}
