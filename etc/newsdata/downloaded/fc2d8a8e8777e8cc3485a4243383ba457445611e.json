While Riyadh and Washington are blaming Iran for the attack, Tehran has vehemently denied involvement.\n\nIranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen initially claimed responsibility for the attack. But Mr. Pompeo said there\u2019s no sign they\u2019re telling the truth.\n\nEven if they were, he said, it does not absolve Iran and its leadership of culpability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5% of the world\u2019s global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself from responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWere it the case that the Houthis\u2019 fraudulent claim was accurate, were that true \u2014 it\u2019s not, but were that true \u2014 it doesn\u2019t change the fingerprints of the Ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. lawmakers increasingly are pushing the Trump administration for a military response. Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican, on Wednesday said the U.S. should pursue \u201cproportional\u201d military responses.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
