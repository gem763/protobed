But to hear the demonstration-happy left tell it, freedom may not be free \u2014 but it should be.\n\nThe various and sundry left-wing special-interest groups that regularly descend on Washington, D.C., to air their myriad grievances (minus the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d-style Festivus pole) don\u2019t think they should have to pay the full cost their demonstrations and marches impose on the city and the federal government.\n\nThe First Amendment grants left-wing protesters \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 freedom of speech and the right peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. But William O. Douglas notwithstanding, there are neither \u201cemanations,\u201d nor \u201cpenumbras\u201d from the First Amendment that obligate the rest of us to pick up part of the not-inconsiderable tab for the public safety and debris-cleanup services their often-raucous protests inflict whenever they hit the National Mall, Lafayette Square, Freedom Plaza, or elsewhere in the city.\n\nLikely reflective of the left\u2019s pervasive \u201cfree stuff\u201d entitlement mentality, these demonstrators \u2014 from radical feminists and anti-Second Amendment gun grabbers to climate doomsayers and LGBTQ extremists \u2014 seem to think that taxpayers should subsidize their left-wing activism.\n\nThat could explain why these self-styled \u201cprogressive\u201d activists \u2014 along with civil rights organizations and the ACLU \u2014 are apoplectic about a proposal floated by the National Park Service that would require protest groups to reimburse the federal government for the cost of security.\n\n\u201cPutting organizers on the hook for the costs of policing could mean invoices in the tens of thousands of dollars, according to U.S. Park Police budgets . That\u2019s enough to price most activists out of protesting altogether, according to experts and activists awaiting a decision from the Park Service,\u201d The Washington Post reported last week.\n\nBut those enormous costs would not be imposed on the public at all in the absence of the leftist Women\u2019s March, the People\u2019s Climate March, the anti-gun March for Our Lives, and the many other acts of far-left street theater.\n\nAs such, it should be up to the protest organizers \u2014 not U.S. taxpayers \u2014 to supply the funds necessary to fully cover those costs.\n\nLeftist groups loudly and self-righteously proclaim that their demonstrations are all in pursuit of \u201cfairness,\u201d but \u2014 the nebulous nature of the concept of what\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d aside \u2014 there\u2019s nothing at all fair about expecting conservative and centrist Americans who don\u2019t agree with the left\u2019s public-policy agenda to foot part of the bill for their \u201cfree\u201d speech.\n\nAccording to The Post, for example, the March for Our Lives in March 2018 cost the Park Police about $77,500. For gun-grabber-in-chief Michael Bloomberg, whose net worth has been estimated at between $49 billion and $62 billion, that\u2019s the equivalent of the change the rest of us find under our couch cushions. Mr. Bloomberg should volunteer to reimburse the Park Police.\n\nBillionaire climate alarmist Tom Steyer should do likewise for the costs of policing the #ShutDownDC protests of Sept. 23 and 27.\n\nUsing ladders, cars and vans, and even an oversized sailboat, to which some of the protesters chained themselves, these global-warming fanatics snarled thousands of commuters in morning rush-hour traffic.\n\nAccording to news accounts of the Sept. 23 event, several hundred demonstrators blocked as many as 22 intersections in the city. Apparently without grasping the irony, they caused idling vehicles to spew far more greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere than would have otherwise been the case. At least 32 were arrested.\n\nThe #ShutDownDC demonstrations prompted Rep. Jim Banks to announce he would draft legislation that \u201cwould require protesters arrested at demonstrations in D.C. to pay for police overtime and other fees related\u201d to the protests if \u201cthe person is convicted of a felony or misdemeanor offense.\u201d\n\nThe Indiana Republican said his bill wouldn\u2019t prohibit demonstrations or protests \u2014 on either end of the political spectrum \u2014 that have obtained official permits. \u201cMy bill would only apply to illegal protesters who are arrested,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s good as far as it goes, but the Park Service should still move ahead with its proposal to require groups \u2014 left or right \u2014 that stage protests in Washington to pay the costs now being shouldered by taxpayers.\n\nThe Park Service shouldn\u2019t allow itself to be bullied out of it by the objections of civil rights groups that benefit greatly from those subsidies or by the ACLU\u2019s threats to sue to block the proposal.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
