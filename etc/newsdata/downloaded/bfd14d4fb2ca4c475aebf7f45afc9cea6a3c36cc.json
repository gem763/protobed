It believes this will cost a lot initially but pass the break-even point in five years considering the high fees of private telecoms.\n\n", "description": "Seoul City to Become Free Wi-Fi Zone by 2022", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
