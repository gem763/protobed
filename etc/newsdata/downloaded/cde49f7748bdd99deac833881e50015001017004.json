Male drivers in that age bracket are more than three times more likely to be involved in a crash compared to women of the same age.\n\nFor every billion miles travelled by women over the age of 70, 173 of them are killed or seriously injured in a crash (stock image)\n\nThe AA trust believes the figures are explained by the fact that men are more likely to be the default driver within a marriage as they get older \u2013 meaning women gain less driving experience over their lifetime. And as women have a greater life expectancy, they are more likely to be driving on their own much later in life.\n\nMen over the age of 65 are six times more likely than women to be the default driver in their relationship, the study of Office for National Statistics figures found.\n\nOnce they reach the age of 70, a third of female drivers give up their licence compared with just a tenth of male drivers.\n\nEdmund King, AA Charitable Trust Director, said: \u2018Being the default driver means men are more likely to gain greater driving experience throughout their life.\n\nThe AA trust believes the figures are explained by the fact that men are more likely to be the default driver within a marriage as they get older (stock image)\n\n\u2018When they reach old age, this bank of experience is a great asset and may be one of the reasons why men are so much more likely than women to keep their driving licence past the age of 70.\n\n\u2018It may also help explain why women drivers become increasingly more likely than men of the same age to be killed or seriously injured in a crash.\n\n\u2018Being able to drive as safely as possible for as long as possible is vitally important for drivers as they get older.\n\n\u2018For many older drivers, their car is a lifeline that helps keep them connected to their community and able to live independently.\n\n\u2018We need to make sure we are encouraging all drivers to keep their skills up to date. Banking a wealth of on-road experience over many years can help ensure drivers enter the later stages of their driving life with as much confidence and competence as possible.\u2019", "description": "The AA study found that for every billion miles travelled by women over the age of 70, 173 of them are killed or seriously injured in a crash - compared to 63 for male drivers of the same age.", "authors": ["Tom Payne For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/00/18892562-0-image-a-87_1569367455042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
