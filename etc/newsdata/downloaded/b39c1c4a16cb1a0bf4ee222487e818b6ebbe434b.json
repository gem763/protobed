Wade ruling.\n\nThe case, June Medical Services v. Gee, concerns a Louisiana law passed in 2014 that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, which reproductive rights advocates argue is an effort to further restrict abortion access.\n\nThe court struck down a similar law in Texas in 2016, when it heard the case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. The justices ruled 5 to 3, with Kennedy joining the liberal justices in the majority. (The court had only eight members at the time due to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and Senate Republicans\u2019 obstruction of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee.)\n\nSince then, President Donald Trump appointed conservative justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, increasing the possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 abortion rights decision \u2014 or at least chipping away at it through individual cases. That has long been a goal of conservative activists. A wave of GOP-led state legislatures have enacted abortion restrictions in recent years, often through imposing onerous requirements for abortion providers.\n\nThe Louisiana law was struck down in 2017, with a federal judge ruling that mandating abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at hospitals was unconstitutional and \u201cwould increase the risk of harm to women\u2019s health by dramatically reducing the availability of safe abortion in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nBut last year, a federal appeals court disagreed, upholding the law. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked it again, pending a full review of the case.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWe Already Know What A Post-Roe World Looks Like\n\nSneaky, Medically Unnecessary Laws Are Closing Abortion Clinics Across The Country\n\nSupreme Court Blocks Louisiana Abortion Clinic Law\n\n5 Men Could Overturn Legal Abortion In America\n\nSupreme Court Strikes Down Texas Abortion Law, Breathing New Life Into Roe v.
