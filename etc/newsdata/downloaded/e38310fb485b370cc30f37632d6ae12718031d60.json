It begins streaming Friday.\n\nHathaway\u2019s episode casts her as Lexi, a brilliant, vivacious lawyer who has spent most of her life hiding her condition. Lexi meets handsome, sweet Jeff (Gary Carr) in a grocery store when she is at her lovable best, but the date they arrange for later in the week finds her in the deepest of depressions. Her chronic absences at work also are putting her job in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t fully prepared for what it was going to take to represent the highs of the high and the lows of the low and then have to go back to the highs and go back to the lows, sometimes multiple times a day,\u201d the 36-year-old actress recently told reporters in New York.\n\nAlthough shooting the episode didn\u2019t take long \u2014 eight days over three weeks \u2014 the role took its toll on Hathaway.\n\n\u201cI really lost my equilibrium by the end and kind of just needed to go to bed and get myself in order,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me appreciate that I am an actor. I\u2019m not diagnosed with this condition.\u201d\n\nShe took the time she needed to decompress after the project ended, assuring herself, \u201cThis will be behind me, which is a very different experience than having a condition that you don\u2019t have control over.\u201d\n\nThe star of The Princess Diaries, Brokeback Mountain, The Devil Wears Prada, The Dark Knight Rises and Les Miserables \u2014 who is pregnant with her second child \u2014 said making Modern Love was an eye-opening experience, challenging though it was.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like actors who complain and go on about how exhausting their parts were,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are the luckiest people in the world, and if you are a working actor, that\u2019s your job and be grateful. There are a lot of people who want your problems.\u201d\n\nTo convey to viewers in a short length of time the extremes of Lexi\u2019s radically shifting moods, the character is seen beautifully dressed, singing, dancing and charming her way through life in some scenes, and then barely able to move, speak or get out of her pajamas in others.\n\n\u201cEvery choice has to matter,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cEvery visual cue had to tell you something about her immediately because there wasn\u2019t time to explain absolutely everything to the audience.\u201d\n\nBecause a perceived stigma often is attached to mental illness, many people avoid seeking treatment or confiding in their loved ones about what\u2019s going on, the actress said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this is the episode that is going to change anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a magic bullet and I don\u2019t think it is the answer, but I am happy to be a part of a show that, in its own imperfect way, invites more people to the table.\u201d\n\nEach episode of Modern Love tells a different real-life story about New Yorkers in unexpected relationships. The show\u2019s revolving cast also includes Tina Fey, Dev Patel, Andrew Scott, Brandon Kyle Goodman, John Slattery, Catherine Keener, Julia Garner and Cristin Milioti.\n\n\u201cThere is a real strong tendency among a small group of people to dismiss shows like this, to dismiss this genre, to not value it the same as dramas and gritty things,\u201d Hathaway said.\n\n\u201cContext is everything, because in a year where everything is going good, this just feels like fluff. But, in a year like 2019, where we are all gasping for positivity, this feels like a lifeline.\u201d\n\nKnown for being candid and self-aware in interviews, the actress credits her upbringing for her feelings of ease with being herself and expressing her opinions.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t raised with too many expectations about how I was supposed to behave,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI really, really was raised in a very free-range environment, especially emotionally, and, so, I don\u2019t think of it as speaking out. II just think about it as representing the world and the people that I know and love, which doesn\u2019t feel particularly brave or inspired or important until you realize that somebody has felt trapped because they weren\u2019t raised in that free-range way.\u201d", "description": "NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (UPI) \u2014 Oscar-winner Anne Hathaway said playing a bipolar lawyer in Amazon\u2019s anthology series Modern Love was one of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
