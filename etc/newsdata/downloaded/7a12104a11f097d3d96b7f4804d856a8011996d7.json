When it dies, its remains \u2014 called a whale fall \u2014 provide food and important nutrients to the ecosystem on the seafloor. It\u2019s what brought all the critters to the party we get to view today.\n\nWHALEFALL! The Nautilus team just discovered a whale skeleton on the seafloor covered in bone-eating worms, cusk eels, and octopus devouring this massive deep sea meal.

They\u2019re backed by the same guy who found the Titanic: deep-sea explorer Robert Ballard. There\u2019s a round-the-clock live stream as the Nautilus vessel and its submersibles search for new discoveries along the seafloor. The pilots and scientists on board are even taking questions submitted through the Nautilus Live website.\n\nThe team got the largest audience they\u2019ve ever had as they poked around the whale skeleton. Taking a request to zoom in, their cameras homed in on the backbone, covered in red bone-eating worms (Osedax) bobbing in the current.\n\nAt one point, the crew hung out with an octopus that attached itself to their equipment. \u201cI think we do have a stow-away,\u201d a crew member laughed. \u201cExcuse us, octopus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe octopus is photobombing us right now,\u201d the crew quips. Then we get an anatomy lesson. One of the octopus\u2019 eight limbs is a \u201chectocotylus,\u201d we learn, which is used to \u201ctransfer sperm packets from the male to inside the cavity of the female.\u201d\n\nAlthough the researchers couldn\u2019t definitely say how long the skeleton had been there, one listener identified as someone \u201cin the science community\u201d suggested that the whale probably died about four months ago, judging from how much tissue was left.\n\nWatch the rest of the live stream below.", "description": "An ocean exploration team just discovered a whale skeleton on the seafloor, and it\u2019s live-streaming the bone-eating worms and other critters gnawing away at what\u2019s left of the carcass.", "authors": ["Justine Calma", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGPYi8u06FPMTlfd05ULvikPAEA=/0x0:1206x631/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19293762/Screen_Shot_2019_10_16_at_4.42.56_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
