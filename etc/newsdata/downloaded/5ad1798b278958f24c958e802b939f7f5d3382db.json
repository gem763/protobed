Can\u2019t make it to the ballpark? The Washington Nationals\u2019 game against the New York Mets will air exclusively on a YouTube livestream for anyone with an Internet connection to enjoy.\n\nLast year, 25 Major League Baseball games, including a few Nationals games, were shown on Facebook Live instead of MASN or any traditional television outlet. For this season, MLB\u2019s online partner is YouTube, and the Nationals will host the ninth of 13 games only streamed for fans on the video hosting website.\n\nThe game will be free to watch at youtube.com/MLB, regardless of whether you own a YouTube account. In last year\u2019s situation, fans needed a Facebook account in order to view the exclusive games.\n\nIt is the Nationals\u2019 first YouTube \u201cMLB Game of the Week\u201d in 2019, but it won\u2019t be the only one. Their game against the Atlanta Braves on Sept. 13 is also supposed to be a YouTube exclusive, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMASN Nationals analyst F.P. Santangelo will be joined by MLB Network play-by-play announcer Scott Braun and color commentator Al Leiter on the broadcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
