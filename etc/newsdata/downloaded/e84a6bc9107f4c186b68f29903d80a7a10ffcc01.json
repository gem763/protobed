Inc. ( TRV ) made a peak in July and moved below the cresting 50-day moving average line. There are other signs of weakness so let's dig deeper.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of TRV, below, we can see that prices broke their 6-1/2-month uptrend in late July. We mentioned the 50-day moving average above and now it shows a negative slope.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line peaked in early July ahead of the price peak and it has made a lower high in August.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum indicator showed slowing momentum from May to July ahead of the price peak. Recently the price momentum has been improving but this matches the price action this month so we do not have a bullish divergence.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of TRV, below, we see a mixed picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line so we are mathematically in an uptrend.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows a decline the past three months telling us that sellers have been more aggressive and the MACD oscillator crossed to the downside in July for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TRV, below, we can see a downside price target of $138 being projected. This is not terribly bearish but if it unfolds it would put TRV is a position to test the 200-day line.\n\nBottom-line strategy: TRV is in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and weakness in this name will help to drag the index lower.", "description": "Dow Stock Travelers Is Ready to Take a Trip South...TRV", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Dow Stock Travelers Is Ready To Take A Trip South", "Weakness In This Name Will Help To Drag The Index Lower.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bob Ciura", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Collins", "Paul Price", "Kevin Curran"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/travelerscompanies.jpg"}
