New Law Just an Attack on Trump", "language": "en", "text": "We\u2019re all used to seeing California throw its weight around, but its new law requiring a presidential candidate to provide five years of tax returns to be eligible to appear on a primary ballot is a new low. Now, however, a federal district court judge has blocked the state from enforcing it, at least temporarily.\n\nIt\u2019s the right decision. The law is nothing more than a political attack on President Donald Trump, the federal elections process, and the right of free association of citizens and all political parties.\n\nCalifornia is weighing its options, but if it chooses to appeal, the Ninth Circuit should affirm the district judge\u2019s decision because the law violates the presidential Qualifications Clause and the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nThe Qualifications Clause in Article II, Section 1 sets out the sole requirements to be president of the United States. You must be a \u201cnatural born Citizen,\u201d 35 years of age, and a resident \u201cwithin\u201d the U.S. for 14 years.\n\nThe key case on this is U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton(1995).There was a movement across the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s to impose term limits on members of Congress. This political movement ended, however, when the U.S.Supreme Court held in Thornton that an Arkansas law limiting the number of terms that a member of Congress could serve was a violation of the separate Qualifications Clauses that apply to members of Congress. The Arkansas law provided that once a representative or senator reached the maximum term, he could not have his name \u201cplaced on the ballot\u201d\u2014a ballot-access restriction akin to California\u2019s new law.\n\nArkansas was adding an additional qualification to being a representative or a senator; the court, in a 5-4 opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, said that \u201cStates lack the power to impose qualifications.\u201d Although the Thornton case dealt with congressional elections, the same constitutional consideration would apply to presidential elections and the presidential Qualifications Clause.\n\nArkansas also tried to argue that the term limit was not an additional qualification, but simply a ballot-access requirement. But the court disagreed.States can \u201cadopt generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself.\u201d States have the right to implement rules that are intended to avoid \u201cvoter confusion, ballot overcrowding or the presence of frivolous candidacies.\u201d\n\nBut what states cannot do is try to disguise additional qualifications as ballot-access requirements.\n\nIn another decision in 1983\u2014this time involving Ohio\u2014the Supreme Court in Anderson v. Celebrezze (also a 5-4 decision written by Stevens) threw out a March filing deadline for a presidential candidate to appear on the November ballot. The deadline placed an unconstitutional burden on the voting and associational rights of supporters of a candidate in violation of the First Amendment.\n\nAccording to the court,\u201cstate-imposed restrictions implicate a uniquely important national interest\u201d since \u201cthe President and the Vice President of the United States are the only elected officials who represent all the voters in the Nation.\u201d Thus, \u201cin a Presidential election a State's enforcement of more stringent ballot access requirements\u201d have \u201can impact beyond its own borders.\u201d So states have far less power to regulate presidential elections \u201cthan statewide or local elections, because the outcome of the former will be largely determined by voters beyond the State's boundaries.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in 2001, in Cook v. Gralike,the Supreme Court, this time in a unanimous opinion written by Stevens, said that the authority of states is limited to regulating election procedures. The acceptable regulations are those necessary to impose \u201csome sort of order, rather than chaos\u201d on the \u201cdemocratic process\u201das well as to protect the integrity of elections.\n\nThe new California law says its purpose is to \u201cprovide voters with essential information regarding the candidate\u2019s potential conflicts of interest, business dealings, financial status, and charitable donations\u201d so they can \u201cmake a more informed decision.\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom said in his signing statement that states \u201chave a legal and moral duty to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking higher office meet minimal standards, and to restore public confidence.\u201d\n\nThe law\u2019s stated purpose reveals that it has nothing to do with regulating the \u201creliability of the electoral process itself\u201dand ensuring orderly voting procedures. Newsom\u2019s statement about the law imposing\u201cminimal standards\u201dalso shows the law isn\u2019t about protecting the voting process\u2014 it\u2019s about imposing California\u2019s minimal qualifications on anyone who wants to be president.\n\nCalifornia passed a similar bill two years ago. When then-Gov.Jerry Brown vetoed the bill, he not only acknowledged that it might \u201cnot be constitutional,\u201d but he expressed his concern \u201cabout the political perils of individual states seeking to regulate presidential elections in this manner.\u201d He called it a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d Tax returns now, but what else might states start to demand he said. Health records? High school report cards? Certified birth certificates?\n\nAll of that might depend, as Brown warned, \u201con which political party is in power\u201d and it could \u201clead to an ever-escalating set of differing state requirements for presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nNeither California nor any other state has the right to impose additional requirements for presidential candidates, whether they categorize them as \u201cqualifications\u201d or as restrictive ballot-access requirements.\n\nThe law also violates the First Amendment.\n\nIn Anderson and Burdick v. Takushi, the Supreme Court laid out a framework for analyzing First Amendment challenges to state election laws. Under that analysis,California\u2019s law causes significant harm to its citizens\u2019 First Amendment rights because it denies members of a political party the opportunity to vote for a constitutionally qualified candidate of their choice.\n\nThe fact that Republican primary voters could write in Trump\u2019s name on the ballot doesn\u2019t save the law. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a write-in \u201cis not an adequate substitute for having the candidate\u2019s name appear on the printed ballot.\u201d\n\nCalifornia says it has an interest in\u201censuring that its voters make informed, educated choices.\u201d That is not a legitimate state interest and can be seen as a pretext for animus against Trump. The right to choose elected representatives belongs exclusively to the people, and it is the people, and not the states, who have the right to educate themselves about their candidates however they see fit.\n\nWhen a state, like California, chooses which of a candidate\u2019s characteristics to educate the people about, it impermissibly substitutes its judgment for the people\u2019s judgment. This law is an unnecessary burden on the public\u2019s First Amendment rights. The law does not educate voters: It punishes candidates who refuse to comply.\n\nIn essence, California\u2019s law deprives voters of their right to vote for any constitutionally qualified candidate of their choosing simply because California has decided, in its infinite wisdom, that tax returns matter more than any other information that voters might care about.\n\nThe First Amendment does not allow that.", "description": "We\u2019re all used to seeing California throw its weight around, but its new law requiring a presidential candidate to provide five years of tax returns to be eligible to appear on a primary ballot is a new low.
