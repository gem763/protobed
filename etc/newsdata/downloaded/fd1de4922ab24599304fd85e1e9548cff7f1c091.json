Even though Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin have been married for over a year at this point, these crazy kids decided to head down below the Mason-Dixon Line to one of South Carolina\u2019s finest plantations for a proper wedding, anyway. And what fun they had! The duo tied the knot (again) on Monday, September 30, at the state\u2019s Montage Palmetto Bluff, and when they weren\u2019t making their very famous guests watch The Notebook on repeat, they posted a few photo-booth snaps on social media for their fans. You know, those photo booths that make you look like a poreless alien. Because altar pics are so gauche.\n\nBaldwin, the \u201cfire\u201d bride in question, previously admitted that they married so quickly because they wanted to have sex. She also said Bieber pisses her off quite frequently in their relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be hard,\u201d Baldwin explained to Vogue at the time. \u201cYou don\u2019t wake up every day saying, \u2018I\u2019m absolutely so in love and you are perfect.\u2019 That\u2019s not what being married is. But there\u2019s something beautiful about it anyway \u2014 about wanting to fight for something, commit to building with someone. We\u2019re really young, and that\u2019s a scary aspect. We\u2019re going to change a lot. But we\u2019re committed to growing together and supporting each other in those changes.\u201d\n\nStay tuned for additional Bieber-Baldwin wedding intel, like if those irate hotel guests ever received refunds on their rooms.", "description": "Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin got married in South Carolina in September 2019.
