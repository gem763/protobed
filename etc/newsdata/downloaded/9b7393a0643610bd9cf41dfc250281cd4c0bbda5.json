We will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to, because we are so busy, but I love him dearly.\n\nHe opened up about their alleged feud (Picture: ITV)\n\nThe documentary followed Meghan and Harry\u2019s time in Africa (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018The majority of the stuff is created out of nothing, but as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry, Meghan, William and Kate were previously referred to as the \u2018Fab Four\u2019 after they worked on charity organisation The Royal Foundation together.\n\nBut earlier this year it was announced that the two couples would be parting ways, with only the Cambridges left looking after the company.\n\nDriver left covered in blood after car completely flipped over\n\nAt the time, both parties denied reports of a feud, stating instead that the move was \u2018largely about preparing both couples for their future roles, which are obviously on divergent tracks\u2019.\n\nMeghan and Harry have since gone on to establish their own new charitable foundation.\n\nDuring the documentary of their Africa tour, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also discussed life as new parents while living in the public eye.\n\nDescribing the last year as \u2018hard\u2019, Meghan revealed she had been warned by British friends not to marry Harry.\n\nHarry and William have faced rumours of a falling out this year (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nMeghan also talked about life as a new mum in the spotlight (Picture: ITV)\n\nShe said: \u2018I don\u2019t think anybody could understand that, but in all fairness I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand.\n\n\u2018When I first met my now-husband my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life\u201d.\u2019\n\nMeghan added that being a royal had been \u2018complicated\u2019, stating that it isn\u2019t enough \u2018just to survive something, you\u2019ve got to thrive, you\u2019ve got to feel happy\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe duchess said: \u2018I tried to adopt the British sensibility of the stiff upper lip.
