Their courageous and controlled intervention was decisive in ending these criminal acts,\" he added.\n\nSofiane, a 17-year-old from the area, told AFP on Sunday that the dead man was one of the first to try to reason with the knifeman.\n\nThe killer \"stabbed him and then when he fell on the ground, he continued,\" Sofiane explained.\n\nA young girl, still in shock at having witnessed the attack, told AFP: \"A man at the 57 (bus) stop started stabbing people left, right and centre.\"\n\n\"Nobody came to help so I threw myself on her (one of the victims) to protect her to prevent him stabbing her again,\" said the girl, who finally managed to help the woman into the bus.\n\nAbdelkader, one of the bus drivers who came to their aid, said he saw the assailant head towards the metro and instinctively challenged him as he repeatedly slashed at one victim.\n\n- 'Expressionless' -\n\n\"His face was expressionless -- you felt he was stabbing away just for the sake of it,\" said Abdelkader.\n\nOn Sunday, he admitted to feeling \"worse and worse -- many flashbacks are coming back to me,\" prosecutor Jacquet said.\n\nFar-right figurehead Marine Le Pen meanwhile led criticism of what she termed \"the laxity of migration policy\" in France which she said was \"a serious threat to the safety of French people.\"\n\n- Exploitation? -\n\nJacquet said the knifeman had been first registered in France in 2009 as a minor, but travelled to Germany, Norway, Britain and Italy before returning to France in 2016 where he was granted temporary residency rights.\n\nPolice raided his room in an asylum-seekers' centre following the stabbings.\n\nThe mayor of Villeurbanne, Jean-Paul Bret from the Socialist party, accused Le Pen and others on the right and far-right of \"exploiting things politically.\"\n\n\"It's the classic reaction from the far-right which tries to turn a dramatic event to its advantage,\" he told the RTL radio station.\n\nHe also reminded Le Pen that offering asylum to people fleeing conflict in places such as Afghanistan was an international duty that France respected.\n\nFrance has been the victim of a string of Islamist-inspired terror attacks since 2015 that have cost hundreds of lives.\n\nTwo of the eight injured victims remained in hospital on Sunday, but none was in intensive care, Jacquet said.", "description": "Jacquet said the knifeman had been first registered in France in 2009 as a minor, but travelled to Germany, Norway, Britain and Italy before returning to France in 2016 where he was granted temporary residency rights.
