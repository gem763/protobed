This year, it's at 67,\" said Saadia Zahidi, head of the WEF's Center for the New Economy and Society. \"That 10-rank increase is in part because the economy has been able to use the current situation in terms of the trade war to attract some of the investments to be able to become a little bit more of a regional trading hub.\"\n\nZahidi said there's not enough information yet to assess the full impact of tariffs on competitiveness, but that the restrictive trade measures appear to be linked to a \"downturn in business sentiment\" that could bode badly for the global economy.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
