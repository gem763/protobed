The lung disease kills more than a million people a year, mostly in poor countries, and about one-third of the world's people harbor the bacteria that cause it.\n\nResults were reported Tuesday at a conference in India, the country hardest hit by TB, and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nXANAX DRUG ALPRAZOLAM RECALLED NATIONWIDE\n\nThere is a TB vaccine now, but it's given only to very young children and partly prevents severe complications.
