Traders did well buying into the early weakness as politically driven bears over-anticipated a selloff.\n\nThursday morning the impeachment issue is \"old\" news and there is no obvious headline to buy. The typical political battle is not providing a good trading catalyst so market players must find some other drivers and there aren't any.\n\nThere was more news about China showing good faith by buying agricultural products but this China news flow has become a joke since the headlines occur so often and are largely meaningless.\n\nWe are left with a vacuum and stocks are drifting lower as a result. Breadth isn't terrible with about 2,900 advancers to 4,000 decliners but momentum stocks continue to see heavy pressure and sectors like biotechnology can't find support.\n\nThis morning I discussed how the market is already deep into a correction. The price action today confirms that thesis. Much of the market is acting like it is already in a bear market. There just isn't any real interest in trying to catch stocks that are falling right now.\n\nFrom a trading standpoint, it would probably be healthier if there was much more intense selling right now. That would wring out some of the problems and set the stage for a better market. Unfortunately, the market likes to dish out some misery before it eventually finds some healthy support.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the weakness this week is that the stories about how this has historically been the worst week of the calendar year on a seasonal basis have been very correct.\n\nI continue the hunt for some new buys but I'm not very optimistic that I'm going to find much right now.", "description": "Stories about how this has historically been the worst week for the market in the calendar year have been very correct.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "This Week Is Living Up To Its Bad Reputation", "Much Of The Stock Market Is Acting Like It Is Already In A Bear Market.", "Jim Collins", "Bruce Kamich", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Peter Tchir"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/b50d783f-e068-11e9-805f-af0f01f43e2c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
