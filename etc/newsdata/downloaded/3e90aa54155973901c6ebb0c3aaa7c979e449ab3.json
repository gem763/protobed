I needed a job.\n\n\"I needed to work. I needed to continue working.\"\n\nDespite his motives, Glover earned a special place in the hearts of horror fans for his performance as the ill-fated, goofy-dancing, future GIF Jimmy, which came one year before his breakout turn as the bullied George McFly in the 1985 classic Back to the Future.\n\nAnd while countless aspiring actors have admitted to taking whatever work they could get (and many have started off in lackluster horror movies), few speak of the paycheck gigs as openly as Glover, who also has no great love for the slasher genre as a whole.\n\n\"I've only seen two of those films, I saw the original film [1980's Friday the 13th, the first film to introduce iconic masked killer Jason Voorhees] and the one that I'm in,\" Glover explained. \"I remember when I saw the original one, not too long before it I'd seen the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre [1974], and when I saw the first Friday the 13th, I thought, 'Well, this is extremely derivative.'\n\n\"I liked the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre very much,\" he continued. \"There's a whole industry that's basically what they call the slasher industry. I find it derivative of that particular original Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\"\n\nRegardless of Glover's feelings on the horror genre, we still love him \u2014 and we still love Jimmy \u2013 which is why he's one of this year's MVPs of Horror.\n\nWatch Crispin also talk about Lucky Day and Back to the Future in our full interview:\n\n\n\nRead more on Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
