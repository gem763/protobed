But this is quickly proving itself to not be true.\n\nFor those who missed the memo, a quick interlude. On Friday, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua revealed that China\u2019s leader had called for the adoption of blockchain \u201cas an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies\u201d in a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee. State-run outlet Xinhua revealed that Xi lauded the potential benefits of blockchain technologies in a swath of industries, including finance, education, health care, food security, and more.\n\nBitcoin Joins Blockchain in Going Mainstream in China\n\nWhile President Xi\u2019s focus was evidently on the benefits of blockchain technology, the ripple effects of his statements have affected China\u2019s view on Bitcoin. So much in fact that China\u2019s state-controlled television station, CCTV.com, recently hosted a segment breaking down BTC, according to a prominent trader that closely follows the region\u2019s cryptocurrency scene.\n\nPanda, who propagated evidence of this online, remarked that CCTV \u201cexplained the basics of the \u2018first-ever blockchain application\u2019 Bitcoin, and how a distributed ledger works\u201d in a recent segment. It isn\u2019t clear how many individuals were watching at this time, but the number was likely easily in the millions. Easily.\n\nChina's state controlled television explaining the basics of \"first ever blockchain application\" #bitcoin $btc, and how a distributed ledger works Imagine 1.3 billion people got to know bitcoin because state made an effort to explain how it works. pic.twitter.com/VcIMlxmkQM \u2014 \u0e51 PANDA \u0e51 (@PandaofBinance) October 27, 2019\n\nTrader CL has tacitly corroborated the trend of Bitcoin returning to the mainstream in China. The analyst remarked in his own Twitter post that he noticed that the Chinese government \u201chas organized a nationwide blockchain exam competition,\u201d whose first class is literally titled \u201cApplication of Blockchain: Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nChinese government has organized a nationwide blockchain exam competition. The study material they see? First class is literally titled: Application of Blockchain: Bitcoin Goes on to describe how it solved double spending, advantage over AliPay and WechatPay, and so on. Insane. pic.twitter.com/XUjEjNRvcs \u2014 CL (@CL207) October 26, 2019\n\nStill Banned\u2026 We Think\n\nWhile Bitcoin is becoming a part of the Chinese consciousness again after 2018\u2019s precipitous collapse, it still seems that a majority of transactions and operations made using the currency are banned. Holding BTC, notably, has been deemed legal on multiple occasions, yet the trading of cryptocurrencies, especially for Chinese yuan, is believed to still be vehemently restricted due to capital control concerns.\n\nCase in point, AliPay, Alibaba\u2019s primary fintech business, recently wrote on Twitter that its services should not be associated with Bitcoin in accordance with Chinese law, hinting that the anti-crypto restrictions implemented by the People\u2019s Bank of China and other entities are still in place.\n\nIt remains to be seen if President Xi\u2019s newfound blockchain strategy will involve less stringent rules placed on cryptocurrency use.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Many wrote off Chinese president Xi Jinping's recent endorsement of blockchain as non-beneficial for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
