The rate of central banks incorporating ESG has nearly doubled to 20% from 11% in 2017, Invesco found in its survey of 139 sovereign investors and central bank reserve managers.\n\nESG remains most prevalent among sovereigns in the west, with 76% adopting the policy. But the number of Middle East sovereign funds using the policy has doubled to 67% from 30% in 2017.\n\nThe scale, size and long-term outlook of sovereign funds\u2019 means they are well-placed to include ethics and sustainability in their investment process. But the uptake had been less broad than initially anticipated, Invesco found in a previous report in 2017.\n\nThe latest study suggested that might be changing.\n\n\u201cThe fact that over half of all sovereign managers now incorporate official ESG policies reflects advancements in investors\u2019 understanding of how to derive value from their application,\u201d said Alex Millar, Invesco\u2019s Head of EMEA institutional distribution sales.\n\n\u201cAs the adoption of such policies in the construction of portfolios continues to develop, we expect to see application spread across asset classes. This year\u2019s study shows this process is already beginning to take place, with sophisticated adopters moving beyond equities into fixed income, and even, in some cases, real estate and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAlthough equities has been the initial starting point for ESG implementation, 65% of sovereign funds that incorporate ESG at the asset class level have now widened it to their fixed income portfolios, the study found.", "description": "Almost two thirds of sovereign investors are making social and environmentally friendly investing part of their approach, up from less than half two years ago, according to a study by Invesco released on Monday.", "authors": ["Tom Arnold", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
