For many South Africans, taking the step of applying for a home loan seems near impossible. Luckily, there are several options at your disposal. One particularly handy offering is a 100% home loan.\n\n\n\nThere are many advantages to getting a 100% home loan, but it\u2019s important to know the finer details before committing to a 20-year term. One of the main reasons a 100% home loan is attractive to buyers, is the fact that it allows you to buy a home without putting down a deposit.\n\n\n\nIn practice, this means the value of the deposit is added to the remainder of the home loan. This, in turn, is paid \u2018as usual\u2019 over the 20-year term. By taking out a no-deposit down home loan, you free up capital at the start of your home buying journey. This can come in handy when it comes to additional costs like transfer fees, renovations, or attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n\n\nBut not everyone can apply for a 100% home loan. It\u2019s important to know what is required of you to apply for \u2013 and hopefully be approved for \u2013 a full home loan. Having the necessary documents ready when applying for your loan will ensure a smoother process. You can see the full list of documents you\u2019ll need by reading more here.\n\n\n\nThe first step in ensuring you get approved for your no deposit home loan, is getting an affordability calculation done so you know what you can afford. This gives you a good idea of what you can expect when it comes to applying, and helps to set realistic expectations.
