The official announcement came 12 hours after Sportsmail\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s match with Italy was also called off \u2014 denying the Azzurri any chance of claiming a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nTournament officials confirmed the four teams affected by the cancellations would be awarded two points each \u2014 with the games declared no-score draws.\n\nThe crucial clash between hosts Japan and Scotland could still go ahead as planned on Sunday in Yokohama, but it will not be moved or put back a day, despite the outcome deciding qualification from Pool A.\n\nTV screens showed the path of the Super Typhoon as the tournament officials addressed issue\n\nWorld Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin confirmed England vs France was off on Thursday\n\nThere was confusion, anger and upheaval for teams, officials and supporters as news spread about this unheard-of disruption to a World Cup.\n\nIt is the first time in the 32-year history of the event that matches have been cancelled. Both England v France and New Zealand v Italy were due to take place on Saturday in Toyota, which lies right in the path of Hagibis. The typhoon is set to rage through central and eastern areas of Japan, with winds forecast to reach 160mph.\n\nEngland reacted to the dramatic developments by hurriedly vacating their hotel in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo. Instead of moving across the city to a hotel in the eastern district of Shiodome, Eddie Jones and his squad flew south to the city of Miyazaki.\n\nThis was where the squad held a pre-tournament training camp and their head coach expressed satisfaction about having the chance to recharge and prepare for a likely quarter-final against Australia in Oita next Saturday.\n\n\u2018Someone is smiling on us \u2014 the typhoon Gods maybe,\u2019 he said. \u2018We are not concerned. We are excited. Who would have thought we would have two relatively easy games, one tough game and then two weeks to prepare for a quarter-final?\n\n\u2018The players are disappointed but we\u2019ve told them to get over it and get on with it. They\u2019ll have a rest tonight and train tomorrow.\u2019\n\nSO, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? As two World Cup matches are called off, Sportsmail answers the key questions... HOW BAD IS THE TYPHOON? Super Typhoon Hagibis is expected to be the worst of the year with 160mph winds causing havoc in and around Tokyo over the weekend. It is the 19th storm of the season. The 15th, \u2018Faxai\u2019, killed three people and caused \u00a3400m of damage. Hagibis is about 1,000 miles wider and could bring \u2018freak waves\u2019 in the Pacific Ocean. Everyone in Tokyo, Toyota and affected areas has been told to stay inside this weekend. WHAT ABOUT SCOTLAND v JAPAN? The intention is still to play it on Sunday in Yokohama when it is expected that the typhoon will have cleared. But there is no predicting the damage the storm will do, so the venue will be assessed on Sunday morning and a decision taken no later than six hours before kick-off. There are no plans for it to be postponed or moved. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE POOLS? If a pool match is cancelled, rules state it will be a 0-0 draw with both teams taking two points. If their game is off, Scotland are out. Italy are out due to the cancellation of their game against New Zealand. WHY WERE MATCHES NOT MOVED? Organisers said they looked \u2018extensively\u2019 at shifting the games \u2014 possibly to Oita in the southern island of Kyushu 750 miles from the capital \u2014 but the challenge was too great. Flights and trains may not run and the stadium in Yokohama holds 72,000, with the Oita one closer to 40,000. WILL FANS BE REFUNDED? YES, for their ticket. But World Rugby will not help them with hotel or transport costs \u2014 telling supporters to go to their travel insurers. WHAT HAVE THE TEAMS DONE? England have left Tokyo and travelled to Miyazaki, where they had a pre-tournament training camp. France were south in Kumamoto and would have gone up to Tokyo for the match, but have gone to Oita instead where they will meet Wales, in all likelihood, a week on Sunday. The Kiwis and Italy are near Toyota so will take shelter. Italy fly home on Monday.\n\nThe former head coach of Japan added: \u2018I\u2019ve been here for about 30 typhoons and there\u2019s a reason why everything shuts down when they come, because they can be very dangerous.\n\n'This one is supposed to be a big typhoon, so I don\u2019t see any other option.\u2019\n\nNor were there any complaints about bringing the tournament here in typhoon season, as he added: \u2018If you never try anything new, you never know anything new. We need rugby to grow and they\u2019ve done a great job. It\u2019s the best-run tournament I\u2019ve seen.\u2019\n\nHowever, Jones\u2019s upbeat response to the tournament turbulence was not echoed by others caught in the chaos.\n\nEddie Jones spoke to the press after the announcement that the France match was cancelled\n\nItaly were incensed at being denied the opportunity to take on the All Blacks.\n\nConor O\u2019Shea, Italy\u2019s outgoing head coach, said: \u2018No one\u2019s mentioned the fact that we still had a chance to qualify. I\u2019m not saying we would have beaten them but we deserved a chance to try. What a way to finish \u2014 being told in beautiful conditions that the game is off.\u2019\n\nThe Scottish Rugby Union demanded guidance from World Rugby about plans for their game against Japan in the event of damage to Yokohama Stadium and the surrounding area.\n\nThere was speculation the fixture could be played behind closed doors if there are concerns about safety but organisers were adamant that if it doesn\u2019t go ahead as planned on Sunday, the match would be cancelled and deemed a 0-0 draw.\n\nScotland head coach Gregor Townsend said: \u2018We believe the game hasn\u2019t been cancelled because the forecast is much improved for Sunday. It looks like the game will be played.\u2019\n\nEddie Jones and his squad flew south to the city of Miyazaki to prepare for their quarter-final\n\nNew Zealand must wait to discover if they will face Ireland, Japan or Scotland in the last eight but their head coach Steve Hansen backed the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds.\n\n\u2018Of course it is frustrating but we can\u2019t control the weather,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do we charge on and put people\u2019s lives at risk or do we make a decision to make sure people are safe? It\u2019s a no-brainer. There\u2019s a lot of sympathy for Italy but the right decision has been made.\u2019\n\nWorld Cup organisers insisted they had only very reluctantly decided to call off matches, in the interests of safety.\n\nOfficials were at pains to explain that there had been \u2018exhaustive\u2019 attempts made to implement contingency plans, that fans missing out on matches they had paid to see would receive refunds, and there were no regrets about bringing the event to the Far East.\n\n\u2018The last three weeks vindicates hosting a World Cup in Japan,\u2019 said tournament director Alan Gilpin.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN MIYAZAKI: The Rugby World Cup was plunged into chaos on Thursday amid cancelled matches and recriminations caused by the approaching super typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/20/19553010-0-image-a-16_1570737265722.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
