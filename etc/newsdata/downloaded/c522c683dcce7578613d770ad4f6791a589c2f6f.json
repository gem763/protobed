Not to mention what sense does it make to stall traffic when you claim you are fighting carbon emissions so that you make more?\n\nWell, one guy was not happy he couldn\u2019t get to work and he made his feelings known.\n\nWarning for offensive language:\n\nyou have officially left the safe space pic.twitter.com/KKg4ZwO1BP \u2014 TyIer (@tyIerzilla) October 18, 2019\n\nThe man, who was wearing medical scrubs, grabbed their banner and tossed it over the fence. He then yelled at them saying he had to get to work.\n\nHere\u2019s another angle, showing more of what happened.\n\nHah. This is so good dude, I\u2019m so glad to see the view from below. pic.twitter.com/XuMavivG4q \u2014 Micah|Micycle \ud83c\udf83 (@Micycle444) October 19, 2019\n\nThe folks who took that video watching from above cheered the man.\n\nAbout nine million have already shared the first video and there isn\u2019t a lot of sympathy for the Extinction Rebellion folks who\u2019ve managed to tick off most people everywhere.\n\nTwitchy caught some of the responses.\n\nBeyond that is a form of tyranny! I decide something is a problem and what has to be done to fix it and everyone else is going to do as I decide or I will interrupt their lives! This thinking is how tyrants use useful idiots to place them in power! \u2014 Indy Visualist (@IVisualist) October 19, 2019\n\nThe guy could be a surgeon on his way to an open chest heart surgery. Patients could be literally dying waiting for him to show up and save their lives. I would be mad too. \u2014 Artifical AI (@AiArtifical) October 19, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve watched this like 15 times and I love it more every time I watch it. \u2014 Cody Lockhart (@lockhart_uk) October 18, 2019\n\nThis may win funniest video of the week.
