Medicaid spending already represented an enormous and ever-growing share of the state budget, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had taken steps to keep the program in check.\n\nThen things changed.\n\nAs Mr. Cuomo was locked in a bitterly fought Democratic primary last year, his campaign asked the association, one of Albany\u2019s most influential and richest power centers, to make a major donation to the State Democratic Party, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe hospital association wrote two checks for the state party, totaling more than $1 million, campaign finance reports show. It was twice as much as the association, which represents New York City\u2019s biggest health care institutions , had given to any campaign in at least a decade.", "description": "Gov.
