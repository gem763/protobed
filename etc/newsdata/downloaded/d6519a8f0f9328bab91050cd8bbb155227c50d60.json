In which case, her advice is to \u201cdrink more water, eat less salt, and sleep propped up on a couple of pillows,\u201d so the fluid does not collect in the under-eye area. She also suggests using an eye cream, like First Aid Beauty Eye Duty Triple Remedy, containing caffeine since it constricts blood vessels and can, therefore, keep the fluid from accumulating. Eye bags are also generally caused by the skin losing elasticity over time and sagging. \u201cCold tea-bag compresses can also be helpful because both the caffeine and the cold can constrict blood vessels.\u201d\n\nHowever, she notes that if your eye bags are pretty much constant, it is more likely the result of the fat pads under the eyes drooping as you age.
