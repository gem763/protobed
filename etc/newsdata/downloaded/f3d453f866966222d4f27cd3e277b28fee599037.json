We'll relish that opportunity. As young men, they've got a chance to create something really special.\"\n\nGatland admitted, however, that he had been hastily preparing a farewell speech before substitute Ross Moriarty's late try, converted by Dan Biggar, broke French hearts.\n\n\"You start going through lots of different emotions -- what I'm going to say in here, what I'm going to be saying on the TV,\" he smiled.\n\n\"You're thinking of those potential scenarios. Definitely went through a lot of emotions today, but I'm really proud of how we hung in there.\"\n\nWales came into the quarter-final desperate to atone for their traumatic 9-8 semi-final defeat by France eight years ago.\n\nThat encounter in Auckland also featured a red card, with then Welsh captain Sam Warburton sent off early for a tip tackle on Vincent Clerc.\n\n\"It's ironic that the last time we met in a World Cup was very similar in a one-point game as well,\" said Gatland, who kept his counsel on Vahaamahina's brain freeze.\n\n\"I don't think anyone could complain about that -- the officials dealt with it appropriately. Unfortunately that's what rugby is about,\" added the 56-year-old.\n\n\"It's heat of the moment stuff. When you've got a lot of testosterone involved that's sometimes going to happen.\"\n\nEngland are still the only northern hemisphere side to have won the World Cup after lifting the trophy in 2003, but Gatland has called for Wales to use the pain of their 2011 exit as motivation.\n\n\"I think for the players were involved in 2011, obviously it does have an advantage in terms of preparation,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to go away tonight and look at some critical areas of our game. We didn't play our best tonight but we showed great character, so that's a testament to this group of men. Credit to the players -- they never give up. They just keep fighting.\"", "description": "Wales coach Warren Gatland challenged his players to write history after dodging a bullet in a pulsating World Cup quarter-final against 14-man France.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2870/82e348c34d1341bf81e1dc729b214c4a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
