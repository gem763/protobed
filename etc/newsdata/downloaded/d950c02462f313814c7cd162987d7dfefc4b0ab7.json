There were calls in the hall for the result to go to a \u201ccard\u201d vote, which were rejected.\n\nDelegates voted in favor of a separate motion \u2014 drawn up by the National Executive Committee and backed by Corbyn \u2014 leaving a decision about how the party would campaign until a one-day special conference following a general election. They also backed another motion supporting the leadership position, which did not explicitly say the party\u2019s stance in a fresh Brexit referendum should be postponed.\n\nSupport for a Remain stance would have been seen as a direct challenge to Corbyn\u2019s authority. He has been reluctant to go for a full-throttled Remain position, arguing the party should decide at a future date based on the outcome of negotiations with Brussels.\n\nSenior shadow cabinet figures including Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry and Deputy Leader Tom Watson have both called for the party to commit to backing Remain in a fresh referendum.", "description": "Party sticks by plan to decide how to campaign in second referendum based on new Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176560146-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
