The resolution was referred to the House Rules Committee and Chairman Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said he would need to see how Pelosi handled the inquiry this week before moving forward.\n\nShortly after the vote on the resolution was announced Monday, several senior Democratic aides were struggling to explain the rationale, having been given little notice of it themselves and expressing concern about the long-term political impact it could have on the caucus\u2019 most vulnerable members.\n\nSome moderate Democrats are already anxious about the plan, after making clear to leadership that they wanted to avoid any unnecessary floor votes on impeachment.\n\nDemocrats have spent weeks fighting GOP attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of their impeachment inquiry, which has spanned dozens of interview requests and subpoenas for documents and testimony.\n\nWhite House and GOP leaders are already calling the resolution proof that Democrats\u2019 inquiry was not valid without a vote.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding,\" White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement, slamming Democrats for \"secret, shady, closed door depositions.\"\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s backtracking is an admission that this process has been botched from the start,\u201d added House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) wrote on Twitter.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was pushing for the resolution, according to multiple Democratic sources. Schiff said Monday that open hearings will be conducted by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nTop Democrats, recalling the Judiciary Committee\u2019s messy September hearing with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, are hopeful to implement detailed changes to the process to prevent future witnesses from disrupting proceedings.\n\nOne of the more significant changes, described by three Democratic sources, would allow lawmakers and staff to question witnesses for longer than House rules typically allow. Under existing House rules, lawmakers typically get five minutes apiece to question witnesses, with Republican and Democratic members alternating. The resolution would permit each side a longer, uninterrupted round of questioning that can be divided up among lawmakers and staff \u2014 similar to the way witnesses have been questioned in closed-door depositions.\n\nUnder current House rules, committees already have the option to grant the chairman and ranking Republican an additional 30 minutes of uninterrupted time, and a second option to give committee staff of each party 30 minutes apiece.\n\nOne option being discussed is providing more time for legal counsel on the committee to question witnesses once the House begins to have open hearings.\n\nMany Democrats have said the only bright spot of the Lewandowski hearing was when a Democratic lawyer for the Judiciary Committee, Barry Berke, forced Lewandowski to admit episodes of dishonesty. Changing the rules could establish clear guidelines for conducting these sessions in public.\n\nDemocrats have always hoped to wrap up their investigation by the end of the year \u2014 with many believing it will culminate in a full House vote on articles of impeachment. The resolution will mark the first floor vote on impeachment since Democrats formally launched their inquiry a month ago.\n\nThe vote could cause heartburn across the caucus, after Democrats spent weeks shooting down GOP attacks on their impeachment process. Many Democrats believed they had won the argument after Friday\u2019s ruling that validated the Democrats\u2019 strategy and made clear that no vote was needed. Judge Beryl Howell, who wrote the extensive ruling, slammed Republican arguments as \u201cat worst, red herrings and, at best, incorrect.\u201d\n\nPelosi herself said in Monday\u2019s letter that the GOP\u2019s argument that the impeachment inquiry was invalid \u201chas no merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey argue that, because the House has not taken a vote, they may simply pretend the impeachment inquiry does not exist,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\nBut Democrats now appear to be taking the precise vote that Republicans wanted: Voting to formalize the ongoing investigation.\n\nOver the last month, House Democrats have struggled with the public-facing aspect of their impeachment probe, with their caucus\u2019s own investigators wrapped up in a half-dozen secret depositions. The interviews have yielded key details, though specifics can\u2019t be made public until the panels have talked to several other witnesses, Democrats say.\n\nBut pressure is also mounting for public hearings, with Republicans taking high-profile steps \u2014 like last week\u2019s stunt in which dozens of House Republicans barged into a closed-door deposition \u2014 to underscore the closed-door nature of the inquiry so far.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

On Friday Kupperman, who served as deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, asked the courts to decide whether he\u2019s required to testify after Trump directed him to defy the subpoena.\n\nBolton, who is represented by the same lawyer, is expected to follow the same judicial directive given to Kupperman when summoned by House investigators.\n\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) plans to unveil text of the resolution by Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cAs committees continue to gather evidence and prepare to present their findings, I will be introducing a resolution to ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward, which the Rules Committee will mark up this week,\u201d McGovern said in a statement. \u201cThis is the right thing to do for the institution and the American people.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio, Burgess Everett and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/f4/78e767c148729620e79cd3252ec6/191028-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
