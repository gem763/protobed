And she\u2019s not that Scary when you know all her secrets... like how she used to pinch cash at work.\n\nWe are both from Leeds and knew each other before we got famous so it helps keeping her in check on the show knowing I\u2019ve got all the dirt.\n\nMe and Mel B are like brother and sister who bicker with each other.\n\nI know her from back when she used to work in a jeans shop when she used to steal tenners out of the till.\n\nSo I\u2019m not scared of her because I know her background and she knows my background.\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror)\n\nWe have a connection because we know each other from before we were on telly or in a pop band.\n\nI always tell people s***. I say stuff and she goes: \u201cWhy did you say that for?\u201d Don\u2019t tell me anything or I\u2019ll tell everyone, I go, \u201cYou do too\u201d, and she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m honest!\u201d But so am I!\n\nShe\u2019s more like Scary Spice on a night out. She is very honest.\n\nShe\u2019ll go about certain people, \u201cLook at her! She\u2019s the same age as us, isn\u2019t she?\u201d, I\u2019m like, \u201cJesus, man!\u201d\n\nBut she is just being honest!\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEvery time she\u2019s been naughty she just says, \u201cI\u2019m being honest!\u201d Mel has replaced Paddy McGuinness as team captain and is up against Holly Willoughby \u2013 and Holly may have met her match.\n\nThey are both really competitive. I mean, Scary Spice is Scary Spice so she\u2019s got something to prove and Holly\u2019s renowned for being competitive \u2013 and she is.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a game called box \u00admountain and I swear at one point Holly had her hand inside Mel\u2019s mouth trying to get over her.\n\nMel said that she nearly pulled her weave off.\n\nSo they are both going against each other \u2013 I can see it getting heated.\n\nWe\u2019ve recorded four shows already and I think Mel\u2019s won the most so far. Holly will pull it back \u2013 she will.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is the new team captain on ITV 2's Celebrity Juice and Keith Lemon says he has a naughty history with the star...", "authors": ["Keith Lemon", "Janine Yaqoob", "Image", "Adam Gerrard Daily Mirror", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466170.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Keith-Lemon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
