He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe Centre County Coroner\u2019s Office identified the 17-year-old as John \u201cJack\u201d Schoenig, who, according to local news reports, was a senior and hockey player at Cathedral Preparatory high school in Erie, Pa.\n\n\u201cThere were no signs of trauma on the victim and several witnesses were present when the victim became unconscious,\u201d the police report stated.

They were unveiled four months after Piazza\u2019s death in an alleged Beta Theta Pi hazing ritual in which he was forced to drink a toxic amount of alcohol and then sustained traumatic injuries in a fall down a flight of stairs, according to a grand jury report. The university implemented a zero-tolerance hazing policy, shortened the pledging process, and ended the system of Greek disciplinary self-governance, touting the new plan as \u201cunprecedented in its scope.\u201d\n\nA December 2017 grand jury report related to the Piazza case accused Penn State of turning a blind eye to drinking culture and fraternity problems, but the university has emphasized that alcohol abuse and hazing are problems at universities across the country.\n\nIn January, Penn State President Eric Barron touted \u201cencouraging\u201d signs of progress, reporting that the number of criminal cases at fraternities and the number of alcohol-related hospital visits by students had fallen since the reforms were implemented. \u201cPenn State remains steadfast in its commitment to transforming the Greek-letter community,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIn February, Piazza\u2019s parents reached a confidential out-of-court settlement with the university that included an agreement to improve safety and accountability within Greek life, according to a press release from Tom Kline, an attorney who represents the Piazzas.\n\nKline tells TIME it\u2019s too soon to draw conclusions about what led to Schoenig\u2019s death \u2014 and there is no evidence that it was linked to hazing. But he says it\u2019s a sign that \u201cthere is a lot of work to be done, not only at Penn State, but on American college campuses\u201d when it comes to addressing dangerous fraternity behavior.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing\u2014and Penn State has been dealing\u2014with an enormous cultural problem embedded in the perpetuation of risky behavior which is associated with Greek life,\u201d Kline says. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that Penn State immediately suspended the fraternity, rather than waiting.\u201d\n\nThe Chi Phi fraternity chapter will remain on an interim suspension\u2014prohibited from attending or planning events as an organization\u2014while police and university officials investigate Schoenig\u2019s death, Penn State said.\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "Penn State has suspended a fraternity after a 17-year-old died Saturday at an off-campus house allegedly occupied by fraternity members", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/penn-state-fraternity-suspended.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
