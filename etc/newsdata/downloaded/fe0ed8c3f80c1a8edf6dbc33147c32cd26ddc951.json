Why?", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m not sure how to tell you this, but here we go: I watch a lot of Family Guy. I don\u2019t remember making a conscious decision to start watching a lot of Family Guy. Basically, I met an American man who had come of age, like me, in the 2000s, when watching shows like Family Guy (i.e. cartoons for adults with a knack for political and/or crass jokes) was a harmless, kind of edgy thing to do. Then, said American man and I got married, and, like most millennial couples, we\u2019re incapable of consuming a meal together without simultaneously watching a TV show.\n\nMost nights, we try to stick to slightly more high-brow staples such as The Handmaid\u2019s Tale or Succession, but as it turns out, we\u2019re busy people! We don\u2019t always have time to watch 45 minutes to an hour of TV! This is 2019, and even keeping up with televisual output is much, much harder than it should be.\n\nCue Family Guy, an easily digestible show that can be watched out of order, any time, and without much previous knowledge. Most episodes last 20 minutes and they're pretty much self-contained. For better or worse, this junk food of the televisual world has become a larger part of my life than I ever intended.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis is why I paid attention when, last year, in the January 2019 episode \u201cTrump Guy\u201d (an interesting episode in and of itself, since it took on the Trump administration and featured Meg Griffin as a victim of sexual assault on the president\u2019s part), the show announced its intention to stop resorting to \u201cgay jokes\u201d. The way in which the decision was communicated, too, was worthy of attention. It started with a fictional Donald Trump telling Peter: \u201cMany children have learned their favourite Jewish, black, and gay jokes by watching your show over the years\u201d, to which Peter replied: \u201cIn fairness, we\u2019ve been trying to phase out the gay stuff.\u201d\n\nThis moment was great in many ways: the show acknowledged its responsibility in shaping young viewers\u2019 minds, Peter attempted to deflect the criticism with a little touch of meta humour \u2013 a Family Guy hallmark \u2013 and we were all left looking forward to a gay-joke-free future. Executive producer Alec Sulkin shared this thoughtful tidbit in an interview with TV Line around the same time: \u201cIf you look at a show from 2005 or 2006 and put it side-by-side with a show from 2018 or 2019, they\u2019re going to have a few differences. Some of the things we felt comfortable saying and joking about back then, we now understand is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nSulkin\u2019s quote might not seem extraordinary at first glance, but it\u2019s truly remarkable. Go ahead and think back to the last time in recent memory that anyone in the entertainment industry brought up their own past behaviour, acknowledged it no longer held up to today\u2019s standards, didn\u2019t get defensive, and committed to adopting a different approach in the future. All I can think of are half-hearted apologies and rehashed complaints about \u201cPC culture\u201d and how it\u2019s slowly killing the very concept of comedy. Not many actors, producers or directors ever get to the point that Sulkin seemed easily to have gotten to.\n\nBut of course, this is 2019 and we can\u2019t have anything nice, remember? So it\u2019s not exactly surprising that, in a recent season 18 episode, Family Guy appeared to do a complete 180 by reversing its stance on so-called \u201cgay jokes\u201d.\n\nTitled \u201cDisney\u2019s The Reboot\u201d, the episode sees Peter and his family trying to find a new identity for their show. Peter gets thrown into a fictional episode of Carpool Karaoke, James Corden\u2019s recurring segment on The Late Late Show, and announces he just had a threesome with two other men. He later asks the host to let him out \u201cnext to this hot guy\u201d. The sequence isn\u2019t so homophobic that it makes you want to throw your remote into your TV screen (though by all means, feel free), but it\u2019s still kind of \u201cmeh\u201d. If you\u2019re going to joke about sexuality, do it properly, and maybe make sure your quip packs enough of a punch to justify its own existence \u2013 otherwise, you\u2019re just joking about being gay for the sake of it.\n\nAfter this sequence, Peter Griffin goes back to the focus group helping him craft a Family Guy reboot, at which point someone asks him: \u201cI thought I read you guys were phasing out gay jokes?\u201d Peter shoots back: \u201cThat quote was taken out of context and widely misunderstood.\u201d\n\nAgain, on the surface, it\u2019s not enough to elicit an outraged gasp. It\u2019s just another bit of meta humour. It\u2019s almost self-deprecation on the show\u2019s writers\u2019 part \u2013 we thought we could do without \u201cgay jokes\u201d, but it turns out we just like them too much, silly us! And of course, this is Family Guy, one of several shows (see also: South Park) that has made irreverence part of its brand, meaning that any criticism of it can immediately be classified as finger-wagging.\n\nAnd yet, it must be said: what a shame, Family Guy! You were so close to getting it right! You set such a nice example of what things might look like if the entertainment industry reflected on its own practices with a sense of accountability and kindness, and then you snatched it all away.

Best comedy shows on Netflix 1/10 Elder Millenial, Iliza Shlesinger If you didn\u2019t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes. Standout line: \u201cThere\u2019s no secret [to meeting your future spouse], just so we\u2019re clear. Don\u2019t buy the books, don\u2019t buy the hype. There\u2019s no secret, OK? I\u2019m gonna be 35 when I get married. If there was a secret, I would have f****** used it. There\u2019s no secret. There\u2019s no special magic to it. I\u2019m never going to be like, \u2018GATHER ROUND, LADIES! Off the 405, lies a toad hole. You must go to it.\u2019\u201d Netflix 2/10 Nanette, Hannah Gadsby In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special \u2013 and indeed it\u2019s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she\u2019s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she\u2019s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania. Standout line: \u201cI have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it's humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.\u201d Netflix 3/10 Hard Knock Wife, Ali Wong If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you\u2019re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she\u2019s not sorry?) are gold. Standout line: \u201cNow, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he\u2019s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money\u2026 is the kind of man that doesn\u2019t like free money.\u201d Netflix 4/10 Relatable, Ellen DeGeneres After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage \u2013 and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she\u2019s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences \u2013 including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood \u2013 and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat. Standout line: [On losing her sitcom, then struggling to sell a talk-show to TV executives after coming out as a lesbian:] \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t want to buy it, because no one thought they\u2019d watch. There was this one station manager that said, and this is a quote: \u2018No one\u2019s going to watch it. No one\u2019s going to watch a lesbian during the day.\u2019 And I said \u2018Well, they weren\u2019t watching me at night. What time of day is good for a lesbian?\u2019\u201d Netflix 5/10 Son of Patricia, Trevor Noah Trevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it\u2019s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes. Standout Line: [Having established Americans\u2019 love for tacos]: \u201cWe\u2019re living through a time when we are all learning about the presidency at the same time as the president. That\u2019s never happened. How wild is that concept?

A delight through and through. Standout line: [About a romantic partner:] \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, I need to be with someone who makes me a priority. And I suppose, because you have a child, I will never be your first priority. I shall always be second.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Hah! Second? Oh\u2026 no.\u2019\u201d Netflix 7/10 Weirdo, Donald Glover Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community \u2013 and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man. Standout line: \u201cI lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base \u2013 we\u2019ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.\u2019\u201d Comedy Central / Netflix 8/10 Not Normal, Wanda Sykes There\u2019s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny \u2013 and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd. Standout line: \u201cIn the Mueller investigation, how does [Trump] not know that he\u2019s Individual Number one? Come on. Everybody who\u2019s been indicted or going to jail\u2026 Papadopoulos, Gates, Flynn, Manafort\u2026 It all says in the Mueller report that they co-conspired with Individual Number One.

Standout line: \u201cIt\u2019s a new invention called THINX. They\u2019re just this underwear that you just bleed into [during your period]. Which I guess\u2026 makes me a f****** inventor. Who knew? Should I go on Shark Tank?\u201d Netflix 10/10 Live Shows, Daniel Sloss This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the \u201cfish out of water\u201d archetype by delivering his take on the US \u2013 and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and \u2013 yes \u2013 paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off. Standout line: \u201cAs a parent \u2013 no, I\u2019m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I\u2019m white, middle-class and male, and that\u2019s what my people do.\u201d Netflix 1/10 Elder Millenial, Iliza Shlesinger If you didn\u2019t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

The \u201cPeter is gay\u201d jokes are never the most incisive in the series, and frankly, you could remove them without losing out. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s impossible (or forbidden) to joke about \u201csensitive\u201d topics such as sexuality. But if the point of your quip is the very concept that someone might be gay, one might argue that your writing is getting kind of lazy.\n\nAs aforementioned, Family Guy is currently in its 18th season. Staying abreast of our times should be a priority for the show\u2019s writers, who presumably want to see it challenge The Simpsons\u2019 longevity record someday (The Simpsons has its own issues, but the point I\u2019m trying to make here is that it\u2019s been on TV for 30 years, which makes it the longest-running scripted series in history). If Family Guy\u2019s commitment to \u201cirreverence\u201d (sometimes, \u201cirreverence\u201d is just another word for \u201cinsensitivity\u201d) takes precedence over its quest for relevance, then the show\u2019s future will be jeopardised, and rightly so.\n\nThat the show would specifically highlight the topic of \u201cgay jokes\u201d in this manner before doing a public about-face is just bizarre. How hard can it possibly be to shelve the \u201cPeter is gay\u201d punchline once and for all? In the words of Nike (I know), just do it.\n\nThat punchline is useless. It\u2019s clutter. Go full Marie Kondo and thank it for its service if you must, and then dispose of it. The world (well, maybe not the world, but at the very least the fictional town of Quahog) will be better for it.", "description": "I\u2019m not sure how to tell you this, but here we go: I watch a lot of Family Guy.
