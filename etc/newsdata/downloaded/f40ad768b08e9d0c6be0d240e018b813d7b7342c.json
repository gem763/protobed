When we applied for the application in 2015, there were six duty free stores in Seoul, but now there are 13,\u201d said a spokesperson from Doosan.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
