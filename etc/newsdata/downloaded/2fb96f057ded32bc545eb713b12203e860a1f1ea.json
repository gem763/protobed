Adam Schiff, D-Calif., welcomed the resolution\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cThe House just voted to recognize the Armenian genocide \u2014 a vote I fought for 19 years to make possible, that tens of thousands of my Armenian-American constituents have waited decades to see,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe will not be party to genocide denial. We will not be silent. We will never forget.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the Armenian genocide happened is well-accepted within academic circles. However, the Turkish government has continued to deny the culpability of their predecessors.\n\nTuesday marks the first time the full House has voted in favor of recognition. It\u2019s perhaps fueled by Congress\u2019 flagging support for Turkey after its incursion into Syria earlier this month. Turkey\u2019s attack on Syrian Kurds was precipitated by President Donald Trump\u2019s agreement with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi hinted at a connection between the recent violence and Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cThere was just an aura of what the Turks could be doing, is engaged again in genocide, by the green light that the president gave them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was sort of a callback.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry rejected the resolution in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe resolution, which has apparently been drafted and issued for domestic consumption, is devoid of any historical or legal basis,\u201d the ministry said.\n\n\u201cThose who felt defeated for not being able to forestall Operation Peace Spring would be highly mistaken should they think they could take vengeance this way,\u201d the statement said, using Turkey\u2019s name for the military operation in Syria.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 The House on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to approve a resolution acknowledging the Armenian genocide, an early 20th century event", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
