A sixth was found in Gunter Bay, in the Franz Josef Land archipelago.\n\nAlso on rt.com No warplanes or tanks: Russian military releases RELAXING VIDEO from picturesque Arctic archipelago\n\nCaptain First Class Alexei Kornis, Head of the Northern Fleet Hydrographic Service, reportedly said it\u2019s not clear what the future holds for the islands, but that nature is already taking hold of some of them and colonizing the sites with plants and birds. He said the team had also found the remains of a seal torn up by a bear, which is a promising sign for the ongoing survival of the islands.\n\nDetailing their findings to Russian media, the team said they\u2019d found a range of artifacts from polar expeditions in the 19th and 20th centuries and the remnants of a Soviet weather station on Novaya Zemlya, which was destroyed by a German Nazi u-boat in the Second World War.\n\nThe crew also admitted to having survived some uncomfortably close encounters with local wildlife at some of their research stops, including polar bears and an angry walrus.\n\nAlso on rt.com RT team nearly attacked by POLAR BEAR while making wildlife film in Russia (VIDEO)\n\nThe islands\u2019 possible existence was first flagged three years ago by engineering student Marina Migunova, who spotted them while examining satellite imagery of the region. They likely only emerged in 2014 when the glacier receded.\n\nGeologists and oceanographers are anticipating further such discoveries, as ice melts accelerate and reveal new land masses and formations.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
