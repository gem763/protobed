(Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nThere are many things that the Chinese Communist Party can control as it gears up to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic on Tuesday. It can dictate what people read and say on the Internet. It can say where people sleep and eat and drink. It decides whether they fly kites or sing karaoke.\n\nBut not even the Chinese Communist Party can control the weather \u2014 although it is trying.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Tuesday\u2019s anniversary events, authorities have turned to their usual playbook to make sure the capital\u2019s often-smoggy skies are blue for the huge military parade through Tiananmen Square, complete with fighter jets streaking multicolored smoke trails.\n\nTrucks have been banned from Beijing since Aug. 20, and all construction in the city center was forced to halt before Sept. 1. Industrial companies within 300 miles of Beijing were asked to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d control emissions or stop production. Mining activities, especially drilling and blasting, have been suspended until Oct. 7, and no one in Beijing is allowed to set off fireworks.\n\nVice Premier Hu Chunhua even visited the China Meteorological Administration and called for \u201cmeteorological support to ensure the success of the activities\u201d around the anniversary.\n\nThe meteorologists should provide \u201ctargeted services\u201d for the celebrations and have \u201cresponse plans\u201d to deal with adverse weather, Hu said.\n\n[Hong Kong protests threaten to rain on China\u2019s anniversary parade]\n\nIt has worked in the past.\n\nEven as Beijing\u2019s air quality deteriorated rapidly in recent decades, the party has tried to eliminate pollution before big events and create the semblance of clean air, ordering the factories around Beijing to grind to a halt and heavy trucks to get off the road.\n\nThe ability to clear the skies on an order has given rise to the term \u201cAPEC blue\u201d to describe a particularly bright day. It is a reference to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting that Beijing hosted in 2014, creating blue skies for the event after months of heavy pollution that often sent the Air Quality Index off the charts.\n\nDuring a China-Africa forum last year, some Beijingers started joking that it had cost them $60 billion to enjoy blue skies. That was how much China pledged in aid to African nations.\n\nBut it turns out the party can do only so much.\n\nA low-pressure front is pushing industrial and vehicle emissions from surrounding provinces into the capital, and the humidity in Beijing is converting it into \u00admoderate-to-severe pollution. As a result, heavy smog is forecast for Beijing over the coming week.\n\nBeijing has had a month of beautiful blue skies. But today, just four days before a huge parade marking the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic of China, we\u2019ve woken up to pea soup smog. And it\u2019s not forecast to improve any time soon... pic.twitter.com/rZXdYpwBW7 \u2014 Anna Fifield (@annafifield) September 26, 2019\n\nBeijing has issued its first \u201corange\u201d alert of the fall for heavy air pollution, causing schools in the capital to cancel outside activities and keep children indoors Thursday.\n\nEleven expressways in or around Beijing were completely or partially closed because of low visibility Friday, and many flights from Beijing Capital International Airport were canceled or delayed.\n\nThe city\u2019s Environmental Protection Monitoring Center on Friday forecast that air quality in central Beijing will be at \u201cunhealthy\u201d levels above 150 on the Air Quality Index for the next week \u2014 levels that are often associated with soupy skies.\n\nThis is particularly stinging given that recent efforts to curb air pollution are paying off. The Swiss firm IQAir AirVisual said this month that the Chinese capital could drop out of the list of the world\u2019s 200 most polluted cities, with concentrations of small particulates falling to their lowest level since record-keeping began in 2008.\n\nBeijing\u2019s mayor, Chen Jining, said this month that the density of PM2.5, the smallest and most dangerous particles in the air, had fallen by 43 percent since 2013. This is in large part due to a precipitous drop in coal consumption in Beijing, to about a fifth of its peak level.\n\n\u201cThe air quality in Beijing has improved continuously,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt used to be the \u2018APEC blue\u2019 or \u2018parade blue,\u2019 but blue skies have now become normal this year.\u201d\n\nTo try to make sure the skies are pristine Tuesday, the Environment Ministry has called on all municipalities to swing into emergency-response mode. The China Meteorological Administration entered \u201ca special working state\u201d on Thursday, continuing through to Wednesday, for nonstop monitoring of the parade weather.\n\n[Beijing air improves significantly in past five years, study finds]\n\nThat may not be enough.\n\nSome experts expect the authorities to start \u201ccloud seeding\u201d \u2014 spraying salt or chemicals into clouds, usually from aircraft, to encourage condensation and make it rain faster than it otherwise would.\n\n\u201cThe most likely option for Beijing is to create rain through cloud seeding one or two days before the parade,\u201d said Tian Pengfei, an atmospheric scientist at Lanzhou University in China\u2019s sandstorm-prone northwest. \u201cIf done earlier than that, air pollutants may start to accumulate again and possibly lead to a new round of smog.\u201d\n\nCloud seeding and other weather-modification measures have become relatively commonplace before big events in China.\n\nAuthorities spent $30 million shooting salt and minerals into the sky before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and then spent more than $1.2 billion between 2012 and 2017 trying to clear the skies for important events like the Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou and a Belt and Road Forum in Beijing.\n\nIn 2015, China\u2019s top economic agency announced a plan to build numerous weather-modification laboratories around Beijing. By 2020, it wanted \u201csophisticated weather-modification systems capable of increasing artificial rainfall and snowfall\u201d and giving it more control over the weather. It has not given an update on its progress.\n\nOther pollution-prone capitals such as Bangkok and Malaysia\u2019s Kuala Lumpur also use cloud seeding to try to disperse hazardous particles, and drought-afflicted areas in countries including Australia and the United States also sometimes try to induce rain in this way.\n\nBut there may be yet another quandary facing Beijing. It might not have enough clouds in which to plant the rain seeds.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the autumn in Beijing is rather dry, and we might not have enough clouds to make it rain,\u201d said Huang Binxiang, an air pollution researcher at China Agricultural University.\n\nThat would mean the meteorologists would need to try to imitate rain by spraying water from aircraft to try to wash the small particles out of the air.\n\n\u201cI have also heard some crazy proposals to use giant fans to blow away the smog,\u201d Huang said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it is impossible, but it has not worked so far as I know.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe sun sets behind Tiananmen Gate in Beijing ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
