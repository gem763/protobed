It\u2019s the Cardinals-Braves and Nationals-Dodgers to start things off tonight.\n\nThis article will outline the best daily fantasy MLB plays of the day at every position. We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe will be looking at the two-game Thursday slate beginning at 5:02 ET.\n\nPITCHER\n\nWalker Buehler - LA Dodgers (vs. Washington)\n\nNailing down a starting pitcher can be difficult in the playoffs. We should see the starters have a longer leash tonight than the last two Wild Card games earlier in the week, but there\u2019s still potential for the bullpen to enter early in a five-game series with several days of rest in between. Buehler checks in as the top option, holding a -175 moneyline designation at home. He has been somewhat up-and-down over his past few starts, but the Dodgers\u2019 righty is still generating plenty of swinging strikes. I believe he can deliver 5-6 quality innings with more than a strikeout per frame tonight. He\u2019ll have a good chance to earn a victory as well.\n\nAlso Consider: Dallas Keuchel\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nFreddie Freeman - Atlanta (vs. St. Louis)\n\nStory continues\n\nAtlanta carries the highest run-scoring projection of the night, which doesn\u2019t say much with four teams facing quality pitchers. However, we are looking for any advantage we can get, and the Braves\u2019 offense should be on your radar through all formats. Freeman and company will step in against St. Louis RHP Miles Mikolas, who holds a vulnerable .331 wOBA split to left-handed bats this season. That\u2019s one of the highest splits of any pitcher taking the bump tonight, and Freeman is a prime candidate to take advantage.\n\nAlso Consider: Paul Goldschmidt, David Freese (punt)\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nEnrique Hernandez - LA Dodgers (vs. Washington)\n\nI really like Ozzie Albies at second base for the same reasons listed in Freeman\u2019s write-up above. However, the Atlanta infielder is somewhat pricey on most DFS sites, leading me to Hernandez as an economical choice. The Dodgers\u2019 utility man should get the start with LHP Patrick Corbin taking the bump for Washington. Hernandez is a platoon hitter who could scrape together a base hit or two, putting him in the conversation as a bargain filler.\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJustin Turner - LA Dodgers (vs. Washington)\n\nTurner is a confident choice for cash games, as he\u2019ll hold the platoon advantage over Nationals LHP Corbin. Not only that, but Turner holds solid numbers (12-32, .375) in his career against Corbin. Sure, the lefty pitcher had some rough years in Arizona, but Turner is a steady hitter who should be able to deliver in this matchup. Holding a premium lineup spot within this mighty Dodgers\u2019 offense doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nAlso consider: Tommy Edman\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nPaul DeJong - St. Louis (at Atlanta)\n\nTo be completely honest, shortstop doesn\u2019t have many inspiring DFS plays tonight. Trea Turner is overpriced for the matchup, and Corey Seager is locked into a difficult lefty/lefty draw. That leaves Paul DeJong as an interesting alternative with a cheaper price point. He\u2019ll step in against Atlanta LHP Dallas Keuchel, who held a .339 wOBA split to right-handed bats this season.\n\nAlso Consider: Dansby Swanson\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nMarcell Ozuna - St. Louis (at Atlanta)\n\nOzuna has always been tremendous against left-handed pitching, dating back to his days in Miami. He\u2019ll have a chance to flex that upside against LHP Keuchel\u2019s aforementioned .339 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Ozuna has tallied multiple hits in three of his last five starts, and I\u2019m confident he can deliver tonight.\n\nMatt Joyce - Atlanta (vs. St. Louis)\n\nJoyce is a bargain filler to help tie your lineup together. He should hold a respectable lineup spot in Atlanta\u2019s order, and the Braves represent the highest run-scoring projection of the night. It was highlighted earlier, but RHP Mikolas\u2019 .331 wOBA split to left-handed bats should feed directly into Joyce\u2019s wheelhouse.\n\nAlso consider: Ronald Acuna, A.J.
