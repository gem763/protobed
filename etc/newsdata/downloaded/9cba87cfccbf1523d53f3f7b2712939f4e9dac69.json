The sudden shake-up comes as the president faces pressing decisions on difficult foreign policy issues. (Sept. 11) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 National Security Council officials, who could provide greater detail about how President Donald Trump withheld military aid for Ukraine while urging the investigation of his political rival, are scheduled for depositions in Week 6 of the House impeachment investigation.\n\nTimothy Morrison, the NSC senior director for Europe and Russia, was mentioned repeatedly in earlier testimony of security and diplomatic officials about Trump withholding nearly $400 million that Congress had approved, under the condition that Ukraine announce an investigation of Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear Morrison or other administration witnesses will appear for the private depositions before the the the three key committees investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine: Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform.\n\nFormer aides have testified and current administration officials have answered questions under subpoena. But the White House notified the House on Oct. 8 that the administration would no longer cooperate with the impeachment inquiry that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared Sept. 24. The witness scheduled for Monday, a former deputy national security adviser, filed a federal lawsuit Friday asking a judge to decide whether he should obey the president's order not to testify or the House's subpoena to appear.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution: Trump's 'right to do whatever I want?' Or a road map for impeachment?\n\nTestimony over the last three weeks described Trump delegating oversight of Ukraine to his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in a back-channel to the State Department. Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to declare an investigation of the Bidens while withholding aid.\n\nDemocrats conducting the investigation contend Trump could be impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of justice for the Ukraine trade-off. But Trump has insisted he was absolutely justified in urging Ukraine to conduct investigations because he didn\u2019t want to waste money on a corrupt government. The president has called the impeachment inquiry led by Democrats a partisan \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and compared it to a lynching.\n\nTrump, for his part, will hold a political rally Friday for a gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi.\n\nWhistleblower:Watchdogs rebuke DOJ's handling of whistleblower letter at heart of Trump impeachment probe\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during the 9th annual Shale Insight Conference at the David L.

But if he defies the House subpoena, he could impede their constitutional duty to investigate potential impeachment and could be subject to criminal penalties for contempt. Kupperman said he didn't take a position on whether the executive or legislative branch should prevail, but that the judicial branch should resolve the dispute.\n\nThe chairmen of the three committees \u2014 Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y, of Foreign Affairs; Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of Intelligence; and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., of Oversight \u2014 wrote Kupperman a letter Saturday saying the lawsuit was meritless and warning that his defiance of the subpoena could be evidence of contempt. The three said the deposition would start on time and he should be there.\n\n\u201cDr. Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit\u2014lacking in legal merit and apparently coordinated with the White House\u2014is an obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\nLindsey Graham: S.C. senator introduces resolution condemning Democrats impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nTuesday: More from the NSC\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council director for European affairs, is scheduled Tuesday.\n\nWednesday: A view from Defense\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs, is scheduled Wednesday.\n\nThursday: Unraveling Ukraine policy\n\nMorrison could provide more detail Thursday about what Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told the House inquiry last week.\n\nTaylor said Morrison told him during an August phone call that the \u201cpresident doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all,\u201d referring to nearly $400 million in military aid that Congress appropriated for Ukraine.\n\n\"That was extremely troubling to me,\u201d said Taylor, who had warned Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he would resign if the U.S. didn\u2019t strongly support Ukraine.\n\nTaylor's Aug. 22 conversation with Morrison was sandwiched between Trump\u2019s July 25 call to Zelensky, when the president urged an investigation of the Bidens, and the White House release of a summary of the call Sept. 25, when Taylor learned of its details.\n\nGOP protest: Republicans say Trump impeachment probe is happening in 'secret,' but 47 GOP lawmakers have access\n\nFriday: Trump political rally\n\nThere are no planned depositions in the impeachment inquiry on Friday.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s campaign has scheduled a Friday rally in Tupelo, Miss., to stump for Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, the Republican nominee for governor.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/28/trump-impeachment-inquiry-nsc-aides-ukraine-military-aid/4086106002/", "description": "The House impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump summoned National Security Council aides to ask about withholding Ukraine military aid", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Published A.M.
