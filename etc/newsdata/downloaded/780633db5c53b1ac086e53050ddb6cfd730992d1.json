Meanwhile, creative and social skills such as leadership, analytical thinking and technology design were increasingly in demand.\n\nThe report's authors also highlighted a slew of capabilities and skills typically seen in people with dyslexia that would be vital to all industries by the year 2022.\n\nThey included leadership, social influence, creativity, initiative and idea generation.\n\n\"Overall, our analysis shows that competencies for a significant number of jobs in the workplace that dyslexic individuals may typically find challenging will largely be impacted by forms of automation,\" the report's authors said.\n\n\"In their place, enhanced tasks and new jobs will be created that match closely to the strengths of dyslexic thinking. Dyslexia could provide an opportunity for organizations to bridge the skills gap of the future.\"", "description": "Dyslexic people have a range of skills that will be required in the workplaces of the future, according to consultancy EY.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105320645-1531406404595gettyimages-728759387.jpg?v=1571056173", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
