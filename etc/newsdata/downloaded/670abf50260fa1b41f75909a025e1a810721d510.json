Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, and lawyers from the division\u2019s Fraud Section met with Giuliani to discuss a bribery case in which he and other attorneys were representing the defendants.\n\nThat meeting took place before the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan publicly charged the two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, with breaking campaign finance laws and trying to unlawfully influence politicians, including former Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. Parnas and Fruman were part of Giuliani\u2019s effort to push Ukraine for an inquiry into Democrats.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
