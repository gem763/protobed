(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) in May will launch its HBO Max streaming service with a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series at the current HBO price of $15 a month in an aggressive move to battle Netflix, Disney and Apple for the future of TV.\n\nThe logo for WarnerMedia's new HBO Max service is seen in this handout photo obtained on October 25, 2019. WarnerMedia/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nThe price, which many expected to be higher, surprised the financial analysts and investors attending the WarnerMedia presentation on Tuesday.\n\nHBO Max is expected to reach 75 million to 90 million global subscribers by 2025, with about 50 million of these coming from the United States. The new service is expected to generate about $5 billion in U.S. revenue by 2025.\n\nThe stakes are high for AT&T, which is saddled with debt from a $134 billion acquisition spree to combine media conglomerate Time Warner and satellite TV provider DirecTV with the second-largest U.S. wireless phone company by subscribers.\n\nThe success of HBO Max is in many ways a referendum on a strategy to merge content with the means to distribute it.\n\nHBO, which invented high-end, subscription programming, is playing catch-up in the streaming era dominated by Netflix.\n\nTo compete, AT&T has committed to invest up to $4 billion in additional HBO Max content by 2025, executives said, just a day after reporting tepid media results for the third quarter.\n\nThe investment falls far short of its biggest rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), which has earmarked $15 billion in cash on content spending in 2019. But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives believe they have content and ways to get it in front of consumers that are lacking at Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O).\n\nWarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey this month told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States \u2014 a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers \u2014 at no extra charge.\n\n\u201cThe price point of $14.99 for HBO Max strikes a good balance between not cannibalizing HBO\u2019s existing revenue base, while also addressing the competitive environment in streaming television,\u201d said Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners and a portfolio manager at the firm, which owns about 3.5 million shares of AT&T. \u201cThe HBO Max content offering is extremely robust and I think it will be well received by investors and consumers.\u201d\n\nNOT WALMART\n\nFrom Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, executives demonstrated the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia\u2019s extensive library of films and TV series. They included the entire collection of DC Universe superhero film franchises from the last decade such as \u201cBatman\u201d and recent box office hits such as \u201cJoker\u201d that will be available within the first year of its launch. WarnerMedia also secured the U.S. streaming rights to \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\n\nTo court new viewers, WarnerMedia executives said they will introduce 88 original series in 2021, 38 from HBO and 50 under the category it called \u201cMax Originals\u201d that will target younger audiences.\n\nExecutives announced a batch of new shows from high-profile producers and directors including \u201cRaised by Wolves\u201d by \u201cAlien\u201d filmmaker Ridley Scott about androids raising human children and \u201cCollege Girls\u201d from comedian, actress and writer Mindy Kaling.\n\nAhead of the presentation, HBO canceled a much-anticipated prequel to the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d starring Naomi Watts, one source familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in Hollywood media.\n\nInstead, WarnerMedia executives announced 10 episodes of a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel called \u201cHouse of Dragons.\u201d The series will be set 300 years before the events of the just-concluded series and is based on author George R.R. Martin\u2019s book \u201cFire & Blood.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d \u2014 and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming \u2014 it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that launches Nov. 12.\n\nAnd as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.\n\nWarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO\u2019s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.\n\n\u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is uniquely HBO Max,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said.", "description": "AT&T Inc in May will launch its HBO Max streaming service with a new \"Game of Thrones\" series at the current HBO price of $15 a month in an aggressive move to battle Netflix, Disney and Apple for the future of TV.", "authors": ["Helen Coster", "Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446325076&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0SC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
