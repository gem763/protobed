REUTERS/Mark Kauzlarich\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday called on all countries to resist China\u2019s demands to repatriate ethnic Uighurs, saying Beijing\u2019s campaign in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang was an \u201cattempt to erase its own citizens.\u201d\n\nU.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote Xinjiang region.\n\n\u201cFurther on the subject of terrorism, I want to make clear that China\u2019s repressive campaign in Xinjiang is not about terrorism. It\u2019s about China\u2019s attempt to erase its own citizens. ...We call on all countries to resist China\u2019s demands to repatriate the Uighurs,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nHe made the comments after a meeting with the foreign ministers of five Central Asian countries - Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan - in New York ahead of the United Nations General Assembly this week, during which Washington is expected to confront China over the issue.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan will host an event on Tuesday on the \u201chuman rights crisis in Xinjiang\u201d in China, diplomats said on Friday.\n\nThe United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang.
