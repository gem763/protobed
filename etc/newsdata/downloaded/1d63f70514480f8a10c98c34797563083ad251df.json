The referendum commission did not respond to questions why China, a major financier to PNG and the region, did not contribute. was regarded as a strategic location during World War Two, hosting several naval aircraft bases of the occupying imperial Japanese army.\n\nIts referendum is part of a peace process negotiated at the end of a decade-long conflict in 1998 largely focused on how to allocate profit from the now shuttered Panguna gold and mine, then run by a forerunner of Rio Tinto .\n\nThere was also discord over the environmental impact of the mining operations.\n\nThe conflict between Bougainville's rebel guerrilla army and PNG forces killed as many as 20,000, the worst violence in the region known as Oceania since the Second World War.\n\nSince the conflict, there has been little development in the resource-rich region, the former economic powerhouse of PNG.\n\nWhile the referendum is expected to overwhelmingly back independence, Australian think tank the Lowy Institute says, there is uncertainty over how an independent Bougainville could fund itself, as it now relies on support from PNG.\n\nThe final step would be a vote in parliament after separation terms are agreed.\n\n\"The outcome of the referendum will have to be firstly ratified by the Papua New Guinea national parliament,\" Wera Mori, the commerce and industry minister, told Reuters in an interview. \"It would be subjected to a negotiated outcome.\"\n\n($1=3.4904 kinas)\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2MEUkvi\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "U.S. edges China out of race to fund Bougainville independence vote", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
