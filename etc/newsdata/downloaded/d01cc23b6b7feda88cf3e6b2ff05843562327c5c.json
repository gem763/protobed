Simon and George Pelecanos, the show\u2019s co-creator, are connecting all the ways in which the sex industry has changed since 1971, the year the series opens on. All of Simon\u2019s most didactic impulses are on display in the early episodes of the new season, which riff on the cynicism of pornography in 1985, the efforts by Mayor Ed Koch to clean up Times Square, anti-porn protests in the feminist movement, and the AIDS crisis. More than ever, the show feels like a homily on the vulnerability of humans as commodities, whether they\u2019re sex workers, film directors, or grunts in a mafiosi power pyramid. But something, at this point in the show\u2019s life, has been lost. There\u2019s no charge in the way two people look at each other anymore; no sense of ambition; no motivation, even. Desire has left the Deuce.\n\nIn some ways, this is a natural response both to the show\u2019s chronological leaps and to its subject matter. Season 1 started in 1971, as gangsters and pimps jostled for control of the Times Square sex business and pornography was innocent enough to employ Campbell\u2019s potato soup as a prop. Season 2 jumped to 1977, at the height of porn\u2019s so-called golden age. While The Deuce has made no efforts to age its characters or even advance their biographies much during the 14-year period it spans, it makes clear in Season 3 that a decade and a half of selling sex (in one way or another) has taken a lot from them. Vinnie is mired in mob life, beaten down and joyless. The adult-film star Lori (Emily Meade), fresh out of rehab, seems almost comically bored by the idea of getting back to work. Paul (Chris Coy) appears barely able to generate an emotional response to the fact that his partner is dying of AIDS. Eileen (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has always been the show\u2019s most fascinating character, radiating sparks of creative energy as she finds her niche as a director, but even she\u2019s lost momentum. The only character still marshaling any enthusiasm is Frankie, Vinnie\u2019s feckless twin (also played by Franco), so unaltered in his smirking ability to irritate that he\u2019s starting to feel like The Deuce\u2019s very own Dorian Gray.\n\nThe Deuce is still an interesting show in the first three episodes; it\u2019s still sporadically a funny one. (\u201cMy client wants to change her line,\u201d Lori\u2019s agent says in one scene, in which Lori objects to her dialogue while playing a high-school teacher. \u201cShe can know who George Washington is and still fuck.\u201d) But a side effect of the show\u2019s state of ennui is that its most compelling element\u2014a willingness to explore the strange humanity of its characters\u2019 kinks and impulses\u2014has been left behind. When Eileen meets a stranger (Corey Stoll) in a bar, the scene offers no sense of what she sees in him, no sharp spike of interest. A later episode makes clear what she doesn\u2019t want from him, but never what she does. When Vinnie takes his ex-wife (Zoe Kazan) back to his apartment to have sex with her, the scene is so rote and dismal that it feels almost like an obligation. Abby (Margarita Levieva), a curious, empathetic NYU dropout and and advocate for sex workers who\u2019s been stuck running the same deadbeat bar for 14 years, has a similar lack of chemistry with a street artist she meets at a gallery, even though it\u2019s obvious where their story line is headed.", "description": "David Simon\u2019s show about the sex industry has lost all its curiosity about what humans want.", "authors": ["Sophie Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/293acbd4e80d3e7cdea31096e702f3fe86c19e35118f6a4e560d717bdf8af9c222f4a7ed91ad7ea8eea1a155fc6a19a4/facebook.jpg?1568222341", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
