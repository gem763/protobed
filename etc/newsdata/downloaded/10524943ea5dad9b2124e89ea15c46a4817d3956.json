The election is the first to be held since the current anti-government protests started.\n\nWong accused the Hong Kong government on Tuesday of accepting \u201ca political mission handed down from Beijing\u201d by banning him from the polls.\n\nThe Hong Kong election officer wrote in her reasoning that Wong\u2019s concept of self-determination does not rule out the independence of Hong Kong as an option, which she deemed inconsistent with the Basic Law, the city\u2019s mini-constitution.\n\nWong and his party, Demosisto, have denied supporting independence for the city.\n\nThey say they advocate self-determination and a referendum for Hong Kong people to decide how they want to be governed.\n\nLast year, Agnes Chow, another young pro-democracy leader from Wong\u2019s party, was barred from standing in by-elections because her party advocates self-determination for Hong Kong.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 Beijing expressed \u201capproval and support\u201d Wednesday for the disqualification of Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/bb2cd7_joshua-wong-has-barred-standing-in-upcoming-local-elections-in-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
