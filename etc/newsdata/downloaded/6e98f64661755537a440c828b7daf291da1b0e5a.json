When that day comes, she plans to be among the cyclists at the starting line.\n\nThe 15-year-old is a newly minted member of the SHKP Supernova Cycling Team, which has nurtured some of the city\u2019s top cycling stars.\n\nNational Youth Games winner and Lam Tai Fai College student finds her passion in cycling\n\nAs she tells Young Post, Lily saw an opportunity to join the winning team six months ago, when she was looking for a cycling crew near her new home in Sha Tin.\n\nWith the team\u2019s training centre just one MTR stop away, Lily knew it was the perfect choice. She sailed through the selection trial and made the list.\n\n\u201cWhen I was searching for a new team, I was looking at race results, and SHKP Supernova has always been at the top in competitions,\u201d she adds.\n\nAs one of the few non-local cyclists on the team, Lily says her teammates always go out of their way to make sure she feels included. They translate the motivational speeches given by the coaches so she can share in the team spirit.\n\nLily has a lucky pair of cycling socks that she bought while training in Taiwan.

But she wanted proof, and nothing speaks louder than competition results.\n\nIn May, one month after she joined the team, Lily was crowned champion in the women youth age 11-16 category at the Hong Kong Road Cycling Race: Series 6.\n\nIt was the proof she needed of her potential in cycling, and of the difference that training had made to her performance.\n\nHow cycling changed my life: one Hong Kong teen\u2019s transformation from 'bad apple' to passionate athlete\n\n\u201cTraining with a team has taught me to read a cycling pack \u2013 the cyclists riding together in a group during a race. I have to identify the slow and fast ones, and decide which group I\u2019m going with,\u201d explains Lily.\n\nIn addition to an effective training strategy, Lily stays on top of her game thanks to a strict timetable.\n\nThe Island School student says that unlike some of her teammates, who might skip training to do schoolwork or prepare for exams, she makes sure she gets her work done outside her training hours.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky that my school has allowed me to do homework during PE lessons, or sometimes I stay up late to finish my work,\u201d says Lily.\n\nHeep Yunn School triathlete on ruining her own chances to compete at the Youth Olympic Games and the lesson it taught her\n\nBut her definition of \u201cstay up late\u201d may not be the same as that of her peers, as Lily never goes to bed later than 10pm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going to bed at 8.30pm since I was a kid. I think sleeping so early does help me in sports, because recovery is really important.\u201d\n\nWhile the Year 10 student has gotten off to a flying start with her new team, she knows she\u2019ll need to work hard if she wants to maintain her winning streak.\n\nRight now, her weakest area is the final sprint, where cyclists ride as fast as possible for the last 300 to 400 metres of the race. The teen believes her lack of competition experience makes it difficult to know the right time to start sprinting.\n\nLily Sheary joined the SHKP Supernova Cycling Team 6 months ago. Photos: Kelly Ho/SCMP\n\n\u201cI remember I was leading in one race, but I was overtaken by others in the last bit and I came fourth,\u201d she says.\n\nTo gain more experience, Lily spent part of her summer holiday training in Europe, where she was able to compete in local tournaments.\n\nOne unexpected discovery she made during her trip was that European cyclists tend to be quite aggressive, often yelling at each other during races, which Lily says made the competitions more intense and entertaining.\n\n7 new records set at Hong Kong Interschool Swimming Competition, including two by Olympic hopefuls\n\n\u201cThey would say things like \u2018Move out of my way!\u2019, which is quite different from the way cyclists behave in Hong Kong; it is much calmer here,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut overall, it was a really good experience, and I\u2019m hoping to go back next year.\u201d\n\nBut nothing could beat the thrill of watching the Tour de France live, which Lily was lucky enough to do while she was in Europe. She has since set a goal for herself: to take part in the women\u2019s race in five years\u2019 time, if possible.\n\n\u201cThe race was so cool and fun to watch. If they do start a women\u2019s race, I\u2019ll definitely go and do that.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "When it comes to career goals, Lily Sheary believes in dreaming big; luckily, the 15-year-old has the talent to match", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/a1768c54-f08a-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires114613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
