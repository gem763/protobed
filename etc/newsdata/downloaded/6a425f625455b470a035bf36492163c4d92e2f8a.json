new lease of life", "language": "en", "text": "Trash to treasure: Everest garbage given new lease of life\n\nA group of tourists sip water at a five-star hotel in Kathmandu, unaware that the green glasses in their hands were once bottles discarded on Mount Everest \u2014 left by climbers eager to make their ascent.\n\nIn homes across the Nepali capital upcycled items, from pots to lamps, crafted from Mount Everest waste products are slowly making their way as authorities and businesses look for fresh ways to tackle the damage caused by decades of commercial mountaineering.\n\nTonnes of garbage \u2014 including empty cans and gas canisters, bottles, plastic and discarded climbing gear \u2014 litter the mountain, which has been dubbed the \u201chighest dumpster in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cWaste doesn\u2019t need to be wasted,\u201d Nabin Bikash Maharjan of local recycling organisation Blue Waste to Value (BW2V) told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe received a mix of materials from Mount Everest \u2014 aluminium, glass, plastic, iron \u2014 much of which could be recycled,\u201d he explained, adding: \u201cWe need to up-cycle and add value to them.\u201d\n\nAfter heavy criticism for the condition of one of its greatest natural resources, Nepal\u2019s government and mountaineering groups this year organised a six-week clean-up.\n\nScaling almost 8,000 metres (26,300 feet) from base camp to the closest camp to the summit, a 14-strong team retrieved more than 10 tonnes of garbage that was flown or driven to recycling centres in Kathmandu.\n\nWorkers there manually sorted the materials \u2014 each type following a different path to rebirth: Iron was sent to rod manufacturing firms, shredded aluminium cans to utensil makers, and discarded bottles re-fashioned into household items.\n\n\u201cWaste is a taboo in our society, considered as dirt,\u201d mused Ujen Wangmo Lepcha of Moware Designs, which upcycles rubbish into light fixtures and glasses.\n\n\u201cWhen they see these kind of products they are like \u2018wow\u2019, these things can be made and it is possible,\u201d she explained.\n\nTheir products are now used in upmarket hotels, restaurants, and homes around the capital, and Lepcha says there is growing consumer interest in goods made from salvaged Mount Everest scraps.\n\nAanchal Malla of Hotel Yak & Yeti, a luxury five-star hotel in Kathmandu, said opting for the upcycled goods was in-line with the hotel\u2019s move towards sustainable and environmentally friendly products.\n\n\u201cIt is not just better for us and the environment but then it goes way bigger than that\u2026 it is encouragement of everyone who is trying to move into that direction of making the globe into a better place, reducing all the waste,\u201d Malla said.\n\nA new waste facility \u2014 called Sagarmatha Next after the Nepali name for Mount Everest \u2014 is also being completed in Syangboche at an altitude of nearly 3,800 metres (12,400 feet), passed by trekkers and mountaineers on the way to the base camp.\n\nIt will process garbage, and collaborate with artists and innovators to make new products in a bid to tap into this burgeoning market for Everest \u2018products\u2019.\n\n\u2018Everest polluters must pay\u2019\n\nBut mountaineers warn that this year\u2019s clean-up collected just a fraction of Mount Everest\u2019s rubbish \u2014 with the higher and harder to reach camps still littered by abandoned gear.\n\nMelting glaciers, caused by global warming, are revealing years-old waste but as the number of climbers attempting to summit soars so do the environmental challenges.\n\nEleven climbers died in the 2019 Mount Everest season, with industry insiders criticising Nepal for issuing a record 381 permits \u2014 leading to high numbers on the mountain and bottlenecks to the summit.\n\nNot all the bodies can be brought down so corpses too lie abandoned on the slopes.\n\nWater sources downstream of the 8,848-metre Himalayan peak have been contaminated by everything from human excrement to empty gas canisters.\n\nLocals say some big-spending foreign climbers \u2014 it costs at least $30,000 to tackle Everest \u2014 pay little attention to the ugly footprint they leave behind, even when given financial incentives.\n\nSix years ago, Nepal implemented a $4,000 rubbish deposit per team, to be refunded if each climber brought down at least eight kilogrammes (18 pounds) of waste, but only half of them returned with their trash.\n\nIn August, the Mount Everest region municipality announced it would ban some single-use plastics and drinks in plastic bottles from the area from early 2020.\n\nCommunity NGO Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, along with BW2V and other agencies, recently launched a campaign to transport waste to recycling centres by harnessing the roughly 50,000 trekkers and their guides who visit the region every year \u2014 not all attempt the summit but many travel to base camp.\n\nThey are each asked to carry a one kilogram (2.2 pounds) pouch of processed garbage to Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region, or Kathmandu for recycling.\n\n\u201cWe have to work year after year to make a real impact,\u201d Ang Dorje Sherpa of the committee told AFP, but warned that recycling alone was not the solution.\n\n\u201cIn the long-term we need is to minimise the trash (garbage) at the source, and make the polluters responsible for the cleaning.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A group of tourists sip water at a hotel in Kathmandu, unaware that
