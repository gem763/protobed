But it\u2019s just the beginning of the journey from the black market to \u201ccannabis 3.0.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Down to Business has focused on business issues with a political twist. This week, host Emily Jackson discusses the cannabis industry\u2019s one-year legalization anniversary with Bruce Linton, the former chief executive of Canopy Growth, Canada\u2019s largest cannabis company.\n\nLinton discusses lessons from the first round of legalization for recreational use, what to expect from the impending introduction of cannabis infused beverages and edibles, and why Canada needs to focus on \u201ccannabis 3.0\u201d if it wants to be a global leader.\n\nYou can listen below \u2014 or on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher and Google Play, where you can also subscribe to get new episodes every Wednesday morning.\n\nIf you have any questions about the show, or if there are topics you want us to tackle, email us: downtobusiness@postmedia.com.", "description": "Episode 25 of the weekly podcast from the Financial Post", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bruce-linton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
