But he struggled to explain how his comments Sunday were not at odds with what he said last week.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people are saying that I said, but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said, adding that he had outlined \u201ctwo reasons\u201d for withholding the aid to Ukraine in a news briefing with reporters on Thursday. In the briefing, however, he outlined three reasons: the corruption in the country, whether other countries were also giving aid to Ukraine and whether Ukrainian officials were cooperating in a Justice Department investigation.\n\nMr. Wallace played back Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s appearance before reporters in which he said the president\u2019s concern about interference in the 2016 election \u2014 and his interest in a widely debunked theory that a Democratic National Committee server is being held in Ukraine \u2014 was part of that final reason for withholding aid.", "description": "The acting White House chief of staff admitted he did not have a \u201cperfect press conference,\u201d but said the administration did not tie military aid to investigating Democrats.", "authors": ["Katie Rogers", "Emily Cochrane"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/nyregion/20dc-mulvaney/20dc-mulvaney-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
