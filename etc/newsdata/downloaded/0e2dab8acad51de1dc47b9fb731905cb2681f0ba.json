Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer and a central figure in the Ukraine controversy, was aware of the statement, as was a top aide to Zelensky, The Times reported.\n\nVolker resigned from his position last week after his name was mentioned in an explosive whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint said Trump pressured Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Biden is one of the 2020 Democratic frontrunners and Trump's chief political rival.\n\nTrump and his allies denounced the complaint as a political hit job, but most of its details have been corroborated by a memo of the phone call the White House put out last month.\n\nRevelations about the draft statement add yet another layer to questions about whether the president used his official position for personal gain. Things for Trump are further complicated by the fact that the US decided to withhold a nearly $400 million military aid package to Ukraine just days before the July phone call.\n\nWhile the White House's notes on the call showed that Trump did not directly mention offering aid in exchange for Zelensky's assistance in investigating the Bidens, they confirmed that Trump brought up how the US does \"a lot for Ukraine\" right before asking Zelensky to do him a \"favor, though\" by investigating Biden and discrediting the former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nBoth those issues were at the center of the draft statement by Volker and Sondland, according to The Times. Specifically, it would have committed Ukraine to investigating the company Burisma Holdings, whose board Biden's son sat on until earlier this year.\n\nIt also would have called for the Ukrainian government to look into unsubstantiated conspiracy theories suggesting that it was not Russia, but Ukraine that interfered in the 2016 election, and that it did so to help then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nVolker testified to Congress on Thursday as part of the impeachment probe. During the hearing, he revealed that Bill Taylor, the US's chief diplomat in Ukraine, said it was \"crazy\" for Trump to withhold military aid in exchange for \"help with a political campaign,\" ABC News reported.\n\nTaylor is said to have made the comment in a group text with Volker and Sondland. Sondland reportedly replied that Taylor's claim was \"incorrect.\" He added that Trump had been \"crystal clear\" there was \"no quid pro quo of any kind.\"\n\nSondland then said they should end the group text, writing, \"I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\"", "description": "The statement was drafted with the knowledge of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and a top aide to Ukraine's president, The New York Times reported.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9685c25288790450217d10?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
