For the most part, the evening was full of lighthearted revelry (with no shoes thrown at anyone else this year), with Woodley, asked about her best and worst fashion-week moments, declaring, \u201cI just really love life.\u201d\n\nBut Courtney Love, \u201990s icon and Hole singer, was thinking about the environment.\n\nDressed in a plaid coat, slinky black dress, and red heels with a crocodile bag, she pointed out that while the guests around us were drinking Champagne and attempting to climb velvet stairs in stilettos, \u201cthe Amazon is BURNING.\u201d\n\nAsked how fashion week has changed in the last decade since 2009, she replied, \u201cWell, really I\u2019ve changed. No. More. Fur.\u201d But was she having more fun that she used to? \u201cI\u2019m sober now,\u201d she replied, adding that she was finally able to enjoy the shows with a clear mind. Then she asked us to reach under her coat so that we could feel her black peacock feathers \u2014 not real, we assume.", "description": "The Cut spotted \u201890s icon Courtney Love at the Harper\u2019s Bazaar ICONS party at Fashion Week Spring 2020. She talked about getting sober, giving up wearing fur, and the dissonance of partying while the Amazon rain forest is on fire.", "authors": ["Brock Colyar"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/07/07-courtney-love.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
