And honey, anything else on the f***ing menu.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s come under fire for the scene not being representative of how people are able to come out, the lack of understanding during the attempt at representation, and the mislabelling and definition of pansexuality and bisexuality.\n\nGuys, @aliwong is now on @bigmouth.
