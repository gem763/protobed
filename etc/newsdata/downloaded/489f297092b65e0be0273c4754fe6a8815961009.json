Stronger-than-expected jobs news, a solid non-manufacturing ISM number and good factory orders news is adding to the positive sentiment.\n\nWhat is most notable about the setup this morning is that sentiment has been running quite negative lately. On Tuesday the action was downright dismal following the weaker-than-expected ISM Manufacturing number that accelerated the chatter about an impending recession.\n\nWhile the news about renewed trade talks is being greeted with much skepticism, it still puts many bears in a tough spot as this news has caused a technical breakout from the recent trading range and is generating some buying momentum. There was no dip for bulls to buy after the initial gap-up open and now they are chasing the index ETFs higher.\n\nTypically this sort of action is mostly index driven initially and larger-cap names will lead. However, as it is digested, traders will start focusing more on individual stock-picking. The best way to improve performance with the indices in an uptrend is to buy high-beta individual stocks.\n\nMost of the small-caps I favor are not doing well but Shark Technical picks Micron Technology (MU) , Keysight Technologies (KEYS) and Twitter (TWTR) are looking good.\n\nThe negative and poor positioning suggests that this move has some room to run. Don't be in a rush to fight it.", "description": "Thursday's uptrend puts many bears in a tough spot as this news has caused a technical breakout from the recent trading range and is generating some buying momentum....MU", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Bears In A Tough Spot As Buying Momentum Increases", "The Best Way To Improve Performance With The Indices In An Uptrend Is To Buy High-Beta Individual Stocks.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Paul Price", "Helene Meisler", "Kevin Curran", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/4c512f31-cdee-11e9-848d-edca552e445e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
