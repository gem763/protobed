He knocked him down again 30 seconds later and finished Gvozdyk off with an overhand right.\n\nGvozdyk had been warned by Rosato after the second knockdown that the fight would be stopped if there was one more and when he took a knee after absorbing the right, Rosato had no choice but to stop it.\n\nBeterbiev was a slight underdog for the two-belt fight which marked the first time that two undefeated champions squared off in the light heavyweight division.\n\nGvozdyk, who suffered his first loss in 18 fights, was coming off a third round knockout of Doudou Ngumbu.\n\nThis was the second time the pair had clashed with Beterbiev also winning when they fought as amateurs 10 years ago. Beterbiev won that fight over a bloodied Gvozdyk by a second round stoppage.\n\nBeterbiev\u2019s next fight will be a mandatory defence against another undefeated fighter, China\u2019s Meng Fanlong. Promoter Bob Arum wants to hold that fight early next year in China around the time of the Chinese New Year.\n\nThe fight was the first world title bout since American boxer Patrick Day died on Wednesday from brain injury suffered in a fight last weekend.\n\nDay was honoured with a 10 bell salute prior to the main event.\n\nThe 27-year-old super welterweight from New York had undergone emergency brain surgery after being knocked out by Charles Conwell last Saturday at Chicago\u2019s Wintrust Arena.\n\nDay, who had been in a coma following the knockout, died surrounded by family and friends, his promoter said.\n\nThe American fighter had been carried unconscious from the ring on a stretcher on following his 10th round knockout.", "description": "Philadelphia (AFP) \u2013 Artur Beterbiev unified boxing\u2019s light heavyweight division on Friday with a 10th round stoppage of Oleksandr Gvozdyk in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/ee33a7_ibf-light-heavyweight-champion-artur-beterbiev-seized-wbc-belt-oleksandr-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
