Takeaways from the three-hour forum in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nWARREN\u2019S RISE ATTRACTS ATTACKS\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren found Tuesday that her rise in the polls may come with a steep cost. She\u2019s now a clear target for attacks, particularly from more moderate challengers, and her many plans are now being subjected to much sharper scrutiny.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg slammed her for not acknowledging, as Bernie Sanders has, that middle-class taxes would increase under the single-payer health plan both she and Sanders favor.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest with this,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the American people are wrong when they say what they want is a choice,\u201d Buttigieg told Warren. His plan maintains private insurance but would allow people to buy into Medicare.\n\nCandidates also pounced on Warren\u2019s suggestion that only she and Sanders want to take on billionaires while the rest of the field wants to protect them. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke told Warren it didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to lift people up and she is \u201cmore focused on being punitive.\u201d\n\nAnd they piled onto her signature proposal, a 2% wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it\u2019s been tried.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California even went after Warren for not backing Harris\u2019 call for Twitter to ban President Donald Trump.\n\n__\n\nTHAT 70s SHOW\n\nThe stage included three 70-something candidates who would be the oldest people ever elected to a first term as president \u2014 including 78-year-old Sanders, who had a heart attack earlier this month. Moderators asked all three how they could do the job. None really addressed the question.\n\nSanders invited the public to a major rally he\u2019s planning in New York City next week and vowed to take the fight to corporate elites.\n\nBiden promised to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses next year and said he was running because the country needs an elder statesman in the White House after Trump.\n\nWarren, whose campaign has highlighted her hours-long sessions posing for selfies with supporters, promised to \u201cout-organize and outlast\u201d any other candidate \u2014 including Trump. Then she pivoted to her campaign argument that Democrats need to put forth big ideas rather than return to the past, a dig at Biden.\n\n__\n\nONE VOICE ON IMPEACHMENT\n\nThe opening question was a batting practice fastball for the Democratic candidates: Should Trump be impeached?\n\nThey were in steadfast agreement. All 12 of them. Largely with variations on the word \u201ccorrupt\u201d to describe the president.\n\nWarren was asked first if voters should decide whether Trump should stay in office. She responded, \u201cThere are decisions that are bigger than politics.\u201d\n\nBiden, who followed Sanders, offered a rare admission: \u201cI agree with Bernie.\u201d\n\nThe only hint of dissonance came from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry. She lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party\u2019s case against him.\n\n__\n\nKLOBUCHAR: MINNESOTA NOT-SO-NICE\n\nKlobuchar has faded into the background in previous debates, but she stood out on the crowded stage.\n\nShe also went on the attack. She chided entrepreneur Andrew Yang for seeming to compare Russian interference in the 2016 election to U.S. foreign policy. But her main barbs were reserved for Warren. \u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work but, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Warren seemed to suggest other candidates were protecting billionaires, Klobuchar pounced. \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cEven the billionaire doesn\u2019t want to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nThat was a reference to investor Tom Steyer, who had agreed with Sanders\u2019 condemnation of billionaires and called for a wealth tax \u2014 despite the fact that his wealth funded his last-minute campaign to clear the debate thresholds and appear Tuesday night.\n\nKlobuchar also forcefully condemned Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds in Syria.\n\n__\n\nBOOKER THE PEACEMAKER\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has been trying to campaign on the power of love and unity. It hasn\u2019t vaulted him to the top of the polls, but it drew perhaps the biggest cheers from the crowd Tuesday night.\n\nAs candidates bickered over their tax plans, Booker shut it down. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president and how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters,\u201d he said. \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nLater, as candidates tussled over foreign policy and Syria, Booker again tried to bring the debate back to morals. \u201cThis president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire,\u201d he said, before launching into a furious condemnation of Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nThe New Jersey senator\u2019s inability to break out of the pack has puzzled Democrats who long saw him as a top-tier presidential candidate.", "description": "A dozen Democratic presidential candidates participated in a spirited debate Tuesday over health care, taxes, gun control and impeachment.
