There\u2019s probably some irony in that statistic because the Jets play the Browns this week. Of course, our superstar sophomore quarterback is out for a few weeks with mono and Le\u2019veon Bell injured his shoulder, but I\u2019ll cry more about that later. For the time being, I\u2019ll just make sure there\u2019s plenty of alcohol available on Monday night.\n\nEd: Speaking of crying, I\u2019ve been weepy over that shellacking the Steelers took in Foxboro all week. At least I started out above .500, but a 4-3 record and five bucks gets you a caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9 around here, I see. Perhaps now that we\u2019ve had a chance to take our first look at everyone\u2019s starting squad, we\u2019ll do a bit better this week \u2026 as long as we don\u2019t pick the Browns.\n\nJazz: As mentioned above, the Jets host the Browns on Monday night (Monday, 8:15 pm, ESPN) and the outlook is not bright in Mudville. The Jets were already probably going to be at even odds at best, but now Sam Darnold has mono, our new star running back has a bum shoulder and we had to recruit a new placekicker out of the parking lot. I hate doing it, but even I can\u2019t pick New York this week. I\u2019ll take Cleveland over New York, 23-9. The Steelers host the Seahawks in what should be one of the better games of the week (1:00 pm, FOX). As horrible as Pittsburgh looked at New England, I have to believe they\u2019ll shake that off. They are so much better on paper. And Seattle is good, but they\u2019re not Patriots level good. I\u2019m picking the Steelers over the Seahawks 27-17. The Vikings visit the Packers (1:00 pm, FOX) after both of them had a great opening week. Both of these teams also looked a lot better on defense than offense. I foresee a lower scoring game that may just come down to home field advantage. I\u2019ll take Green Bay over the Vikings 21-16.\n\nEd: As bad as the Pittsburgh Steelers looked last week, there were two upsides. First, it looked like execution problems rather than talent deficiencies, and execution can get fixed. At home, the Steelers will be a lot tougher, and the Seahawks didn\u2019t exactly chew up the ground either against the Bengals in Seattle last week. Steelers over Seahawks, 24-20. Green Bay looked very impressive on defense last week, and this week they\u2019re playing at home. The Vikes have a good running game, but they\u2019re better at home than on the road. Packers 17-14 over the Vikings, maybe even in OT. Finally, the NFL has put the Browns at Jets on Monday night, which might be the best expression of hope over experience anyone has seen. Even with the Browns\u2019 flop last week they\u2019re still favored by a TD, thanks to Darnold\u2019s illness and Bell\u2019s injury. I\u2019m \u2026 not so sure. I\u2019ll take the Jets 21-17 over the Browns in an upset.\n\nJazz: Here\u2019s four more games to fill out our card for the week.\n\nChargers at Lions (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 I would have picked the Chargers if they hadn\u2019t gotten more banged up than the Jets last week. As it is, the good look the Lions defense gave us should be enough to cause Philip Rivers problems. I\u2019ll go with the Lions over the Chargers 17-14 .\n\nI would have picked the Chargers if they hadn\u2019t gotten more banged up than the Jets last week.

Saints at Rams (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 These are two good teams who now have some contentious history behind them so passions will probably be running high. The Saints definitely look playoff ready to me, but they\u2019ll be flying to the west coast for this one. It\u2019s just a hunch, but I\u2019ll take the Rams over the Saints 28-24 .\n\nThese are two good teams who now have some contentious history behind them so passions will probably be running high.

Bears at Broncos (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 A fun pick, but neither of these teams looks like they\u2019re ready to put a bunch of points on the board. I\u2019ll take the Broncos over the Bears 20-12 .\n\nA fun pick, but neither of these teams looks like they\u2019re ready to put a bunch of points on the board. I\u2019ll take the . Eagles at Falcons (8:20 pm, NBC) \u2013 The Falcons wound up with a tough schedule, first running into the Vikings and now the Eagles. Sadly, with their somewhat dodgy offensive line against the Birds\u2019 massive D line, it won\u2019t improve this week. I\u2019ll take the Eagles over the Falcons 24-13.\n\nEd:\n\nChargers at Lions (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 The Lions looked good for three quarters in Arizona before fading badly in the fourth. At home, they\u2019d better pull it together, but I think the Chargers will pull this one out, 31-28 .\n\nThe Lions looked good for three quarters in Arizona before fading badly in the fourth.

Saints at Rams (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 Want to bet pass interference calls won\u2019t get missed this time around? The Saints come into Los Angeles with a lot to prove \u2014 and maybe the Rams do, too.

Bears at Broncos (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 Da Bears got humbled at home last week \u2026 and Denver didn\u2019t do too well on the road, either.
