Public Schools (DCPS) system is entering the new fiscal year with a $10 million deficit, but the deputy mayor for education said Monday that the budget shortfall will be closed by next month.\n\nTuesday marks the start of fiscal 2020, and no city agencies are permitted to carry a budget deficit from one fiscal year to the next.\n\nBut Deputy Mayor Paul Kihn said that the school system has until Nov. 7 to close the $10.1 million deficit in its fiscal 2019 budget. Nov. 7 is the date that DCPS has to balance its books and submit reprogramming requests to the D.C. Council.\n\nMr. Kihn sought to reassure students and families that the budget situation will not affect the ongoing academic year.\n\n\u201cWe are the victim of our own success,\u201d he said in addressing the cause of the DCPS deficit.\n\nThe school system has retained more experienced teachers than expected. The teachers\u2019 contract requires that they receive pay increases for years of experience, certifications, degrees and overtime.\n\nThe DCPS fiscal 2019 budget did not factor in funds for salary increases, resulting in what was originally a $25 million shortfall.\n\n\u201cWe have learned a lesson about this particular line item that we hadn\u2019t experienced,\u201d Mr. Kihn said, adding that teachers\u2019 salary increases were taken into consideration for the fiscal 2020 budget.\n\nThe universal per student funding formula increased by 3% for the 2020 budget.\n\nThe $10.1 million deficit amounts to about 1% of DCPS\u2019 nearly billion-dollar budget. To close the gap, the school system instituted a hiring freeze, cut its central office staff and reduced nonpersonnel spending like supply budgets and cross-agency memorandums of understanding, which are \u201call intended not to impact schools,\u201d Mr. Kihn said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that this is not final yet,\u201d the deputy mayor said. \u201cWe are continuing to work on gap-closure measures internal to DCPS so we can understand the challenges to the city budget.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) said in an e-mailed statement: \u201cThe Mayor plans to resolve the DCPS spending pressure through a reprogramming of underspending in other parts of the budget. In order for the reprogramming to be deemed approved by November 7, it must be submitted to Council no later than October 23 to allow for the 14-day passive approval.\u201d\n\nCouncil member David Grosso, chairman of the Education Committee, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn an Aug. 13 letter to council Chairman Phil Mendelson, CFO Jeffrey DeWitt said the District will end this year with a balanced budget.\n\n\u201cThe District has ended each of the last 24 fiscal years with a balanced budget. Be assured that this year will be no different,\u201d Mr. DeWitt said. \u201cIn fact, it is my expectation that the District will end FY 2019 with the highest level of reserves in its history and in continued strong financial position.\u201d\n\nBut D.C. Auditor Kathy Patterson noted that DCPS had spent 115% of its budget by the third quarter, which she called a \u201creal red flag.\u201d She questioned the CFO\u2019s ability to perform oversight if it doesn\u2019t require DCPS to have a plan to close the gap.\n\n\u201cThe final page of the quarterly financial report asks what the plan is to close the gap and in each quarter DCPS filed a report without answering the question and apparently got away with that!\u201d Ms. Patterson said in an email. \u201d The advantage of having an independent CFO is to have an added layer of accountability and if they are not requiring accountability for deficit spending EACH QUARTER via a gap closing plan, that raises a question about their appropriate role as a watchdog for spending.\u201d\n\nMr. Kihn said that city officials \u201chave put in place some additional financial controls so that my office and the City Administrator\u2019s office and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer will be monitoring DCPS budget more closely and earlier,\u201d so that the school system\u2019s deficit won\u2019t happen again next year.\n\nHe said that he expects the gap in the budget will be zero by the Nov. 7 deadline.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
