Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg invoke Christianity to shill for taxpayer-funded, unrestricted abortion and the family values of Sodom, plus confiscation of wealth and redistribution. Note to the media: Why aren\u2019t Democrats \u2013 and Republicans \u2013 being asked what they think of Drag Queen Story Hour? Anyone?\n\nMeanwhile, in San Francisco, the Democratic National Committee adopted a resolution on August 24 hailing the \"religiously unaffiliated\" as the \"largest religious group within the Democratic Party, growing from 19% in 2007 to one in three today.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s great news for those Democrats who would love to replace worship of God with worship of the state.\n\nThe DNC resolution declares \u201cthat morals, values, and patriotism are not unique to any particular religion, and are not necessarily reliant on having a religious worldview at all.\u201d\n\nReally? So, where did American morals and values come from? The DNC might want to try to identify areas of the world not influenced by Christianity or Judaism that have nonetheless embraced the sanctity of life, individual rights, free markets, self-government and women\u2019s rights.\n\nThey\u2019ll be looking for a long time.\n\nMany nonbelievers are patriotic, have strong personal integrity and strong opinions. But the moralistic language they use is derived from the very faiths that they claim have no value. If everyone has his or her own \u201ctruth,\u201d and everything is relative, who can say what\u2019s right or wrong?\n\nThe Declaration of Independence credits God as the source of justice, stating that, \u201call men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\n\nLikewise, as John Adams wrote, \u201cOur Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the Constitution\u2019s design for maximum human liberty works only when the people have a moral compass beyond their own appetites. Absent that, we can rationalize anything.\n\n\u201cOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports,\u201d George Washington wrote in his Farewell Address. \u201cAnd let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion.\u201d\n\nBased on concepts enshrined in British Common Law, which the great English jurist William Blackstone traced to the Bible, Christians led the campaign to end the slave trade. Across the world, Christians created hospitals and clinics. They criminalized infanticide, child marriage, child and spousal abuse, gladiatorial combat, death games and immolation of widows, to name a few reforms. Some also behaved very badly, justifying their inhumanity by misusing the Bible.\n\nThe American Revolution led to a hunger for self-governance that rocked the world. It\u2019s not for nothing that brave Chinese dissident students erected a model of the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s resolution calls for \"rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.\" Science is, indeed, marvelous. But there\u2019s no acknowledgement that the scientific method arose in Christian countries precisely because of the biblical view of an ordered universe with a discoverable design.\n\nFinally, before the Democrats embrace atheism as their new-found faith, they might want to take a closer look at the surveys.\n\nSome polls show that up to 25 percent now choose \u201catheist, agnostic or \u2018nothing in particular\u2019\u201d when asked about religious affiliation. However, this may be quite misleading. The Pew Research Center\u2019s latest figures show that only 3 percent of the U.S. population identifies as atheist, notes Glenn Stanton, a researcher at Focus on the Family, in The Federalist.\n\n\u201cYes, there has been a sizable increase here over the last decade, but that\u2019s up from only 1.6 percent of all adults,\u201d he writes.\n\nPeople who were nominal Christians in mainline denominations now describe themselves as unaffiliated, or \u201cnones.\u201d Meanwhile, evangelical churches are growing rapidly.\n\n\u201cRobust Christianity is not shrinking, not even among young adults,\u201d Mr. Stanton writes. \u201cIt is holding quite firm and even growing in many important ways. It is increasingly liberalized, orthodoxy-denying, and lukewarm faith that\u2019s tanking as if it has a mill stone around its neck.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something to think about when the Democrats celebrate unbelief in their midst or trot out pagan customs masquerading as Christian tolerance.", "description": "Democrats can\u2019t seem to figure out whether they want to .09/03/2019 19:36:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Robert Knight", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/178/3bb79f33-0b9b-405f-97c0-a7fd5a0412f1.png"}
