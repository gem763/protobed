Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who is also president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, which co-hosted the forum. \u201cI thought all of the conversation gave Trump too much airtime. It really wasn\u2019t about Trump. It\u2019s about criminal justice.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California, the only HBCU graduate in the Democratic field, threatened to boycott the forum until the host group \u2014 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Club, which gave Trump the same Bipartisan Justice Award on Friday that it had given Harris years earlier \u2014 was removed as a sponsor.\n\nWith other candidates considering boycotts as well, Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin \u2014 another co-host \u2014 spoke to all the campaigns and Benedict College President Roslyn Clark Artis before ultimately announcing on Saturday morning that the college had taken over the candidate portion of the forum.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is awarded the Bipartisan Justice Award during the \"2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum\" at Benedict College on Friday in Columbia, S.C. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nArtis wasn\u2019t consulted before Harris announced her plans to boycott. So it came as a surprise. According to Ceeon Quiett Smith, Benedict College\u2019s chief of staff, Artis\u2019 concern was, \u201cIf you don\u2019t attend, you\u2019re letting down these students,\u201d who were involved in planning meetings and were set to help with media, production, logistics planning, questions and serving as delegates for the candidates.\n\n\u201cIt is not a Dr. Artis-Sen. Harris thing at all,\u201d Smith said when asked whether Artis took personally Harris\u2019 cancellation since she wasn\u2019t contacted beforehand. \u201cIt was an \u2018I can\u2019t disappoint these kids who have worked and who are looking forward to her coming.\u2019 That\u2019s what that was. No, not personal.\u201d\n\nCritics saw Harris\u2019 threat as a political move to get attention and avoid taking tough questions about her record as a prosecutor and state attorney general, though she later reconfirmed her participation.\n\nHarris had originally announced her boycott over Trump\u2019s award and the number of students who were excluded from being inside the room where the president made his remarks on Friday. And, unlike the Democrats, Trump left without taking any questions. After the college took over the forum, more students were given access to the Democratic candidates and chances to ask them questions.\n\n\u201cI totally agree: He not only should not have received but did not deserve an award for anything to do with criminal justice,\u201d said Cobb-Hunter, the state representative. \u201cBut I think people should just ignore Donald Trump because he craves attention, and the more the conversation is about him, the more he likes it. I\u2019m glad she rethought her decision and arrived at a way to attend.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who worked with the White House and fellow lawmakers on the First Step Act legislation, held the same position as Harris but took a different tack. He reaffirmed his commitment to speak at the forum but also planned to do a separate forum with Benjamin, Columbia\u2019s mayor, elsewhere on campus, an attempt to fulfill his commitment but also reach a broader audience of students and community members.\n\nBenjamin was going to host Booker, Harris, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden at a competing forum on campus. But those events were canceled after the school took charge of the events.\n\nIn his remarks, Booker applauded Benedict College for taking over the cattle call and criticized the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center for its role in Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump was given an award. He was given a platform. He was unchecked for close to an hour,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe Bipartisan Justice Center allowed him to create an illusion that he had support from HBCUs or this community when in fact \u2026 he does not have the support of communities like this that he actively demeans, degrades and disempowers.\u201d\n\nWith a set of candidates who largely agree on issues of criminal justice, the weekend was yet another opportunity to court a key constituency in a critical primary state. Black voters made up more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina\u2019s 2016 primary. That same bloc of voters will be critical in determining who wins the state\u2019s primary in late February and, ultimately, the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nWhile Booker and Harris took divergent paths, each hoping to gain ground with voters, Biden made several references to a popular figure to remind black voters why they should support him in 2020: former President Barack Obama.\n\nBiden began his remarks by joking that attendees, who had sat through hours of speakers before he took the stage, might feel as though they were incarcerated. But he used the duration of his speaking time to tout the Obama administration\u2019s record and defend \u201cmy president\u201d from Trump.\n\n\u201cI understand he had some things to say, like he\u2019s done more for African Americans than President Obama,\u201d Biden said of Trump. \u201cWhoa. Whoa. I mean, come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States that I served with deserves enormous credit,\u201d he added, \u201cand I won\u2019t stand by and let President Trump tell lies about his record or make outrageous statements and receive awards that I don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d\n\nBiden and Warren, who lead the field in national polls and are first and second in the most recent survey of South Carolina Democrats, were more low-key outside of the forum.\n\nBiden was among the candidates who met with students either before or after speaking at the forum. Warren, meanwhile, had breakfast with about 10 female leaders on Sunday morning.\n\n\"I won\u2019t stand by and let President Trump tell lies about his record or make outrageous statements and receive awards that I don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d - Former Vice President Joe Biden\n\nBiden and Warren are top-polling candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire, but South Carolina is a must-win state for Biden, Booker and Harris, who are each counting on the black vote to power them to victory in the state\u2019s primary. Booker and Harris have stumped in South Carolina more than any other candidate, but the state is still Biden\u2019s race to lose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very surprised that Cory and Kamala are so behind everybody else,\u201d said Columbia City Councilwoman Tameika Isaac Devine, who added that she\u2019d been hearing a lot more about Warren and Sanders in South Carolina than she thought she would.\n\nDevine attended the breakfast with Warren. She said the senator was asked about why she hadn\u2019t been in the state as much as other candidates and whether she was too polarizing to unite people.\n\nWarren noted that her campaign wasn\u2019t focusing only on the first four early states but did plan to show up more between now and February, and she denied that she was a polarizing figure, Devine said, instead casting herself as someone who\u2019s unapologetic about calling out things that need to be addressed.\n\n\u201cShe does have to show up more, but one of the things she has done and I think is good is she has really built a good group of South Carolinians that are on the ground all the time,\u201d Devine said, pointing to state Reps. Wendy Brawley and Kambrell Garvin as leaders who have been in the community for a long time and built wide reaches.\n\nSummarizing the weekend and different candidates\u2019 strategies for standing out, Cobb-Hunter said, \u201cThis is politics, and all of it \u2014 whether it\u2019s South Carolina, New Hampshire or Iowa \u2014 is about posturing, period.\u201d\n\nThe program was scheduled to end with a straw poll. But it was scrapped because the focus of the weekend had gotten away from criminal justice.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Former Vice President Joe Biden"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/ec/e675187b4987b1a7eb4802244d5d/20191027-trump-plane-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
