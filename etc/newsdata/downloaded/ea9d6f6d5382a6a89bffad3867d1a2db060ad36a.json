Atlanta (1-6) is mired in a five-game losing streak and off to its worst start since 2007.\n\nThe 30-year-old Sanu heads to the reigning Super Bowl champion Patriots (7-0). He gives quarterback Tom Brady another target in a dynamic offense that leads the league in scoring at nearly 32 points a game.\n\nThe trade came less than 24 hours after the Patriots blew out the New York Jets 33-0.\n\n\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Brady tweeted to his newest receiver.\n\nSanu has 33 receptions for 313 yards and one touchdown this season, his fourth with the Falcons after spending his first four years with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nHe had a career-high 67 catches for the Falcons in 2017 and followed up with 66 catches for a career-best 838 yards last season.\n\nSanu tweeted his excitement at joining the Patriots and thanked the Falcons organization, including owner Arthur Blank, general manager Thomas Dimitroff and coach Dan Quinn.\n\n\u201cI appreciate everything the organization has done for my family & I,\u201d Sanu wrote on Twitter. \u201cMr. Blank, TD, Coach Q, & everyone through the organization, I am forever grateful for the opportunity. To my Teammates & fan y\u2019all know how I feel about y\u2019all love y\u2019all to death. #ThankYou.\u201d\n\nEven before the trade, Sanu seemed unlikely to remain with the Falcons beyond this season. He has one year left on his contract, but the Falcons are facing some tough salary cap decisions and already have Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley to anchor the receiving corps.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons have traded receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick in 2020, according to a person within the NFL.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/patriots_jets_football_57477_c0-124-2978-1861_s1200x700.jpg?ae9e86ffbca4269d35289a2d8c5217e0640bf678", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
