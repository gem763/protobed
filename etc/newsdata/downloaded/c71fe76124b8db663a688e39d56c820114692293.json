Google's big hardware event kicks off Tuesday, October 15 at 10am Eastern, and we'll be there with full live coverage of the event. That starts with a liveblog, where we'll be covering everything announced at the show as it happens.\n\nThis year, we're expecting to see a whole suite of Google products launch. Headlining the event will be Google's next smartphone, the Pixel 4, with a 90Hz display, an air-gesture system powered by Google's radar \"Soli\" technology, and a next-gen version of the Google Assistant. There should also be a new Pixelbook, the Pixelbook Go, which sees a return to a more traditional form factor after the collapse of the Pixel Slate.\n\nWith Nest's recent demotion from a standalone company to a Google smart home sub-brand, we should see two new products with the weird branding of \"Google Nest.\" We're expecting to see a sequel to the Google Wifi called the \"Google Nest Wifi.\" This new rev of Google's mesh Wi-Fi system will reportedly have a primary router that hooks up to your modem and then several satellite devices that are both Wi-Fi mesh nodes and Google Home speakers that accept Google Assistant voice command and can play music. A second-gen Google Home Mini should also launch at the show with an aux jack and better sound, and this one will be rebranded \"Google Nest Mini.\"\n\nFinally, there's expected to be a new version of the Google Pixel Buds. Hopefully this time they are fully wireless.\n\nWhile a lot about Google's future lineup has leaked, there's still plenty we hope to learn from the show. We don't know the prices, release dates, or (probably very limited) country availability for anything. Other than some text descriptions, the Nest Home Mini, Nest Wifi, and new Pixel Buds are mostly mysteries. We're also not exactly sure why you would want Project Soli in a smartphone or what other surprises Google has in store for the Pixel software.\n\nAll will be revealed October 15 at 10am, so be sure to follow along live.", "description": "Tune in at 10am ET for the Pixel 4, Pixelbook Go, Nest WiFi, and more.", "authors": ["Ron Amadeo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/D84Zw6UUYAACz7j-1-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
