The campaign claims that move by House Democrats helped supercharge Trump's fundraising.\n\n\"Boycotts from Hollywood liberals and Democrats' shameful attacks on private citizens, along with unprecedented support for our President, boosted the RNC to break fundraising records again this quarter,\" said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.\n\nAn RNC official says they already have staff on the ground in 19 states and will be using some of that cash to defend the president and go after vulnerable Democrats on impeachment.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale also credited Trump's campaign operation and its partnership with the RNC.\n\n\"President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,\" Parscale said. \"With our great partnership with the RNC and Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, we will re-elect the President and win back the House of Representatives.\"\n\nMcDaniel said the RNC is investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to \"hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and re-elect President Trump in 2020.\" That includes $8 million across cable and digital ads to hit former Vice President Joe Biden and Democrats on the Ukraine scandal.\n\nFormer Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted that today's numbers should be a \"giant wake up call.\"\n\nSome Democratic candidates also announced their third-quarter fundraising numbers Tuesday. The Bernie Sanders campaign reported $25.3 million, and the candidate tweeted that the \"billionaire class should be very, very nervous.\"\n\nFort Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported $19.1 million; Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million and Sen. Cory Booker brought in $6 million.", "description": "The Trump campaign says recent moves by House Democrats helped supercharge the president's fundraising.", "authors": ["Tamara Keith", "Amita Kelly"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/01/gettyimages-1168743601_wide-8cfae36edc84a257658113408ca09fd53e10f84b.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
