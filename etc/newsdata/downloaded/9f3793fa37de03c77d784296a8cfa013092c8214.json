Pretty soon, it started to spring up anywhere there was a canal, unless it was a filthy canal, and before long it was available at music festivals. This sealed its place, for me, as a bit of a hipster\u2019s affectation, a way to exercise while still looking countercultural; as if you would never be seen dead exercising (see also in this category: surfing; lindy hop).\n\nPaddleboarding is a mix between surfing and kayaking: you stand on the board (about 10-11ft long) and then propel yourself along with the paddle. I have a go in Paddington Basin, which I\u2019m a bit scared of, because the daughter of a policeman told me her father had once found a hand in there. But I\u2019m more scared of balancing on a paddleboard, one of those skills (like parenting or making choux pastry) that you don\u2019t know you\u2019ll be able to master until it\u2019s too late to back out. Yes, you really do have to get off the jetty and stand on the board. You have to brace your abs enough that you keep your balance, but not tense up so completely that you disturb your entire relationship with gravity. In the interests of not tensing up, I imagine it would be a bit easier if you were slightly drunk to start with, but I wasn\u2019t and, again, it was too late.\n\nOnce you\u2019re on the board, you\u2019ll need a bit of time just familiarising yourself with not falling in. The most useful way to do this is with the mantra: \u201cFalling in is not the end of the world; there are no hands in Paddington Basin.\u201d However, don\u2019t spend too long doing this: the momentum of moving has a stabilising effect.\n\nFit in my 40s: I hated Pilates the first time I tried it. Now I\u2019ve had an epiphany | Zoe Williams Read more\n\nThis is not a very technical sport; the paddles go in, at a clean angle, and come out again. It doesn\u2019t make huge demands on your upper body, and you pick up a fair amount of speed even with novice strokes. You can put more welly into it when you\u2019re more confident but, in the first instance, most of your energy is in the muscular effort of keeping your balance, plus the intellectual donkey work of relentless self-congratulation: here I am, moving along through water with my own brute strength. Ah, here I am again: behold my tremendous thighs, which would normally be giving up on this mini-squat position, were it not for the watery peril.\n\nIt reminded me a bit of callanetics, the huge 1980s weight-loss trend: the theory behind it was that tiny, pulsing movements, repeated over an hour, would help tone you. It was meant to give you amazing contours. Although nobody says the same about paddleboarding, it\u2019s a result I can easily imagine. The effort, while not backbreaking, is sustained. Then there\u2019s all that mental peace: losing yourself physically, concentrating utterly; the pleasure of the water. You could \u2013 give or take the modern spec of the equipment \u2013 be in a Georges Seurat painting, which is something I\u2019ve never thought before in my epic keep-fit journey.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nYou have to check your tides. You will be a happy novice only on flat water.", "description": "You\u2019ll need a bit of time just familiarising yourself with not falling in", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec02631b5d6a04c7ded949216263b966de258dd/0_604_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=715bad8dfc1b6a6a3b803486d8b3e669", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
