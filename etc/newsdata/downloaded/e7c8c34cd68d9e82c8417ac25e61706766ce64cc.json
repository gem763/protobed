Its central element is a cable that would be anchored to the moon and span more than 200,000 miles to a point above Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 perhaps an orbit about 27,000 miles from our planet. (The cable of a lunar space elevator couldn\u2019t be anchored to Earth\u2019s surface because the relative motions of the moon and our planet wouldn\u2019t permit it.)\n\nAs explained in the paper, the simplest version of the Spaceline cable might be barely thicker than the lead in a pencil and might weigh about 88,000 pounds \u2014 within the payload capacity of a next-generation NASA or SpaceX rocket. It could be made from Kevlar or other existing materials rather than the exotic and hard-to-make carbon-based materials that have long been seen as the key to building a classical space elevator.\n\nFuture space travelers would use a spacecraft to fly from Earth to the end of the dangling cable, which would be held taut by Earth\u2019s gravity, and then transfer to solar-powered robotic vehicles that would climb up the cable to the moon. The voyage might take days or weeks. Return trips would simply reverse the process.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeremy Hsu", "Nbcnews.Com Mach Science"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
