What have we done to deserve this? What have we done? The young men who died, what did they do?\u201d one demonstrator asked on Saturday night.\n\nMany Iraqi students joined the demonstrators on Sunday despite warnings from Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi. Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s promises of reform have so far been unpersuasive and protesters are increasingly vocal about wishing to bring down the entire government.\n\nFour members of the Iraqi parliament have already resigned and one of the largest parliamentary blocs is now holding sit-ins to protest Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s government, heightening the sense that the prime minister is beginning to lose the struggle to retain his office.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis reached out to the people of Iraq, sending his condolences for violence suffered by protesters and promising his prayers.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
