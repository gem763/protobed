Kamala D. Harris followed the release on Wednesday of her $10 trillion climate change plan that aims for a carbon-neutral economy by 2045 with a pledge to end the Senate\u2019s filibuster if needed to pass a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d\n\nHarris (D-Calif.) made that bold promise during her segment of CNN\u2019s seven-hour, 10-candidate climate change forum, where some of the Democrats vying for the White House offered their climate solutions.\n\n\u201cThe U.N. has told us \u2014 we\u2019re all very clear \u2014 if, over the next 12 years, which is such a short period of time, if we don\u2019t take drastic action, it will be irreversible,\u201d Harris said at the forum.\n\nHarris\u2019s call for an end to the filibuster \u2014 a Senate procedural rule that requires 60 votes, rather than a simple majority of 51, to move legislation forward \u2014 underscores the urgency many Democrats feel about taking significant steps to address climate change before scientists say it\u2019s too late. (As president, Harris could advocate changing the Senate rule, but only the Senate majority party, which is now the GOP, could make it happen.)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has the Democratic field\u2019s most ambitious climate change plan, with a $16 trillion price tag, wouldn\u2019t endorse ending the filibuster when asked about it, instead saying he would use other procedural workarounds to ensure \u201cit won\u2019t take 60 votes to save the planet.\u201d\n\nIn recent days and weeks, other Democratic presidential candidates have rolled out their strategies to fight climate change ahead of the CNN event. Climate activists had called for a Democratic debate focused solely on climate issues, but that idea was rejected by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Harris had been more vague on climate change than on many other major issues. Her stump speech offers broad support for the expansive goals of the Green New Deal promoted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), but she had rarely delved into specifics.\n\nThe Green New Deal calls for the United States to \u201cachieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions . . . through a 10-year national mobilization\u201d that marries climate change and economic inequality. Several candidates released plans with longer target dates this week, an implicit recognition of the difficulty of reaching net-zero emissions in a decade.\n\nA recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested that limiting global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius could reduce its impact. That goal, the group said, \u201cimplies reaching net zero [carbon] emissions globally around 2050.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) staked her position on climate policy Tuesday when she embraced the climate change plan offered by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a former presidential candidate who put the issue at the center of his campaign but recently dropped out. That plan aims to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d key parts of the economy within a decade, and Warren said she would also toughen environmental regulations.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also released a climate plan Wednesday that would require zero emissions for all new passenger vehicles by 2035. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, are among other candidates who weighed in with their own strategies this week.\n\nMany Republicans downplay the threat of climate change, and business leaders often argue that plans like those offered by the Democrats are impractical and expensive. Democrats and environmentalists respond that Republicans and \u201cclimate deniers\u201d are ignoring or minimizing a threat that jeopardizes the planet\u2019s future.\n\nDemocrats say the partisan divide on climate change shows they govern by science and reason while the GOP, they say, is tied to ideology and denialism.\n\n\u201cIs it realistic to not listen to the scientists and to create a situation where the planet that our children and grandchildren and future generations will be living in will be increasingly uninhabitable and unhealthy? Is that realistic?\u201d Sanders said, defending the scope and cost of his plan. \u201cWe are dealing with what the scientists call an existential threat to this planet, and we must respond aggressively, we must listen to the scientists. That is what our plan does.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former vice president Joe Biden, who introduced a more modest $1.7 trillion climate blueprint in early June, was asked during the forum if his plan is ambitious enough.\n\nBiden argued his more incremental approach was more realistic. He also made the case for why he\u2019s the best equipped to deal with the crisis on a global level.\n\n\u201cWe should be organizing the world, demanding the change,\u201d Biden said, adding that the first thing he\u2019d do as president is call a meeting with nations who signed the Paris climate accord to discuss how to \u201cup the ante.\u201d\n\nBiden faced a question about a fundraiser he\u2019s set to attend on Thursday hosted by a co-founder of a natural gas company, Western LNG. First, Biden said Andrew Goldman wasn\u2019t a fossil fuel executive and, when pushed, he said he didn\u2019t know Goldman was.\n\nGoldman doesn\u2019t currently have any day-to-day responsibilities with the company, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper later clarified. Biden, who signed a pledge not to take any fossil fuel money, said that\u2019s what he had understood, but that if it turns out Goldman is still involved with the company, then Biden wouldn\u2019t \u201cin any way accept his help.\u201d\n\nWarren, during her portion of the forum, chided the fossil fuel industry and politicians, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to ruin the air, water and soil for everyone else just to help giant corporations. We have a Washington that works great for the wealthy and well-connected. It\u2019s just not working for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nWarren also scoffed at a question about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to roll back regulations on energy-efficient lightbulbs. She said the fossil fuel industry wants to distract from the greater climate conversation by talking about \u201clightbulbs, straws and cheeseburgers\u201d instead of carbon emissions.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates spoke about their climate change solutions during a CNN town hall dedicated to the issue.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qDStRONQ2afpFeSm2cc-3pgBWx0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VYXNDYGOTAI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
