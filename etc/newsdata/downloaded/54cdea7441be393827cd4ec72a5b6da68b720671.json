His experience is good, his team-mates decided with the vote that they wanted him as vice-captain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am usually speaking with him and now he is more confident and more mature in the Premier League compared to when I arrived last year, he came only six months before me.\n\n\u2018He scored a lot of goals last year but has now also taken a big responsibility within the team and he is one of the captains who can manage in the dressing room.\n\n\u2018I will speak with him in my office, the hotel or the dressing room. First, we built a human connection and then as a player and then I know I can ask him what I want and what the team needs \u2013 he always listens and will always give his best to provide that.\n\nGranit Xhaka was named Arsenal\u2019s permanent captain last week (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He will play all minutes, some minutes, all games if we ask that of him and he is always ready to play again \u2013 this is also showing his leadership qualities.\u2019\n\nAubameyang has proven to be a massive success since signing for Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, scoring 49 goals for the club in only 74 games.\n\nDortmund\u2019s CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke questioned Aubameyang\u2019s motives for making the move last week, but the Arsenal forward hit back labelling his former boss a \u2018clown\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Unai Emery has hailed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's leadership qualities by saying that the Arsenal striker has taken on greater responsibility within the dressing room.
