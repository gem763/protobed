She not only looks amazing, she\u2019s been sharing a slew of body positive photos on Instagram that are everything.\n\nCouple that with the fact that she might be dating Mike Johnson from the Bachelorette, and people just can\u2019t get enough of her lately. Also, she\u2019s Demi-freaking-Lovato, so there\u2019s that, too.\n\nGiven that Demi has a hand in pretty much everything (acting! singing! the works!), it\u2019s only natural to wonder what she\u2019s worth. Well, according to Celebrity Net Worth, Demi Lovato's net worth is about $33 million. Here\u2019s how she made all that money.\n\nShe got her start in TV when she was little.\n\nDemi was on the TV show Barney & Friends back in 2002, when she was just 10 years ago. That led to starring roles in Disney hits like Camp Rock (alongside Joe Jonas) and Sonny With a Chance.\n\n\n\nShe released her debut album when she was 16.\n\nDemi became a BFD in the world of Disney after Camp Rock (have you heard her belt out This Is Me?!), and that led to her debut album, Don\u2019t Forget, which peaked at No.1 on the Billboard chart. She followed that up with her second album Here We Go Again, which debuted at No.1.\n\nShe makes a lot on tour.\n\nDemi has had several successful tours to promote her albums, but her Tell Me You Love Me tour made $20 million, according to Elite Daily. So\u2026there\u2019s that.\n\nShe\u2019s been a reality TV judge.\n\nDemi judged X Factor for several seasons, and she was paid pretty well for her time. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Demi made about $1 million for her first season on X Factor, and she asked for double that the second time around.\n\nShe had a clothing line.\n\nDemi partnered up with Kate Hudson\u2019s Fabletics a few years ago to design lines of activewear. \u201cI like to work out a lot. I like to stay active,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. \u201cI wanted to design comfortable clothes that make people feel confident.\u201d\n\nThere's plenty more to come.\n\nDemi is just 27, and she's already accomplished so much. But she recently teased on Instagram that she's back in the studio, \"working on an anthem.\" Can't. Wait.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "She asked for double after her first season.", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lgpqny2jiTNPWokew_anzw--~B/aD03MjQ7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/faaf4618fa4df5df094b4c9c3eee9b1e", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
