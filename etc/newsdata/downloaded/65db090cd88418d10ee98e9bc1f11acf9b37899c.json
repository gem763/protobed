Some 240,000 tourists are currently relying on Condor to get back to Germany from vacation, according to Germany's Economy Ministry.\n\nThe government is in \"constructive talks\" with the EU executive on the loan, the ministry said in a statement late Tuesday, adding that Condor should also be protected from Thomas Cook's creditors.
