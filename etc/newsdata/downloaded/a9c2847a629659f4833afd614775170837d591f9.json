Family members were going through belongings on his property when they made the discovery. The family's attorney called Will County, Illinois Sheriff's Office to report the findings, at which point sheriff's detectives, crime scene investigators and representatives from the coroner\u2019s office were dispatched to the rural home. The Coroner's Office took possession of the fetal remains and removed them from the property.\n\nLast week, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend offered burial for these babies in one of its cemeteries.\n\n\"I join my voice to the many people who have expressed their horror and disgust at the discovery of 2,246 medically preserved remains of unborn babies in the Illinois home of Ulrich Klopfer, who performed thousands of abortions in the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend,\u201d Bishop Kevin Rhoades said in a press release. \u201cI strongly support the investigation being carried out by the attorneys general of Illinois and Indiana. I also offer any assistance, including the use of our Catholic Cemetery in Fort Wayne, for the proper and dignified burial of the remains of these unborn children.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether authorities will allow the Church to bury these babies.", "description": ".10/04/2019 8:31:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/083aff99-90ca-4778-b9f1-26eef9b53075.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
