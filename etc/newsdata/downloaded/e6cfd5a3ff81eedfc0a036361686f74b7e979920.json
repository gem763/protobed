(TOKYO:6981) (ISIN:JP3914400001) today announced that it is working to develop an RF module solution for Terragraph, a gigabit wireless technology developed by Facebook that is designed to meet the growing demand for reliable, high-speed internet access in urban and suburban environments.\n\nTerragraph is enabled in part by placing millimeter-wave RF modules at 200 to 250 meter intervals between base stations. As background, high-speed networks are typically constructed by burying fiber-optic cable, but long completion times and high costs are significant challenges. With Terragraph, construction takes less time to deploy at a lower cost when compared to a conventional network. This is accomplished by attaching set boxes that include millimeter-wave RF modules to objects such as streetlights, that are already ubiquitous in cities.\n\nMurata\u2019s millimeter-wave RF modules use an independently developed LTCC* that realizes stable communications quality in the millimeter-wave band and features both high heat and moisture resistance. This help ensures a high-quality network environment for Terragraph.\n\nNorio Nakajima, Senior Executive Vice President, Module Business Unit, and Representative Director stated:\n\n\u201cAs the popularity of 5G approaches, the information society will become more familiar than ever and will be accessible to everyone. Murata Manufacturing has advantages in communications and hardware, and we are very pleased to be able to support Facebook\u2019s Terragraph project to expand access to high-quality connectivity.\u201d\n\nThe product will be exhibited at the Murata Manufacturing booth (Makuhari Messe, Hall 7, H021) at CEATEC 2019 (media convention: October 14, 2019; duration: October 15 through 18).\n\n* Abbreviation of Low Temperature Co-\ufb01red Ceramics: Refers to ceramics fired at temperatures of 1,000\u00b0C or lower.\n\nMurata in Brief\n\nMurata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of ceramic-based passive electronic components & solutions, communication modules and power supply modules.
