It contains ambophenol, which works to reduce the size of inflamed blood vessels.\n\nBuy now\n\nMurad sensitive skin soothing serum: \u00a349.50, Murad\n\nThis, from the brilliant dermatological brand Murad, contains hyaluronic acid to soften and bind water to dry, tight skin, lecithin to strengthen the skin\u2019s barrier and soothing chamomile and arnica. It\u2019s a clear, gel-like serum that absorbs immediately, leaving no residue behind.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nBioderma sensibio tolerance cream: \u00a316, Look Fantastic\n\nThis is a fragrance-free, lightweight, cushioning cream that offers immediate relief to inflamed, hot skin and is gentle enough to suit pretty much everyone. It\u2019s also a winner for soothing sunburn. Use it twice a day as a moisturiser; we love it layered over La Roche-Posay\u2019s rosaliac serum.\n\nBuy now\n\nREN evercalm anti-redness serum: \u00a334, REN\n\nWe love REN for its gentle, failsafe formulations, and the evercalm range is one of its stars. The serum contains milk proteins, seaweed and arnica extracts to calm and reduce inflammation, and it packs a good moisturising punch, too. It has a very light texture and absorbs straight away, and we saw long-term improvement as well as short-term calming.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nClinique redness solutions day relief cream: \u00a331, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThe moisturiser from Clinique\u2019s redness solutions range is quite thick and creamy in the pot but melts away easily on the skin; it feels super nourishing and doesn\u2019t leave any residue behind. It is cooling and calming, giving near-instant results, and also improves the skin's texture, dryness and reduces flare-ups over time.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nAvene antirougeurs jour redness relief cream: \u00a314.50, Look Fantastic\n\nAntirougeurs is a light, simple moisturiser that relieves tightness and helps settle irritated, inflamed skin. It has a small amount of green pigment to immediately balance out redness and contains SPF20, which might not be high enough for many, but, as the sun is a well-known trigger for rosacea, it can\u2019t hurt.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nDarphin intral redness relief: \u00a356, Space NK\n\nThis, from Parisian skincare brand Darphin, is instantly cooling and refreshing on application and reduces redness and irritation overnight. It\u2019s a serum, so we recommend following up with a moisturiser. Darphin\u2019s offering is lightly fragranced, so might not be appropriate for really sensitive skin.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nSmashbox colour correcting primer in \u2018adjust\u2019: \u00a328, Boots\n\nColour-correcting products work on the principle that complementary colours neutralise each other, hence why you get purple shampoos to balance out yellow brassiness in blonde hair (in fact there\u2019s also a purple version of this product to correct sallowness). For a quick-fix, Smashbox\u2019s green primer tones down redness and mattifies too, but most will still want a foundation over the top.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nEstee Lauder double wear custom coverage colour correcting duo: \u00a324, Look Fantastic\n\nA more targeted application of the same principles as the Smashbox primer, this has two formulas to choose from: one that is drier and slightly more paste-like to dab onto smaller areas of redness, spots or broken capillaries, and a lighter, more fluid one that can be applied to larger areas. The result is a more even-toned finish; it worked brilliantly on the redness around our tester\u2019s nose.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nHerbivore jade facial roller: \u00a326, Cult Beauty\n\nIf the cause of your redness is irritation, heat and/or inflammation, a jade roller is cooling and calming. They also help the absorption of other products, so use one with a serum or moisturiser from this list or roll over a sheet mask for a longer pampering session.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Redness solutions\n\nLa Roche-Posay\u2019s serum is far more effective than its reasonable price suggests, while Clinique\u2019s redness solutions moisturiser is a reliably good purchase. For immediate colour correction, try Estee Lauder\u2019s double-formula wand.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
