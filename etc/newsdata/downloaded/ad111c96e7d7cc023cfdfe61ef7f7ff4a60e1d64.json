But today\u2019s deal now marks the first time in the Rip Curl\u2019s history that the company will not be under private, independent ownership.\n\nUnder the deal, Singer and Warbick \u2013 who each owned 35.5% of the company \u2013 and current Rip Curl CEO Michael Daly will also receive various portions of 10.9 million shares in Kathmandu stock, which is currently worth somewhere around $31 million.\n\nPreviously, Singer and Warbick had attempted to sell off their stake in Rip Curl at least twice before, with a $500 million sale in 2012 not eventuating, and a $400 million attempt in 2017 ultimately falling through.\n\nREAD MORE Billabong's Collab With Blogger Sincerely Jules Is Here To Extend Your Summer\n\nIn a statement published on the Rip Curl website, Singer and Warbick stated that the sale was an \u201cemotional event\u201d for them, but that they realise their \u201cbaby has grown into an adult recognised all over the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 50 years it\u2019s an emotional event for us. Surfing and the surf industry has been an integral part of our lives for more than 50 years. We realise, Rip Curl, our baby has grown into an adult recognised all over the planet and we are proud that we have created one of the world\u2019s great brands. We are confident the crew at Rip Curl will continue to look after the brand and products into the future. We look forward to supporting the crew on this journey.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of Rip Curl follows on from Kathmandu\u2019s acquisition of US-based hiking boots brand Oboz, which they purchased for around $70 million in early 2018. Combined, the three brands are set to push Kathmandu\u2019s overall annual revenue above $1 billion for the first time in company history.", "description": "Iconic Australian surf brand Rip Curl has been sold off to NZ outdoor group Kathmandu, with the sale attracting a price tag of a lazy $350 million.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/rip-curl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
