With this win, though, they re-established their lead at the top of the Premier League to six points and took another step towards their Holy Grail of finally being the champions of England after a painful wait of 30 years.\n\nWe are only 10 games into the league season and there is the formidable task of holding off Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City but the manner of this triumph, a far better game than that Champions League Final, will further fuel belief. It felt like a big, big win for Liverpool and a tough defeat for Tottenham. It was a win born of drive and holding their nerve and a win in which the outstanding performer was not, for once, any of the attacking triumvirate but Fabinho. The lighthouse, as the Brazilian midfielder is known, showed the way.\n\nFor Spurs it was a fourth league defeat of the campaign and one that leaves them in 11th place. Once again for Mauricio Pochettino there was frustration \u2013 not least, surely, at the poor performances of Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli \u2013 and a sliding doors moment when Son Heung-Min broke away and rounded goalkeeper Alisson only for his shot to cannon back off the cross-bar.\n\nAt that point Spurs were still one goal up. Doubling that advantage would surely have led to a famous victory although, in fairness, they should not point the finger at Son, who along with goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga and captain Harry Kane was their best performer, but instead ask why some of the others did not step up when the pressure become so intense. \u201cWhenever you lose a game, it is never a step forward,\u201d Kane said. \u201cOur league form has not been good enough.\u201d\n\nThe frustration of the Spurs fans will focus on Serge Aurier who \u2013 again \u2013 rashly conceded the crucial penalty as Liverpool finally earned their reward. It means they have 28 points \u2013 16 more than Spurs \u2013 and are only the fourth team in Premier League history to reach that mark at this stage. Suffice to say the other three were all crowned champions \u2013 although City only achieved that by goal difference in 2012.", "description": "In the panoply of Anfield chants a reprised number this season has been \u201cwe are the champions, champions of Europe\u201d and during this raw contest it rang around as a reminder of Liverpool\u2019s victory the last time they met Tottenham Hotspur back in June.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Alistair Tweedale", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214334288-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwtUT54c80eKHJHMfvK9NIvr5xZ9Y1jNCzVO3jDaOWBI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
