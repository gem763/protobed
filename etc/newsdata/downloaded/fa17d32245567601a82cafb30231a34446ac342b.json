USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 It might be heartless, rash and unfair to fire Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.\n\nAnd it\u2019s time to do it.\n\nRoberts is smart, professional and even-tempered. And he\u2019s got to go after the ugly scene Wednesday night.\n\nIn the parking lot outside Dodger Stadium, fans were running over a Clayton Kershaw jersey after his latest postseason meltdown \u2014 giving up back-to-back homers in the eighth inning of the Dodgers\u2019 season-ending loss.\n\nIn the clubhouse, Dodgers starter Walker Buehler was in tears after his strong 6 2/3-inning stint went for naught in a 7-3, 10-inning loss to the Washington Nationals in Game 5 of the National League Division Series.\n\nThe place felt like a morgue.\n\nAnd it\u2019s time to end Roberts\u2019 reign while acknowledging his accomplishments. During his four years as manager, the Dodgers have won two National League pennants, reached the National League Championship Series three times and won four National League West Division titles.\n\nBut this team should be doing more.\n\nWith the Dodgers failing to win a World Series yet again, the front office needs to shore up the bullpen. Address an aging starting rotation. But as much as that, this club needs a jolt \u2014 best accomplished by bringing in a new manager.\n\nIn a day and age when analytics rule, it\u2019s almost comical to think of the fiery Tommy Lasorda trying to find a job. And it\u2019s wise to remember that the expletive-loving, fiery Lasorda was the Dodgers\u2019 manager in 1988, when they won their last World Series \u2014 with a team far inferior to the one Roberts has managed the past four seasons.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 09: Manager Dave Roberts leaves the dugout as the Washington Nationals celebrate their 7-3 win on Wednesday.

They finally broke through three years later when they beat the Yankees in the 1981 World Series.\n\nAnd then there was Bobby Cox, the former Atlanta Braves manager whose teams won division titles 14 times in 15 years between 1991 and 2005, yet won just one World Series title. His Braves lost the 1991 and 1992 World Series before breaking through three seasons later by beating the Cleveland Indians for the 1995 World Series title.\n\nHe deserves more time, Roberts\u2019 supporters will say. He\u2019s a scapegoat, they\u2019ll tell you. But the Dodgers have to make a meaningful change, and it\u2019s the quickest and most dramatic way to address falling short of expectations.\n\nThe talent is there, including two of the game's best young players in Cody Bellinger and Buehler.\n\nPlus more talent is in the pipeline. Their NLDS roster included four rookies \u2014 catcher Will Smith, outfielder and first baseman Matt Beaty, first baseman Gavin Lux and pitcher Dustin May \u2014 each of whom the Dodgers drafted and developed.\n\nThey set franchise records this year with 279 home runs and 106 wins. And the Dodgers have averaged more than 98 wins a year during Roberts\u2019 four-year stint as manager.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump famously criticized Roberts after the Dodgers blew a four-run lead in Game 4 of the World Series. And as fans exited Dodger Stadium Wednesday night, they understandably took issue with Roberts\u2019 pitching decisions again after the team blew a three-run lead.\n\nBut those decisions likely are made with the input of the Dodgers' front office and their always-up-to-date analytics. This is a more visceral issue \u2014 the voice and make-up and temperament of a manager when the stakes are highest.\n\nAfter the game Wednesday, Roberts arrived in the interview room looking disconsolate. A reporter asked what he told his players after the game.\n\n\u201cMade sure that the guys understood how proud I was,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201chow they competed all year long, didn't take a day off.\u2019\u2019\n\nEqually even-tempered, Kershaw said, \u201cSpring training\u2019s going to come, I\u2019m going to have to be ready to pitch and do the job the best we can.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the Dodgers\u2019 best hasn\u2019t been good enough. Given this club\u2019s rich talent and generous payroll, it\u2019s World Series-or-bust.\n\nAnd by those standards, Roberts is a bust.", "description": "Sure, Dave Roberts has accomplished a lot over his four years as Los Angeles Dodgers manager.
