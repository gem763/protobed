Well, hear, hear. I am with you all the way, fellows and fellowesses. Let us resist the temptation to sound like shock jocks on the campaign trail. Yet I do not think that Mr. Trump is at the heart of the problem.\n\nI have not heard of the Republican National Committee cautioning the president against using crude back-alley language while campaigning. It is the Democratic National Committee that has repeatedly had to caution its candidates for high office against vile language, and I am not talking about some dirty-mouthed candidate from some remote congressional seat. I am talking about the Democratic National Committee cautioning its top tier candidates for president against using foul language that runs athwart FCC guidelines.\n\nSome weeks ago ABC News, the network broadcasting the debate aired in Houston on September 12, cautioned the Democratic presidential candidates to \u201cavoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law and the FCC guidelines.\u201d Has any previous network broadcaster felt obliged to issue such a warning? That night things went okay, but since then the F-bomb has been flying \u2014 most notably from the mouth of young Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nOther even cruder formulations have been heard from Democrats, and again the Democratic National Committee has felt called upon to urge its presidential candidates to tone it down.\n\nRemember this is 2019. Many of the Democratic candidates are women. Supposedly they are the keepers of American virtue. What would Eleanor Roosevelt say? What about Jackie Kennedy? Back in their day, if a Democratic presidential candidate would let fly the F-word, I would imagine that the men in the white coats would come calling.\n\nThe Democrats such as Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand (recently retired from the presidential field) are political stars of the #MeToo movement. They are dampening sexual ardor among adults in the office space and I assume on park benches, while introducing crude back-alley language in pursuit of the presidency.\n\nThis is just one of the contradictions that the Democratic Party embraces. Has anyone ever been elected because of his or her fluency with four-letter words? Has a whole field of candidates demonstrated its fluency with its four-letter words such as our Democrats have been in a rush to demonstrate?\n\nAs a historian, as a presidential historian \u2014 remember my scholarship on the Clintons \u2014 I will tell you that never in all the years of our history has practically the entire upper tier of a major political party had to be cautioned against vulgarity by its party\u2019s professionals. For that matter, I am not sure that the Communist Party of the USA had to issue such a warning to its candidates.\n\nGeorge Wallace was innocent of even a hint of such language. We have had some world-class demagogues such as Huey Long and Pitchfork Ben Tillman, but they never used the obscene language that the present field of Democratic presidential aspirants uses.\n\nWhat has come over the Democratic Party? Well, I think I shall ask my friend Donald Trump the next time I see him. He obviously understands the Democrats best. He has fashioned a political strategy and a parlance that brings out the worst in these amateurs. In their whole field, which once numbered almost 30 candidates, there is not a statesman among them.\n\nThey have no dignity, no restraint, and no feel for the American people. Before his 2016 campaign Donald Trump had never run in a political race in his life. He found himself running in 2016 against the woman that Bill Clinton boasted of as the \u201cmost qualified person for the position.\u201d Mr. Trump beat her fair and square, and ever since the Democrats have been grumbling, \u201cNo fair.\u201d\n\nIt now appears that the Democrats within the government even tried to snatch the election away from Mr. Trump, a historic first. My agents within the government tell me that indictments are going to be filed, and one will be for John Brennan, the former director of the CIA. More will be coming. If this is true, hold on to your toupee.\n\n\u2022 R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. is founder and editor in chief of The American Spectator.
