Or is chatting to your hairdresser one of life's greatest joys? asks LIZ HOGGARD", "language": "en", "text": "In a world where we text rather than speak on the phone, and prefer social media to small talk, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that you can now book silent haircuts.\n\nLondon\u2019s Not Another Salon claims to be the world\u2019s first to offer a service that allows you to opt out of chit-chat.\n\nAccording to owner Sophia Hilton, your stylist will talk you through your consultation, but the rest of the time is yours. It\u2019s the latest development in self-care (much loved by our younger colleagues).\n\nLiz Hoggard questions the introduction of hair salons that offer silent haircuts, such as London\u2019s Not Another Salon (file image)\n\nBut are they barking mad? Going to the hairdresser is the most fun you can have with your clothes on.\n\nThanks to stylists over the years, I have heard the best gossip and been introduced to fascinating fellow clients (film directors, chefs, even one future prime minister) while in the salon chair. I\u2019ve taken recommendations for great novels and restaurants, for doctors and kinesiologists when my hair was thinning, and I\u2019ve even had my tears discreetly mopped up during romantic crises.\n\nA blow-dry can be life-changing \u2014 and often much cheaper than therapy\n\nAt Hari\u2019s salon, where they do my henna colour, I can see Benedict Cumberbatch undergo a brutal trim (to play Richard III) or Saoirse Ronan as she\u2019s about to have her hair dyed pink, and I can gossip about it in situ.\n\nBut more than this, I love the easy chatter. It\u2019s a silly cliche that hairdressers are capable only of asking about holidays. Most have great life experience which they\u2019re happy to share (just avoid debates about Brexit and real fur).\n\nSome people may find silence blissful, but for me it\u2019s a sign of disapproval. If my fringe looks terrible, I want to know. But I also want us to share triumphs and failures together, as human beings. A blow-dry can be life-changing \u2014 and often far cheaper than therapy.", "description": "Liz Hoggard believes that talking to your hairdresser is one of life's great joys.
