(Picture: Cadbury)\n\nWhile most of us are dreaming of the treasures we\u2019ll score on the annual Halloween trick-or-treat round, Cadbury\u2019s is planning for the future.\n\nIt might just be October, but the chocolate brand has already announced its Easter range for 2020.\n\nThe news was shared on Facebook, where fans vocalised their dismay as one person said \u2018Let\u2019s wait for Christmas first\u2019.\n\nIndeed, Cadbury\u2019s may well have taken inspiration from the December holiday as two of the main products in the Easter collection include large tubs of Creme Eggs and Mini Eggs \u2013 emulating popular tubs of Quality Street during the jolly season.\n\nThe Choca-Latte egg will set you back \u00a39.99 (Picture: Cadbury)\n\nThe new range features tubs of creme eggs, a Peter Rabbit bar and two large eggs (Picture: Cadbury)\n\nOther treats feature a Peter Rabbit chocolate bar made from orange mousse, an orange chocolate Bournville Easter egg and a coffee-flavoured \u2018Choca-Latte\u2019 egg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has yet to announce an official release date, but the reaction to the new announcement has been mixed.\n\nOne person was concerned that the early launch would take the fun out of holiday-themed treats.\n\n\u2018All these goodies will soon be available all year round and nothing will be special anymore,\u2019 they commented.\n\nSomeone else agreed that it was too soon: \u2018Not even Halloween and they\u2019re already advertising Easter!.\u2019\n\nAccording to Cadbury, the products will hit the shelves at the beginning of next year and some people were thrilled.\n\nOne person said: \u2018Shame they\u2019re not going to be available for Christmas, they would make a fortune, much better than Roses or Quality Street!\u2019\n\n\u2018I reckon we could do these in one sitting,\u2019 commented someone else.\n\nAs for the prices, the tubs will retail at \u00a35.99, while the Peter Rabbit bar will sell for 65p.\n\nOut of the two eggs, the Bournville one is cheapest at \u00a33.99 and the special coffee delight will cost you \u00a39.99.\n\nCadbury told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We haven\u2019t released all the information about the products yet \u2013 we will be doing so in the New Year \u2013 but wanted to let you know that the tins are a bit different to our other tubs of chocolate products, like Roses and Heroes.\n\n\u2018The Cadbury Mini Egg tins contain 10 Mini eggs bags, while Cadbury Creme Egg tins contain eight Cadbury Creme Eggs and one bag of Cadbury Creme Egg Mini Filled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are designed to be the perfect gift for bakers and have digitally interactive graphics on the outside that link to online recipes to try.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum shares trick to keep avocados green and ready to eat year-round\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a bank that gives out ice cream with an ATM that dispenses free toppings\n\nMORE: Lidl launches wine tasting in the dark experiences across the UK\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Shoppers are baffled at the Easter products announcement as they beg for Cadbury to let them 'get Christmas out of the way first'.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92193520_1572020572.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
