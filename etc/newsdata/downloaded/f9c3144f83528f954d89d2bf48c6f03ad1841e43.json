As Sarah embarks on another battle with an evil time-traveling robot, she\u2019s joined by Grace (Mackenzie Davis), a human from the future with cyber-enhancements similar to her own, and Dani (Natalia Reyes), a young Mexican woman from the present who\u2019s being targeted by the robots for reasons unknown. Sometimes Sarah acts as a grizzled mentor to her younger charges; at other times, she\u2019s more of an embittered loner. Hamilton, who has been largely absent from the big screen since Terminator 2, tackles both sides of her character\u2019s personality with aplomb, growling curses and firing bazookas as if she\u2019s been doing so for decades.\n\nEverything else about Dark Fate, which was directed by Tim Miller (Deadpool) and is credited to six writers, is more routine. If you\u2019ve seen other Terminator movies, you\u2019ll get the idea with this one: There\u2019s a bad robot (this one\u2019s called the Rev-9 and played by Gabriel Luna) chasing everyone around, devoid of personality and essentially impossible to kill. There are time travelers, like Grace, who have come from a world at war with machines, and the grim apocalyptic future they represent prompts a lot of vague talk about causality and fate. And there\u2019s action, with many shotguns fired and grenades lobbed as the humans try to stay one step ahead of their robotic adversary.\n\nPast Terminator sequels were helmed by relatively anonymous directors coming off major box-office hits (Jonathan Mostow, McG, Alan Taylor), and Miller continues the pattern. A former visual-effects artist, he distinguished his work on Deadpool by harnessing computer technology to make a mid-budgeted movie look expensive. Dark Fate is being made on a far bigger scale, and the action, while appropriately extreme, is completely weightless. Miller can craft whole sequences in which multiple characters do battle in the skies while giant airplanes smash into each other, but none of it is actually filmed, and it ends up looking like digital glop. Cameron\u2019s first Terminator movie, made for a pittance, ended with a chrome exoskeleton chasing Sarah around a factory; that scene, in all its rickety stop-motion glory, remains much more compelling than watching CGI people fall hundreds of feet from the sky.\n\nLuckily, Arnold Schwarzenegger is on hand to play the bulky T-800 that has served as villain, hero, and goofy sidekick over the various iterations of this franchise. Even at 72 years old, he retains the confidence and physical presence that made him an instant star back in 1984. In this role, he also has a new self-awareness, seeming to recognize that Hamilton has always been the beating heart of the series, and quite gracefully ceding her the limelight. No special effect is as striking as either of these stars walking into the frame.", "description": "The actor\u2019s performance in Terminator: Dark Fate proves that what makes this series work isn\u2019t the action, but characters the audience can care about.", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/dark_fate_2/facebook.jpg?1571761976", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
