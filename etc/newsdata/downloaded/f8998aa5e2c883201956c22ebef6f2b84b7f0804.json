The captain was told he would secure millions of dollars, and a new life in the US, if he would sail the ship to a port where it could be recaptured.\n\nbrian hook More\n\nSimon Dawson/Reuters\n\n'How f---ing stupid are they?'\n\nThe initial response to the leak in defense and security circles was disbelief, and even laughter \u2014 not at the offer itself, but the fact that a US official had ever expressed it in writing.\n\nOne source, the owner of a London-based business intelligence firm who has worked with the US on similar operations in the past, was among those who were incredulous.\n\n\"I mean to send an email, ffs,\" he said, using the abbreviation for a common vulgar expression of annoyance.\n\nThe executive asked not to be identified because of ongoing client operations and fears of being identified.\n\n\"How f---ing stupid are they? They should have sent a covert team on to disable the tanker or found enough dirt on the captain to f--- him over,\" said the source.\n\nHe argued that making the policy overt in an email risked compromising the entire program.
