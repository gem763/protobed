Why? I made that b---- famous.\u201d\n\nWhen Swift expressed outrage over the controversial line, Kardashian retaliated by sharing videos of a phone call between Swift and Kanye. The phone call reveals that Kanye received permission to name drop the popular singer.\n\nSwift fired back at Kardashian shortly after the videos were released in 2016 and said that she never approved being called \u201cthat b----\u201d in West\u2019s song. She also took issue with being called a liar.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWhile I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot \u2018approve\u2019 a song you haven\u2019t heard.
