Sometimes we\u2019re talking about a genuine piece of disinformation. Other times, fake news means simply a news report with which a politician does not agree.\n\nOutside the U.S., disinformation is very real and pervasive, not just a partisan talking point. Fictional news stories are as normal as rain in places like Russia, Ukraine and Moldova. Russian President (and onetime KGB operative) Vladimir Putin has turned the dissemination of false narratives into a worldwide tool of influence.\n\nThe widespread distribution of falsehoods received serious scrutiny in 2015 when the European Union\u2019s East StratCom Task Force examined the impact of Russian disinformation campaigns in the European Union\u2019s Eastern Partnership countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The task force compiled more than 6,500 cases of disinformation in 18 languages.\n\nUkraine, the focus of so much attention these days, was the target to a barrage of pro-Kremlin disinformation. A particularly egregious example was a video ostensibly about how Ukraine\u2019s political goal is war with Russia.\n\nOther stories \u201creported\u201d that the U.S. had evidence of Kyiv\u2019s responsibility for the downing of a Malaysian Airlines plane over eastern Ukraine in 2014 and that Kyiv is under Washington\u2019s control. Both stories were patently false.\n\nIn Moldova, a small, impoverished nation near Ukraine, one planted story contended that NATO controls the military infrastructure of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. Another perpetrated the charge that the U.S. was plotting to overthrow Moldova\u2019s government. Politicians and the rich were also targets of outlandish claims. One story ridiculously asserted that the entire Moldovan government is a \u201cpuppet\u201d of liberal Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. Another lodged the false charge that a former deputy speaker of the Parliament \u2014 and the chairman of the Democratic Party of Moldova \u2014 was wanted by Interpol, an allegation the international security agency publicly denied.\n\nIn Poland, the fake news came in the form of wistful paeans to the not-so-good Soviet \u201cEvil Empire\u201d days. One article falsely asserted that \u2014 out of respect for Polish sovereignty \u2014 the Red Army did not participate in the Polish martial law prior to World War II and that Poland posed a military threat to the Soviet Union in the years before the Soviet invasion of 1939.\n\nOne big problem is that even debunked claims prove resistant to fading away. They linger on the internet, finding a readership particularly among those who seek out only stories that confirm their already established worldview. The globalist internet is a force multiplier, so fictional news originating in some remote location can quickly reach a worldwide audience.\n\nAs Harvard\u2019s Nieman Foundation recently documented in its report \u201cTrudeau\u2019s Blackface: The Chilling Effects of Disinformation on Political Engagement,\u201d increasingly sophisticated communications technology and social media sites only spur on disinformation and \u201cfalse narratives\u201d in the U.S., Canada and the far corners of Europe.\n\nAccording to the Harvard report: \u201cWhether they are alt-right trolls trying to trick reporters into misidentifying a mass shooter or foreign interests impersonating black activists, media manipulators come together in loosely formed coalitions to coordinate during periods where breaking news is unverified and unstable.\u201d\n\nIn other words, disinformation campaigns that have been routine overseas have morphed in the U.S. into increasingly sophisticated attempts to plant false narratives into legitimate news stories.\n\nU.S. media outlets need to work harder to prevent fictional news from polluting their coverage. Western governments, political parties, candidates, corporations and concerned citizens should learn to spot the growing fictional news emanating from Eastern Europe. While our government can provide some guidance and warnings about our adversaries\u2019 attempts to influence our political discourse, the most effective countermeasure is that foundation of our democracy \u2014 a rigorous and free press, which effectively distinguishes between fiction and truth.\n\n\u2981 Daniel N.
