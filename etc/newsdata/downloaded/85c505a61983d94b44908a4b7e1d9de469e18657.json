The outages may last until midday Monday.\n\nForecasters are predicting the strongest winds in years throughout the region.\n\nThe shutoff could affect a larger number of people than two weeks ago, when PG&E cut off power to 738,000 customers in 34 counties.\n\nCalifornia Office of Emergency Services director Mark Ghillarducci is warning Californians to be prepared with supplies because gas stations and grocery stores might lose power.\n\nPG&E resorted to shut-offs after fallen power lines and other electrical equipment were blamed for several blazes in recent years that killed scores of people, burned thousands of homes and ran up billions of dollars in claims that drove the utility into bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, PG&E said Thursday it didn't de-energize a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville that malfunctioned minutes before the fire erupted. The company reported finding a \"broken jumper\" wire on a transmission tower Wednesday night.\n\nA vehicle burns as a property is engulfed in flames near Geyserville early Friday.

He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in \"excellent condition.\"\n\nWhile the high winds in Northern California had died down by Friday, they were expected to pick up over the weekend, with gusts of 64 to 97 km/h in many places, and PG&E warned it may black out an even larger region.\n\n50,000 under evacuation orders in south\n\nMeanwhile, punishing Santa Ana winds that pushed fires into Los Angeles-area neighbourhoods \u2014 burning six homes and forcing tens of thousands to evacuation\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \u2014 were expected to last through the weekend and could prompt more power shutoffs across the state.\n\nAs many as 50,000 people were under evacuation orders, while Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said more than 15,000 structures were threatened by a wildfire that has scorched nearly 17 square kilometres and is only five per cent contained.\n\nThe fast-moving wildfire roared through California wine country early Thursday, as authorities warned of the imminent danger of more fires across much of the Golden State.

In some places, they failed.\n\nAs hot embers flew, subdivision homes and rural ranch properties were damaged or destroyed in the Canyon Country area of Santa Clarita and in the nearby community of Castaic.\n\n\"We know of at least six but that number may rise,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said.\n\nWatch fast-moving fires set houses alight in Santa Clarita:\n\nA wind-driven wildfire roared across a swath of northern California wine country on Thursday, prompting the evacuation of some 2,000 Sonoma County residents, including the entire town of Geyserville, where about a dozen homes were destroyed. 2:05\n\nSome residents tried to fight the blaze with garden hoses.\n\nIn the rural areas, where at least two ranch houses burned, people rushed to rescue dozens of horses, donkeys, goats, a pig and even an emu.\n\nNo injuries were reported but fire officials say a firefighting helicopter was struck by a bird and its windshield damaged, forcing it out of the fight until Friday.\n\nA vehicle lies destroyed by the flames of the Tick Fire while a SoCal Gas worker assesses the damage of a nearby home in Santa Clarita, Calif., on Thursday.
