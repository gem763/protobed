The eruption destroyed more than 700 homes, but remarkably no one died.\n\nAnd it was all thanks to 60 seismic stations located across the island.\n\n\u201cWithout those instruments, we would have been blind,\u201d said Tina Neal, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. \u201cWhile we would have known something was happening, we would have been less able to give guidance about where and what was likely to happen.\u201d\n\nNature\u2019s Bill of Rights\n\nDr. Moran and his colleagues had that example in mind as they pressed their case for adding instruments to Mount Hood.\n\nThey submitted a proposal to the Forest Service in 2014. But the instruments \u2014 which will be housed in four-feet-tall boxes with radio antennas and solar panels on the outside \u2014 violate the Wilderness Act, which prohibits any new structures and even noise pollution within federal wilderness areas.\n\n\u201cI see the Wilderness Act as nature\u2019s bill of rights,\u201d said George Nickas, the executive director of Wilderness Watch, a conservation group that opposed volcano monitoring in federal wilderness. \u201cI think it is so important to have places like that where we can just step back, out of respect and humility, and appreciate nature for what it is.\u201d\n\nIn reviewing Dr. Moran\u2019s proposal, the Forest Service provided the public with an opportunity to comment, during which they received more than 2,000 statements \u2014 most of which agreed that the wilderness needs safeguarding.", "description": "A thicket of red tape and regulations have made it difficult for volcanologists to build monitoring stations along Mount Hood and other active volcanoes.", "authors": ["Shannon Hall"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/science/11SCI-VOLCANOES1/merlin_160251957_80dba19e-751a-46fd-be42-3e0fb7dae1a2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
