California\u2019s right to set stricter rules than the federal government is expected to be formally revoked as the president travels through the state for fundraisers in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley.\n\nAs Caitlin McCoy of the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program told The Independent last week, the administration is attempting to push the revocation through despite pushback from the auto industry itself.\n\nBut the White House has its eyes on a long-term goal: defending their legal efforts to undo these regulations in the Supreme Court, before president Donald Trump leaves office. As with most of the current administration\u2019s sweeping efforts to roll back environmental regulations, the hope is that the rules will be harder, or impossible, to legally reinstate after they leave.\n\nFor now, the legal battle will be set. Revoking the state\u2019s waivers will force auto companies to choose whether they\u2019ll side with California\u2019s side, which seeks to slow the destruction of climate change, or the Trump administration\u2019s, which is effectively ignoring the climate crisis. As of July, four major companies have said they\u2019ll side with the state over the federal government.\n\nThirteen states and the District of Columbia have also vowed to adopt California\u2019s standards.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday to the National Automobile Dealers Association, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler appeared to speak directly to upcoming challenge.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump's long-term plan to destroy Obama's green legacy\n\n\u201cWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the same day, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra vowed to fight the revocation.\n\n\u201cCalifornia will continue its advance towards a cleaner future,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to defend the standards that make that promise a reality.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump's long-term plan to destroy Obama's green legacy", "description": "The Trump administration is expected to revoke California\u2019s legal authority to set air pollution standards that are stricter than federal rules, as part of a long-term plan to weaken Obama-era climate policy meant to curb gas emissions from cars.Tailpipe pollution is the largest source of greenhouse", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gw7CF_06hczjepJ.6v8D3g--~B/aD0zNDc7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d6b5e10dc9c01616f01f95ced00046b9", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
