A crew member took it from him for fear the batteries could explode.\n\nThreats of violence\n\nAt that point, Moustakas became verbally abusive.\n\n\"This dirty w---e, I hit her in her stupid foreign face. I don't care if I break her jaw,\" he said, according to an English translation of comments he made in German.\n\n\"As soon as we land on Cuban soil, I hit her in the face as there is no German law anymore.\"\n\nMoustakas went on to make sexualized threats against the woman and also gave the Nazi salute. He grabbed a second attendant, pinned her arm behind her back and forced her head down to her knees.\n\nWhen the announcement was made that the plane was diverting, Moustakas and his two travelling companions stormed the plane's galley to protest.\n\nHe snatched a drink that had been prepared for another passenger and downed it. He then returned to his seat, telling another passenger he would \"finish\" him when the plane eventually reached Cuba.\n\nJudge says safety of crew and passengers was at risk\n\nDespite the violence and the threats, Moustakas was only charged with two offences under the Aeronautics Act, not the Criminal Code.\n\n\"The vile infliction of sexualized verbal and physical violence against helpless and defenseless flight crew members, while in flight, thousands of miles in the air over the Atlantic Ocean, restricted in the small confines of an aircraft, with over two hundred passengers on board, is extremely aggravating as it put the safety and security of the flight crew and passengers at risk,\" Judge Frank Hoskins said in his decision.\n\nThe judge noted that Moustakas had no criminal record and he accepted a defence argument that he has poor impulse control and that condition contributed to his behaviour on the flight.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "A man has been sentenced to 30 days in a Nova Scotia jail for what a judge described as \u201cvile and disturbing\u201d behaviour on a 2018 flight headed for Cuba that was forced to divert to Halifax because of the passenger's conduct.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309438.1570213973!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/glass-of-beer-on-plane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
