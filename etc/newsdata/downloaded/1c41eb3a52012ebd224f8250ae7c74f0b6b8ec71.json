He had three tackles, including one for a loss, and swatted down a pass before he was injured.\n\nWatt tweeted out after the game: \"This game can be beautiful and it can also be brutal. Absolutely gutted that I won't be able to finish the season with my guys and give the fans what they deserve. I truly love this game and can't stand letting you guys down. Thank you for all of the thoughts & well-wishes.\"\n\nHe wasn't the only player to have a shoulder injury Sunday.
