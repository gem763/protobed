Just look at 'em! Perfection!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear the 41-year-olds were happy that the couple stayed firm on their request for two kitchen islands, because it ultimately paid off, and HGTV viewers were just as surprised by the final reveal.\n\nView photos Photo credit: mrsilverscott - Instagram More\n\n\u201cDidn't think the 2 islands would look good but WOW did you pull it off,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cAlthough 2 islands are a little too much for me, this still turned out amazing!!\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cThe 2nd island is awesome!
