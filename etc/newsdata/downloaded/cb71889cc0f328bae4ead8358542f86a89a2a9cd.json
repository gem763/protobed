But none has endorsed the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Ukraine controversy, which has been the impetus of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, comes amid other negative headlines for the White House. Members of both parties have ripped Trump\u2019s recent decision to pull U.S. forces out of Syria, and last week two associates of Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiBolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report Ex-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry MORE were arrested for alleged campaign finance violations in a probe that is not yet complete.\n\nRegardless, Republican aides and strategists say it would be a political mistake for a GOP lawmaker to take on Trump publicly.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, you just keep your mouth shut and see how the cards fall,\u201d said Republican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell.\n\nO\u2019Connell said there is broad recognition among Republican lawmakers that their political fates are tied to Trump in 2020.

Bucking Trump could also trigger primary challengers to Republican senators who are up for reelection next year.\n\n\u201cTheir entire political livelihood is dependent on Donald Trump winning in 2020. So unless there\u2019s some enormous smoking gun that no one foresaw \u2014 and certainly that\u2019s not the case right now \u2014 they\u2019re going to stick with Trump,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellFury over Trump Syria decision grows Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump to slap sanctions on Turkey for Syria offensive | Trump calls on Turkey to broker ceasefire | Pelosi, Graham seek deal on sanctions | Ex-Trump aide testifies in impeachment probe Trump: Let Assad, Russia or China protect the Kurds MORE (R-Ky.) made the argument earlier this year that the path to keeping GOP control of the Senate in 2020 is to portray their majority as a crucial \u201cfirewall\u201d against bad ideas from the House.\n\nMcConnell says impeachment, just like other plans favored by the Democrats\u2019 left wing, such as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal, will be quashed in the Senate. The Kentucky Republican, who is up for reelection next year, slammed House Democrats last week for striking \u201cat the core of our democracy\u201d by trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election without \u201cfairness and due process.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRomney, who is Trump\u2019s most outspoken Republican critic in the Senate, declined to comment late last week when asked if the House impeachment inquiry is appropriate or whether he would vote in favor of articles of impeachment should they come to the Senate. He told The Salt Lake Tribune that he hasn\u2019t spoken to any other Republican senator about the impeachment process, making no concerted effort to change the minds of his colleagues.\n\nArticles of impeachment would need a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, in the Senate to convict the president. At this point it appears unlikely any would even gain a majority, as Republicans control 53 seats to the Democrats\u2019 47.\n\nCollins, who decried Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate Biden as \u201ccompletely inappropriate,\u201d last week criticized Senate Democratic colleagues for rushing to embrace impeachment before the House investigation is complete.\n\n\u201cI am amazed that some of my colleagues have already made up their minds one way or the other before all the evidence is in and before the facts are known,\u201d she told the Bangor Daily News. \u201cI think that\u2019s entirely inappropriate whether they\u2019re for impeachment or against impeachment.

It seems to be more bone-headed stupidity that you shouldn\u2019t do, but it doesn\u2019t mean you should be removed from office,\u201d the staffer added.\n\nSenate Republicans are mindful of the fates of former Sens. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeHow to survive an impeachment Are Senate Republicans certain that Trump can return to office? Jeff Flake calls Trump's language 'authoritarian' MORE (Ariz.) and Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerGeorge Conway hits Republicans for not saying Trump's name while criticizing policy Trump announces, endorses ambassador to Japan's Tennessee Senate bid Meet the key Senate player in GOP fight over Saudi Arabia MORE (Tenn.), two former GOP colleagues who squared up against the president and wound up retiring from public service under the threat of a tough primary challenge.\n\n\u201cIn private moments many of the Republican senators are embarrassed and concerned by the president\u2019s behavior, but they also know what happened to Sen. Flake and Sen. Corker. They took Trump on, and the president pushed their favorability rating down into the teens. He was relentless in attacking both of them for that. That has not been lost on the Republicans in the Senate and so many of them hold their fire, keep their own quiet counsel and say nothing out loud,\u201d said former Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.).\n\n\u201cI served with many of them for a lot of years, and I know them well and I know they\u2019re people who love their country and have a good sense of right and wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re always using language like, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have said that,\u2019 or \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have said it that way.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just very concerned about a president who has 60 to 70 million people receiving his tweets every day,\u201d Dorgan said.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry has made progress in corroborating an unnamed whistleblower\u2019s complaint that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden, though it hasn\u2019t broken enough new ground to move Senate Republicans.\n\n\u201cRepublican senators have not moved very much. A few of them have criticized Trump, but no one has suggested they\u2019re ready to impeach the president,\u201d said Darrell West, the director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cRepublican voters are still not sympathetic to the impeachment effort, so I think Republican senators will not shift unless there\u2019s a major change in public opinion,\u201d he added. \u201cMost of the testimony to date has just confirmed what was in the whistleblower complaint, so it\u2019s hard for that to move things. There\u2019s going to need to be new information that alters people\u2019s views.\u201d\n\nSome polls show the Democratic impeachment effort is gaining ground, but Republican pollsters and Senate GOP aides have disputed the accuracy of these surveys, arguing they undercount Republican base voters.\n\nA Fox News poll last week showed that 51 percent of voters want Trump impeached and removed from office, a new high.\n\nAn NBC News\u2013Wall Street Journal poll conducted earlier this month, however, showed that 43 percent of American adults say Trump should be impeached and removed from office while 49 percent opposed the idea. A plurality of voters in that survey rated themselves as \u201cstrong Democrat.\u201d\n\nTrump pollster Jim McLaughlin said Republican strategists are generally discounting the polls that show high public support for impeaching Trump.\n\n\u201cEven in places like New Jersey, a majority of people in battleground districts will tell you they don\u2019t want him impeached,\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\nMcLaughlin pointed out his polls show that voters think Congress should be focusing on \u201cthe issues that matter, like health care, the economy, national security, immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like two-thirds saying that\u2019s what they should be focused on, not impeachment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Republicans are staying strong. Like, over 90 percent of Republicans don\u2019t want impeachment.\u201d\n\nMcLaughlin said polls showing growing Republican support for impeachment are poorly conducted.\n\n\u201cA lot of them are doing random-digit dialing,\u201d he said.", "description": "President Trump has had a rough couple of weeks, but his Republican wall of defense is holding in the Senate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sasseben_collinssusan_romneymitt_101419gn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
