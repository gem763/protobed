Why civil rights aren\u2019t enough to make the American Dream come true", "language": "en", "text": "In spite of individual successes, 21st century African Americans still feel held down by failing schools, drugs, crime, incarceration, unemployment, decaying housing and broken families. Some, like barber Shariff Griffin, continue to believe the American Dream is within reach if they try hard enough.\n\nAfrican Americans also want to live the American Dream.\n\nOthers suspect they are being held back by a system rigged against them. RTD heads for the seat of American power, Washington D.C. and the nearby Black majority cities of Baltimore and Richmond, Virginia. There, African Americans give their very different perspectives on who, or what is at the root of the oppression they face.\n\nJournalist Pearl Jr. believes racism is the root cause of Black America's problems.\n\nFor documentary filmmaker Pearl Jr., \u201cIt's a white world!\u201d The journalist agrees with Black Lives Matter activists who blame systemic racism and White supremacy. She points the finger at tokenism, which allows a limited number of Black people to rise while Whites remain in control.\n\nImam Abdul Alim Musa argues the American system is intrinsically oppressive.\n\nStill, not everyone sees things in black and white. Activist Imam Abdul Alim Musa claims the whole American order is rotten and is hurting White America too. Coming from the opposite end of the political spectrum, Dr Steve Parson, a Trump-supporting pastor from Virginia, has his take on the root of all the evil afflicting African Americans. He argues that \u201cracism exists \u2013 but racism really does not matter\u201d.\n\nSo, will Black America ever get within reach of the American Dream, or was it only ever an illusion?", "description": "Black Americans have legal equality, but they still feel shut out from the American Dream by the system.
