If this helped restrain Erdogan from moving in over the months he was threatening to do it, the calculation changed on Sunday. No more U.S. forces, no more hitch.\n\n\u201cLook, Turkey is a large country,\u201d a senior U.S. administration official told reporters Monday as a bipartisan uproar flared, with politicians and commentators across the political spectrum condemning what they called a betrayal of America\u2019s best friends against ISIS. \u201cIt\u2019s got a big military \u2026 and they\u2019re a NATO ally. So, you know, the United States is not in a position to, and will not be in a position to, fight Turkey over, you know, any actions that it takes with respect to Syria.\u201d\n\nThis person continued: \u201cThe president has made it very clear, you know, there should be no untoward action with respect to the Kurds or anyone else.\u201d\n\nRead: Trump is killing a fatally flawed Syria policy\n\nWhat the president would consider \u201cuntoward\u201d was unclear, but the kickoff of the Turkish bombardment today stoked panic in Washington as well as northeast Syria. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\u201d tweeted Senator Lindsey Graham, typically a vocal ally of the president. Graham vowed to lead an effort in Congress to make Erdogan \u201cpay a heavy price.\u201d\n\nBut Erdogan might not care. Turkey endured sanctions when the government imprisoned the American pastor Andrew Brunson for two years, then released him last year at Trump\u2019s urging. Turkey has also continued to risk sanctions over its purchase of a Russian air-defense system, though none have yet been imposed\u2014and has kept the system, even though the Defense Department has tried to punish Turkey by refusing to deliver next-generation fighter jets.\n\nSoner Cagaptay, a Turkey expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told me the incursion might be limited, as Turkish forces seek to break up the swath of territory Kurdish forces hold in northeastern Syria, as they did with two previous interventions. He said that today\u2019s attacks dispel a persistent myth among U.S. decision makers that Turkey only threatens to attack the Kurds in Syria and never actually does: Turkey has done so three times as of today. In The Washington Post yesterday, a spokesman for Erdogan articulated Turkey\u2019s long-standing position: \u201cTurkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Kurdish forces had reported two civilian deaths as of early Monday afternoon. General Joseph Votel, the former head of the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, said at a think-tank event yesterday that it was likely the Kurds would leave the area once it was clear they were outmatched. He said that he was disappointed with the decision to pull back and that it would not have been the military advice he would have given the president. Of his own experience with Kurdish forces, he said, \u201cThey protected us every day.\u201d", "description": "The biggest hitch to Turkey\u2019s ambitions in northeastern Syria was the presence of U.S. forces.
