More recently, it coupled its announcement that it is prepared to resume talks with the United States with the second test of its super-large multiple rocket launcher These tests have been met with seeming indifference from US President Donald Trump despite their implications for regional security. Trump isn\u2019t the only one to downplay North Korea\u2019s tests. Experts have suggested that the tests are designed to increase North Korea\u2019s leverage in the expected resumption of talks with the United States or express its unhappiness with the US-South Korea military exercises.\n\nNeither of these explanations seems likely for the tests in July and August. Since the Singapore summit, joint US-South Korea military exercises have been intentionally scaled back to address North Korean concerns. At the same time, it\u2019s hard for North Korea to argue credibly for the complete end of joint military exercises when it continues to conduct its own military exercises.\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely that the tests will provide North Korea with any leverage in talks with the United States. Trump has clearly indicated that the tests are not a concern and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has suggested that they do not violate UN Security Council Resolutions prohibiting ballistic missile tests by North Korea. By publically downplaying them on multiple occasions Trump and Pompeo have lessened any negotiating value the tests might provide. The stalemate the two sides have faced for nearly two decades also suggests that tactical actions have had little impact on the broad course of negotiations.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Whether intentionally or not, by normalizing North Korea\u2019s recent ballistic missile tests, Trump is making it more rather than less likely that any deal with North Korea will leave Pyongyang with increasingly advanced missiles capable of attacking Japan, South Korea, and US military installations in", "authors": ["Troy Stangarone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J394.F2Zl0Gi7XZi0dhtUw--~B/aD05NTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/46733f5be1c2a65fd9fb45422615aae2", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
