One recent post showed a man training two assault rifles at a closed door with the caption \u201cJust sitting here waiting on Beto.\u201d Others wink at right-wing conspiracy theories about Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cties to Islam\u201d or the Clintons having their enemies killed, or portray Muslim members of Congress as terrorist infiltrators. The page is effusive with praise for Vladimir Putin, and one post portrays Russia as the last bastion of freedom in Europe.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the usual fare on RealClearPolitics. Founded in 2000, the site was an early online aggregator of political news, curating links to widely read politics stories and opinion articles in other major outlets. The site has become synonymous with its polling aggregator, which is regularly cited by news organizations on both sides of the aisle as an objective metric of major political races. In recent years, the site has expanded to cover health care, finance, foreign policy, and more.\n\nThere\u2019s no hint of Conservative Country\u2019s provenance on its Facebook \u201cabout\u201d page, which reads in total, \u201cGovernment is not reason; it is not eloquence. It is force. And force, like fire, is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.\u201d (It\u2019s an apocryphal quote attributed to George Washington.) But in 2017 Conservative Country was linked as the official Facebook page for a now defunct political news site using the same name and logo, ConservativeCountry.net.\n\nThat website featured professional writers instead of memes, but it too omitted any mention of who owned or operated the site. The Daily Beast connected ConservativeCountry.net to RealClear through archives on the Wayback Machine, which show that the website had RealClear\u2019s Google Analytics tracker code and that some of the site\u2019s images were served from the WordPress account of RealClear\u2019s chief technology officer. Interviews with former editorial staff of ConservativeCountry.net confirmed that it was a stealth RealClear property.\n\n\u201cIt was a site put out through RealClear Media,\u201d said Kevin Whiteley, who in an interview with The Daily Beast recalled coming to RealClear in April 2016 by way of a Craigslist help wanted ad. He worked out of RealClear\u2019s Chicago headquarters, and at first his job was writing for the publisher\u2019s branded websites. \u201cAnd then they launched Conservative Country to do conservative politics,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they started Conservative Country, I was just writing for Conservative Country.\u201d\n\nRealClearPolitics has taken major pains to be seen as nonpartisan and non-ideological in its reporting. The site\u2019s news reporting focuses on horserace-style coverage of elections, evenly weighing opinions from both parties, while the RealClear pages curate a mix of stories and opinion articles from sites across the political spectrum.\n\nBut the willingness to share and aggregate all political views has also made the site more receptive to Trump-friendly writing than some other outlets. Of the seven featured \u201copinion writers\u201d listed in a tab on the site, three\u2014including occasional Trump adviser Steve Cortes\u2014are openly supportive of the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nConservative Country isn\u2019t the first ultra-partisan title that\u2019s been connected to RealClear. A 2017 SEC filing listed RealClear co-founder John McIntyre as a director at FDRLST Media and put both companies at the same Chicago address. FDRLST Media is the parent company of The Federalist, the conservative news site behind last month\u2019s false story claiming the deep state secretly revised official whistleblower regulations to allow the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower to provide secondhand information. Even after the story was widely debunked, Trump and several GOP lawmakers pushed it on social media and the Sunday morning political shows, and a link to the Federalist article appeared in 1600 Daily, the official White House newsletter.\n\nAlthough it shies away from some of the most insane conspiracy theories\u2014there\u2019s no mention of Q or Seth Rich\u2014the Conservative Country Facebook page is also no stranger to fake news. During the 2016 campaign season, the page drove traffic to Macedonian sites known for publishing outrageously false stories to reap ad profits. It\u2019s unclear whether those links appeared by negligence or design. According to a former writer for Conservative Country, RealClear monetizes the Facebook page with a pay-for-play model: Third-party publishers can put up cash to get a post featured on the highly trafficked page.\n\n\u201cThere were companies paying RealClear for traffic, and Conservative Country was another RealClear page that companies could promote on,\u201d the writer said. \u201cThe whole thing was money based, not activist based or anything like that.\u201d\n\nRealClear didn\u2019t respond to questions about the Facebook page but acknowledged that it created the website. \u201cThe Conservative Country website was created as part of an effort to understand the flow of traffic from social media\u2014particularly Facebook\u2014to political websites,\u201d said RealClear CTO Anand Ramanujan in an email to The Daily Beast. \u201cThere are no other non-RealClear titles out there.\u201d\n\nA count of the Conservative Country posts featuring external links suggests the page\u2019s main purpose is driving traffic back to RealClear\u2019s own properties. Some 240 of the 1,070 external links posted on the page since January 2017 are to RealClear Media\u2019s flagship title, RealClearPolitics. Fox News comes in a distance second with 71 links, followed by 41 posts linking to the conservative commentary site American Thinker. \u201cWe have a contract with Real Clear Holdings to handle some of our non-editorial functions,\u201d said American Thinker\u2019s founder Thomas Lifson, when asked generally about his site\u2019s relationship with RealClear.\n\nIt is unusual for media companies to run pages without disclosing their ownership. In an email to The Daily Beast, Kelly McBride, a senior vice president at the media-monitoring Poynter Institute, noted that transparency is a crucial element for readers seeking to understand whether they can trust a news outlet.\n\n\u201cLegitimate and respectable news organizations are transparent about their ownership,\u201d McBride said. \u201cIt should be clear to the audience consuming a news product who the owner is. Conversely, audience members who are interested in ownership structures should be able to see all the media properties owned by a corporation.\u201d\n\nOthers don\u2019t see it as a problem. The more extreme, bigoted memes appearing on the Facebook page are \u201ccertainly not a good look for RealClear Media,\u201d Dan Kennedy, an associate professor and media ethicist at Northeastern University\u2019s School of Journalism, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it calls into question the credibility of RealClearPolitics.\u201d\n\nWith a full-time editor and a handful of paid freelance writers, the Conservative Country website was more costly to run than a Facebook page. According to the former writer, the site\u2019s traffic cratered when Facebook tweaked its algorithms to favor Facebook content over external links. After eight months in operation, RealClear closed the website in October 2017 without ever officially acknowledging its existence.\n\nWhiteley, who served as ConservativeCountry.net\u2019s line editor for the life of the site, said he doesn\u2019t know why RealClear\u2019s branding never graced Conservative Country. \u201cI can confidently say there was nothing sinister about that,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe whoever built the site didn\u2019t think to put that there.\u201d", "description": "RealClearPolitics has carefully cultivated a non-partisan image\u2014while in the shadows its parent company pushes images of killer Clintons and a freedom-loving Kremlin.", "authors": ["Kevin Poulsen", "Maxwell Tani", "Sr. National Security Correspondent", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570494102/191007-poulsen-real-clear-politics-tease_wmp8ta", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
