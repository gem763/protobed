It's been challenging at times but they\u2019ve made it worthwhile, just in terms of how welcoming they\u2019ve been.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to miss being there but you\u2019ve got to look forward and be excited. One more game and then I\u2019ll start thinking about the next challenge.\"\n\nWales team: 15-Hallam Amos, 14-Owen Lane, 13-Jonathan Davies, 12-Owen Watkin, 11-Josh Adams, 10-Rhys Patchell, 9-Tomos Williams, 8-Ross Moriarty, 7-James Davies, 6-Justin Tipuric, 5-Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4-Adam Beard, 3-Dillon Lewis, 2-Ken Owens, 1-Nicky Smith.
