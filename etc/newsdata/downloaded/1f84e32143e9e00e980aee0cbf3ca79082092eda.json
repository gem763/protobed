It's much more doable, though, if you can nail down which city suits your budget best. Porch, a website that connects homeowners to local home improvement contractors, narrowed down the best cities for young families using data from the U.S. Census Bureau, review site Yelp and online real estate database Zillow. Porch ranked each city based on the number of millennials living there, child day care availability and rental housing options.

The five least family-friendly places are Detroit, Michigan; Miami, Florida; Dallas, Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; and Hartford, Connecticut, according to Porch. Detroit earned the bottom spot on the list due to a lack of available child care, a low population of millennials and high-priced housing, the report says. Additionally, Detroit's population has been on the decline for decades, and given the city's history of economic issues, it's become known as a difficult place to settle down and plant roots.\n\nWhy where you choose to live matters", "description": "The best and worst U.S. cities for young, growing, millennial families, according to Porch, a website that connects homeowners to local home improvement contractors.
