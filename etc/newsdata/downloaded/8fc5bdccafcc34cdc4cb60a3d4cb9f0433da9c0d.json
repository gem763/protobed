The Los Angeles Unified School District announced that all schools in the San Fernando Valley would be closed on Friday \u201cdue to air-quality and safety concerns from the fires.\u201d Local colleges also closed as the fire raged.\n\nFlames rolled out of the valley foothills into neighborhoods, sending residents into a panic as only 5 percent of the fire was contained by early Friday morning. Several fire lanes tore through residential areas, the Los Angeles Times reported, and some people wielded garden hoses in a futile effort to protect their homes.\n\n\u201cThe fires have gotten close, but never like this,\u201d Marcia Armijo, 60, and a resident of two decades, told the Times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike others in the area, she was forced to evacuate, taking along her dog Hope and cat Maxwell as the threat grew to Canyon Country, a community by the Santa Clarita River.\n\n\u201cI have no idea if my house is burning down right now,\u201d she said.\n\nOther residents in the area had confronted the devastation. Alejandra Corrales fled with her three children, but did not have enough time to gather her mother\u2019s ashes. She feared her rescue sheep were killed in the blaze, but some animals managed to survive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a little overwhelmed and I\u2019m literally seeing sticks and fire of what used to be our home,\u201d she told the local CBS affiliate.\n\nAs many as 10,000 structures are at risk of burning, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nThe Southern California fires have been fed by strong downsloping offshore winds known regionally as Santa Ana winds, gusting up to 65 mph through Los Angeles and Ventura counties on Friday, officials said, creating the potential for new ignitions to occur.\n\nAD\n\nThe heat and bone dry humidity will cause vegetation to dry out, enabling it to burn if any ignition sources ignite a fires. \u201cThe fuels and vegetation are critically dry,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.\n\nOverall, the worst fire weather shift today from Northern California to southern parts of the state. Though winds are still strong \u2014 up to 35 mph in the Sacramento Valley and topping 40-45 mph in the foothills and mountains \u2014 they are forecast to slacken this afternoon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cExtremely critical\u201d fire weather remains in the forecast for southern portions of the Golden State, with pockets of elevated and critical conditions present in and around the Los Angeles metro area.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a red flag warning is up through Friday evening along with a heat advisory, highlighting conditions that are \u201cfavorable for extreme fire behavior and rapid growth.\u201d Temperatures will skyrocket into the mid to upper 90s in many areas, with relative humidities as low as 2 to 5 percent.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, sustained northeasterly winds of 25 to 40 mph, gusting up to 65 mph in the foothills and mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties would support fires spreading at rapid pace, if any get started.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe expected weather will create an environment ripe for large and dangerous fire growth,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said in its morning forecast discussion. \u201cWe urge everyone to be extremely cautious.\u201d\n\nThe Tick Fire ignited about 20 miles northeast of the site of another major wildfire, in Sylmar. That blaze, known as the Saddleridge Fire, has burned nearly 9,000 acres since Oct. 10, though it is mostly contained now, according to Cal Fire. One person died in the Saddleridge Fire, and another eight were injured; the blaze also left dozens of buildings damaged or destroyed.\n\nAD\n\nIn Northern California, the Kincade Fire continues its destructive march through Sonoma County.\n\nAD\n\nThe Kincade Fire has consumed nearly 22,000 acres. On Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric, the state\u2019s largest utility, told state regulators that a jumper on one of its transmission towers broke close to where officials say the Kincade Fire started.\n\nThe air in the vicinity of the Kincaid Fire is slightly less dry and a bit cooler, which could offer a greater opportunity for firefighters to make gains on the blaze before more volatile conditions return this weekend.\n\nThe ongoing wildfires come on the heels of the devastating 2017 and 2018 California fire seasons, which featured the largest, most destructive, and deadliest blazes on in state history.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s part of a clear pattern toward larger, more frequent and destructive blazes, as well as a longer-lasting fire season. And, according to CalFire, \u201cclimate change is considered a key driver of this trend.\u201d\n\nPopulation growth and the increase in homes and businesses located near lands that typically burn are also escalating the risk of and damage from wildfires in the Golden State.\n\nReis Thebault and Kim Bellware contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Tick Fire is sprawling through California's Santa Clarita Valley, where it expanded rapidly overnight and jumped State Route 14.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TNpdtrPJAkoVbit1gZ0_IkSV8qs=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-25-2019/t_523682855d3c47dcacae8ec68240d6d1_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_01_10_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
