The safety explained how when he was with the New York Giants, he never knew which Cousins he would face across the line of scrimmage against the Redskins \u2014 the guy who could dissect a defense like a surgeon or the quarterback who would crumble under pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s a story the Redskins knew all too well, and one the Minnesota Vikings have been baffled by since signing the quarterback to a three-year, $84 million fully guaranteed contract in 2018.\n\nBut when Cousins faces his former team Thursday for the first time, he\u2019ll do so in the midst of the hottest stretch of his career.\n\nAfter three straight stellar performances, Cousins leads the league in passer rating (114.3) and the Vikings look like a legitimate Super Bowl contender. The Vikings have tailored to Cousins\u2019 strengths, relying heavily on play action to take shots deep down the field.\n\n\u201cRight now he\u2019s playing like a Pro Bowl Kirk Cousins,\u201d Collins said.\n\nBy the end of Cousins\u2019 tenure with Washington, his departure felt inevitable. The Redskins were reluctant to give Cousins a market-setting contract, and many in Washington questioned whether the Michigan State product wanted to stay. After the team put the franchise tag on him for the second time, Cousins and his agent didn\u2019t even bother to negotiate.\n\nInstead, the Redskins traded for Alex Smith, Cousins went to Minnesota and Case Keenum, Minnesota\u2019s former starter, landed in Denver for a year before being traded to Washington.\n\nIt was a quarterback carousel that has, so far, failed to deliver on expectations for all three franchises, including Minnesota.\n\nCousins, Keenum and Smith all got paid. But Smith suffered a career-threatening injury with the Redskins, Keenum struggled in Denver and now again in Washington and Cousins led a team with Super Bowl aspirations to a disappointing 8-7-1.\n\nBut over the last three weeks, the Vikings seem to have found a formula that gets the most out of Cousins \u2014 a blend of coach Mike Zimmer\u2019s run-first approach with the 31-year-old\u2019s ability to hit intermediate and deep throws. With a solid offensive line, Cousins leads the league in average time to throw \u2014 3.05 seconds per attempt.\n\nAfter racking up 306, 333 and 337 yards through the air in wins this month, the Vikings no longer appear to be a team in danger of coming apart at the seams.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case a few weeks ago when receiver Stefon Diggs appeared to want out of Minnesota, receiver Adam Thielen took a shot at Cousins in a postgame interview and Cousins apologized to Thielen on a podcast, all of which can be traced back to the offense\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cWhen he was here, he was a great teammate and a great QB in my eyes,\u201d Redskins cornerback Quinton Dunbar said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re facing a good challenge.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Redskins understand better than anyone how different Cousins can look from one performance to the next. Tackle Morgan Moses said if the defense can get to Cousins and rattle him, he\u2019ll \u201ccough the ball up a little bit.\u201d Cousins has fumbled a league-leading 47 times since 2015, the year he became a full-time starter.\n\nYet for all the skepticism that surrounds Cousins, the Redskins haven\u2019t been able to find stability at the quarterback position since he left. First-rounder Dwayne Haskins \u2014 labeled the future of the franchise \u2014 is not ready to start against NFL defenses, according to his coaches.\n\nThere\u2019s also this: The Redskins have had six different quarterbacks under center in the 23 games since Cousins\u2019 departure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny situation, I guess,\u201d running back Chris Thompson said. \u201cThere was a lot of stuff going on when he was here being franchise-tagged twice when we all know he wanted to get a long-term deal done but we weren\u2019t able to. \u2026 With injuries, it\u2019s been a whole lot since then, but that\u2019s part of the business. Things happen, obviously.\n\n\u201cI made it known back then when Kirk was here \u2014 we both talked about playing together for years. But things happen.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cousins said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for his time with Washington when speaking to reporters Tuesday in Minnesota. He noted how he had to wait two-and-a-half days once the draft started before the Redskins took him in the fourth round.\n\nCousins also said he was thankful for being able to start. He supplanted Robert Griffin III as a starter, setting up the rest of his career.\n\n\u201cI was given an opportunity to start when there weren\u2019t many people outside of that building who thought I should,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cThey stuck by me when there was a stretch there, we were 2-4 and many people thought it should be over for me to be playing, and then we had that comeback game against the Buccaneers, and I yelled the words \u2018You like that!\u2019 and kind of never looked back.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
