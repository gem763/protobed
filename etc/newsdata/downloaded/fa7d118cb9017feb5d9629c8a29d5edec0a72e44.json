While many of those efforts are aimed at adults, the recruiting methods for some student recognition programs give a peek into the widespread and opaque world of data mining for millions of minors \u2014 and how students\u2019 profiles may be used to target them for educational and noneducational offers. MyCollegeOptions, for instance, says it may give student loan services, test prep and other companies access to student data.\n\nThese marketing programs are generally legal, taking advantage of the fact that there is no federal law regulating consumer data brokers. They also face little oversight because federal education privacy laws make public schools, and not their vendors, directly responsible for controlling the spread of student data.\n\nBut the handling of student surveys is receiving heightened scrutiny, particularly in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that siphoned off the data of Facebook users who took a personality questionnaire.\n\nIn May, the Department of Education issued \u201csignificant guidance\u201d that recommended that public schools make clearer to students and their parents that surveys with the SAT and the ACT, a separate college admissions exam, are optional. The notice emphasized that pretest surveys could provide opportunities for families to learn about college choices. But it also reminded schools that parents had the right to inspect all surveys in advance. Parents also have the right to opt their children out of any school-required surveys that touch on sensitive topics like religion, family income or politics.", "description": "College-planning surveys give a peek into the opaque and little-regulated market of data-mining of minors.", "authors": ["Natasha Singer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/business/30STUDENTDATA-1/30STUDENTDATA-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-29"}
