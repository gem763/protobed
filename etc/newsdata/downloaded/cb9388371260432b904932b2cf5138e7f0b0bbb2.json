Unlike Twitter, however, Facebook did not consider the behaviour to be mistake.\n\nBut, in handing down its record-breaking $5bn fine, the US Federal Trade Commission said Facebook must stop using \"the phone numbers it obtained specifically for security\u201d to power its advertising platform.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
