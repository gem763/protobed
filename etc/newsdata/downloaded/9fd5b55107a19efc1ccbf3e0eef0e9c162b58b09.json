Maxine Waters (D-CA) said Republicans lawmakers who continued to support President Donald Trump were \u201cwilling to harm our country.\u201d\n\nWaters said, \u201cThe president is all about himself. Now, if you want to know something, I am disgusted with those spineless members of the Senate who don\u2019t have the guts to stand up for this country. Many of them have defined themselves as patriotic. They\u2019re not patriotic. They are spineless, and they\u2019re not willing to step up and do what needs to be done in recognizing the danger of this president. They are willing to harm our country.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know how they look their children and their wives, their community in the face coming to work in the United States Senate knowing what they know, seeing what they see. And I can\u2019t imagine how anybody who has had the nerve and the audacity to run for a United States Senate seat, and they can\u2019t stand up to this lying, dishonorable president.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve to be elected by anything and anybody and serve this country if they have that kind of fear. If you have that kind of fear, you\u2019re not a good representative. You don\u2019t know what it takes to make good public policy. You don\u2019t stand up for the security of this country. And so I have no respect for any senator, any member of Congress, who is not willing to put themselves on the line for this country. And understand that our security is at stake.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On this Sunday's broadcast of\u00a0 \"AM Joy\" on MSNBC, Rep.
