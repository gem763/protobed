Get that f*****g p***.\"\n\nThe \"outrageous\" scenes erupted at 9.30am after a window of the family\u2019s grey Audi A3 was smashed by a girl while bailiffs were attempting to repossess the vehicle.\n\nProsecutor Claire Holmes told the court that the officer was concerned that one of the bites had broken the skin and she \"didn\u2019t know what she could have contracted\".\n\nMiss Holmes said: \"In the footage you can hear her saying 'f*****g p***' and the word 'p***' being used to describe officer Hussain. The officer is heard in the footage saying 'she bit me, she bit me'.\n\n\"A second officer, an officer Waller, said she begins to help the defendant Johnson to her feet and cover up her modesty with the dressing gown.\n\n\"However, as she led the defendant to the van, she calls her 'an ugly cow' and then proceeded to spit in her face.\"\n\n(Image: HullLive/MEN Media)\n\nJohnson pleaded guilty to assaulting two police officers and racially aggravated public order offence, namely threatening behaviour, at an earlier hearing.\n\nCatherine Kioko-Gilligan, defending, said the defendant\u2019s recollection of events \"remained hazy\", but accepted what she did \"at the earliest opportunity\".\n\nShe told the court: \"I ask the court to step back from an immediate custodial sentence and withdraw from activating the suspended sentence and she can continue with the progress made and support she is receiving from the probation service.\n\n\"Given her mental health problems, she has attended appointments which is becoming positive, and by drawing back from sending the defendant to prison, which will no doubt cause her distress in the future.\"\n\n(Image: HullLive/MEN Media)\n\nThe court was told Johnson's mother died when she was aged 12 \"which she was still deeply affected by\" and had also brought up her twin daughters by herself.\n\nJohnson had received a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, on January 23 this year.\n\nShe had \"set about\" a family after spotting them in Chanterlands Avenue and punched a 13-year-old girl before raining punches down on the girl's mother in an \"abhorrent\" attack in April 2018.\n\nJohnson had even bragged about the attack on Facebook and then later told Hull Live she would 'do it again in a heartbeat'.\n\nAs part of her sentence, an order was made to carry out unpaid work and attend a better relationships programme.\n\nHowever, the court revealed she had completed no work and only attended 22 out of 40 rehabilitation appointments.\n\n(Image: HullLive/MEN Media)\n\nJudge Mark Bury said Johnson had \"completely lost control\" in an \"outrageous\" attack on the two officers. He also told her that her behaviour was \"no role model\" for her two daughters.\n\nJailing her for 18 months, Judge Bury said: \"You could not simply stand by and allow these public enforcers do their job and take away the car which you couldn't pay for.\n\n\"What you did in attacking the officer was completely outrageous, you totally lost control.\n\n\"When PC Hussain tried to do her job, you called her a 'f*****g p***' and then when she restrained you, you bit her which she describes as 'clamping down'.\n\n\"It is the court's duty to protect emergency service workers so they can carry out their work. PC Waller helped you and was courteous towards you, but when you were led to the van you spat in her face.\n\n(Image: HullLive/MEN Media)\n\n\"This is simply outrageous behaviour. For the previous offence which took place in August last year, you were very lucky not to go to prison.\n\n\"The previous judge took pity on you and suspended the sentence for what was a particularly unpleasant and nasty assault. That's not being a role model at all.\n\n\"I have taken into account everything and immediate custody today is inevitable, however, I take a merciful course.\n\n\"I activate the suspended sentence of 12 months and I add six months consecutively for each of the three new charges, to run concurrent to the original offence.\"\n\nShouting from the dock to her daughters, she said: \"Love you.\"", "description": "Gemma Johnson\n, 34, described PC Hussain as a 'f*****g p***' and bit her hands several times in the attack outside her home in Hull", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Hulllive Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557226.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS173175201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
