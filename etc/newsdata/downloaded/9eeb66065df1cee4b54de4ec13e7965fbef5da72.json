Customers can book a bus between the airport and any Landline destination as part of their itinerary, and critically, the companies will work together to accomodate displaced passengers. \"Unforeseen circumstances can delay road or air travel,\" Landline's website reads. \"Should this occur, you will automatically be rebooked on the next available Landline or flight.\"\n\nThe three-hour trip between Duluth and Minneapolis costs as little as $5 each way (fares during peak times start at $9) and Landline allows a full-size bag, carry-on and personal item free of charge.
