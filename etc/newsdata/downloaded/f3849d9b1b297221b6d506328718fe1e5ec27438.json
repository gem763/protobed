It's just one of those spots where you could expect to find that type of building.'\n\nBut in November last year, Edward was forced to apologise to local residents who complained the grey concrete property was unfinished and had become an 'eyesore' on the beautiful coastline.\n\nViewers will have to wait to find out whether the project is yet to be completed until the episode airs.\n\nEdward Short, 50, and his wife Hazel, will appear on tonight's episode of channel 4's Grand Designs, where they will reveal the torment of building their 'dream' lighthouse home\n\nThe couple, who lived in a fairly modest house on the clifftop (pictured) before they started the build, explain they wanted a house which would do the site 'justice'\n\nOn this evening's programme, Edward explains that he had long dreamed of building a lighthouse on the cliff - but says several factors got in the way.\n\n'This house doesn't do the spot justice,' admits Hazel. 'We want glistening white, with lots of glass. It should look striking. It should look fantastic.'\n\nThe couple say they planned to build the luxury home, comprised of a huge circular tower and spectacular glass edge infinity swimming pool, in just 18 months.\n\nThe six-bedroom house, which they hoped would also feature a home cinema and a sauna and steam room, boasts panoramic views across Croyde Bay to the north, as well as to Saunton beach and Braunton Burrows to the south.\n\nLast year, local residents called the lighthouse 'an eyesore' after it emerged the building was still unfinished - almost a decade after permission to build was granted\n\nBut it soon emerges that the build is almost impossible, with Kevin calling the project 'total madness'.\n\nAs builders try to start erecting the steel structure of the home, they reveal even the slightest breeze makes it incredibly difficult to build.\n\nThe builders tell Edward: 'Because it's so exposed here, if I'm lifting up 12, 13 ft steel if a gust of wind suddenly comes, that steel will suddenly swing. And I've got no way of stopping it.'\n\nAnd Edward admits the weather is pushing back the development on the house, saying that losing 'three months' on the project 'would be a disaster'.\n\nLater, he adds that the experience has been horrifying and says: 'Terrifying doesn't really sum it up to be honest.'\n\nAnd Edward's downhearted daughters also doubt the lighthouse is 'ever going to happen.'\n\nIn November last year, it emerged the house was still unfinished, almost a decade after Edward and Hazel were granted permission for the project.\n\nEdward says he had always dreamed of knocking down the modest home on the clifftop (pictured) and building a lighthouse in its place\n\nThe ambitious couple have been working on the home ever since they were granted permission to build in 2010\n\nAt the time, many in the local community dubbed the house a 'total eyesore' and took to social media to express their strong views.\n\nOne unimpressed Facebook user wrote: 'From the water it looks like a North Korea missile bunker. Total eyesore.'\n\nA further critic complained: 'I don't mind the house, just its location. It's not too intrusive from the road but from Saunton beach it's a total eyesore in my opinion.'\n\nWhile many feel the building project which got underway in 2014 has taken too long, Edward spoke out addressed the comments.\n\nAt the time, he told the North Devon Journal: 'We can only apologise for the delay in completing the build which we are aware is currently an eyesore.\n\n'The fencing around the site is stipulated to be there by health and safety and can not be removed, which would also invalidate any insurance.'\n\n'We are working hard with all involved to finish the build as soon as possible and limited works are taking place.\n\n'We can only hope for some patience with the complexities of the location.'", "description": "Edward Short, 50, and his wife Hazel, from Devon, were granted permission to build their dream white-art deco lighthouse build in 2010.
