Notably, the RFV deal was structured through an SPV that is managed by Anthemis Group, a major early-stage investor in Tide and one of the most active fintech investors.\n\nJeroen van Doornik, Partner at RFV, said:\n\nThis investment in Tide will generate valuable insights regarding innovation and development in SME banking and further allows us to work together with Anthemis and alongside existing investors such as LocalGlobe.\n\nThe funding will help Tide substantially increase its share of the UK business banking market, as well as to support the company\u2019s planned international expansion.\n\nDesigned for SMEs and sole traders\n\nIf you are unaware, Tide is a fintech and banking company in the UK offering banking service designed for SMEs and sole traders providing them with a curated offering of the best financial products sourced from third-party partners.\n\nWith this platform, customers can manage their accounts through the app or the web browser without the need to visit a branch. The company aims to create a digital banking platform targeting a UK market share of 8% within four years.\n\nSurpassed 100,000 users!\n\nThe London-based fintech platform has already surpassed 100,000 users, thanks to the demand for better customer service, lower costs, and less bureaucracy.

We believe this is one of the largest Series B rounds ever secured by a UK fintech company. As we outlined earlier this year, securing more funding means we can accelerate our strategy to capture a significant share of the UK SME banking market. We want to challenge the oligopoly that has dominated and failed SMEs for too long. With a clear plan for growth in the UK backed by significant investment, we are ready for an exciting future, which includes looking at taking Tide to an international market.\n\nRabo Frontier Ventures!\n\nRFV is a \u20ac150 million investment fund of Rabobank, focusing globally on innovative fintech and agtech companies.
