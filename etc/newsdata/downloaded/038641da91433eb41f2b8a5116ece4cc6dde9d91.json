The newspaper\u2019s esteemed board argued that any talk of impeaching Trump is silly, in large part, because this president is likely too bumbling to execute that kind of scandalous quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cIntriguingly, Mr. [Bill] Taylor says in his statement that many people in the administration opposed the [Rudy] Giuliani effort, including some in senior positions at the White House,\u201d the editorial board wrote. \u201cThis matters because it may turn out that while Mr. Trump wanted a quid-pro-quo policy ultimatum toward Ukraine, he was too inept to execute it. Impeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the government, and most presidents at some point or another in office.\u201d\n\nTrump, a routine morning reader and skimmer of several newspapers\u2019 print editions, saw this editorial\u2014which was obviously meant to defend him\u2014last week. And the president promptly began complaining about it to some of those close to him.\n\n\u201c[The president] mentioned he had seen it and then he started saying things like, \u2018What are they talking about, if I wanted to do quid pro quo, I would\u2019ve done the damn quid pro quo,\u2019 and\u2026 then defended his intelligence and then talked about how \u2018perfect\u2019 the call [with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] was,\u201d said a source familiar with Trump\u2019s reaction to the Journal editorial. Another person familiar with the president\u2019s comments on the matter corroborated the account.\n\nInside the Call: How Trump Pushed Ukraine to Probe Biden\n\n\u201cHe was clearly unhappy. He did not like the word \u2018inept,\u2019\u201d the first source added.\n\nThe president\u2019s negative response to the Journal editorial board\u2019s musings mirrors his thinking on his now-infamous Zelensky phone call, which helped trigger the whistleblower complaint that led to the impeachment probe: He couldn\u2019t have perpetrated an impeachable offense because he isn\u2019t enough of an imbecile to get caught red-handed.\n\n\u201cHow many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?\u201d Trump posted to Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe president has tweeted statements to that effect several times. He also has publicly stressed to reporters, over and over again, that he knew others were listening in on his July conversation with Zelensky, and therefore he wasn\u2019t going to try anything sketchy.\n\nTrump has long been highly sensitive to any jabs, real or perceived, at his level of intelligence or competence. In July, for instance, he tweeted that he is \u201csmart,\u201d a \u201ctrue Stable Genius!\u201d and also \u201cso great looking.\u201d\n\nSenior officials working in Trump\u2019s West Wing are also often tasked with defending the president\u2019s alleged brain power.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump\u2019s former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said at a conference hosted by the Washington Examiner that he told the president not to \u201chire a \u2018yes man,\u2019 someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth\u2026 because if you do, I believe you will be impeached.\u201d Kelly also said he regretted departing the administration and claimed he could have acted as a moderating force on Trump, thus forestalling the Democrats\u2019 impeachment drive.\n\nOn Saturday, after Kelly\u2019s comments began making the rounds, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham quickly returned fire, saying in a statement to CNN, \u201cI worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great President.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Photo by Gerardo Mora/GettyAs Donald Trump gets dragged deeper, and deeper, and deeper into his Ukraine scandal and the impeachment inquiry accelerates toward a likely House vote before the year\u2019s end, the president is increasingly insistent that,", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hDATa3i0mG..KWXnZlnyMA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/36baf1d965780fc098e7de379563ddd8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
