The company filed a patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for what's called \u201csmart clothing,\u201d which would likely connect with devices like the Apple Watch to measure health vitals, including ECG readings.\n\nApple\u2019s patent, which was filed last year, shows a soft-and-stretchy, ring-shaped band that can be woven into clothing fabric with sensors and circuitry that will gather information on the user\u2019s health data, according to Patently Apple.\n\nThe smart clothing would measure heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, electrocardiograms, blood oxygen levels and respiration rates. The patent also describes fitness-related metrics as well, such as step count.\n\nThe device could respond to voice commands through a microphone and will be capable of communicating wirelessly with other Apple electronic equipment.\n\nAs for fabric, Apple\u2019s patent notes that yarns may be formed from a combination of polymer, ceramic, graphite, glass, metal, cotton or bamboo.\n\nDaniel Podhajny is listed as a product designer for Apple\u2019s smart clothing patent, who had previously worked at Nike as their \u2018Knit Exploration Innovator\u2019 and was behind the brand\u2019s Nike Flykit line of knitted, breathable athletic footwear.\n\nThe caveat is that such fabric-based smart clothing will require extreme care, and might be difficult to keep clean. However, Apple\u2019s patent does state that the \u201cfabric-based item may be configured to sustain relatively high temperatures such as those associated with laundering of clothing.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nApple\u2019s patent was published Firday, so it will still likely take some time before smart clothing products hit the market, and pricing has yet to be determined.", "description": "Apple has filed a patent for 'smart clothing' that will sensor vital signs for a potential new line of athletic-wear.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/apple-logo-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
