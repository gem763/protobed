USA TODAY\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2013 The New Orleans Pelicans tried to slow the Zion Williamson Hype Train.\n\nA troublesome right knee brought it to a screeching halt.\n\nNot only will Williamson miss the Pelicans\u2019 season opener Tuesday at Toronto (8 p.m. ET, TNT), he will miss about six-to-eight weeks after undergoing surgery Monday to address a torn right lateral meniscus, the team said in a news release late Monday afternoon.\n\nSo what was billed as a marquee lid-lifter features the defending champion Raptors without NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and the Pelicans without the most touted rookie since LeBron James.\n\nWilliamson's absence puts a damper on opening night and the first two months of the season. He was already a must-see attraction and his debut will have to wait until sometime near Christmas.\n\nThe Pelicans' growth will also be stunted because Williamson is such a big part of their present and future, and though the Pelicans still have talent to win games, the excitement around their season crashed before it even began. In the deep Western Conference, New Orleans is a borderline playoff team, and without Williamson even for six-to-eight weeks, it makes postseason goals that much more difficult.\n\nBut for the Pelicans, Williamson means more than one season. Yes, they want him on the court as much as possible, but his long-term health \u2013 and we're talking multiple seasons \u2013 is far more important than two months worth of games. New Orleans needs to be cautious. There's no other way around it. There's just too much at stake.\n\nEveryone involved in the NBA wanted to see his debut Tuesday, the most anticipated since James played his first game for Cleveland in 2003. That includes networks TNT and ESPN. The Pelicans are on national TV, including NBA TV, nine times the first five weeks.\n\nWilliamson will eventually play, but this absence invites larger questions about his health. He was injured at Duke, was held out of summer league games as a precaution after sustaining a bruised left knee and now this. Individually, each issue is not a big deal. Collectively, though, are these signs of the potential for long-term health problems?\n\nHe is an explosive big man (6-6, 285) who puts pressure on his knees and feet and that has resulted in lingering health problems for other players. Greg Oden is the extreme example and Amar'e Stoudemire is an example of a player who had knee injuries but forged a productive career. Then, there's James, who has been relatively injury free despite his combination of size, power and quickness.\n\nZion Williamson had surgery Monday to address a torn meniscus in his right knee. (Photo: Darren Abate, AP)\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports that Williamson avoided a major knee injury in his next-to-last preseason game last week. The person was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about Williamson's health.\n\nThere\u2019s a valid reason for the pall that befell the NBA upon this news. Williamson had an impressive preseason, averaging 23.3 points and shooting 71.4% from the field, including 12-for-13 in one game. He showed off his powerful dunks, ability to score with great efficiency and a crafty game that includes finesse.\n\nYes, it was just the preseason. But Williamson is a significant reason the Pelicans should be fun to watch and possibly make the playoffs.\n\n\u201cSome of it is what we suspected,\u201d Gentry said of Williamson\u2019s game. \u201cHis body control is unbelievable, avoiding charging fouls and things like that. I didn\u2019t know he had that in his game. Just the poise that he has. Never really seem(s) to get upset or anything. That seems to be a really big asset for him, too.\u201d\n\nCLICK & ROLL: Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter\n\nPREVIEW: 25 most interesting players for 2019-20 season\n\nOPINION: Bucks doing all the right things to keep Giannis\n\nThe early returns on Williamson since training camp opened have been fantastic. Williamson has confidence without being arrogant. He displays genuine humility. His magnetic, easy-going, fun-loving personality, electric smile and thoughtful answers add to the attraction.\n\nWilliamson is asked often about pressure \u2013 the same question he fielded during his one season at Duke. The answer each time is similar.\n\n\u201cI just be myself,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change who I am because there was a time when I didn\u2019t have all this and I was the same person.\u201d\n\nBut what about all the hype?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to it at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the moment I start letting the outside noise dictate my game, something\u2019s wrong. \u2026 I don\u2019t watch much TV. I just play my game. I play the game I love. People try to add unnecessary pressure. ... My game is to go out there and win. Whatever the team needs me to do, I\u2019m ready to do it.\u201d\n\nWell, not quite.\n\nThe Pelicans have been impressed with Williamson\u2019s approach since they drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in June.\n\n\"He\u2019s touched by the hand of God to play the game,\" said David Griffin, the Pelicans' executive vice president of basketball operations. \"When you get to see that happen and you get to see that start to come together, it\u2019s fun. We\u2019re just in this sort of early stages with this right now.\u201d\n\nAnd despite how the Pelicans try to spin it, Williamson is at the center of their plan. With their investment in Williamson as both player and person, the Pelicans will remain cautious with his return. They don't want a situation where this knee issue lingers or turns into something worse, which would be problematic for the franchise that has potential to be a significant factor in the Western Conference in the future.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still 19, a very young 19,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI think Zion is finding more comfort just with himself as a man, as a person. And that\u2019s really important to us. We don\u2019t have expectations that we are hoisting on him with the players. It\u2019s really about finding himself, finding comfort with his teammates, finding his role and we\u2019re blessed. All Zion wants to do is win.\u201d\n\nNow, we're just waiting for the Zion Hype Train to start rolling again.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "description": "New Orleans' growth will be stunted because Zion Williamson, the most touted rookie since LeBron James, is a key figure to their present and future.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
