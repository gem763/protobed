His successor, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has criticized how the case was handled and the release of suspects at the heart of the probe.\n\nDeputy interior minister Alejandro Encinas, the official overseeing the reopening of the case, told a news conference 77 of 142 suspects detained over the Sept. 26, 2014 disappearances in the southwestern city of Iguala had been released by courts.\n\nThe drug gang leader, Gildardo Lopez Astudillo, was recently released after a judge found officials had tortured him to get evidence. The U.N. human rights office said last year that authorities had probably tortured dozens of people in the case.\n\nEncinas said the probe by prosecutors into the officials in charge of the case would focus \"in particular\" on Jesus Murillo, Tomas Zeron and Jose Aaron Perez Carro.\n\nMurillo was the attorney general who presented the government's official account of what happened to the students, while Zeron headed the agency that led the investigation. Perez was in charge of a special office dedicated to the Iguala case.\n\nMurillo and Zeron became lightning rods for public anger over the scandal, which helped undermine trust in the previous administration and pave the way for Lopez Obrador's landslide victory in last year's presidential election.\n\nMurillo could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the official government account, the drug gang killed the students after mistaking them for members of a rival outfit. It said the killers then incinerated and ground up their remains, before dumping them in a nearby river.\n\nIt was there on Oct. 29, 2014 that Zeron's team said it found a bone fragment belonging to the only one of the 43 students whose remains have been definitively identified.\n\nBut a team of independent experts who picked holes in the account found that Zeron had been to where the fragment was discovered a day earlier with an alleged gang member, without notifying the man's lawyer or filing a report on his visit.\n\nZeron has denied any wrongdoing.
