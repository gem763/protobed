Promoters say that the most sought-after acts can charge upwards of $200,000 for a set lasting a few hours at one of the top venues.\n\nBut the appeal to DJs goes beyond the bottom line.\n\n\"Dubai is a great city that reminds me of Ibiza,\" says award-winning DJ and producer Luciano (Lucien Nicolet), who has played at several of the top clubs in Dubai.\n\n\"You get a very international crowd which is good to play for. People who have been traveling, who are knowledgeable and open to discovering new things.\"\n\nThe year-round sunshine is also appealing, Luciano adds, and the clubs tend to boast ultra-modern equipment and facilities.\n\nDJ Dany Neville puts the needle on the groove of Dubai's dance music scene.\n\nMelting pot\n\nThe current profusion of venues and influx of talent to Dubai is a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nBritish music journalist Lesley Wright arrived in 2013 and recalls it being \"early days\" for the club scene.\n\nMore than 90% of Dubai's population is comprised of expats, and the new arrivals imported elements of their own musical traditions.\n\n\"Young people from the UK, Italy, Lebanon...who were used to their own club culture were coming over and starting their own little parties,\" says Wright. \"It has been great to see that grow over the past seven years.\"\n\nMost clubs in Dubai are located in hotels, the only venues licensed to sell alcohol. Many club nights in five-star hotels are high-end affairs themselves - what Wright describes as \"champagne and sparklers\" events - featuring VIP table service around a small dancefloor.\n\nBut she says that nightlife has greatly diversified in recent years, with large-capacity, dance-oriented venues opening in the city and booking top-tier talent, such as Base and Soho Beach in 2017.\n\nSoho Beach Dubai. @evgenijten\n\nThere has also been a move toward smaller, independent events, such as The Hatch and alternative favorite Analog Room with DJs playing underground house and techno for connoisseur crowds.\n\n\"Our passion was to change the culture and be more than a party,\" says Mehdi Ansari, the Iranian founder of Analog Room. \"We are about empowering the local scene...for a year we only booked local (performers).\"\n\nAnalog Room now showcases a mix of local and international talent. When Ansari books foreign performers he tends to favor cult favorite DJs such as Nick Hoppner, who made his name in Berlin's legendary Panorama Bar.\n\nWright believes that greater savvy among promoters has contributed to the development of Dubai nightlife.\n\n\"(Before) you would have a lot of DJs coming to town and playing the same night,\" she says. \"But there are only so many people to go around so some venues would not have great crowds...and the atmosphere could be a bit flat.\"\n\n\"Now promoters are more open with each other and discuss what's going on so great nights don't clash.\"\n\nWright adds that seasoned promoters have learned to play on Dubai's position between larger destinations, such as through cajoling performers to add dates to tours of Australia.\n\nAdaptation is a two-way street\n\nA degree of adaptation is required to play Dubai, some performers say.\n\n\"Over the years I've been slowly absorbing the nightlife and lifestyle of Dubai,\" says Grammy award winner Afrojack (Nick van de Wall), who now lives in the city.\n\nThe Dutch-Surinamese DJ credits \"going out to restaurants, going to the oversized shopping malls, showing around family and friends, and all those things combined really gives you an ear to sound of the street, which in Dubai is very versatile.\"\n\nBeyond musical adaptation, there are also cultural differences that international DJs would encounter relative to other clubbing destinations such as Berlin or New York.\n\nA Muslim governorate, there are laws against public intoxication and indecency. Some high-profile DJs have fallen foul of strict prohibition of illegal drugs.\n\nIn practice, Hijazi says, clubbers rarely fall foul of these laws. He believes the city is seeing an \"ongoing shift towards greater tolerance.\"\n\nFor their part, Dubai's authorities prize an image of modernity and appear keen to develop nightlife in the city. The government's official tourism website exhorts visitors to come and \"party the night away.\"\n\nCrowds enjoying a night at the Analog Room club. Analog Room\n\nNew horizons\n\nWhile Dubai's club scene has made advances in recent years, there are lingering bugbears for its protagonists.\n\nPromoters can still face delays securing work visas for international performers, although such requests are rarely refused.\n\nWright has some concerns that wealthy entrepreneurs buy into storied venues without much affinity for music or clubbing culture, which can result in mismanagement.\n\nThe city is gaining new clubs all the time, but popular nightspots such as 360 and Cirque Le Soir have permanently closed.\n\nBut such frustrations are largely outweighed by belief in the prospects for nightlife in Dubai. Hijazi points to the launch of a first warehouse-style venue in the city. The Lebanese promoter has also introduced a taste of festival culture in neighboring Fujeirah, while Ansari has bought multimedia festival MUTEK to Dubai.\n\nAnsari says that some DJs come to Dubai for money, others come for a good time, and a third group are motivated by the possibility of being part of something special.\n\n\"These are people who first experienced electronic music in the 1980s and 1990s in their own city and know that moment is not repeatable,\" he says. \"Now they feel that energy again -- the magic of a movement - on the other side of the world.\"", "description": "From Martin Garrix to Hardwell, Don Diablo to Afrojack, many of the world's top DJs are flocking to the Emirate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191015125707-base-club-dubai-3-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
