But despite the best intentions, opting for a pricier \"grain free\" option could actually be doing your pet more harm than good.\n\nWhile some headlines have suggested that grains are simply used to bulk food out, are hard for animals to digest and could be responsible for allergies in pets, both cats and dogs can actually benefit nutritionally from grains. Meanwhile, a grain-free diet in dogs has recently been linked to increased incidence of canine heart disease.\n\nThe most important thing for any pet is a nutritionally-balanced diet \u2013 and that\u2019s where the experts at Purina come in. With more than 90 years of scientific research and development by vets and nutritionists, their pet food is designed to help keep your pet as healthy and active as possible.\n\nDogs\u2019 dietary needs can be met by either meat or plants, while cats need some meat in their diet, but can supplement this with other food. And far from being included in pet food simply as a filler, grains such as corn, wheat and barley \u2013 all found in Purina products \u2013 are a great source of essential nutrients for cats and dogs. Their high levels of carbohydrates and low sugar content help to give your pet a sustained release of long-lasting energy, and as long as they are properly cooked, should be easy to digest. Grains are also high in fibre, which helps encourage good intestinal bacteria and positively impacts many areas of digestive health, such as regular bowel movements.\n\nCarbohydrates are an essential part of canine diets as this is where they get their energy from. So even pet foods marketed as \"grain free\" will contain carbs, usually in the form of potato or pea flour. And despite common misconceptions, very few dogs and cats have a true allergy to grains or gluten.\n\nGrains are among a blend of nutrients within Purina pet foods that include essential fatty acids, B vitamins, antioxidants, protein and trace minerals. These can contribute to a range of health benefits \u2013 from keeping eyes in tip-top shape, to boosting the immune system \u2013 and help to provide a balanced diet to ensure your pet is as healthy and happy as possible.", "description": "> Pets are like members of the family, so it\u2019s no surprise that recent research found that UK dog owners spend an average of \u00a358 per month on dog food, while cat owners spend \u00a336.
