The founder of venture capital firm Betaworks and former Time Warner (T) and AOL (VZ) executive believes the information-gathering performed by such devices is tantamount to surveillance.\n\n\u201cI would say that there's two or three layers sort of problematic layers with these new smart speakers, smart earphones that are in market now,\u201d Borthwick told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer during an interview for his series \u201cInfluencers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so the first is, from a consumer standpoint, user standpoint, is that these, these devices are being used for what's \u2014 it's hard to call it anything but surveillance,\u201d Borthwick said.\n\nJohn Borthwick talks to Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer. More\n\nThe way forward? Some form of regulation that gives users more control over their own data.\n\n\u201cI personally believe that you, as a user and as somebody who likes technology, who wants to use technology, that you should have far more rights about your data usage than we have today,\u201d Borthwick said.\n\nSmart assistants face a reckoning\n\nThe venture capitalist\u2019s comments follow a string of controversies surrounding smart assistants including Google\u2019s Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Siri, in which each company admitted that human workers listen to users\u2019 queries as a means of improving their digital assistants\u2019 voice recognition capabilities.\n\n\u201cThey've gone to those devices and they've said, \u2018Give us data when people passively act upon the device.\u2019 So in other words, I walk over to that light switch,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cI turn it off, turn it on, it's now giving data back to the smart speaker.\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that smart speakers from every major company are only activated when you use their appropriate wake word. To activate your Echo speaker, for instance, you need to say \u201cAlexa\u201d followed by your command. The same thing goes for Google\u2019s Assistant and Apple\u2019s Siri.\n\nThe uproar surrounding smart speakers and their assistants began when Bloomberg reported in April that Amazon used a global team of employees and contractors to listen to users\u2019 voice commands to Alexa to improve its speech recognition.\n\nA general view of an Amazon Echo smart speaker alongside an ear thermometer and some pills.

The Guardian then published a third piece about Apple employees listening to users\u2019 Siri commands. Facebook was also pulled into the controversy when Bloomberg reported it had employees listen to users\u2019 voice commands made through its Messenger app.\n\nGoogle and Apple have since apologized, with Google halting the practice, and Apple announcing that it will automatically opt users out of voice sample collection. Users instead will have to opt in if they want to provide voice samples to improve Siri\u2019s voice recognition.\n\nAmazon, for its part, has allowed users to opt out of having their voice samples shared with employees, while Facebook said it has paused the practice.", "description": "Venture Capitalist John Borthwick says that smart speakers' ability to listen to users is similar to surveillance.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gl8T4VgVTP2Z4oQWVT0tdA--~B/aD0zMjY4O3c9NDY2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/91d0c270-ca9b-11e9-b5f6-bd97cf536191"}
