(Teddy Amenabar/The Washington Post)\n\nIn many ways, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is already larger than life, with an adoring fandom, a rap-influenced nickname bestowed by admirers and two motion pictures depicting her life. But now, the expression is becoming quite literal.\n\nThere\u2019s a new mural of the 86-year-old justice near the intersection of 15th and U streets in Northwest Washington. Pedestrians can find the art installment tucked in an alley between Bread Bite Bakery and Flock DC, the D.C.-based real estate group behind the project.\n\nD.C. native Rose Jaffe, 30, was commissioned by the company over the summer to paint the mural, a combination of panels and painting directly on the building\u2019s exposed brick. Jaffe is a self-described \u201cfeminist, activist-oriented artist\u201d and said she was \u201cjust over the moon\u201d when she first took the project to paint Ginsburg, a hero of hers for as long as she can remember.\n\nIn the mural, Ginsburg is wearing her judicial robes with a signature decorative collar, smiling as she gazes toward the U Street corridor. There\u2019s a flock of birds around her \u2014 a reference to Flock DC. The founder and owner of the group, Lisa Wise, told The Washington Post she hopes people will see the birds as a way to \u201crelease their own passion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope tied up with\u201d Ginsburg, said Wise, 47.\n\nJaffe finished the mural Monday, and it\u2019s already making the rounds on D.C. Instagram accounts, such as in this photo by Paul Thacker that was later shared by PoPville, a D.C. community website.\n\n\u201cThe public reaction is one of my favorite parts of doing murals and public art,\u201d Jaffe told The Post. \u201cWhen it\u2019s outside, it\u2019s for everyone.\u201d\n\nAs a female-owned business, it was important for Flock DC to hire a female artist for the project, Wise said. It\u2019s hard to go wrong having a positive conversation starter like this, she said, even if it\u2019s political. The company has always been political and left-leaning, she added.\n\n\u201cI always dreamed of having a really powerful, iconic woman that was on the side of our building,\u201d Wise said. \u201cIt made sense to have her be that figure.\u201d\n\nVictor Galindo, who lives a block away from the mural, stopped to take a photograph of the wall Tuesday evening after hearing about the installation from his neighborhood email group.\n\n\u201cIt comes at an opportune time, considering what\u2019s going on in our country,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for us. It\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\nGinsburg spoke at the National Book Fair a few weeks ago, discussing her recovery after four bouts of cancer in an interview with NPR legal affairs reporter Nina Totenberg. Ginsburg drew throngs of fans to the event as the court\u2019s oldest member and leader of its liberal wing.\n\nAndy Ford, who used to live in the District and was visiting from Ohio for a conference, said he does wonder whether a mural of Ginsburg fits in with the black history of the U Street corridor. Still, Ford, 53, said he loves the mural because of all that Ginsburg has accomplished on the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cHow does that not make you smile?\u201d he said, turning toward the art.\n\nAlex Stoller, 32, works at the design firm Swatchroom and said she\u2019s a fan of Jaffe\u2019s work throughout the city. So far, Jaffe has painted about 20 indoor and outdoor murals across the District.\n\n\u201cShe does a great job of being organically present in a lot of different facets of D.C. culture,\u201d said Stoller, 32.\n\nStoller said she sees the mural as \u201cplayful but large and in charge.\"\n\nJaffe said the project took 10 days, including work in the studio and on location. For this project, Jaffe said, it was important to nail Ginsburg\u2019s likeness, and she painted directly on panels to capture a \u201csharper, crisper portrait.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s always a chance the justice might stop by to see the mural on the way to work.\n\n\u201cI hope that she sees it,\u201d Jaffe said, laughing. \u201cThat would really make my life.\u201d\n\n[Ask The Post: What questions do you have about D.C. or the region?]", "description": "The project was undertaken by D.C. native Rose Jaffe, who has painted other murals throughout the city.", "authors": ["Teddy Amenabar", "Audience Editor Embedded On The Local Desk", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/m8JkYIzhO-nS0spIR8XqSSuwln0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DO36BHP4WJANJD24ORIBWCHNFE.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
