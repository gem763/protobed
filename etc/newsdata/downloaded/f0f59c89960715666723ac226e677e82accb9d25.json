You\u2019re so excited to see a new Star Wars movie, so happy to be there, so in awe of the spectacle and callbacks, so happy George Lucas has been removed, that you failed to realize that The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi were not very good \u2014 at least until you tried to watch them again at home where you found your iPhone more interesting for uncomfortably long stretches.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of how Last Jedi dumped all over the franchise\u2019s own mythology, most especially surrounding the Jedi, and how these movies keep killing off the only characters we care about. This new trailer has a quick shot of Billy Dee Williams, but instead of getting excited, all I could think of was how they intend to kick Lando Calrissian\u2019s bucket.\n\nAnd what\u2019s Poe doing there \u2014 is the sexist oaf of Last Jedi heroic again? Is that allowed? Unlike our own, does the Star Wars universe offer forgiveness for #MeToo perpetrators?\n\nI see Palpatine is back\u2026 So Darth Vader died for no reason.\n\nSo they\u2019re killing off Luke, Han, Vader; they\u2019ve lost Leia, but Palpatine lives on\u2026 why, exactly? Is there going to be some awkward third-act reveal of a sinister Master Plan that wraps up all nine chapters? Or will we see Palpatine leave the dark side, get killed off (again), and do a spirit dance among the Ewoks?\n\nMaybe his return has something to do with how Rian Johnson killed off that Snoke guy before we had any clue who he was or what he was up to. Or the fact that none of the plot threads at the end of Last Jedi were interesting enough to draw fans back for another chapter. Or the fact that Kathleen Kennedy injecting juvenile politics into the series has hurt the bottom line \u2014 big time.\n\nWhatever the reason, it\u2019s clear that JJ Abrams was brought back for a cleanup on Aisle Disney. But with so many new characters, this doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be a lean, straightforward escapist fantasy. It\u2019s looking a lot more like Abrams just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and dumped all of his unused ideas onto the screen.\n\nThe social media response to the trailer has been mixed. Let\u2019s just say that a whole lot of detractors have a whole lot of questions:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get answers but the plot holes from 8 are gonna carry over. C-3PO met Rey twice and suddenly he\u2019s sentimental for her. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a good movie and maybe I\u2019ll enjoy it maybe even like it but this trilogy should have never happened. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I care? This new franchise has destroyed every character I loved front to back and, in Return you replaced them with dead replicas and plot progression worse than most fanfic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she\u2019s training on Endor, Kylo shows up, Palpatine has wanted to get these two together, has had a fleet hiding underwater/on an iceberg? And Kylo and Rey team up again?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo is this one be as feminist sexist as the last one? After all, they killed off most of the main characters in the last one, so can\u2019t get much worse. Though I am sure Disney will find a way to take its final [poop emoji] to destroy the Star Wars franchise.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018People keep telling me they know me. No one does.\u2019 You\u2019re right. And that\u2019s a problem when we are entering the THIRD chapter of your story.\u201d\n\n-\u201cWhere were these million ships in the last two movies? Oh and the Emperor looks like he survived for real and is on a floating machine thing? So that\u2019s great. So much for Anakin\u2019s sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\u201cA cavalry charge. On the top of a star destroyer. In space. With what looks like regular horses with tusks. I- did I have a stroke? Tell me I had a stroke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to Rian Johnson. JJ has to give answers to who is Rey, who is Snoke, who are the knights of ren, how did palps get back and many more things all in just 150 minutes\u2026 I want to be hyped for ep 9 but im almost certain that it is not gonna give the fans satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThis guy sums it up best: \u201d Be honest \u2013 In these trailers\u2026 it\u2019s always the music that gets us more than these characters.\u201d\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
