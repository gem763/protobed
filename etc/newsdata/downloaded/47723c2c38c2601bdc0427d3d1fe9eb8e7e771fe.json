On an annual basis, it held at 1.6% against the RBA's target band of 2% to 3%.\n\nThe two key measures of underlying inflation - trimmed mean and weighted median - also undershot the RBA's goal, averaging around 1.4% for the year.", "description": "Australia inflation cools in third-quarter, highlights challenge for RBA", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T02I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
