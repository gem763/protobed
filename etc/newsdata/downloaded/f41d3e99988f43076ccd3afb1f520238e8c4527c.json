The ruling prompted furious protests across Catalonia and led to angry clashes with police after demonstrators attempted to occupy Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport.\n\nIn an emailed interview with Reuters, Junqueras said he was convinced that a political solution had to be found to end the bitter independence conflict.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m sure of is that this conflict is to be resolved via ballot boxes ... we are convinced that sooner or later a referendum is inevitable because otherwise, how can we give a voice to the citizens?\u201d he wrote from prison, adding that he did not regret having organised the referendum in October 2017.\n\nJunqueras also confirmed that he and the other jailed leaders would take their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.\n\nHe said that they would never abandon their push for independence. \u201cPrison and exile have made us stronger and makes us ever more convinced, if that is possible, in our profoundly democratic beliefs,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Catalan pro-independence protesters gather during a demonstration at El Prat airport in Barcelona.

The warrant said Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium to avoid arrest by the Spanish authorities, was wanted for alleged sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nThe verdict and sentences triggered angry protests, with demonstrations held around the region and skirmishes with police at El Prat. Officers used baton charges and foam bullets to try to dislodge protesters.\n\nSome trains were also halted after protesters put burning tyres and wood on rail lines and blocked roads and the airport entrance. Around 110 flights were cancelled.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A defiant Oriol Junqueras says crisis \u2018must be resolved via ballot boxes\u2019 as protesters clash with police", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b6de2fe404d13e71c0c2dc12e1e2ba39c634072/0_117_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aaeb943da6e377fd16ed1480eaf92d0c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
