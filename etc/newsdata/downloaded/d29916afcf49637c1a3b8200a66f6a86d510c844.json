And what has he been working on? Well he wants to teach kids how to grow up to be \"human\".\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nDuring a dialogue at the Forbes CEO Conference in Singapore yesterday, the retired founder of Alibaba talked about his plans to return to teaching as part of his retirement. He said he plans to tour schools and visit teachers around the world next year. And in the meantime, he's already worked towards building up \"a bit of a kindergarten\", \"a bit of a primary school\", as well as a middle school.\n\nHe says he's been working with teachers in rural areas of China for the past five years, and he's got a few ideas to help that he wants to develop.\n\nMa joked about how, because he failed his primary, middle school, and university entrance exams, he would never have been employed at Alibaba today, what with all the Ivy League graduates applying. However, even as he joked about all the smart people among the younger generation entering the work force, he also expressed his worry that kids today will be ill-equipped to deal with a digital future if current education systems are not revamped in the next two or three decades.\n\nDon't Miss 15.1 K SHARES 133 SHARES 102 SHARES 126 SHARES\n\nThe retired CEO said he's proud of all the smart employees at Alibaba today, but he prefers people to be wise rather than intelligent, and to be able to listen to their hearts.\n\n\"Most smart people want to win,\" he said. \"We want to make smart people learn how to live like a human, how to care about others. When smart people learn how to care about others, how to care about the future, how to be human, then a company becomes warm, things go smooth, and it has soft power. Otherwise, you have a group of gangsters.\"\n\n\"This is why I believe we need more wise people and leaders,\" Ma continued. \"A smart machine will be always smarter than you are; a machine can never be wiser. Machines don't have hearts, machines only have chips. So, this is what I think: human beings should always learn to be wise.\"\n\nIt's part of how he wants to change the education system, so we can inculcate human values and morals into kids alongside training their minds. Specifically, he believes topics like music, dancing, painting and sports are \"very important\" in an education, as they engage people's hearts.\n\n\"When young people learn (about success) too much, they think they can easily succeed,\" Ma said. \"Learn the mistakes, not avoid them. When you meet the mistake, you know how to face it, how to solve it, how to challenge it. This is called wisdom. This is what we should teach our kids.\"", "description": "Jack Ma recently quit as CEO of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, in order to enjoy his retirement and engage in charity work to give back to the community.
