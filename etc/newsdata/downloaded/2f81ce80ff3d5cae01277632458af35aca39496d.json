Participants were aware that schools can also apply pressure to parents or children indirectly.\u201d\n\nMs Spielman, said: \u201cHome education is a legitimate parental choice and can be a positive decision when parents are well equipped to provide a good education.\n\n\u201cHowever, children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school.\n\n\u201cSchools, local authorities and parents need to work together before such a decision is made, to make sure that home education is genuinely in the interests of children and not just the best thing for schools or parents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that parents are fully informed about the alternatives, and that they understand all the implications and costs of home educating their child.\u201d\n\nJulie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cHome education, when entered into for the right reasons, can be a positive choice for families. However, this report suggests that some children may be being educated at home for reasons that are not in their best interests.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously concerning, particularly given that this particularly, according to the report, affects children with complex needs.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cSchool leaders work tirelessly with young people and their parents to ensure they receive a high quality education, and to support children who are having difficulties at school.\n\n\u201cHowever, cuts both to school budgets and to wider support services make it increasingly difficult for schools to provide the high-level support that some children need, which can lead to frustration and friction between schools and families.\n\n\u201cIn addition, places at Pupil Referral Units or other alternative provision are woefully lacking in many areas, limiting the options available for supporting children with complex needs.\u201d\n\nCouncillor Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s Children and Young People Board, said: \u201cWe share Ofsted\u2019s concerns that an increasing number of families of children with complex needs are being encouraged to educate their children at home.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the vast majority of children with Send would benefit from a mainstream education and are therefore pleased that Ofsted are raising awareness of this practise.\n\n\u201cHowever inspectors should go further and consider levels of mainstream inclusion when grading a school, while mainstream schools should be incentivised and rewarded to provide a more inclusive education environment for children with Send.\u201d", "description": "Special educational needs, medical and behavioural reasons were among the main motives for pupils being moved out of schools, the report suggests.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715240-1571094311-743_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
