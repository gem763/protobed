(Even though the task was set in Oxford and Cambridge.)\n\n* and the same team\u2019s uncertainty about when the second World War was.\n\n\u2018Oh that\u2019s a good start!\u2019 tutted Riyonn, about his colleagues\u2019 shocking lack of education, gloriously ignoring the fact he didn\u2019t have a clue either.\n\n\u2018Was it 1945?\u2019 wondered Lewis hopefully, before rather undermining this impressive knowledge by asking: \u2018is that when it started or ended?\u2019\n\nPainfully bad: Tonight though, the candidates were so inept, irrational, and ignorant, it was almost as if last week\u2019s episode and Team Empower\u2019s \u00a31,240,000 orders for their electric bike were a fluke\n\nDefinitely one of them\u2026\n\nPamela\u2019s suggestion for working it out wasn\u2019t exactly encouraging.\n\n\u2018Just think of our parents\u2026 Were they alive?\u2019 she mused. \u2018Or our grandparents?\u2019\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s move on to the next item,\u2019 someone said, settling the matter brilliantly.\n\nThe two Project Managers meanwhile were not only hopeless (standard) but in a way that made you wonder if they\u2019d watched The Apprentice before.\n\nJemelin\u2019s comments in the boardroom certainly indicated she hadn\u2019t seen this round.\n\n\u2018This task was a very hard task!\u2019 she complained \u2013 after she had lost it.\n\nAwkward: One candidate (Thomas Skinner) asking \u2018how come these apples are white but in the supermarket they\u2019re brown?\u2019 (Particularly dumb because a) they weren\u2019t and b) they aren\u2019t)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a very hard task!\u2019 Lord Sugar spluttered, incredulously. \u2018I\u2019ve done this for 15 years!\u2019\n\nNot to be deterred by this minor detail, Jemelin protested: \u2018we didn\u2019t know what the items were!\u2019\n\n\u2018I know that! That\u2019s the point!\u2019 cried Sugar, not unreasonably.\n\nHer rival captain, Marianne\u2019s approach to the practicalities of the challenge also indicated she hadn\u2019t done much research.\n\nAstonished: \u2018It\u2019s not a very hard task!\u2019 Lord Sugar spluttered, incredulously. \u2018I\u2019ve done this for 15 years!\u2019\n\n\u2018I envision this task as being about lateral thinking and that\u2019s an area where I excel,\u2019 she told her colleagues.\n\nThis was hard to argue with. Her belief that lateral thinking had anything to do with completing the list was in itself proof that Marianne was a master of it. (It was of course the exact opposite of lateral thinking).\n\nShe backed this up later by arguing that Lord Sugar\u2019s requirement for \u2018a book from the Alice In Wonderland collection\u2019 with the specification \u2018pre-second World War\u2019 didn\u2019t actually have to be that old, or even old at all.\n\nAfter all a brand new edition cost them \u00a34.99p not \u00a3200.\n\nAnother item was \u2018a plate with 31 college crests.\u2019\n\nConfused: Marianne\u2019s approach to the practicalities of the challenge also indicated she hadn\u2019t done much research\n\n\u2018Is there anything wrong with just getting a regular plate and one college crest, then putting it on 31 times?\u2019 she said, thinking (very) laterally.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the name of the game when it comes to scavenger hunts \u2013 not doing the obvious. Not getting what it specifically says and finding a clever way of getting what you\u2019re required to.\u2019\n\nThis was all clearly nonsense. As Lottie Lion gently hinted it was not only better to get the things Lord Sugar required (thereby avoiding being fined) but actually easier - just buying the right plate for example.\n\nThe fact that Marianne still led Unison comfortably to victory said more about her opponents than her own team. (To be fair, Empower ticked off 8 of the 9 items \u2013 one more than Unison \u2013 and bought 5 of them for less).\n\nDisaster: Her belief that lateral thinking had anything to do with completing the list was in itself proof that Marianne was a master of it. (It was of course the exact opposite of lateral thinking)\n\nPamela\u2019s negotiation skills were particularly poor as we saw when she was rinsed by the woman she wanted to buy a mortar-board from.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m the only remaining party shop in Oxford so I happen to know that this hat you\u2019re desperately after is the only one for miles and miles and miles\u2026\u2019\n\nNeedless to say Pamela ended up paying the asking price.\n\n\u2018You had no strategy whatsoever!\u2019 Lord Sugar raged at the Project Manager (Jemelin) and Team Empower generally (Pamela, Lewis, Dean, Carina, Riyonn, and Ryan-Mark).\n\nTo be honest he could have fired any of them.\n\n\u2018Over the past five weeks Ryan-Mark hasn\u2019t done very much,\u2019 Claude Littner grumbled, ignoring last week\u2019s winning logo and his idea \u2018Team Fabulous.\u2019\n\nYou're fired: Lord Sugar kept the dream of seeing Ryan-Mark and Lottie Lion working together alive, at the expense of Riyonn\n\nLuckily (for us), Lord Sugar kept the dream of seeing Ryan-Mark and Lottie Lion working together alive, at the expense of Riyonn.\n\n\u2018I have been a key member in every single team!\u2019 he insisted to Lord Sugar, then doubling up by claiming: \u2018I have done the most in every single team!\u2019\n\nFrankly this seemed doubtful, if not actually a blatant lie.\n\nIn any case, having lost five tasks out of five so far, it was hardly something for Riyonn to boast about.\n\nIn fact it only confirmed why he should be fired.\n\nAll over: Having lost five tasks out of five so far, Riyonn confirmed why he should be fired\n\nGOOD WEEK\n\nIasha\n\n\u2013 avoided spoiling her record by being even quieter than usual\n\nLottie Lion\n\n\u2013 will never be losing Team Leader if the others never let her be Project Manager\n\nThe woman from Oxford\u2019s only party shop\n\n\u2013 not to be messed with\n\nBAD WEEK\n\nRyan-Mark\n\n\u2013 \u2018a weathercock\u2019 Lord Sugar said (I think)\n\nJemelin\n\n- \u2018no leadership skills whatsoever' did not bode well\n\nRiyonn\n\n- was practicing his bitchy boardroom criticisms of his team-mates throughout the task.
