REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to a deal pretty much subject to getting it written,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House after two days of high-level trade talks in Washington, with China\u2019s top negotiator Vice Premier Liu He sitting in the room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take probably three weeks, four weeks or five weeks,\u201d he said, noting that both governments would be in Chile together for an upcoming summit.\n\n\u201cMaybe it will be then or maybe it will be some time around that,\u201d Trump said. Both sides have an agreement on intellectual property, he said, and financial services.\n\nAn initial article on Xinhua\u2019s Chinese-language website, which based its reporting on guidance from China\u2019s trade delegation, didn\u2019t mention any specific agreement or that a deal is likely to be signed in coming weeks, however. This was the first official response from China after the conclusion of the talks.\n\n\u201cThe two parties had an honest, highly efficient, and constructive discussion in economic and trade issues, under the important guidance from the presidents of both countries,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have made substantial progress in agriculture, intellectual property rights protection, exchange rate, financial services, expansion of trade cooperation, technology transfer and dispute settlement.\u201d\n\nIt concluded that the two parties \u201chave made arrangement for following consultations, and agreed to make the efforts towards a final agreement.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent commentary published online on Saturday morning, Xinhua said that this round of talks had resulted in \u201crational, pragmatic progress\u201d and helped prevent escalation and expansion of the trade conflict. But it cautioned that there remained uncertainty about many issues.\n\nThe commentary noted that China-U.S. relations had become more complex and that \u201csome people want to politicize trade and economic issues. Finding a solution to trade and economic issues that is acceptable to both countries could be a long process.\u201d", "description": "U.S. officials on Friday promised a \"Phase 1\" deal with China on a host of conflicts from intellectual property to currency was imminent, but China's official state-owned news organization Xinhua struck a more cautious tone.", "authors": ["Echo Wang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439953471&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B06C", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
