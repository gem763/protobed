It looked like the Bulgarian players had given up, embarrassed by the whole night.\n\nEngland showed they could still play even when the racists were trying to drag them down with a result which humiliated their hosts. The England fans chanted: \u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net\u2026 Raheem Sterling.\u201d\n\nIt was their answer.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd more than that, the players showed real character to overcome the horrible circumstances even when Gareth Southgate, the referee and the officials looked ready to lead the players off with everyone looking confused as to what happens next.\n\nBut it really felt England\u2019s players were on a mission to show nothing would stop them.\n\nTyrone Mings was subjected to monkey chants which marred his full debut, Sterling was jeered and yet England were not distracted from the job in hand.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThe worries from England\u2019s demoralising defeat in Czech Republic on Friday night quickly disappeared when Rashford put them ahead after just seven minutes with a goal of the highest quality to end his 12 game bought for club and country.\n\nRoss Barkley made an important interception on the left edge of the penalty box, Rashford picked up the loose ball, beat Kiril Despodov and then turned Georgi Pashov inside out. Rashford then hit an unstoppable shot which left Bulgaria keeper Plamen Iliev clutching at thin air.\n\nMeanwhile, the disgraceful chanting was going on but England kept playing. The second goal came after 20 minutes when Sterling and Harry Kane swapped passes, Sterling broke into the box and his low cross was turned in at the back post by Barkley.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nEngland got a third after 32 minutes. Kane turned provider again as his cross was perfect for Barkley who drifted into the box with perfect timing before glancing home. Barkley has been a reliable midfielder for Southgate and he surely cannot drop him again.\n\nIn the fourth minute of stoppage time at the end of the first half, Kane\u2019s cross was turned home by Sterling after a nice flowing move.\n\nNo-one was really thinking about the football by now as the game was twice stopped but England always kept going.\n\nBulgaria seemed to get rid of the worst offenders from one section of the ground, captain Ivelin Popov spoke at length to home fans at half time and the teams re-emerged for the second half looking as if they had decided just to get this horrible night over and done with.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nSterling twice went close before eventually getting his second after 69 minutes. Kane put Sterling through, the Manchester City star slotted it past the keeper and that made it five.\n\nIt was a night to shame football but one in which England\u2019s players showed they will not let the racists win.\n\nEngland captain Kane showed his leadership qualities on a difficult night, he had unselfishly set up team mates but finally got his own reward with the sixth in the 86th minute as he swept home.\n\nA huge win on a dreadful night.", "description": "BULGARIA 0-6 ENGLAND: The Three Lions were excellent - but unfortunately no-one will remember their performance", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580820.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
