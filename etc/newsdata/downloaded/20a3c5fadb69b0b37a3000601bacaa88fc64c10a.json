And Why It Matters.", "language": "en", "text": "With ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group\u2019s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there\u2019s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph.\n\nBut the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad.\n\nAl-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri\u2019s speeches rarely come without some critique of the \u201cepidemic\u201d put forth by ISIS.\n\nOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.\n\nNeither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi\u2019s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201c Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. \u201d\n\n\u201cBased on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,\u201d one post read.\n\n\u201cHow thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?\u201d read another.\n\nSome wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation: \u201cMay Allah send him to Hell.\u201d\n\nMessages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.\n\nThe tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS\u2019 \u201cCaliph\u201d dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent.\n\nPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by \u201cAdel Amin,\u201d the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda\u2019s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters \u201creturn to the road of righteousness\u201d after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:\n\nThe situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider\u2026 Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.\n\nStatements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: \u201cNow [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!\u201d\n\n\u201c The ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. \u201d\n\nThese messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to \u201crepent\u201d and leave the group.\n\nYet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved.\n\nSince the summer of 2016, the group\u2019s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-\u2018Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi\u2019s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks.\n\nReinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\n\nFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been. These days, al-Qaeda Central\u2019s role is largely symbolic, limited to leadership messages and other content while steering the big-picture ethos of the organization. Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position.\n\nThese variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem. So, while some fighters might very well join the ranks of al-Qaeda affiliates in their region, we shouldn't expect to see any drastic migration from ISIS\u2019 ranks into its rival\u2019s.\n\nDespite any notions of good-riddance that al-Qaeda and its supporters attach to Baghdadi\u2019s death, and for whatever number of defectors it may win over as a result of Baghdadi\u2019s demise, ISIS is not going anywhere. The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars. Baghdadi was not the sole barrier keeping ISIS members from joining al-Qaeda, and his death is unlikely to diminish existing disputes.", "description": "The faithful followers of Osama bin Laden and his successor are not mourning the demise of the Islamic State's leader.
