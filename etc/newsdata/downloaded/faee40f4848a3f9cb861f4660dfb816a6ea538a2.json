The best of his early novels \u2014 \u201cThe Shining,\u201d \u201cThe Stand,\u201d \u201cCarrie\u201d \u2014 came out while I was in grade school, and I read them each six times in class tucked under my desk. I thought my enthusiasm made me a horror fan, but then I tried other horror writers and that wasn\u2019t it at all. I was a Stephen King fan. In terms of being able to tell a story, he was all by himself out in the HOV lane. He was hooting as he blew past.\n\nThe most realized of these novels, to my tender imagination, was \u201cThe Stand.\u201d On the surface, it\u2019s about a virus that wipes out most of the world\u2019s population, but at heart it\u2019s a road novel about the survivors. It taps into that half-corny, half-essential American turnpike mythos I\u2019d locate in Kerouac and Springsteen and Lucinda Williams and others, but with apocalyptic inclinations. Filled with fly-specked AM radio dials and exterminating angels, \u201cThe Stand\u201d is Americana by way of one of Goya\u2019s Black Paintings.\n\nI like to think of \u201cThe Stand\u201d that way, at any rate. I\u2019ve been afraid to dip back in again. It\u2019s magic I\u2019d hate to spoil. I\u2019ve been hesitant to get too close to any of King\u2019s steroidal novels in the intervening four decades. I\u2019ve mostly grown out of my interest. He\u2019s maniacally prolific. Where would one insert a straw into that fire hose outpouring?\n\nKing\u2019s new novel \u2014 it is roughly, depending on how you count, his 61st \u2014 is titled \u201cThe Institute.\u201d It\u2019s a big shank of a book that reminded me instantly of many of the reasons I loved (love?) him. His characters are the kind of people who hear the trains in the night. The music is always good. He swings low to the ground. He gets closer to the realities and attitudes of working-class life in America than any living writer I can think of. In \u201cThe Institute\u201d people worry about taking their Prilosec. They\u2019re happy to notice that the Denny\u2019s and the bowling alley are right next to each other.", "description": "In his latest, King tells the story of an institution where children with special powers are cultivated \u2014 but that\u2019s just where the nightmare begins.", "authors": ["Dwight Garner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/books/02bookking1/02bookking1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
