Snaking around the skyways above the city\u2019s streets, sporting hats and shirts and banners and signs saying they were cops and bikers and pilots and women for Trump, they had come to see their chosen champion. Hounded by the impeachment inquiry and increasingly battered by polls, Trump descended on Air Force One to flash for them his vivid and vitriolic refusal to succumb.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYES, I\u2019M A TRUMP GIRL,\u201d said the hat of Jodi Munson, 50, of Hastings, some 30 miles from the Target Center. \u201cGET OVER IT.\u201d Munson loved that Trump was not only in her state\u2014again\u2014but in this quite specific place.\n\n\u201cJust to shove it in their face,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe\u2019s in the belly of the beast.\u201d\n\nM. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cIf he can come here and make his statement, right here, in the devil\u2019s cauldron, that\u2019s saying something\u2014that\u2019s putting a big exclamation mark on what he does and who he is,\u201d added a retired union worker from Champlin named Kelvin who wouldn\u2019t give his last name \u201cbecause we have to hide in the weeds.\u201d\n\nSimply by showing up, Trump reiterated his well-known taste for a fight. But will it get him through the quickly mounting impeachment peril back in Washington? And can this belligerence alone, running the gamut from biting to blithe, deliver a state that he vows is within reach next year?\n\nOver the course of a fiery hour and 45 minutes Thursday inside the almost full 19,356-seat Target Center, in his first campaign rally since the start of the House inquiry, the president unleashed especially acid attacks on Democrats and Washington and the news media while trashing the leaders of the biggest city in this state he so clearly covets.\n\nHe pilloried \u201cthe insane impeachment witch hunt\u201d and \u201ccrooked Adam Schiff\u201d and \u201cdo-nothing Democrat con artists.\u201d He castigated potential 2020 opponent \u201cnever considered smart\u201d \u201cSleepy Joe Biden\u201d as well as Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, whom he called \u201ca loser.\u201d And he called the top pol here, Jacob Frey, with whom he feuded this week, a \u201cbad mayor,\u201d and the local member of Congress, Ilhan Omar, \u201can America-hating socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the biggest reasons I\u2019m going to win, and the Republican Party is going to win, Minnesota,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have turnout the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m energized!\u201d he said.\n\nM. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies are central to his political persona, and it\u2019s sometimes hard not to see them as one long string of more or less the same event because of the recurrent themes and chants, the anthemic, chest-rattling loop, the high-voltage hum and the egged-on air, the telltale mixture of play-it-again predictability shot through with head-on-a-swivel uncertainty. But this was something new\u2014a different strain of provocation. At this fraught juncture, this president not only upped the ante of the fight\u2014he took it straight to enemy territory, smack in the Trump-hating heart of one of the most left-leaning districts in the country.\n\nFor this president, who always has favored above all else the hunt, the getting more than the having, Minnesota remains uniquely tantalizing. The last time a Republican running for president won the state was Richard Nixon in 1972, and Trump in 2016 lost by just 1.52 percentage points, or 44,765 votes. This week, Team Trump flooded this bustling metro region with a concerted and well-funded initiative: Lara Trump and second lady Karen Pence anchored a Women for Trump event Wednesday in St. Paul, Vice President Mike Pence toured a sign manufacturer earlier Thursday in suburban Lakeville, and Trump\u2019s rally was his third in the state since his election. Those other two events, though, were in Rochester and Duluth\u2014whereas Thursday\u2019s location made for a spotlit, cosmopolitan stage from which he could pry open the state\u2019s marked divide between more rural, more conservative and predominantly white \u201cGreater Minnesota\u201d and more progressive, more diverse Minneapolis and St. Paul.\n\n\u201cIt shows a lack of timidity,\u201d former congressman and current United States Senate candidate Jason Lewis told me, \u201cthe temerity to go into quote-unquote the devil\u2019s den.\u201d\n\nM. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cIt gives me hope,\u201d Danielle Stella, who\u2019s bidding to have the chance to unseat Omar, said when I met her in the line in the skyways. \u201cPresident Trump isn\u2019t saying, \u2018This is such a liberal district I don\u2019t have a chance.\u2019 He\u2019s coming here to fight.\u201d\n\nInside the arena of the NBA\u2019s Minnesota Timberwolves, the incendiary, seemingly indefatigable Trump consistently delighted his red-capped crowd with his rough treatment of Omar and Somalian refugees writ large while bearing down on the Bidens. \u201cHe was only a good vice president,\u201d he charged, \u201cbecause he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d The profane burst elicited electric, gleeful, grinning cheers, some of the loudest and longest of the night.\n\n\u201cFour more years! Four more years!\u201d they chanted.\n\n\n\n***\n\nCould Trump actually win Minnesota?\n\nAssuming he holds onto everybody he had in 2016\u2014a big if\u2014Trump still would need to net another not quite 45,000 people. He could try to depress Democratic turnout in the bluer, more urban areas all but mobilized against him (unlikely), or he could try to grow his already stout share around the rest of the state (there are, after all, roughly a quarter of a million unregistered white men, Ken Martin, the chair of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, told me), or he perhaps could peel off some new supporters in slivers of swing-district suburbs and exurbs. This, of course, is a question that won\u2019t have an answer until next November, but it\u2019s on the tips of the tongues of politicos here spanning the spectrum.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in many, many years that a Republican presidential candidate is planning to seriously contest the state,\u201d Jeff Blodgett, a longtime strategist who was the state director for both of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal that Democrats have to take seriously.\u201d\n\nThey are. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is probably the most robust and deepest level of investment I\u2019ve ever seen this early on by a Republican presidential candidate,\u201d the DFL\u2019s Martin said. \u201cThey already have 20 people on the ground. They have four offices around the state. Their digital spend is about 4 to 1 what the Democrats are doing.\u201d\n\nCould Trump win here? \u201cOf course he could,\u201d Martin said.\n\n\u201cI am not ruling it out,\u201d added Gregg Peppin, a veteran Republican strategist who helped Marco Rubio win the Minnesota caucuses in 2016 before being admittedly surprised at Trump\u2019s subsequent success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s plausible,\u201d Peppin said, \u201cthat he can pick up support in the suburbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe outer-ring suburbs are kind of back and forth,\u201d Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s varied, and I certainly don\u2019t want to suggest it\u2019s a slam dunk for Donald Trump\u2014I think he\u2019s got trouble with better educated voters, with women and so forth, but there is a pocket in some of those areas where people nod and say, \u2018Yeah.\u2019\u201d\n\nTake Dakota County. South of the Cities, it stretches from the edge of the urban core out into green-gold cornfields split by flat rural roads dotted by anti-abortion billboards. And more or less in the middle, some 25 miles down Interstate 35, sits Lakeville. Population 64,334, it\u2019s been growing this decade by about a thousand people a year, according to the mayor. Earlier this week, I drove around under a bright blue sky with wisps of white clouds, taking in a tableau of strip malls and chain stores, square lawns and clean concrete, cookie-cutter stick-built homes staple-gunned to what used to be farms.\n\nThe relative banality of the scenery belies its political volatility. At the Capitol in St. Paul, Lakeville has a blend of Democrats and Republicans, from state Senator Matt Little, who\u2019s the former, and state Representative Jon Koznick, who\u2019s the latter. On Capitol Hill, it was represented in Minnesota\u2019s 2nd Congressional District by Jason Lewis \u2026 until last year when Democrat Angie Craig flipped the seat. In the presidential election in 2016, across Lakeville\u2019s 17 precincts, Trump won 51 percent of the votes\u2014neatly emblematic of this past cycle\u2019s leftward shift in areas like this around the state and around the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a swing district, and certainly Dakota County is a swing part of that swing district,\u201d Craig said when we talked this week. \u201cAnd Lakeville is kind of arguably a little bit of ground zero,\u201d Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of the state Republican Party, told me. \u201cMy district looks like America,\u201d Craig continued. \u201cIt\u2019s got working union families, it\u2019s got family farmers, it\u2019s got the suburbs and the exurbs, and so it\u2019s just a non-gerrymandered district\u2014and to represent it well, you\u2019ve got to listen to everybody.\u201d\n\nM. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nOn Holyoke Avenue, Lakeville\u2019s main drag, I listened the other day to people who didn\u2019t vote for Trump and won\u2019t in 2020, either (\u201cWe\u2019re not Trump supporters,\u201d said Jason Baker, owner of World of Games), and people who did vote for him in 2016 and definitely will again (\u201cI feel like most people are for him here,\u201d said Joe Drummer, a supervisor at Ace Hardware), and people who voted for him in 2016 and \u201cprobably\u201d will again (\u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t thought much about it,\u201d said Jen Orth, a co-owner of Hypointe Childcare). I also met people who voted for him in 2016 and now aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWe voted for him,\u201d said local honey merchant Arlene Hill, referring to her beekeeper husband, too. \u201cWe would just like the man to stop tweeting and saying stupid things. But I think he\u2019s trying to do a lot of great things.\u201d Her vote next year? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she granted. \u201cI want to see all the candidates.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans are activated anew. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back a lot more to the right than I think anybody will expect,\u201d local Republican state senator Dan Hall told me. Conservative city councilwoman Michelle Volk concurred. \u201cI can tell you that I\u2019m watching people be more fired up than they were the last time in 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to liken this to what I saw happen the first time Scott Walker won Wisconsin and then they had their recall vote. And I went over to Wisconsin \u2026 to make phone calls on his behalf.\u201d\n\nWhat, though, about those much-sought-after people who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but will vote for him in 2020?\n\nI was sitting at the bar at Lakeville Brewing Company listening to patrons talk about their shotguns while eating surprisingly good Korean brisket tacos when I got a text from Koznick. The local state rep had sent me a picture of the 2016 ballot of a \u201cfriend.\u201d The friend had written in Condoleezza Rice and Paul Ryan.\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d I responded. \u201cIs your friend going to vote for the president next November?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Koznick answered.\n\nTexting with his friend, a Republican who lives in Lakeville, while he was texting with me, Koznick explained that this man three years ago \u201cjust wasn\u2019t sold on Trump\u201d but now is, primarily due to Supreme Court judges and \u201cthe over reaction by democrats.\u201d\n\nI asked if I could talk to him.\n\nNo, Koznick said\u2014because his friend is a State Senate staffer. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t look good for him and for people to figure out that he didn\u2019t vote for Trump.\u201d\n\nKoznick, however, did know somebody else who fit the bill\u2014who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but will in 2020. \u201cJane is her name,\u201d he told me by text.\n\n\u201cI did not vote for him in 2016,\u201d confirmed Jane, a woman from Lakeville in her 50s who spoke to me on the phone on condition I would not use her last name. Unaffiliated with either party, she voted for Hillary Clinton, she said, after not liking either candidate but going the way she did because she decided to just vote for the woman.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I asked her about Trump, \u201cwhat was the hang-up for you three years ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think one of the hang-ups,\u201d she said, \u201cwas that there was just an off comment he made on one of his shows \u2026 I can\u2019t remember if it was \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 \u2026 I can\u2019t remember \u2026 but he made the comment about\u2014and I can\u2019t remember who it was\u2014but it was a vet who actually was a prisoner of war, and he made the comment, something about I don\u2019t like him or something \u2026 I can\u2019t\u2014it was so long ago\u2014but something about where he got himself caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptured?\u201d I prompted.\n\n\u201cIt was somebody, a higher-up, and I don\u2019t know \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re talking about John McCain,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she responded. \u201cMaybe that was it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that turned you off \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo where you didn\u2019t want to vote for him \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so tell me a little bit more about what he\u2019s done since his election in 2016,\u201d I said, shifting the conversation back toward Trump, \u201cthat has changed your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur economy is doing better. Unemployment is down. I really like what he\u2019s doing with autism. I really like the border control. I am one\u2014I feel for these people who are trying to get here, but it\u2019s still illegal, and you still got to follow the process. What I like about him is he is actually enforcing the laws that we have.\u201d\n\nI asked if anything could change her mind again.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s going to change my mind,\u201d she said.\n\nThis, she said, is also because of the impeachment inquiry and what she perceives as Democrats\u2019 consistently shabby treatment of Trump.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him, but he\u2019s the president, so I\u2019m going to respect him,\u201d Jane told me. \u201cThey say, \u2018Oh, he didn\u2019t win the popular vote.\u2019 I don\u2019t care what vote he won. He won. He\u2019s in there. Show him respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just hate him so badly,\u201d she said. And it\u2019s made her like him that much more.\n\nThroughout Minnesota, are there 44,766 Janes?\n\n\n\n***\n\nOn Thursday, up in the skyways, some seven hours before the scheduled start of the rally, a man wearing a homemade Trump shirt that said \u201cFUCK YOUR FEELINGS\u201d on the back had to go to the bathroom. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said to a security guard, \u201cis there a restroom around here?\u201d\n\nM. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nWhen he returned, I introduced myself.\n\nHe had made the shirt the night before, said Trevin Miller, 29, from nearby Bloomington. \u201cDeliveries were a little backed up on Amazon,\u201d he explained.\n\nMiller was for Trump from the start. Some of his friends, though, were not. That, he told me, is changing. An accountant, an insurance salesman, landscapers\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re seeing the facts, the numbers on unemployment.\u201d And he has other friends, he said, who just didn\u2019t vote at all. They didn\u2019t think it mattered. Now, he said, given how close Trump came last time, they see that it does, and this time they\u2019ll head to the polls. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard from a few people,\u201d Miller said. \u201c\u2018OK, I\u2019m voting.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the very front of the long line, seated in a camping chair, having arrived at this spot 2\u00bd days before, was Dan Nelson, 36, from suburban Spring Lake Park. He was wearing on a hat he had made. \u201cGOD WINS,\u201d it said on the front. \u201cQ,\u201d it said on the side, a reference to the vast, online, pro-Trump, anti-\u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theory. Nelson, too, loved Trump from the get-go, but he had a friend, he said, who was \u201chardcore\u201d against Trump. Now? \u201cHe says, \u2018You know what? Everybody\u2019s got jobs.\u2019\u201d Something else he thinks is leading some who were reluctant to vote for Trump in 2016 change their tune: \u201cHe didn\u2019t destroy the place,\u201d Nelson said, meaning the country, \u201clike people were saying he was going to do.\u201d\n\nDown toward the other end of the queue, standing next to a window charging her phone, I met Munson, the woman from Hastings, the woman with the \u201cGET OVER IT\u201d hat and a \u201cQ\u201d on her shirt who was excited that Trump was on his way to \u201cthe belly of the beast.\u201d Munson told me she has \u201cprobably 20\u201d friends who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but will now. \u201cThey can just literally look around and see that things are better and people are happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just see all the negativity in the news, and they can see through that. They\u2019re saying, \u2018That doesn\u2019t look like my life.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThose votes are out there,\u201d Michele Even, 54, of Prior Lake near Lakeville, who started just this past June a 2,000-member grassroots group called MAGASOTA.\n\nM. Scott Mahaskey for Politico Magazine\n\nI walked through the skyways feeding toward the Target Center. I saw all those hats and shirts, and visors and vests, and koozies and scarves, and banners and flags, saying \u201cNO MORE BULLSHIT\u201d and \u201cPROUD TO BE A DEPLORABLE\u201d and \u201cDEPORT ILHAN OMAR.\u201d I saw Trump running shoes. I saw a sweatshirt that was nothing but prints of Trump\u2019s face. I saw InfoWars shirts. I saw lots of the letter Q. \u201cBreitbart is an excellent news source,\u201d I heard somebody say. A man called me \u201cfake news.\u201d A woman called me \u201cnefarious.\u201d\n\nAnd then the people here all but filled the arena, practically packing it to the ceiling to see Trump.\n\n\u201cPhony polls,\u201d he told them.\n\n\u201cCrooked writers,\u201d he told them.\n\n\u201cThese people are sick,\u201d he told them.\n\n\u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d they chanted.\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Trump said, \u201cin a struggle for the survival of democracy in America.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: 2020", "description": "Pummeled by the polls and hounded by an impeachment inquiry, Trump has chosen to fight in enemy territory.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Michael Grunwald"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d8/b6/d884990945fbb8ff16d9c4f28a87/lede.20191010msmTrump-Rally-Minnesota215_DxO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
