September's 9.4% decline for starts came with a margin of error of 9.4 percentage points.\n\nStarts were up 1.6% from September last year and building permits were up 7.7% from the same month in 2018.\n\nDespite historically low mortgage rates and rising wages, the housing sector has been strained by low inventory of affordable homes propelled by rising construction costs and lack of land.\n\nBorrowing costs ticked up in September to just above 3.7% but have since receded. Average rates for 30-year mortgages fell to 3.57% last week, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nAt the same time, the National Association of Home Builders reported this week that builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes climbed in October to its highest level since February 2018.\n\nThe Commerce report can be found at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
