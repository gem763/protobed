REUTERS/Damir Sagolj\n\nIn a questionnaire sent in August, the European Commission said it had information Apple may have restricted online payments for the purchase of goods and services made via merchant apps or websites, in breach of EU antitrust rules.\n\nLaunched in October 2014, Apple\u2019s mobile payment service Apple Pay is part of the company\u2019s diversification from device sales. It is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including in more than 20 EU countries.\n\nThe questionnaire asked if companies were under a contractual obligation to enable a certain payment method and also if such contracts included conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps and websites.\n\nRegulators wanted to know if Apple has rejected merchant apps as incompatible with the terms and conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps.\n\nThe Commission confirmed that it had sought information from market participants.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is actively monitoring the development of mobile payment solutions, the behaviour by operators active in the payments sector, including mobile payments,\u201d the EU competition enforcer said.\n\nApple said its payment system offers the safest and most secure solution in the market as evidenced by the thousands of banks using it.\n\n\u201cIPhone has completely transformed mobile payments by providing customers with a choice of how to pay including cash, credit card and debit card, as well using apps from the major banks and financial institutions,\u201d it said.\n\nCritics have long complained about an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone which means Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods.\n\nRecent alerts on iPhones asking users if they want to set up Apple Pay on their devices have also triggered protests from some.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters last year, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said she might investigate Apple Pay if there are formal complaints.\n\nApple is already the target of a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) which says the U.S. company unfairly limits rivals to its own streaming service.
