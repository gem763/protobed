(Source: Court documents) More\n\nThe statement emerged among court documents unsealed in August. The court documents are part of the CFPB\u2019s lawsuit against Navient that was announced in 2017.\n\n\"For years, Navient failed consumers who counted on the company to help give them a fair chance to pay back their student loans,\" then-CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. \"At every stage of repayment, Navient chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs. Too many borrowers paid more for their loans because Navient illegally cheated them and today's action seeks to hold them accountable.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Navient deceived borrowers by \u201csteering\u201d them toward forbearance to boost the company\u2019s bottom line. The memo stated that roughly 70% of student loan borrowers would choose forbearance, which involves a borrower being allowed to temporarily reduce the amount or stop the loan repayments while their loans accruing interest over time.\n\n\u201cThe evidence unsealed\u2026 confirms that Navient's practices that added billions of dollars of debt to struggling borrowers emanated from the top echelon of the company,\u201d Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Seth Frotman told Yahoo Finance in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis follows a decade-long pattern of Navient ripping off servicemembers, disabled veterans, teachers, and American taxpayers,\u201d Frotman added. \u201cThe time has come for policymakers to admit this company's practices are predatory and corrupt\u2014 it should not be given a single additional taxpayer dollar.\u201d\n\nStudents attend the commencement ceremony on May 27, 2018 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.

Hence, borrowers can pay an amount based on their current income and household size, and the plan allows for fluctuations based on the hardship they\u2019re experiencing. Payments can be as low as $0.\n\n\u201cThe high use of forbearance is also associated with increased rates of borrower default,\u201d the CFPB added in its lawsuit. Student loan defaults have \u201cgrown stunningly\u201d over recent years, according to recent data.\n\nNew York Fed researchers noted in August that \u201cin the second quarter of this year, the outstanding severely derogatory balance is comprised of 35 percent defaulted student loans, which have grown stunningly since 2012.\u201d\n\nSeverely derogatory, the New York Fed explained, refers to \u201cany stage of delinquency paired with a repossession, foreclosure, or \u2018charge of\u2019\u201d (meaning that the lender has removed the debt from its books).\u201d", "description": "An ongoing lawsuit alleges student loan servicer Navient systematically encouraged student loan borrowers into forbearance \u2014 adding billions of dollars in interest on top of existing loans in the process.", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Finance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ir07riQJ1neZ2GSB6K2WHQ--~B/aD0xNjQ0O3c9MjU0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e5a0f280-f359-11e9-9bdf-57dddf496138", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
