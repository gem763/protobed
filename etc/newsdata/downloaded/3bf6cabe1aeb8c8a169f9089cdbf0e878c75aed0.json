However, the FDA said the chemical \u201cis a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products, and vegetables.\u201d\n\nFor now, the agency is not calling for the public to toss out heartburn pills, but noted individuals taking ranitidine could consider other approved drugs on the market.\n\nProton pump inhibitors like Prevacid, Prilosec and Nexium, which are a different type of heartburn drug, are not included in the FDA\u2019s notice.\n\nThe agency said it is \u201cevaluating whether the low levels of NDMA in ranitidine pose a risk to patients,\u201d and will share that information once it is available.\n\nNDMA has also been linked to dozens of recalls of prescription blood pressure medications within the past year, including valsartan, which is widely used to treat hypertension. Health officials decided on the recalls upon finding that the NDMA levels in the drugs, which were made in China, were dangerously high.\n\nThe FDA is continuing to investigate the matter.", "description": "The chemical was detected in certain ranitidine medicines like Zantac, which are commonly used to treat ulcers and indigestion.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7d23283b0000039fd3488e.jpeg?cache=aq9f6fs2jn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
