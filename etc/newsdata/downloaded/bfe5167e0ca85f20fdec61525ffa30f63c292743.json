While Kurdish autonomy was suggested in the first post-war treaty, those terms were renegotiated after the Turkish war of independence and set the borders of modern Turkey and left the Kurds without a self-ruled region. Colonial mapmaking divided the Kurdish regions between the Turkish-, British- and French-mandated states of Iraq, Syria and Iran. The Kurds ended up being persecuted minorities in each of these countries.\n\nIn the eyes of the Turkish state, the Kurds didn\u2019t exist. Our names were replaced with Turkish names, our language banned, our music criminalized and our existence denied. Kurds were forcefully assimilated into being Turkish. Large Kurdish populations in Turkey fled to neighboring Syria during violent Turkification campaigns in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nIn Syria, Kurds were forced into a precarious existence. Ideologically driven by pan-Arabism, policies in post-independence Syria denied citizenship to Kurds in the northeast, rendering the entire community stateless. Stamped out between Turkification and Arabization, statelessness for the Kurds means much more than the simple lack of a Kurdish nation-state. It means the lack of basic protection from any of the states they naturally inhabit.\n\nWhen my father was born, his mother tongue was a crime. Until 1991 the Kurdish language was officially forbidden in Turkey, which made speaking, writing or listening to Kurdish illegal. In my father\u2019s Yazidi -Kurdish village in Turkey, every day students at his school would have to read an oath that ended with the line, \u201cMy existence shall be dedicated to the Turkish existence.\u201d The oath was recited in schools until 2013.\n\nMy parents were university students in Ankara, when in another part of Kurdish geography another state attacked the Kurdish right to exist. Saddam Hussein launched a genocidal campaign against Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988. Tens of thousands ran to the Turkish border to escape annihilation.\n\nMy parents traveled to Diyarbakir in Turkey\u2019s southeast and helped build shelters for those seeking refuge after the chemical attack in Halabja, which killed 5,000 civilians instantly. My mother would tell me that her friends in college were arrested for reading a statement condemning massacres committed by the Iraqi dictator. Those who publicly expressed solidarity with Mr. Hussein\u2019s victims were persecuted in Turkey for promoting Kurdish separatism.", "description": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s war is an ethnonationalist attack on Kurds and their aspirations.", "authors": ["Rosa Burc"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21burc/21burc-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
