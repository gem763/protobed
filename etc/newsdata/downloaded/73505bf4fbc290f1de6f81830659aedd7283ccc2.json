The slanted tip is ideal for lifting hair from the skin before you pull out the strand, which Fisher says is \u201cextremely important for precision\u201d and lets you get closer to the base, which means the hair will be less likely to break when you pull. Malynda Vigliotto a.k.a. \u201cBoom Boom,\u201d owner of Boom Boom Brow Bar says that her studio uses Tweezerman\u2019s Slant Tweezer, as well, and says, \u201cA sharp slanted tweezer will grab the hair out easily so it doesn\u2019t break off and become an ingrown hair.\u201d She also notes that the tweezers will \u201clast a lifetime\u201d because you can mail them back to the company to be sharpened. Rebecca Hoffman, owner of Bespoke Brows NYC, praised the tweezers, too, in part because of the sharpening policy and also because the slanted edge makes it less likely that you\u2019ll pinch yourself while tweezing. \u201cYou can also angle it to just use the pointy edge of the tool for really stubborn hairs,\u201d she says.", "description": "We talked to six aestheticians about the best tweezers for plucking eyebrows, ingrown hairs, and facial hair, and heard about slanted and pointed tweezers from brands including Tweezerman, LaVaque, and Anastasia Beverly Hills.", "authors": ["Maxine Builder", "Hilary Reid"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2018/05/21/tweezers/21-tweezers-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
