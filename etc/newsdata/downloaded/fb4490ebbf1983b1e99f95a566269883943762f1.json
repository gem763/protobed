Without a few errant tweets by Popeyes\u2019 competitors, future American generations might not grow up hearing about the Great Chicken Wars of 2019. But despite the social-media-kindled fire and deep-fried fury, the sandwich that launched 1,000 memes was the result of years of calculated strategy and a creative process that sounds more collegiate than corporate.\n\nThe story begins in the late aughts when the company changed its official branding from Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. This shift in identity not only aimed to attract a wider audience by emphasizing a localized, more wholesome-sounding operation, but also to expand the company\u2019s culinary depth of field beyond its signature offerings. Chicken and biscuits are obviously delicious, but by drawing on its Cajun and Creole roots, Popeyes gave itself a way to stand out from countless other chicken chains. (Both Domino\u2019s and Dunkin\u2019 would later follow this tack, dropping \u201cPizza\u201d and \u201cDonuts\u201d from their names, respectively.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much more we can do with the food and the menu,\u201d Amy Alarc\u00f2n, the company\u2019s vice president of culinary innovation, explained in a phone call in 2017. \u201cCajun gravy, tons of seafood promotions [like] spicy garlic and hushpuppy shrimp, Zatarain\u2019s shrimp. Those types of things do tremendously well and it\u2019s part of being on the Gulf Coast and coming from a culture that\u2019s heavily dominated by seafood, crawfish boils, shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e, the list goes on.\u201d\n\nIn the world of fast food, it\u2019s not easy to innovate in a way that can scale to thousands of locations consistently in order to scale to thousands of locations consistently. Concepts generally cannot cost too much, require new equipment, stray too far from a core set of ingredients or be too complicated to explain to consumers in 30-second ads between spots for home insurance and Chevy Silverados.\n\nTo invent within these tricky parameters, Popeyes created a product-invention process more personalized and elaborate than one might expect from a chain with 3,000 outposts around the world. A few times a year, the company invites about two dozen delegates from different corners of the company \u2014 from marketing to operations as well as its ecosystem of franchisees, suppliers and ad agencies \u2014 and sends them to a given U.S. city with a bustling food scene. In places like Portland, Ore., Charleston, S.C., and Seattle, the team seeks out inspiration by learning about local culinary history and, of course, by eating everything on offer from roadside stands and dives to fine-dining spots and Michelin-starred haunts. \u201cWe always joke, bring your big-boy pants,\u201d said Alarc\u00f2n. \u201cBring the elastic waistband.\u201d\n\nFollowing this 72-hour, high-calorie rumspringa, the team spends the next few days brainstorming hundreds of potential Popeyes concepts by talking about evolving trends as well as their personal lives. Once the list is compiled, the group then undertakes the tedious work of stress-testing all the possibilities against their logistical realities, such as figuring out how the item would be produced, whether it would successfully scale on a global level and how it might be marketed. Finally, the company spends months developing and testing the chosen product internally before it arrives in stores.\n\nIn 2016, long before the new Popeyes Chicken Sandwich was a sketch on a drawing board, I joined one of their ideation sessions in New Orleans, the spiritual roost of the company, which is now headquartered in Miami. After a flurry of ghost tours, live jazz, remoulades, spiced pig ears and muffulettas, the group assembled at Mardi Gras World \u2014 the famous carnival-float emporium \u2014 to digest everything they consumed in the city\u2019s oldest and newest institutions. But this was more than just a field trip. Each delegate was also tasked with sharing insights about food in terms of their lives and families. \u201cI can pretty much guarantee that whatever your obsession is, it\u2019s going to filter out into the larger audience because that\u2019s our responsibility,\u201d Alarc\u00f2n told the team before describing her obsession du jour: the comfort food of her childhood like fondue and casseroles.", "description": "In 2016, Adam Chandler, author of Drive-Thru Dreams, observed Popeyes' process for brainstorming new products.
