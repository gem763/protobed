(May 30) AP\n\nBUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Experts have concluded that the captain of a sightseeing boat that collided on the Danube River with a much larger cruise ship was not responsible for the deadly crash that killed 28 people, including himself, Hungarian police said Tuesday.\n\nThe small Hableany (Mermaid) tour boat collided with the Viking Sigyn river cruise ship on May 29 near the Hungarian Parliament in Budapest. All but two of those killed were South Korean tourists aboard the Mermaid. Seven South Koreans on the boat survived but the remains of one missing female South Korean tourist have not been recovered.\n\nCol. Adrian Pal of the Budapest Police reported the results of the recently-concluded investigation, which contained 11,000 pages of documentation and over 4,200 photos. Authorities have not released the name of the deceased captain of the Mermaid.\n\nBudapest Police Chief Colonel Adrian Pal reviews investigators' conclusions at a press conference on Oct. 15.

There are clear sound recordings of this.\u201d\n\nYuriy C. is the only suspect so far in the case and is under pre-trial arrest until Nov. 30 at the latest. He is suspected of endangering water transport resulting in a fatal mass catastrophe and of failing to offer aid at the time of the crash.\n\nPal said the Viking Sigyn\u2019s captain claimed several times in his testimony that he \u201csimply did not notice\u201d the Mermaid before the collision after sunset near the base of the city\u2019s famous Margit Bridge.\n\nRescue workers search for survivors near the base of Budapest's Margit Bridge in the hours after the crash on May 29.

It was not clear why the sound was off.\n\n\u201cThe explanation could be that traffic on the Danube is so heavy that (the radar\u2019s alarm) would be beeping constantly,\u201d said Pal, saying it could have been hard to filter out the truly unsafe condition from other false alarms.\n\nPolice are also conducting a separate investigation into the possible responsibility of the captain and the crew of the Viking Idun, a sister ship of the Sigyn, which it was following not far behind when the collision occurred. Pal said police were trying to determine whether those on the Idun also failed to offer aid to victims of the collision.\n\nThe Mermaid was raised out of the Danube by a huge floating crane on June 11. Some of the victims\u2019 bodies were recovered weeks after the crash more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) downstream.\n\nProsecutors are reviewing the investigation to decide how to proceed with the case.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/15/danube-tour-boat-crash-sightseeing-boat-captain-cleared/3986280002/", "description": "The captain of a tour boat that collided with a cruise ship did not cause the crash that killed 28, including himself, Hungarian police said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published P.M.
