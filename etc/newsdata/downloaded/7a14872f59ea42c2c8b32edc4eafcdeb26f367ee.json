Raylaine Knope, 43, was sentenced to 28 years in prison and her daughter, Bridget Lambert, 22, was sentenced to 48 months. The duo used horrific verbal, physical, and psychological abuse to enslave the woman between Aug. 13, 2015, and June 30, 2016.\n\n\"Knope and Lambert conspired to brutally coerce a vulnerable victim with disabilities to work long hours in despicable conditions and with no monetary compensation,\" Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice continues to combat human trafficking by forced labor and today\u2019s sentencing reflects the Division\u2019s commitment to seeking justice for the most vulnerable victims in our society.\"\n\nUnder President Trump, the DOJ has made the crackdown on human trafficking one of its top priorities. For example, In June, a DOJ initiative called, \u201cOperation Broken Heart\" resulted in 1,7000 arrests nation wide for abuse of children.\n\nAccording to the DOJ, \"Knope pleaded guilty to one count of a forced labor conspiracy, one count of a substantive forced labor violation, and one count of misprision of a felony.\" Her daughter \"pleaded guilty to one count of a forced labor conspiracy.\"\n\nDuring Knope's hearing, the mother \"admitted that she forced D.P. to live in a locked backyard cage and to perform housework and yard work in exchange for food and water.\" She also said that she and Lambert \"subjected D.P. to routine physical abuse, threats, and verbal and psychological abuse designed to ensure D.P.\u2019s continued compliance with the family\u2019s orders.\" Most shockingly, Knope admitted that \"that she once forced D.P. to eat D.P.\u2019s deceased mother\u2019s cremated ashes.\"\n\nLambert admitted during her testimony that she subjugated D.P. to horrendous abuse such as striking her \"in the head with a wooden board, causing D.P. to bleed from her head, and on another occasion advanced the conspiracy by holding D.P.\u2019s arm in place so that a fellow conspirator could punish D.P. by burning her with a cigarette lighter.\"\n\n\"The defendants\u2019 actions in this matter were nothing short of cruel and inhumane. Both Raylaine Knope and Bridget Lambert mistreated and psychologically abused another human being, a family member, and someone who should have been considered a loved one,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Bryan A. Vorndran of the FBI New Orleans Field Office.\n\n\"As the primary federal agency responsible for investigating allegations regarding violations of federal civil rights statutes, the FBI will continue to protect the civil rights of all persons\u2014citizens and non-citizens alike.\" Vorndran added. \"I applaud the tremendous efforts put forth by the men and women of the FBI New Orleans Field Office, the Tangipahoa Sheriff\u2019s Office, Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office \u2013 Eastern District of Louisiana, and Tangipahoa District Attorney\u2019s Office to bring these defendants to justice.\"\n\nThis isn't the first case this year the DOJ has prosecuted featuring this sort of wickedness. In July, a Maryland woman plead guilty to enslaving an illegal alien as part of a human trafficking scheme.", "description": "The abuse included locking the woman outside in a cage, hitting her with a wooden board, and burning her with cigarettes. .10/17/2019 21:03:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/30885fd7-ab5f-473b-9db9-a1c0b3ab3706.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
