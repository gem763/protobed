After 46 years, Brennaman is retiring - and no, he won\u2019t be coming back to the microphone again. A series against the playoff-contending Brewers will provide a truly final out.\n\n\u201cThursday will be the hardest day of my life, I think,\u201d Brennaman said, referring to the series finale. \u201cI think that will be a tough one.\u201d\n\nThe Reds\u2018 voice since 1974, Brennaman originally intended to quietly retire and fade into private life after last season. He relented and agreed to a farewell season that would allow fans and teams to show their appreciation and celebrate a career with so many calls: Hank Aaron\u2019s 714th homer that tied Babe Ruth, three World Series titles and Pete Rose\u2019s record-setting hit No. 4,192 among the most memorable.\n\nAlong the way, he also took on baseball commissioners, Chicago Cubs fans and even Reds players who simply weren\u2019t getting the job done, employing a tell-it-like-it-is style that is slipping away along with the many voices that have been part of the game for a long time. Pittsburgh\u2019s Steve Blass is retiring after the Reds\u2018 game against the Pirates at PNC Park on Sunday, ending his 34-year broadcasting career.\n\nBrennaman is proud that he\u2019s one of eight broadcasters who have spent at least 45 years with only one big league team, something \u201cthat means more than anything in the world.\u201d He\u2019s been touched by the many tributes and the countless bins full of fans\u2019 mail thanking him for his years of coming into their homes through transistor radios and car speakers.\n\nHe\u2019s also been touched by the tributes from around the league. The Cubs gave him a metal panel from the Wrigley Field scoreboard with 46 - his number of seasons - during a visit last week, doing it low-key because some fans there still smart from his critical comments.\n\n\u201cThere were certain parks where it was very emotional for me to leave, and there were other places - and I\u2019m not going to name where they were - but I was thrilled to death to get the hell out of there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by that part of it.\u201d\n\nBrennaman hadn\u2019t yet thought about what he\u2019ll say for his sign-off after Thursday\u2019s game. He\u2019ll speak in generalities because he doesn\u2019t want to overlook anyone.\n\nHe\u2019s reminded of his last broadcast with longtime partner Joe Nuxhall in 2004.\n\n\u201cWe got to the last game and we got to the last out and we went to the postgame show and at that point he said, \u2018I guess we have to talk about it, don\u2019t we little buddy\u2019 - that\u2019s what he called me,\u201d Brennaman said. \u201cI said I guess we do. And I couldn\u2019t get through it, I simply couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen he says goodbye to fans on Thursday, Brennaman will be done with baseball broadcasting. He\u2019s open to doing something else - Brennaman has called NCAA Tournament games - but he won\u2019t be at a microphone behind home plate again.\n\n\u201cI made it perfectly clear when I do the Thursday game, that\u2019s going to be it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not coming back to do any other games.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, when the Reds open their final road trip of the season in Pittsburgh, Brennaman will be playing golf and attending a high school football game in Cincinnati, easing into the next phase of his life.\n\n\u201cI jokingly said that when I call the last out Thursday, I will cease to become relevant in this town,\u201d Brennaman said. \u201cI truly believe I\u2019m going to be a whole lot less relevant, and that\u2019s good with me. I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A few hours before the start of his final series as a Cincinnati Reds broadcaster, Marty Brennaman was pausing to collect himself at the thought of a final out now clearly in sight.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/reds_brennamans_fairwell_35185_c0-220-5267-3290_s1770x1032.jpg?cd1593cd57b41836ff6314fd3e2b7e40a3fc0e9f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
