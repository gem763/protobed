According to local sources, the quota was intentionally unattainable because its true goal was to force citizens to pay fines and bribes for their failure to meet the necessary targets.\n\nThe scale of North Korea\u2019s crop is particularly important for ensuring that people do not suffer from famine and malnourishment, a reality that has plagued the country since its inception as an independent communist state.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the country went through a mass famine, often referred to as the \u201cArduous March,\u201d which saw between 240,000 to 3.5 million people die due to lack of nutrition.\n\nAuthorities have already set a similar quota for 2020, leading to social unrest and a negative environmental impact as citizens have begun fighting and stealing feces from one another in a bid to avoid paying the fines. Other people have also started digging up soil that they can mix with the feces in an effort to deceive authorities.\n\n\u201cThe agricultural authorities are forcing residents to produce eight tons of manure for each household to help the local farms,\u201d one resident from Ryanggang province recently told RFA\u2019s Korean Service. \u201cPeople in the city are fighting to take over public restrooms. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who can\u2019t get enough from the restrooms resort to collecting soil to mix with the feces to [make it seem like they have collected enough] manure,\u201d they continued. \u201cWhen it rains, the holes in the dirt become puddles of filth and are the main culprits of environmental destruction.\u201d\n\nThe source also revealed that the quota has presented an opportunity for enterprising merchants who begun selling feces on the black market.\n\n\u201cAs the absolute amount of manure is nowhere near the quota, there are even now merchants who are selling dried feces,\u201d the source said. \u201cPeople put all their human feces outside to dry so it\u2019s all over the city. It\u2019s really hard to breathe when you go out on the streets.\u201d\n\nA separate source told RFA that many people are beginning to resent authorities as they spend so much time trying to meet their quota.\n\n\u201cThe people have no time to take care of themselves. It\u2019s so hard to make a living already but there are so many things they want them to dedicate to the state. People are getting resentful,\u201d the second source said.\n\n\u201cResidents complain that this year the authorities have been forcing them to do so many of these missions that people can\u2019t even remember everything,\u201d they continued. \u201cGovernment officials are exempt from these tasks under their authority, but the powerless people are required to carry them out. These powerless people are the only ones made to suffer.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "North Korean laborers have begun fighting over and stealing each other's excrement in an attempt to meet their impossible quota collection.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-136077893-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
