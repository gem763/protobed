He said GM responded Sunday morning by reverting back to an offer that had been rejected and made few changes.\n\nThe company\u2019s proposal did nothing to address a host of items, Dittes wrote, specifying job security for members during the term of the four-year contract.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private, said both sides are far apart on guarantees of new products in U.S. factories.\n\nGM\u2019s U.S. factories have been shut down since the workers walked out Sept. 16. Parts shortages also have forced the company to close plants in Mexico and Canada.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Contract talks aimed at ending a 21-day strike by the United Auto Workers against General Motors have taken a turn for the worse.", "authors": ["Tom Krisher"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/general-motors-strike.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
