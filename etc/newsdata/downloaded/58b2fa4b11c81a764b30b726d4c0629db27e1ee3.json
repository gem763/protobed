Symbolically the Sun nourishes our soul and illuminates our path with heart. There are four key points in his annual journey as viewed from our geocentric vantagepoint. These points are the: Spring Equinox in March, Summer Solstice in June, Fall Equinox in September and the Winter Solstice in December.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere we approach the Fall Equinox, when day equals night. The light of the summer is fading. The days are shrinking, but it brings the joy of the abundant harvest, when we reap all the growth of the summer months. We're entering the last quarter of the year, which will end with the Winter Solstice and the long nights.\n\nJupiter, Opener of the Way, will move you forward toward the accomplishment of your hopes, dreams and aspirations. Saturn will be ideally placed for building the foundation of your future. Conditions are optimal for pursuing your dreams with a practical and common-sense approach.\n\nMercury will go through his last retrograde cycle of the year in passionate Scorpio in November. This will help you both financially and emotionally. December will bring a spectacular Annular Eclipse of the Sun when the Moon moves through the centre of Sun and is surrounded by a flaming ring of fire.\n\nYour horoscope for the Fall Equinox:\n\nAries\n\nA scenario that's developing closely resembles a previous occasion which didn't work out according to your wishes. When we consider what you've learned since that time, it's unlikely that the same outcome would happen again. Experience has taught you much in the interim. You've moved on. You've made a lot of sacrifices and compromises. Some of them were essential, others were quite unnecessary. Either way, you've had enough of all that. The Fall Equinox is opening a chapter in your life when you pledge fealty to your own needs and requirements. Your own needs must be serviced first.\n\nTaurus\n\nYour promise to honour a certain commitment was a wise one at the time you made it, but it's now become a rather heavy burden to bear. As a result, you face a perpetual shortage of time. Look at what your needs are and work on the assumption that you must make space to fulfil them. The Fall Equinox will move you to get engaged in a discussion about your role in this situation. This is good. Discussion will bring positive results. It'll provide a chance to redefine your role and get the recognition you deserve. Everything that can be dropped will be dropped.\n\nGemini\n\nYou've done well and proven that you have the strength, fortitude and patience to deal with problems under pressure. Once you get beyond a certain fear, it will become clear what you must do in a current scenario. The Fall Equinox will send you a marvellous reward for your efforts. As soon as you let bygones be bygones, an opportunity will appear, if it hasn't already, to make a change that will bring some much-needed emotional security. You'll find a wonderful way to settle an important matter in a constructive and practical manner.\n\nCancer\n\nIt's crucial now to stay true to what you know in your heart of hearts. You have the personal power to push past every difficulty in your path. If someone is blocking your progress, remind yourself of the process called karma. It takes care of people like that. Depending on how we conduct ourselves, good or bad, our deeds come back to reward or reprove us. The Fall Equinox will mark a turning point that will mete out justice. If someone has done you wrong, do your best to not to let that cause you distress. The Universe will deal with them in its own natural time.\n\nLeo\n\nIf you're wondering how anything good can come out of a certain scenario in which you're embroiled, you'll soon have your doubts dismissed. Beautiful diamonds lie buried amongst the dross. The Fall Equinox will awaken an inner source of wisdom. It will lead you toward a hidden advantage just waiting to be discovered. A rather happy and lengthy interlude in your life is about to begin. You'll be able to breathe again and look back and wonder why you tried so hard, worried so much and became so upset. You'll even have some time you can devote to levity, frivolity and mirth.\n\nVirgo\n\nIt's not very likely that you've ever be accused of swaggering braggadocio behaviour. Social cockiness isn't your way. You're more likely to indulge in self-deprecation. So, you won't be guilty of hubris in the coming months as the Fall Equinox marks a rise in your charm. If compliments haven't already started flowing your way, they soon will. Blush if you must, but you deserve all the good stuff that's coming your way. Yes, bask in the sunlight of praise. It's about time to redress the imbalance in your self-esteem. You're in a fine position to rediscover your enthusiasm and your power of magnetism.\n\nLibra\n\nTense stellar activity has got you fearing the worst. If you're to make things better, some sort of move or change must come about. Movement, even if ostensibly it doesn't seem ideal, is preferable to nothing. The status quo needs to be shifted. The Fall Equinox will show you how to claim more freedom and recognize opportunities. That way you'll be able to put things right and square that circle. By exclusively entertaining only positive thoughts, you will effectively repel the impact of any negativity that comes your way and draw a most fortunate encounter toward you.\n\nScorpio\n\nAn important marker point lies ahead. Once you pass this point you'll be able to relax and turn your attention away from a worrisome matter that's dominating your attention. The Fall Equinox is a transition point that will clear the decks of old issues that have had their day. You can't be a casual observer. You'll need to plunge into an essential course of action and give it all you've got. Challenges are opportunities in disguise. You'll introduce innovation and positive change right where you need it most. With a flexible attitude you'll work miracles. You have achieved much, and the best is yet to come!\n\nSagittarius\n\nYou've been through hard times that were so intense, it was hard to imagine them ever coming to an end. Time can move ahead with lightning quick speed; however, that offers little comfort when we find ourselves in the eye of a slow-moving storm. Time gets stuck. It lasts forever. The Fall Equinox is marking a rapid shift from an old way of life into an exciting new era of success. An idea or plan that you could never get off the ground will blast off like a rocket to Mars. The problem was never you. It was the timing and circumstances. Everything is now in place for you to materialize a dream.\n\nCapricorn\n\nA certain area of your life that's been lacking in happiness and contentment is due for a healing. You were forced to get used to something that's far from ideal. You might prefer to describe it as torturous, but things are different now. A conflict has been resolved. You've learned a lesson or two. The Equinox is leading you to a total cure. You've moved on from where you were and so has someone else. You're now being invited to try a far superior arrangement. Instead of a frown, you'll wake up in the morning with an easy smile on your face. You have every reason to step forward will eager anticipation.\n\nAquarius\n\nHot flames are being whipped up deep down within your own psyche. You won't need any chili sauce with your food for the foreseeable future. Things are hot enough as they are. Fire means wilful courage. It's the spark of the divine. The Fall Equinox will give you a chance to get a firm grip on where your life is going. It will unveil the hidden power within yourself. You're worrying more than you should. You can't be totally sure if you've got everything right, but you can rest assured that you're on the right track. A way will be found to expedite an ingenious plan in winning fashion.\n\nPisces\n\nSomething has been bothering you. You have an unconscious ability to sense trouble. You're so sensitive you can feel a pea at the bottom of a hundred mattresses. The point is that something quite small is causing you a great deal of undue concern. Try not to fret. This Fall Equinox marks the point when your personal power will blossom and grow. Give it a little time and you'll notice how your sources of worry will become infinitesimal and insignificant. No more cussing and fussing. Just keep smiling sweetly and you'll rid yourself of a worrisome situation. By and large, you're doing fine and you're due to do even better.", "description": "Conditions are perfect for turning your dreams into reality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288658.1568832580!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fall-equinox-horoscope-ft-img.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
