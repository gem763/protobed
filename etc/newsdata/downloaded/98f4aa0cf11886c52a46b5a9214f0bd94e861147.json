Chad Cordero, the Nationals\u2019 closer during their inaugural 2005 season, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nCordero will be caught by his own former batterymate, longtime Expos and Nationals catcher Brian Schneider, the report said.\n\nMany fans wanted the Game 3 first pitch to be linked back to the 2005 season, as a way to celebrate how far the team had come in 15 years after Washington went without a Major League Baseball franchise for more than three decades.\n\nPopular ideas included Livan Hernandez, the Opening Day pitcher for the Nationals\u2019 first season, and the widow of Frank Robinson, the Nationals\u2019 first manager.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that one of these figures won\u2019t make an appearance Friday, or perhaps be given first pitch duties for Game 4 on Saturday. There may be need for a Game 5 in Washington should the Astros win one of the next two games; after that, the series will shift back to Houston if necessary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
