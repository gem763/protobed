The earlier protests also saw violence against protesters, and a total of 240 people have been killed since the unrest began.\n\nBut the bloodshed in Karbala could mark a turning point because of the high death toll and because the city is a major pilgrimage site where a revered Shiite figure was killed in a 7th century battle.\n\nThere were differing accounts and death tolls, and details were still emerging from the scene.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, and protesters said they did not know whether the masked men were riot police, special forces or Iran-linked militias. The protesters said Iraqi soldiers had been stationed around the protest site but withdrew after the attackers began firing tear gas and live ammunition.\n\nAmid a clampdown by security forces, it was difficult to piece together what exactly prompted the attack although eyewitnesses told The Associated Press that masked gunmen opened fire on the camp.\n\nProvincial governor Nassif al-Khutabi denied that any protesters were killed but said there were some injuries among security forces.\n\nHe said videos posted online were fabricated and not from Karbala. The footage purported to show the aftermath of the attack, with fires and people running away to the sound of heavy gunfire. Al-Khutabi\u2019s description contradicted those from people who were at the scene.\n\nAn AP video showed a nighttime fire and young protesters, some of them taking video with their cellphones, as gunfire echoes. An ambulance can be seen trying to drive amid the chaos, with Iraqi security forces arriving.\n\nThe leaderless and largely spontaneous protests across Iraq have been met with bullets and tear gas by security forces from the start.\n\nAt least 73 people \u2014 not including the latest fatalities in Karbala \u2014 have been killed since anti-government demonstrations resumed Friday, while 149 were killed during the earlier wave of protests this month.\n\nTuesday\u2019s attack happened in Karbala\u2019s Education Square, where protesters had set up tents for their sit-in.\n\nOne of the demonstrators said they were chanting slogans when an army unit arrived and that they gave the soldiers flowers and had friendly interactions. Then tear gas canisters came spiraling into the square, fired from the streets and alleys behind the soldiers, who then withdrew.\n\n\u201cWe saw masked men dressed all in black and they fired live bullets toward the square,\u201d the protester said. \u201cPeople fell dead and wounded right next to me. We tried to escape but when we fled into the alleys we ran into moving checkpoints set up by these forces. They arrested people and searched their phones for video of what had happened.\u201d\n\nAnother witness said hundreds of protesters were in the encampment when someone opened fire from a passing car. Then, masked gunmen in black plainclothes arrived and started shooting at the protesters, and the tents caught fire.\n\nBoth witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisal. The death toll was confirmed by Iraqi security officials, also speaking anonymously, because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.\n\nThe anti-government protests in Karbala, Baghdad and cities across southern Iraq have often turned violent, with security forces opening fire and protesters torching government buildings and headquarters of Iran-backed militias.\n\nThe demonstrations have occurred in Shiite-majority areas and have been directed at the Shiite-dominated government and Shiite political parties and militias, many of which are supported by neighboring Iran.\n\nIn Tehran, the Foreign Ministry warned Iranians traveling to Iraq during the demonstrations and asked them to postpone their trips until further notice, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nKarbala is one of the holiest places in Shiite Islam, where Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, was killed in battle in the year 680, a formative event in the schism between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. Hundreds of thousands of Shiites flock to the city every year to commemorate his martyrdom.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the residents in Karbala and the city\u2019s security forces are Shiite.\n\nThe demonstrations are fueled by anger at corruption, economic stagnation and poor public services. Despite its vast oil wealth, Iraq suffers from high unemployment and crumbling infrastructure, with frequent power outages that force many to rely on private generators.\n\nThe protests have grown and demonstrators are now calling for sweeping changes, not just the government\u2019s resignation. Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi has promised a government reshuffle and reforms, which the demonstrators have already rejected.\n\nAuthorities on Monday imposed a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. in Baghdad, as renewed protests raged there and across the south.\n\nA senior security official estimated that 25,000 protesters took part in the demonstration in the capital on Monday. Thousands of students joined the protests, as clashes with security forces firing tear gas killed at least three demonstrators and wounded more than 100.\n\nStudents skipped classes at several universities and secondary schools in Baghdad and across southern Iraq to take part in the protests, despite the government ordering the institutions to operate as normal.\n\nOne of those killed was a 22-year-old female medical student, the first woman to die since the protests began earlier this month. Seventeen students were among the wounded.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeina Karam and Joseph Krauss in Beirut and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed..", "description": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Masked gunmen opened fire at Iraqi protesters in the Shiite holy city of Karbala on Tuesday, killing 18 people and wounding hundreds,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/c56602_iraq-protests-27750-anti-government-protesters-light-fires-iraqi-security-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
