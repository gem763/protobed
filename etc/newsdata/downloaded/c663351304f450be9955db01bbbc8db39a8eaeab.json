UK airports are in chaos, as all flights to mainland Europe have been cancelled since late on Friday.\n\nThe WTO rules do not cover aviation. And no aircraft is permitted to fly between the UK and EU airports until a new bilateral agreement on flights is reached.\n\nWeekend motorists in Kent are also suffering, as the roads leading to the ports of Dover and Folkestone soon become gridlocked with stationary lorries.\n\nEach UK export consignment to Europe now has to be checked by customs staff in Calais, with tariffs and VAT collected.\n\nThe French port\u2019s infrastructure is rapidly overwhelmed and ferry companies are instructed not to disgorge any more lorries until they can hire and train more officers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Expecting a rush of panic buying, some profiteering operators jack up fuel prices on Sunday to as much as \u00a31.50 a litre.\n\nWhen the stock markets open on Monday, traders\u2019 screens are drenched in red as UK stocks and investment funds get brutally marked down. Many find they cannot process orders on behalf of European clients due to the sudden demise of the single market passport for financial services.\n\nBank executives implement their contingency plans, informing thousands of employees that they will either be sacked or relocated to Frankfurt.\n\nLawyers are commissioned across the Square Mile for a gargantuan battle over trillions of pounds of derivative contracts whose legal status is now suddenly in doubt.\n\nDespite an emergency rate cut and unprecedentedly large financial market liquidity injection from the Bank of England, panic takes hold in the City.\n\nThe pound is sinking at its most rapid rate since the night of that Leave vote in the Brexit referendum. One airport bureau de change offers to buy pounds for only a single dollar.\n\nCar plant workers in the midlands and the north east arrive for work only to be told that half of them should go home. The parts they need to work with have not been delivered. They are stuck in transit and the \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery system has broken down. The shockwaves ripple out to their thousands of supplier firms. Airbus announces it is closing down its entire plant in Wales, throwing 10,000 out of work at a stroke.\n\nDespite months of stockpiling, many NHS drug deliveries are also held up. Non-urgent operations are cancelled indefinitely. All but the most sick are urged not to present themselves for treatment. One panicking manager of an overstretched hospital turns away a Spanish woman because, he says, as an EU citizen, her right to healthcare in the UK is now unclear. Others follow the precedent. The Madrid government declares that, in retaliation, retired Britons on the Costa del Sol will also be ineligible for Spanish healthcare.\n\nCivil servants frantically hammer the phones, trying to get through to their European counterparts, pleading for the ports and airports to be opened, for emergency supplies to be fast-tracked, for some kind of temporary political agreement on the rights of EU citizens and Britons on the continent.\n\nBut the Europeans are divided. Hardliners in Germany, France and the Netherlands insist on no cooperation with the perfidious Brits whatsoever until they agree to honour their \u00a339bn of EU liabilities. They are also consumed with the question of how to deal with Ireland, which has refused to close its border with the north for fear of provoking a Republican terror attack, leaving a gaping hole in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nAs UK public anger and fear swells, Brexiteers give defensive media interviews. Some blame the chaos on the government\u2019s failure to plan adequately.\n\nOthers blame the EU for deliberately sabotaging the UK economy and demand retaliation. Others call for martial law. Not one utters the words \u201cproject fear\u201d.\n\nThis article was originally published on Friday 27 July 2018.", "description": "It\u2019s Saturday 30 March 2019 and Britain has gone over the cliff edge.
