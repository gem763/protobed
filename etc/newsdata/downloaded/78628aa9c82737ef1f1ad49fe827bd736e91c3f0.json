They cost around $400,000 to $600,000.\n\nThe Kendra's moved from Crystal Lake in Illinois to Wake Forest almost three years ago and in the aftermath of the mass shooting are trying to find their footing.\n\n'We are just trying to figure out what our new normal is,' she said.\n\nThe Aurora Strong flag, as well as the American flag hung alongside it, are a symbol of the family's grief for both Parks and family members who served in the military.\n\nThe Aurora Strong logo has become a beacon of hope for residents and loved ones who suffered through the mass shooting.\n\nThe Aurora Strong Community Fund has raised over $500,000 since it was created eight months ago and paraphernalia has been made around the world.\n\nAurora Shooting Facts On February 15, Gary Martin was fired from his job and subsequently opened fire on his coworkers\n\nThe first active shooter call was made at 1.24pm\n\nThe first of four officers being shot is reported at 1.30pm\n\nReports of three employees shot inside the meeting room and two in the warehouse come in at 1.31pm\n\nParamedics and medical services start arriving at 1.37pm to administer help\n\nAt 2.58pm, Aurora officers confront Martin and kill him\n\nSix people, including the suspect, are left dead\n\nAfter a local station reported on the flagpole dispute, the homeowners' association agreed to no longer fine the family.\n\n'Due to not receiving the application before the flag pole was installed, the Board of Directors was unfortunately unaware of the passing of your son and the intent to honor him with the flags and did not have the opportunity to respond accordingly,' the organization said.\n\n'The Board would like to extend their sincerest condolences to your family for your loss.'\n\nHowever, disagreements on the flag's placement still wage on.\n\nThe homeowners' association board has asked the Kendra's to move the pole to the left side of the home and downgrade the flagpole size to 15 feet.\n\nThe Aurora Strong flag will be allowed to fly on February 20, 2020, but afterwards can only be flown on the mass shooting's anniversary.\n\nLeslie hopes to fly the flag year round, but will be forced to take it down at the end of October if an agreement is not met.\n\nIn an effort to fight the rule, the family has reached out to the state's attorney's office and Illinois legislators for help.\n\nLeslie said: 'People have sports teams things on their mailbox. I just don\u2019t understand why anyone would have a problem with this.'\n\nThere have reportedly been at least 21 mass shootings this year.\n\nSix people, including Parks, were killed during the Aurora mass shooting at the Henry Pratt Co. warehouse (left)\n\nSpanning multiple coasts and at least 14 states, mass shootings have become an epidemic in American society.\n\nThis summer alone, unprecedented attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, shook the nation's core\n\nIn El Paso, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius walked into a Walmart near the U.S. - Mexico border and opened fire on a crowd of unsuspecting shoppers.\n\nCrusius has been identified as a white supremacist and his attack was a direct target on people of Mexican descent.\n\nUsing an AR-47, the gunman killed 24 people and injured 22 more.\n\nIn a recent court appearance Crusius pleaded not guilty, despite telling authorities he was the shooter when he surrendered on August 3.\n\nVideo surveillance caught Crusius near one of store's entrances.\n\nOne day later, 24-year-old Connor Stephen Betts killed 10 people after he fired shots at Ned Peppers Bar in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nAurora, Illinois shooter Gary Martin, 45, killed five co-workers during his murderous spree\n\nBetts used a Ar-15 style gun and was killed at the scene by authorities.\n\nHe shot 26 people in 32 seconds.\n\nAuthorities say the motive behind Betts attack, which included his younger sister Megan Betts, may never be known.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shared a tweet sending condolences victims of the Aurora shooting, but has stopped short of formally enacting any policies towards gun control.\n\nAfter the El Paso and Dayton shootings, Trump said mental illness is the reason for the continual violence.\n\n'Mental illness and hatred pull the trigger. Not the gun,' he said.\n\nTrump also suggested America reopen mental institutions that have previously been closed as a way to combat future mass shootings.\n\nThis point quickly and hotly contested by mental health experts who say mental illness is not a predictor of violent outbursts.\n\nIn recent years, gun control has become has become an integral topic of discourse for both Trump and the democratic presidential candidates leading up to the 2020 election.", "description": "Leslie Kendra, mother of Aurora mass shooting victim Clayton Parks, has been ordered by her Wake Forest, North Carolina homeowners' association to take down a flag honoring her son", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/16/19890254-0-image-a-31_1571412748593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
