REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up 0.5% and Tokyo's Nikkei stock index .N225 rose 0.96%. Australian shares were up 0.2%.\n\nIn early European trading, the futures for pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 STXEc1 were up 0.65%, German DAX FDXc1 0.6%, and London\u2019s FTSE FFIc1 0.52%.\n\nChinese stocks rose and the yuan hit a three-week high after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to delay an additional increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks at the request of China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He \u201cas a gesture of good will.\u201d\n\nU.S. stock futures ESc1 rose 0.38% and safe-havens such as the yen, U.S. Treasuries, and gold weakened in a sign of improving appetite for risk.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s comments are likely to put a little juice in the market, but it could be gone tomorrow,\u201d said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management in Sydney.\n\n\u201cSome in the market react to small changes in negotiating positions because Trump is negotiating in the open. I\u2019m more concerned about Brexit, because there is some complacency in the EU about this.\u201d\n\nOil prices rose in Asia, rebounding from a tumble on Wednesday, on hopes OPEC members will cut output to support prices.\n\nAny easing of concerns about the bruising trade war is likely to help equities extend their rally this month after a tumultuous August.\n\nInvestors also await an ECB meeting later on Thursday to see how far policymakers will go to support a flagging economy, given the risks posed by Britain\u2019s divorce from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 .SPX ended 0.72% higher on Wednesday.\n\nThe dollar briefly rose to a six-week high of 108.175 yen JPY=EBS before paring gains slightly to trade up 0.17% at 108.030 yen.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose to 1.7730%, the highest in five weeks, extending a sell-off in government bonds that started on Sept. 4.\n\nSpot gold XAU= fell 0.14% to $1,495.00 per ounce.\n\n(Graphic: Treasury yields and gold link: here)\n\nTrump\u2019s delay of additional tariffs on Chinese goods comes one day after China said it would exempt 16 types of U.S. products from import tariffs.\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies have been locked in protracted battle over Beijing\u2019s trade practices that has raised the spectre of a global recession.\n\nThe gestures of goodwill raise hopes both sides can narrow their differences before working-level talks resume in mid-September and high-level trade negotiations that are expected in October.\n\nIn offshore trading, the yuan CNH=D3 rose to a three-week high of 7.0739 per dollar, while Chinese shares .CSI300 rose 0.66% on renewed optimism about trade talks.\n\nThe euro EUR=EBS held steady at $1.1014 but remained near a one-week low. The ECB is set to unveil fresh stimulus measures on Thursday but its exact moves are far from clear.\n\nGermany is at risk of slipping into recession and inflation expectations sliding, but ECB President Mario Draghi, who hands over the leadership of the central bank to Christine Lagarde at the end of October, will face resistance to aggressive easing from more conservative ECB members.\n\nSterling GBP=D3 traded at $1.2328, little changed following a 0.24% decline on Wednesday after a Scottish court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of the British Parliament was unlawful.\n\nPolitical wrangling over the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU has weighed on the outlook for the British pound.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.93% to $56.27 in Asia on the day. Futures tumbled more than 2% on Wednesday following a report that Trump is considering easing sanctions on Iran, which could potentially boost oil supplies.\n\nAsian traders were likely focused on OPEC\u2019s decision on Wednesday to cut its forecast for global oil demand in 2020. OPEC also said all producers have a shared responsibility to support the oil market.", "description": "Asian stocks advanced to a six-week high on Thursday on hopes for a thaw in U.S.-China trade relations and expectations that the European Central Bank would kick off another wave of monetary easing by global central banks.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428876394&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B01G", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
