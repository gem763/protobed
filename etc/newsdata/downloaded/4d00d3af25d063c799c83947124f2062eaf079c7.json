This is the exact opposite of unconstitutional. The Constitution specifically says that impeachment is left to Congress with very little statement as to how they want to conduct it. And in fact, I think I remember that Newt Gingrich did an impeachment effort, led an impeachment effort against Bill Clinton in 1998. Was that an effort to overturn an election? No, he was investigating stuff.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe may find out that there is some there-there \u2014 there\u2019s no there-there, but to call it unconstitutional or an effort to overturn an election, that\u2019s a reach particularly for somebody like Newt Gingrich who was involved in the last impeachment effort.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Friday's broadcast of Fox News Channel's \"America's Newsroom,\" \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace\u00a0called out former House Speaker Newt Gingrich | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/chris-wallace-gesture-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
