It has ruined many lives,\" an anonymous source told News24 on Tuesday.\n\nBusinesswoman Khanyi Dhlomo confirmed the closure of her company Ndalo Media in December 2018.\n\nALSO READ | Khanyi Dhlomo: Decision to close Ndalo Media made 'after much reflection'\n\nIt was later liquidated - a process which is currently underway - after CEO Dhlomo announced that the company - which housed Destiny, Destiny Man, Elle and Elle Home magazines - would be closing \"after much reflection\", News24 previously reported.\n\nThe anonymous source said retrenched employees' bid to take Dhlomo to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) failed after it was thrown out during the labour process.\n\n\"We went from a slam dunk, clear cut case to it being thrown out. She did not show up to any of the reconciliation hearings.\n\n\"The matter was then referred for arbitration, however, her lawyers did not pitch,\" the source added.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, former Ndalo Media employees claimed Dhlomo had not been in contact with them.\n\n\"We really were left high and dry. The frustration we have is that there is a lack of accountability,\" the source said.\n\nALSO READ | 'Where has our money gone?' - former Ndalo Media employees left with 'absolutely nothing'\n\nThe statement also revealed that 45 former staff members have secured pro bono representation with regards to the case.\n\n\"It has been a stressful year for the staff, both emotionally and financially, as many of us are still not fully employed. We are extremely grateful to advocate [Nazeer] Cassim SC, advocate [Teneille] Govender and [Thapelo] Kharametsane for taking up our cause and we hope that the staff will be fairly compensated.\n\n\"We look forward to putting this episode behind us so that we can all move on,\" a former staff member said.\n\nThe anonymous source could not reveal what legal action would be pursued at this stage.\n\nNews24 reached out to Ndalo Media's lawyers, Judin Combrinck Inc.
