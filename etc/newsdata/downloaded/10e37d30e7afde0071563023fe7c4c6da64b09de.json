Their mission was to rescue the son of the notorious drugs lord, El Chapo, who had been captured by police. Officers were forced to release Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez after gang members threw up roadblocks with blazing trucks, and staged a prison break of 51 of their comrades.\n\nThe battle came only a week after Mexico\u2019s interior secretary Olga S\u00e1nchez Cordero pledged that the country would \u201cvery soon\u201d see results of the deployment of a 70,000-strong National Guard \u2013 a showpiece unit formed this year by president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 against resurgent violence and record murder levels.\n\nBut on Monday, 14 police officers were killed by cartel gunmen in Michoac\u00e1n. Fifteen more lives were lost next day during a firefight in Guerrero. In Thursday\u2019s fighting, a soldier and civilian were killed in Culiac\u00e1n, in Sinaloa state, and others wounded \u2013 with questions hanging over how it happened.\n\nIn reality, the new National Guard is deployed mostly against migrants in a joint policy with the US. While hundreds of guards blocked a convoy of Hondurans in Tuzant\u00e1n last weekend, security minister Alfonso Durazo conceded on Friday he had deployed only 35 troops to seize Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez \u2013 \u201cThe Mouse\u201d, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s fourth son by his second wife, Griselda L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez \u2013 blacklisted in the US in 2001 and charged last February with cocaine trafficking.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? On the surface, Amlo \u2013 as the president is known \u2013 at last cracks down on a cartel long known for its conviviality with government, but is outgunned; unconfirmed reports indicated the detention on Tuesday of Ovidio\u2019s mother.\n\nBut why mobilise a paltry crew of 35 against a mafia boss? How did such a cartel counter-force arrive to confront and humiliate it immediately? There\u2019s choreography at play \u2013 but by whom, of what?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, currently in jail in the US.

Durazo at first sought to have Mexicans believe that a routine patrol was fired upon from a house which, when raided, happened to be harbouring Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n. (For El Chapo\u2019s son to draw fire on himself beggars belief even by the standards of his own outrageous reputation.) Only later did Durazo concede to a news agency that Ovidio had been released.\n\nThe president then contradicted his own minister, confirming that the operation was \u201cbased on an arrest warrant for an alleged criminal\u201d.\n\nTwo other factors further muddy the waters: one video clip shows troops and cartel gunners giving one another high-fives after the former were surrounded and neutralised. The prison break would hardly be the first time authorities have been directly or indirectly party to an escape, not least one by El Chapo \u2013 who founded the Sinaloa cartel and is now in jail in the US \u2013 himself.\n\nThe cartel has fragmented since Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s extradition and conviction. Factions compete for the succession: one led by the guiding but ailing hand of Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, suspected of delivering El Chapo to the US authorities, or at least withdrawing his official protection; another, loyal to Guzm\u00e1n, is led by his sons, \u201cLos Chapitos\u201d \u2013 Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar (son of El Chapo\u2019s first wife Maria Alejandrina Salazar Hern\u00e1ndez) and Ovidio.\n\nA third interest, led by D\u00e1maso L\u00f3pez, \u201cEl Licenciado\u201d, now captive in the US, defected to the rising Jalisco New Generation cartel, to which Sinaloa is losing initiative within Mexico.\n\nSuch an attack on the state is not El Mayo\u2019s usual strategic style. It is more typical of Guzman\u2019s sons, whose brazen tactics he abhors.\n\nBritish film-maker Angus Macqueen \u2013 who penetrated further inside the Guzm\u00e1n family than any foreign reporter, interviewing El Chapo\u2019s mother \u2013 noted: \u201cThis is the first open confrontation between the authorities and the Sinaloa cartel. The remarkable thing is the speed with which hundreds of armed cartel members arrived and dominated the centre of this town.\u201d\n\nAnabel Hern\u00e1ndez first described the state sanctioning of El Chapo\u2019s escape from jail in 2001 and named the cartel\u2019s connections at the apex of power in her book Narcoland; after numerous threats to her life, she has completed a new volume on the inner workings and reach of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Culiac\u00e1n just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cNo sense in the government sending 35 people to take Ovidio. That\u2019s his girlfriend\u2019s house, and they\u2019d have followed him there with intelligence. There\u2019s the municipal police and an army base in Culiac\u00e1n; helicopters can arrive easily from [nearby] Mazatl\u00e1n.\u201d\n\nAnd, she cautions: \u201cNever forget that the Sinaloa cartel remains a vast organisation across 70% of the world. It\u2019s far bigger than El Chapo, and after he was sentenced, the sons got a very small part; the huge share came under El Mayo. But the sons have money to spend, and that\u2019s what happened in Culiac\u00e1n: if you pay people to carry the weapons, you get what you want.\u201d\n\nOfficial collusion at some level is inevitable in Thursday\u2019s battle-as-theatre. Hern\u00e1ndez puts the events in perspective: \u201cFor a decade, war between the cartels is reflected within the police, army and all forces.\n\n\u201cOne cartel is protected by some officers, another cartel by others. That has not changed \u2013 the prison break yesterday must have been sanctioned from within the authorities. All we can be sure of is that someone betrayed the government in Culiac\u00e1n yesterday.\u201d", "description": "The abortive bid to arrest the son of \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzm\u00e1n last week made one thing clear: someone betrayed the government", "authors": ["Ed Vulliamy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41fef29443c0cfee57843d4889f518e04a14f3e5/0_338_3304_1982/master/3304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55a9e3ea6441db6b3afca6ff39253b70", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
