REUTERS/Tom Jacobs/File Photo\n\nSidestepping technical hurdles that take time to clear and pinning hope on top-level talks is a risky strategy that failed two former British prime ministers, both of whom were forced to quit over their country\u2019s thorny divorce from the bloc.\n\nThe leaders of the bloc\u2019s 27 other countries fear that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, known for his loose attention to detail, will arrive at the Oct. 17-18 summit in a blaze of bravado, calling on them to overlook missing details and seal a more general, political deal.\n\nIf they turn him down, they worry, they risk taking the blame themselves for making a damaging no-deal Brexit inevitable.\n\nEU leaders won\u2019t play along with that scenario.\n\nThis is because the technical provisions of any deal are important, negotiations over them are entrusted to the EU\u2019s executive Commission and it will need time to work through them to make recommendations for the leaders meeting in mid-October.\n\n\u201cThe EU27 has always insisted that these negotiations are not something for the Council (of national leaders),\u201d a senior EU diplomat told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be solved by the prime minister waving a single piece of paper at the summit. I cannot see what he would say on that date that would miraculously solve the issue at the heart of the backstop problem.\u201d\n\nThe EU made clear this week that London\u2019s ideas so far on replacing the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d - an insurance agreement written into a stalled Brexit deal that would prevent the return of border controls between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - were far from acceptable.\n\nBritain said on Thursday it had shared \u201cconfidential technical non-papers\u201d with the EU, essentially preliminary ideas rather than the formal written legal proposals Brussels wants for an agreement on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit on Oct. 31.\n\nAntti Rinne, the prime minister of Finland, which currently holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, said on Wednesday that London had until the end of September to present detailed legal texts of what it wants a new Brexit deal to look like.\n\n\u201cTime is running out,\u201d a French government source said, commenting on a meeting between Rinne and French President Emmanuel Macron. \u201cWe won\u2019t be negotiating directly at the European Council in mid-October.\u201d [L5N26A1VI]\n\nThe EU side worries London may be making the same mistake as those of former British premiers Theresa May and David Cameron grappling with Brexit.\n\nMay, Johnson\u2019s immediate predecessor, was rebuffed at an EU summit in Salzburg a year ago when she made a political appeal to the other 27 leaders to back her Brexit matrix, only to have them reject it unanimously.\n\nBefore Britain\u2019s 2016 Brexit referendum, then-prime minister David Cameron leant heavily on Germany\u2019s influential chancellor, Angela Merkel, to give Britain a new status within the EU in the hope that she would sway the rest of the bloc. He was bitterly surprised when he secured much less than he had hoped for.\n\n\u201cThe Commission leads our negotiations for a reason: they have the technical expertise needed to tackle such issues as the Irish border. You agree stuff with them. The leaders are there to approve or dismiss the deal - not to work it out,\u201d said another EU diplomat involved in the Brexit talks.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s insistence on detail and process contrasts with the rhetoric coming from the British side - \u201cIt\u2019s time to take risks, show leadership and seize the opportunities ahead,\u201d said one UK government official - and diplomats in Brussels foresee it will end in a crash at next month\u2019s summit.", "description": "Britain finally put some documents on the table on Thursday to break an impasse in its Brexit talks with the EU, but the bloc is worried that London is banking too much on a meeting of the 28 national leaders next month to get a deal across the line.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431683247&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1NX", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
