It hasn\u2019t let its future be held back by a rich past, and is instead forging new ways to combine ancient culture with a thriving student population and (like it or not) an increasing number of hen dos.\n\nWhat to do\n\nUnusual artworks\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYork Art Gallery packs a mighty punch for a small space, and fans of ceramics in particular are in for a treat. Visit before November to catch an exhibition of Dame Lucie Rie\u2019s elegant pots and wartime ceramic buttons. Entry costs \u00a37.75.\n\nMighty Minster\n\nMeanwhile there\u2019s plenty to marvel at in the Minster too \u2013 with some of the world\u2019s finest stained glass windows on offer. Many have been painstakingly cleaned and restored, revealing their jewel colours and the incredible details on some of their inhabitants\u2019 faces \u2013 bring binoculars for the full effect.\n\nEntry \u00a311; free tours are available at regular intervals. The famous wren and spider panel is easy to overlook. It\u2019s tucked away inside the Zouche Chapel on the right-hand side of the building.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Grab a bite in its friendly bar-bistro area beforehand.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nFor a sense of history with modern day style, try Grays Court \u2013 the oldest inhabited building in York, with parts dating back to 1091. Today it has elegant rooms, generous bathrooms, a bar packed with cosy nooks and a chic restaurant (more below). The garden is rimmed with Roman walls, and in summer these can be accessed directly. Doubles from \u00a3140.\n\nHop aboard the Luxury Houseboat Till, just half a mile from the Minster, for a shipshape self-catering stay. Central heating will keep you cosy whatever the weather, and there\u2019s room for six. Two nights from \u00a3494.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThe Bow Room at Grays Court has made a name for itself in modern dining \u2013 think blind tasting menus and small plates packed with local ingredients. While some of the flavour combinations might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, experimental eaters will be in their element.\n\nFor brunch with a continental twist, head to the Press Kitchen, Walmgate. There are plenty of veggie and vegan options, including breakfast burritos and buttermilk pancakes, available daily until 5pm. An evening menu is also available from \u00a318.50 for two courses.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nCocktail fans are spoilt for choice in the city, but rough and ready Evil Eye on Stonegate frequently appears on national lists of best bars. It has the best stocked bar you\u2019ll ever see (it\u2019s in the Guinness Book of World Records for largest gin selection) and great deals on mojitos. What\u2019s not to like? Buy gifts to take home at the onsite gin shop.\n\nFor a non-alcoholic option, it has to be a cup of Yorkshire\u2019s finest at the famous Bettys tearoom \u2013 which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. While there are usually queues for a table, you can always slip up to the counter on the left to buy fat rascals, curd tarts, elegant fondant fancies and more to take away.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nMake your Instagram pop with a trip to Botanic, Walmgate. A veritable greenhouse of plants for every desk, mantelpiece and room in your house, this independent shop has staff who really know their stuff.\n\nHarry Potter fans will be in their element in The Shambles, where there are multiple shops dedicated to the Boy Who Lived. The original is The Shop That Must Not Be Named, which had queues around the block for its first months. Now the fuss has died down, but it remains a popular spot to pick up house clothing, stationery and cuddly toys.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nPublic transport\n\nWalking or cycling are good options, but there\u2019s also a comprehensive bus network.\n\nBest view\n\nWhile there are gorgeous views around most corners of central York \u2013 from the atmospheric Shambles to the top of the Roman walls or Clifford\u2019s Tower \u2013 one of the best spots for sunny days is the 10-acre botanical gardens surrounding the Yorkshire Museum. Picnic beside the ruins of St Mary\u2019s Abbey, the River Ouse and plentiful flower beds.\n\nInsider tip\n\nFor some of the finest examples of stucco decor you\u2019re ever likely to see, pop into Fairfax House. The Georgian property\u2019s ceilings \u2013 which were painted shocking red when the building was a dance hall and cinema \u2013 have had every inch painstakingly scraped from the plaster to restore them to their former glory. Entry \u00a37.50.\n\nMore information\n\nGo to the Visit York website: visityork.org\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing multiple attractions try the one-day York City Pass for \u00a345 (covers 25 attractions and sightseeing buses).", "description": "York is a city that\u2019s truly living among history, with modern, independent shops tucked beneath Roman walls and contemporary restaurants down the road from Viking digs.
