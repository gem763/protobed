Obama and Power first met in the spring of 2005, when Obama was an ambitious junior senator from Illinois. They worked together for a year (Power volunteered to serve in his office), and when Obama won the Democratic primary in 2008, he hired her as a foreign policy adviser, later appointing her to the National Security Council as senior director for multilateral affairs and senior director for human rights.\n\nIn government, Power swiftly learned that few officials cared about human rights; many, in fact, deemed them a distraction from more important issues of power politics. Nevertheless, while at the NSC, Power helped expand by $50 million U.S. aid to Iraqi refugees, increased the number of Iraqis allowed to resettle in the United States, and doubled the government\u2019s refugee stipend. She also advocated for the United States to run for a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council, which it won in 2009. From this perch, U.S. officials spurred a number of resolutions focused on revealing human rights abuses in various nations, including Iran, Syria, Sudan, and North Korea. Moreover, Power proudly emphasizes, the United States \u201csucceeded in getting the Human Rights Council to reduce by half the share of country-specific resolutions on Israel.\u201d\n\nAs this last comment indicates, for Power, protecting human rights means disciplining nations of the Global South that are not U.S. allies. Throughout The Education of an Idealist, she barely mentions Israel or Saudi Arabia\u2014she says nothing about Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank or the Saudi war on women and LGBTQI+ people. These silences are deafening, because the type of world Power wants to build will never be realized if only certain countries\u2014namely, those that stand outside America\u2019s imperial sphere\u2014are held to account. Her approach does not make much sense from a pragmatic perspective either: U.S. officials have the highest likelihood of ending human rights abuses in countries that depend on us; there is little point in spending political capital in a mostly quixotic attempt to transform antagonists like North Korea.\n\nMeanwhile, Power completely ignores the human rights violations that took place in her own country under Obama\u2019s watch; like many liberal interventionists, she is far more vexed by suffering abroad. Nowhere does she address police violence against African Americans, mass surveillance, refugee detention, or mass incarceration. Nor does she give much thought to the colonial violence that defines American history: In The Education of an Idealist, she recalls inviting a Serbian official to meet with her in the so-called Indian Treaty Room, where she lectured him on the importance of apprehending the war criminal Ratko Mladi\u0107. Somehow, Power overlooks the irony of championing justice in a room named for repeatedly broken treaties that the U.S. government made with the native population against which it committed genocide.\n\nPower\u2019s most consequential decision during Obama\u2019s first term displayed a shortsightedness that has often accompanied her faith in U.S. military power. With the outbreak of civil war in Libya, Power began to advocate vociferously in favor of intervention to stop a potential massacre at Benghazi. In particular, during a March 15, 2011, meeting, Power endorsed U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice\u2019s proposal to establish a no-fly zone over Libya and attack Muammar Qaddafi\u2019s forces. Obama approved Rice\u2019s plan, and on March 19, a U.S.-led NATO coalition began bombing Libya, initiating a process that concluded with Qaddafi\u2019s death. Despite the war\u2019s expansion and the chaos that ensued, Power remains proud of her contribution. For her, \u201conce the revolution spread, the real question became how to use the tools at our disposal to bring about the best possible\u2014or the least bad\u2014outcome.\u201d\n\nBut was that the real question? Here are some other questions that are equally important and that she should have taken more seriously before Obama commenced Operation Odyssey Dawn: Is the war likely to expand? If the war expands and Qaddafi is deposed, who will govern Libya? Is the United States\u2014especially the American public\u2014willing to commit itself to reconstruction efforts? What precedent does the intervention potentially set? Power never really asked these questions, because ultimately, as the historian Stephen Wertheim has argued, she considers humanitarian intervention a categorical imperative (as long as it doesn\u2019t involve U.S. allies, of course). For this reason, throughout her time in office Power regularly encouraged war.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s second term, Power left the NSC to become U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In this position, she won many admirable victories: She aided in establishing a U.N. post dedicated to monitoring global LGBT rights; brought countries together to end the deadly Ebola outbreak of 2014; and promoted a resolution that demanded the United Nations deport any peacekeeping units from countries in which U.N. soldiers were reported to have committed sexual assault.\n\nYet it was also during Obama\u2019s second term that Power found herself less able to convince the president of the moral necessity of intervention. In her memoir, she relates that when she first learned that Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government had employed chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, she hoped \u201cObama would respond forcefully\u201d and was disappointed when he didn\u2019t. Nevertheless, in August 2013, Power was heartened to discover that Obama intended to answer the Syrian government\u2019s murder of 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack with airstrikes of military targets.\n\nPower\u2019s expectations, however, were dashed when she was informed that Obama had decided to seek congressional authorization for the airstrikes. \u201cWhat happens if Congress doesn\u2019t support you?\u201d she asked the president. \u201cDoes that mean Assad could just keep using chemical weapons?\u201d In the end, Obama determined that Congress would rebuff his plan and chose not to go ahead with a vote; against Power\u2019s wishes, he also refused to intervene. Instead, the president accepted Russia\u2019s offer to work together to disable Assad\u2019s chemical weapons program. For her part, Power \u201cshuddered at the inadequacy of the effort\u201d to decrease Assad\u2019s stockpile, despite the fact that U.S.-Russian collaboration provided an opportunity to build the trust necessary to reach a political resolution of the conflict.\n\nPower\u2019s recollection of the Syria debate highlights her meritocratic skepticism of democratic politics. She writes that she \u201cregretted that our administration had not ascertained whether we had the votes before the President announced he was going to Congress. Had he known he would fail, [she] did not believe he would have chosen the path he did.\u201d Power, in other words, wanted Congress to rubber-stamp Obama\u2019s decision to intervene; she wasn\u2019t interested in having a real public discussion about the potential benefits and drawbacks of using military force. In fact, Power has the temerity to express disappointment with the U.S. public for refusing to support intervention. Most Americans, she laments, \u201cwanted no part of Syria. The student activists, civic groups, churches, mosques, and synagogues that had come out en masse to demand help for the people of Darfur [where in the mid-2000s a genocide erupted] were largely silent.\u201d Such a statement evinces the privilege of an individual who has no reason to fear the effects another Middle Eastern intervention might have on her own family\u2014or on the people of the Middle East.\n\nThe assumption running through Power\u2019s career is that the American empire is able to act as a force for good in the world. At her memoir\u2019s end\u2014and in the wake of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria\u2014she affirms that \u201con issue after issue, either the United States brought a game plan to the table or else the problem worsened.\u201d Though this might be true in some cases, it is certainly not the rule, especially when one considers the disastrous effects of the nation\u2019s wars in the Greater Middle East; its pointless antagonism of China, Russia, and Iran; its unwillingness to take the business-unfriendly steps required to arrest climate change; and its unhesitating promotion of a capitalist system that has exploited the labor of untold millions. The last several decades have taught us that the world needs far less American \u201cleadership\u201d than it has enjoyed.\n\nIf you accept Power\u2019s premises, then humanitarian intervention boils down to a purely philosophical inquiry: Is it right to save lives if one has the capacity to do so? The answer, of course, is yes. The problem, though, is that intervention is not a thought experiment; it takes place in a world of brutal realities. In particular, humanitarian forces confront radical uncertainty. Is intervention likely to impel more violence in the long term? Do policymakers actually know enough about the situation on the ground to make the \u201cright\u201d decisions? Is the American public willing to commit itself to years-long reconstruction efforts? Honest answers here may not sit well with idealism. In many instances, the most moral act is not to act at all.\n\nSimply maintaining an enormous military able to intervene anywhere in the world carries its own set of malign consequences: endless wars, global arms proliferation, a militaristic political culture, the diversion of resources from welfare to weapons, and the strengthening of the military-industrial complex, to name just a few. The Education of an Idealist does not account for these social ills, or consider that the only way we can avoid them is by giving up the capacities that enable us (theoretically, if not in practice) to alleviate foreign suffering.\n\nThe historian Samuel Moyn has warned that we must be careful not to elevate \u201cthe narrow and rare problem of when to send the military to help strangers into the decisive one around which the future of American foreign policy revolves.\u201d Power\u2019s memoir shows how much the discourse of humanitarian intervention obscures. By focusing on the question \u201cDo we save innocent lives?\u201d liberal interventionists like Power shift our attention from an equally important query: \u201cHow do we change conditions so lives don\u2019t need to be saved?\u201d A world oriented around this last question would look very different from the one we have now.", "description": "Samantha Power did not set out to justify war.", "authors": ["Daniel Bessner"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ffc08bc3b083fad88e91ddc291e2fcfde14e8d1d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
