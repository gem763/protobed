The pizza is eaten, the popcorn is popped, and now it's time to settle into the couch and put on a movie. When you ask the kids what they want to watch, the answer is always the same: \u201cSomething scary!\u201d But you\u2019re the one who has to deal with nightmares and future therapy bills, so you\u2019re not so sure. Thankfully, we\u2019ve rounded up 20 scary movies for kids that strike the right balance. There are definitely creepy elements in all of them (so you\u2019re not necessarily out of the no-nightmare woods), but they mostly keep it PG (though there\u2019s definitely a wide range of what was acceptable in a PG movie through the years, and we urge you to use your discretion based on your kid's maturity level).\n\nIn a way, these movies have the hardest job: it\u2019s much more difficult to scare someone using just their imagination, keeping the terrifying stuff off-screen. While you sit back and appreciate the directors\u2019 creativity, your kids will be chattering under their blanket. (Not worth it? Try one of the best kids' movies of all time, Halloween movies for kids or the best animated movies.)", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_CbtDR.0NMDtcv_ckGjZdQ--~B/aD0xNDEyO3c9MjEyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_561/6a9e4669b63b36dd3c49762f1945ba13", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
