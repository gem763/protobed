Photo: Jeremy Daniel\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with The Sound Inside\u2019s pedigree. It stars Mary-Louise Parker, whose strange air of iced-over agitation can be so magnetic onstage; it\u2019s directed by David Cromer, who knows his way around a new text. It comes to Broadway from Williamstown, where it was fed and watered carefully, and playwright Adam Rapp has done high-wire acts before: the lovely Red Light Winter and an old favorite of mine, Nocturne, in which a heartbroken young man talks us through his long experience with grief.\n\nRapp \u2014 often a television writer \u2014 started as a novelist, and you can hear that mode calling to him through his plays, whether he\u2019s using direct address or characters who wax poetic. But the impulse to explore nondramatic text has gotten clotted in The Sound Inside: There\u2019s too much self-consciousness, too much writing about writing. \u201cThat sounds like writing,\u201d the two characters will caution each other when something sounds too processed \u2014 in this incredibly processed-seeming play. And Lord knows it\u2019s dangerous to have your characters talking about technique. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful,\u201d one person says to the other about a bit of story in the show we are presently watching. Are we here to listen to the playwright give himself compliments? What an odd use of time.\n\nThe main compliment-giver is Bella Baird (Parker), a professor at Yale, who first appears isolated in a spotlight, introducing herself by drawing attention to how badly she\u2019s introducing herself. She would never tell her students to explain a character in such detail, she assures us, before telling us about her eating habits (steak once a month), her loneliness, her publishing history, and her late-diagnosed, fast-blooming cancer. Slowly, a set creeps forward out of the murk \u2014 Heather Gilbert\u2019s lighting design is a series of near blacknesses \u2014 and we see Baird flash back to meeting Christopher Dunn (Will Hochman), a needy creative-writing student who has come by during her office hours.\n\nThe characters and, indeed, the play itself make a fetish of books. At one point, Bella tells us she is sleeping with a typescript on her pillow, waking to embrace it in the morning. Christopher is such an awkward guy that he doesn\u2019t take his backpack off during their first meeting, perching forward uncomfortably on his seat, but he sometimes opens his hands in front of him in a graceful little gesture: He is always thinking about the sensation of opening a book. The play is similarly obsessed with narration. Bella speaks to us as frequently as she speaks to Christopher, so, for instance, while they\u2019re discussing his aversion to email, she turns to us to say, \u201cHe smiles. He suddenly looks impossibly young, like an oversized 14-year-old.\u201d Parker\u2019s voice \u2014 her great treasure as a performer \u2014 manages to sound both dryly amused and on the brink of some great revelation. But despite her gifts, this sort of story-theater method tends to sap the energy of a play. It becomes doubly soporific in this production, which is already plunged into unrelenting, sleepy dimness.\n\nThe world has conditioned us to find the scenario frightening: A boy shows up to insist that his female professor pay attention to him, bend the rules for him, admire him. Yet Bella is, perversely, intrigued because Christopher has said something provocative about Crime and Punishment. Most teachers would have long since pushed a panic button, but Bella encourages Christopher to tell her the plot of his new novel (giving us still more stretches of narrative), even after he has reeled off a list of suicidal authors, and she\u2019s flattered when he turns to the audience to relate the events of her novel (thus, a third nested story).\n\nThe tale Bella is telling about herself and the story Christopher is writing in his novel do eventually knot together. Her cancer leads her to desperation, and she asks terrible things of him, puts burdens on his shoulders that would crush any stranger. Only because they\u2019re such literarily determined characters \u2014 as opposed to people \u2014 do Bella and Christopher continue to have so much to say to each other. Rapp needs them to behave strangely, even inhumanly, so he can unspool one more heavily foreshadowed development that braids them together forever.\n\nIt\u2019s lucky, then, that the production has Mary-Louise Parker. She\u2019s quite odd as Bella, nervy but glacially unresponsive to her own end-of-life terror and blessedly able to convey the sensation of a thought happening in real time. She chooses to work the vein of the character\u2019s self-absorption, so we watch her turn inward, then inward again \u2014 a kind of implosion in real time. Her Bella sometimes so surprises herself with a turn of phrase that Cromer has her write it down on a little notepad, which is a welcome note of humor: They show us how a writer\u2019s narcissism can be a buffer against death itself. There will certainly be an audience for The Sound Inside because it\u2019s clever, if airless, and because it compliments itself and its audience by talking about writing in terms of surprise (which it contains) and menace (ditto). For those of us left alienated by its self-regard, at least there\u2019s always something to read.\n\nThe Sound Inside is at the Roundabout at Studio 54 through January 12.", "description": "Theater Review: Adam Rapp\u2019s \u2018The Sound Inside\u2019 on Broadway at the Roundabout With Mary-Louise Parker", "authors": ["Helen Shaw"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-the-sound-inside.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
