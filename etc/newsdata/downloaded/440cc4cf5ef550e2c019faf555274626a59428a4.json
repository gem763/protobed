General Assembly to review the progress made by the SAMOA Pathway, a U.N. program adopted in 2014 that aims to address the unique environmental concerns impacting small island developing states.\n\nMomoa called the experience \u201clife-changing\u201d in an Instagram post Friday.\n\n\u201cIt takes an amazing team and support system to pull off something like this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am deeply grateful to my wife and children, my mother.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Momoa talked about the impacts of ocean plastic pollution and rising sea levels.\n\n\u201cIsland nations contribute the least to this disaster, but are made to suffer the weight of its consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cOur governments and corporate entities have known for decades that immediate change is needed. Yet change still has not come.\u201d\n\nMomoa shared a video of his entire speech on Instagram, which he described as, \u201cNo BS. Nothing sugar coated, just straight from the heart.\u201d\n\nMomoa charged that humans are the \u201conly species willing to force disharmony with the natural balance of our world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the living consequence of forgotten traditions,\u201d he added.\n\nMomoa has been outspoken about the effects of climate change and ocean pollution on numerous occasions.\n\nLast month, he used his social media platform to help spread awareness about the fires across the Amazon rainforest to his roughly 13 million Instagram followers.\n\nBrazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research reported that the Amazon wildfires showed an 84% increase over the same period last year.\n\nWatch a video clip of his entire speech at the U.N. below:", "description": "The \"Aquaman\" star spoke \"straight from the heart\" on behalf of small island nations under threat from rising sea levels.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8f66582400005e00d3b9fe.jpeg?cache=prqmnat0cj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
