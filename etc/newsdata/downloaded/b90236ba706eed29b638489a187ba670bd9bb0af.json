USA TODAY\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 In addition to providing the usual video sessions and strategy discussions to prepare his team to meet the nation\u2019s No. 1 defensive team, Ohio State coach Ryan Day challenged his players like he never had before.\n\n\u201cBig-time players,\u201d he said more than once, \u201cstep up in big games.\u201d\n\nOhio State players said Day\u2019s message was in their heads Saturday during the No. 4 Buckeyes\u2019 38-7 win against No. 13 Wisconsin in a game that was played in miserable, rainy conditions.\n\n\u201cI think all of the big-time players on the team definitely stepped up and made great plays,\u201d said quarterback Justin Fields who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another.\n\nOhio State defensive lineman Chase Young sacks Wisconsin quarterback Jack Coan during the second quarter at Ohio Stadium.

J.K. Dobbins also rushed for 163 yards and two touchdowns. Chris Olave registered a pair of touchdown catches.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, I think we could have put up 50,\u201d Field said. \u201cI think if the weather was different I think we could have thrown the ball more and put up more points.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe the Buckeyes could be playing at higher level than they are now. They totaled 431 yards against a Wisconsin team that was giving up an average of 193 yards per games.\n\nSILVER LINING?: The one positive from Oklahoma's shocking loss\n\nThe Buckeyes haven\u2019t scored fewer than 34 points in a game this season, and their slimmest margin of victory is 24 points. Their personnel are the envy of most of the teams in the country.\n\n\u201cJ.K. ran with an edge all day,\u201d Day said. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best running back in the country.\u201d\n\nAfter surpassing 1,000 yards in the season, Dobbins is now the first running back in Ohio State history to reach that mark in each of his first three seasons. He\u2019s a hard-nosed runner, with the quickness to bounce outside and the moves to elude tacklers.\n\nOhio State players teased Dobbins in practice this week because Wisconsin boasted Jonathan Taylor who was leading Dobbins by 10 yards in the Big Ten rushing statistics.\n\n\u201cWe were messing with J.K. the whole week about the best Big Ten running back is coming to the Shoe,\u201d Fields said.\n\nDobbins responded by averaging 8.1 yards per carry. Taylor had 61 on the ground with a 2.6 yards per carry average. The Buckeyes are 15-0 when Dobbins rushes for 100 or more yards.\n\nMeanwhile, Young played like he super powers powers against Wisconsin. He now has 13.5 sacks this season and 15.5 tackles for losses.\n\n\"The best I\u2019ve been around,\u201d Day said. \u201cI had a chance to see Nick Bosa last year and I coached in the NFL and saw some really good players.\"\n\nFields sees Young in practice and he says he \u201cfeels bad\u201d for the quarterbacks who have to face him. \u201cHe can get back there pretty much whenever he wants,\u201d Fields said.\n\nYoung is projected to be a top pick in the 2020 NFL draft. As a former quarterback, Day said he can imagine how difficult it is to face young charging toward the pocket.\n\n\u201cYou start to feel ghosts and see ghosts, especially when he\u2019s on your backside,\u201d Day said. \u201cAre you getting the ball quick enough? The other part if a lot of times they have to put an extra guy in protection. If they go seven men on protection, only three guys on the route. So his impact is felt throughout the game schematically.\u201d\n\nThe Buckeyes seem to have so many talented players that it is challenging to scheme against all of them.\n\n\u201cWe have so many weapons on the offense and defense, but there\u2019s only one ball that goes around,\u201d Olave said. \u201cI had the big game today, but maybe in two weeks it could be K.J. Hill and won\u2019t have any catches. We try to be unselfish about it.\u201d\n\nDay said the strong performance in rainy conditions showed \u201chow tough and gritty we can play.\u201d\n\nHe added that it shows \u201cwe have the capability to play with anybody in the country.\n\nFields was knocked around often by the rugged Badgers defense. \"It may not show it statistically, but he had as gritty of a game as anybody on our team,\" Day said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go unnoticed that the Buckeyes\u2019 impressive performance came with former Ohio State coaching legend Urban Meyer in the house, working as a television analyst. He interviewed Day after the game.\n\n\"Boy, it\u2019s hard to follow up a guy who is one of the best college football coaches in the history of the game,\u201d Day said. \u201cIt just is.\u201d", "description": "Ohio State has more big-time players than most programs.
