It may continue to govern the country alone after this weekend, but smaller parties are making gains.\n\nDr Jaros\u0142aw Flis, a sociologist at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, thinks smaller parties will possibly play a part as kingmakers.\n\n\u201cWhat will be the most interesting on the election evening is what will be the position of the fourth and fifth parties because it can determine who will be able to build the majority after the election,\u201d he said.\n\nPoland has been pushed to the right as the ruling party clamped down on press freedoms and some of the checks and balances on power, which not everyone agrees with.\n\nThis year's election campaign saw personal attacks on candidates, as well as issues that have stoked tensions with the main opposition coalition.\n\nRobert Biedro\u0144, leader of opposition party Wiosna (Spring), said: \u201cWe want a Poland that is open, modern and tolerant. Equal opportunities in Poland, not party politics but competence and skills are the keys to its success. This is the vision of our Poland - a modern welfare state.\u201d\n\nAnother opposition leader with the Civic Coalition is Grzegorz Schetyna. He said the current ruling party needs to go.\n\n\u201cThe reconstruction of the Polish school, the reconstruction of Polish diplomacy and the army, the creation of modern health protection, the reconstruction of the Civil Service, the reconstruction and improvement of independent courts - this is a precise diagnosis of the catastrophe in which Poland plunged (under) Kaczy\u0144ski's rule,\u201d he said.\n\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski is the leader of PiS and is widely expected to win Sunday's vote.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to build a Polish version of the welfare state. We must in this term and with God\u2019s help if society supports us - we focus primarily on wage increases.\u201d\n\nA party will need 231 seats to govern with an outright majority in Poland and preliminary results will be known on Sunday at 9 pm CEST.\n\nWatch Good Morning Europe's report in the player above.", "description": "The ruling Law and Justice Party may continue to govern alone after this weekend's election in Poland, but smaller parties are making gains.", "authors": ["Joao Vitor Da Silva Marques"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/36/62/1000x563_cmsv2_673fa48a-5be8-59b1-885a-443befb14bef-4223662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
