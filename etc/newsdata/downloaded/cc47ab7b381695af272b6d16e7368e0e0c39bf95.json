Levy's character, David Rose, is pansexual \u2014 meaning he's open to all sexual orientations and gender identities \u2014 and as such, became among the first depicted on television.\n\nThe character's sexual orientation was explained in the show's first season (using a metaphor of wine) and has been widely commended since for being written with acceptance and without homophobia.\n\n\"I like the wine, and not the label,\" Levy's character famously responds after being asked about it in one of the episodes.\n\n\"I like the wine and not the label.\" Happy Pride from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SchittsCreek?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SchittsCreek</a>! \ud83c\udf08 <a href=\"https://t.co/Bj0xicDlvu\">pic.twitter.com/Bj0xicDlvu</a> \u2014@SchittsCreek\n\nSchitt's Creek cast members Annie Murphy (Alexis Rose), Emily Hampshire (Stevie Budd) and Noah Reid (Patrick Brewer) presented the award.\n\nLevy, who has experienced a steady rise in Hollywood since Schitt's Creek became available in the U.S. through Netflix, signed a three-year deal with Disney's ABC studios recently to develop and produce projects. He took home an MTV Award in June for best comedic performance.\n\nThe Canadian has participated in fundraising efforts to support GLAAD. Previous winners of the Davidson/Valenti award include CNN host Don Lemon and singer-songwriter Adam Lambert.\n\nOnstage, Levy credited a supportive network of friends and family for giving him the courage to come out during his teenage years.\n\n\"Had I not had the love to give me a sense of security, I don't know if I would have found my way out of the closet, let alone create the opportunity for myself to tell stories on television that have effected some kind of positive change in the world,\" he told the audience.\n\n\"Support, encouragement and love: Three relatively simple acts of kindness that can change the course of a person's life.\"\n\nSchitt's Creek scored a Canadian Screen Award earlier this year for best comedy series. Its sixth and final season will begin airing in January.", "description": "Canadian Dan Levy, showrunner and star of the TV comedy Schitt's Creek, received a GLAAD award Saturday evening in San Francisco for promoting acceptance of the LGBTQ community.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301875.1569739063!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1171863224.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
