In June, after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone, Trump initially endorsed a retaliatory military strike then abruptly called it off because he said it would have killed dozens of Iranians.\n\nOn Friday, he left the door open a bit for a later military response, saying people thought he'd attack Iran \"within two seconds,\" but, he said, he has \"plenty of time.\"\n\nDuring the Friday meeting, U.S. National Security leaders will present Trump with a broad range of military, economic and diplomatic options to consider as he decides how the U.S. should respond to what administration officials say was an unprecedented Iranian attack on Saudi oil facilities. The options will include an updated list of potential military strike targets inside Iran. But Pentagon leaders will also warn that military action against the Islamic Republic could escalate into war, according to U.S. officials familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAny decision may depend on what kind of evidence the U.S. and Saudi investigators are able to provide proving that the cruise missile and drone strike was launched by Iran, as a number of officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have asserted.\n\nIran has denied involvement and warned the U.S. that any attack will spark an \"all-out war\" with immediate retaliation from Tehran.\n\nPompeo and Vice President Mike Pence have condemned the attack on Saudi oil facilities as \"an act of war.\" Pence said Trump will \"review the facts, and he'll make a decision about next steps. But the American people can be confident that the United States of America is going to defend our interest in the region, and we're going to stand with our allies.\"\n\nThe U.S. response could involve military, political and economic actions, and the military options could range from no action at all to airstrikes or less visible moves such as cyberattacks. One likely move would be for the U.S. to provide additional military support to help Saudi Arabia defend itself from attacks from the north, since most of its defenses have focused on threats from Houthis in Yemen to the south.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized to a small number of journalists traveling with him Monday that the question of whether the U.S. responds is a \"political judgment\" and not for the military.\n\n\"It is my job to provide military options to the president should he decide to respond with military force,\" Dunford said.\n\nTrump will want \"a full range of options,\" he said. \"In the Middle East, of course, we have military forces there and we do a lot of planning and we have a lot of options.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said in an interview Thursday that if Trump \"chooses an option that involves a significant military strike on Iran that, given the current climate between the U.S. and Iran, there is a possibility that it could escalate into a medium to large-scale war, I believe the president should come to Congress.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump signaled Friday that he's not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike on Iran in response to the attacks on the Saudi oil industry, saying he believes showing restraint \"shows far more strength\" and he wants to avoid an all-out war.
