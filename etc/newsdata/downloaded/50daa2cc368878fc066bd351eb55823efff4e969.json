She then served much of a 15-year sentence on terrorism charges, which she says were politically motivated.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Kigali as she arrived at a hearing in the case of nine other people from her party who face terrorism-related charges, Ingabire called on security services to \u201cdo something about those killings and protect the opposition members as all Rwandans\u201d.\n\nDusabumuremyi was at least the second of Ingabire\u2019s aides to be killed this year.\n\nOn 15 July 2019, Eug\u00e8ne Ndereyimana, another member of FDU-Inkingi, was reported missing by his colleagues when he failed to show up for a meeting in Nyagatare in Rwanda\u2019s Eastern province, and in March the body of Ingabire\u2019s spokesman was found on the edge of the Gishwati forest in March after he disappeared while travelling to visit his parents.\n\nLast year Boniface Twagirimana, FDU-Inkingi\u2019s vice-president, was reported to have escaped from Mpanga prison, a maximum-security jail in the southern Nyanza district, but has not been seen since. Human rights campaigners say the circumstances of his alleged escape suggest he may have been abducted and killed.\n\nRwanda\u2019s Khashoggi: who killed the exiled spy chief? Read more\n\nKagame\u2019s government came under international scrutiny in 2014 when the president\u2019s former spy chief Patrick Karegeya was found strangled in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nKaregeya took charge of Rwanda\u2019s foreign intelligence services for a decade, until he fell into disgrace. He was jailed twice, in 2005 and 2006.\n\nSouth African prosecutors said they found \u201cclose links\u201d between the murder suspects and Kagame\u2019s government. Rwanda has always denied the allegations.\n\nSouth Africa has asked Rwanda to extradite two men suspected of murdering Karegeya, in a move likely to sour relations between the two countries.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters seen earlier this year outside the Rwandan embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, calling for an investigation into the killing of Patrick Karegeya. Photograph: Alexander Joe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKagame forcefully denied any human rights abuses in Rwanda earlier this year, calling criticism \u201cabsolute rubbish\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou [in Europe] really need to stop this superiority complex nonsense about human rights,\u201d Kagame told France24. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the only ones who respect human rights, and all others it\u2019s about violating human rights. No, we have fought for human rights and freedoms of our people much better, and more than anyone including you people who keep talking about this nonsense.\u201d\n\nIn September last year, 2,000 prisoners were released, including Ingabire. Human rights organisations welcomed this, saying it showed that \u201cRwanda may be turning a new leaf\u201d, but said the arrests, executions, disappearances and torture would have to end to prove that the change was meaningful.\n\nDespite some discontent over unemployment and other domestic issues, and a controversial reputation overseas, Kagame appears to be genuinely popular in Rwanda.\n\nSome observers have questioned the reliability of the economic statistics showing growth. Others allege that increasing cronyism could undermine economic progress.", "description": "Victoire Ingabire fears murder of party official was attempt to deter rivals to president", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c78882c15544a8c91ea5257d1c4447560ca611/569_118_3791_2275/master/3791.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0df39e42d2cb24cb5efeac6cad5a5a5e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
