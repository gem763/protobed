REUTERS/Russell Boyce\n\nUnder current rules, introduced by former prime minister Theresa May when she was interior minister, students are only allowed to stay for four months after they finish their degree.\n\n\u201cThe important contribution international students make to our country and universities is both cultural and economic. Their presence benefits Britain,\u201d Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur universities thrive on being open global institutions. Introducing the graduate route ensures our prestigious higher education sector will continue to attract the best talent from around the world to global Britain.\u201d\n\nThe government said the new graduate route would enable students to work, or look for work, at any skill level. They could then switched to a skilled work visa if they found a job that met the requirements.\n\nThere will not be a cap on the number of students who can apply for the graduate route, it said. There are about 450,000 international students a year studying in Britain.\n\nIt will apply to those who start an undergraduate level or above course from next year in any subject at \u201ca trusted UK university or higher education provider which has a proven track record in upholding immigration checks\u201d.\n\n\u201cAbout time. Should have reversed this silly policy years ago. Britain should always be open to the best talent from across the world,\u201d finance minister Sajid Javid said on Twitter.\n\nBut with concerns over levels of immigration a key driver behind Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the European Union, the move was not universally welcomed.\n\nMigration Watch, which campaigns for less immigration, said it was a \u201cretrograde step\u201d which would lead to foreign students staying in Britain to carry out low-skilled jobs.\n\n\u201cThe government only seems to come up with ideas for how to increase immigration,\u201d it said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOur universities are attracting a record number of overseas students. There is no need to devalue a study visa by turning it into a backdoor route for working here.\u201d", "description": "International students will be able to stay in Britain looking for work for up to two years after they graduate under new rules announced by the government on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428635496&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0NI", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
