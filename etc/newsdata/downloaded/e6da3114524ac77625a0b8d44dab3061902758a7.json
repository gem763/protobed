It\u2019s possible that the bleeding isn\u2019t over yet and investors will likely wait for the 4-hour and daily close before making any strong moves.\n\nMany traders anticipated a decisive move occurring sooner than later simply based on the fact that Bitcoin has been bouncing around in the $7,800 to $8,300 range since Sept. 26 and the digital asset\u2019s consistent failure to sustain above $8,200 to $8,300 suggested that momentum was waning.\n\nLet\u2019s explore several reasons that caused the price of Bitcoin to suddenly plunge today.\n\n1. Technicals: support finally gives after 9th try\n\nSince dropping from $9,500 on Sept. 24, Bitcoin has dropped below $7,800 on eight separate occasions and today\u2019s price dump is the ninth. So from a technical point of view, Bitcoin was already biased towards bears on the short-term timeframe and this bias has also steadily increased on the longer time frames.\n\nToday\u2019s price dump liquidated $200 million worth of leveraged longs at BitMEX. According to twitter analyst \u201ctaiwandan\u201d the Bitcoin liquidation at BitMEX could have begun with a 3,600 BTC sale at Bitstamp. Taiwandan said that \u201cevery bid from $7,800 to $6,200 wiped out in less than 15 minutes.\u201d\n\nBitMEX XBT USD Liquidations.

Mr. Zuckerberg goes to Washington\n\nSimilar to traditional markets, the crypto sector is heavily influenced by media and it\u2019s possible that recent news might have exacerbated the shock to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nToday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is testifying before U.S. lawmakers about the Libra project, political ads, and the proliferation of fake news on the platform. It seems every time the U.S. Congress discusses cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s price drops.\n\nAdding to the fear, on Oct. 22, U.S. congresswoman Sylvia Garcia presented a draft bill proposing that all stablecoin be categorized as securities. If passed into law, all stablecoins and their issuers would fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n3. Google\u2019s quantum breakthrough spooks Bitcoin investors?\n\nAdditional news that could be impacting Bitcoin\u2019s price is Google\u2019s announcement that a quantum computing breakthrough has enabled one of its machines to carry out tasks that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years to execute.\n\nQuantum computers solving complex algorithms seem to make investors nervous that the Bitcoin network is under threat and it\u2019s possible that some crypto investors jumped ship as the story circulated through the New York Times, Bloomberg and crypto media.\n\nClearly, a lot is happening during a short time span and this is weighing on Bitcoin\u2019s price. Let\u2019s take a brief look at the charts to see what might happen next.\n\nBTC price double top hinted at today\u2019s drop\n\nBitcoin formed a double top at $8,312 and this was a sign that a reversal was on the cards. Previously, bulls defended $7,800 and buyers consistently stepped in to prevent the price from dipping below this point.\n\nBut today\u2019s sell-off broke through the $7,800 and $7,500 support. The 111 Daily Moving Average (DMA) still appears en route to cross below the 128 DMA and today\u2019s downside break pulled the price far below the 20-MA of the Bollinger Band indicator.\n\nBTC USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nPrior to the break, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator was trending upward on the daily time frame whereas Bitcoin price had descended since Oct. 11.\n\nOne could also argue that the head and shoulders pattern on the daily was completed and repeated failure to break above $8,300 increased the chance that BTC price would take the southern route.\n\nTo reverse the trend, bulls need to push the price to $8,225, $8,600 and $8,800 to set a higher high. The $8,600 mark also aligns with the upper arm of the Bollinger Band indicator and above the $8,200 to $8,400 resistance zone. Then the volume profile visible range shows open-air until $9,300, which would also place price above the 111 and 128-DMA.\n\nTelltale signs of today\u2019s drop were a tightening range over the past 3 weeks, decreasing volume and a bearish weekly MACD and (Relative Strength Index) RSI.\n\nDay traders will attempt to play both sides of Bitcoin\u2019s interim chop, while swing traders are likely licking their chops and eyeballing the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the weekly time frame as it is this price point that has three things going for it:\n\nSome traders have pointed to the importance of variations (100, 111, 128, 200) of the weekly moving averages; this could be a make it or break it point for Bitcoin.\n\nBTC USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nThe 50% Fibonacci retracement level is an important point with support reaching all the way back to March 26, 2018. BTC spent a lot of time in the $6,000 to $6,500 zone so a drop to this level could serve as strong support.\n\nBTC USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nThe VPVR also shows demand at the $6,000 to $6,500 zone so it could at least provide a strong oversold bounce or two for interim traders, and if price settles in this region investors will be looking to open leveraged longs from this price.\n\nAcross multiple time frames Bitcoin appears to be in bear territory but some traders see a silver lining in the current scenario.\n\nFor example, veteran trader and crypto analyst Scott Melker hinted that the 4-hour chart appears to suggest a reversal could be in order. Melker identifies a possible bullish divergence taking place on the 4-hour and daily timeframe.\n\nBTC USD 4-hr chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nBTC USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nIf Bitcoin price can find support at $7,300 to $7,400 after a few 4-hour candle closes, traders may be induced to re-enter long positions. The 4-hour chart also shows that the RSI and Stoch RSI are deeply oversold so an oversold bounce could be in play before the daily candle closes.\n\nUltimately, similar drops in Bitcoin price occurred at $12,500, $9,400, $8,300 and now $8,000.\n\nOften, BTC price seemingly settles on the 4-hour timeframe before plummeting even harder so traders are advised to approach with caution and wait for further confirmation that a bottom has been reached before making their move.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
