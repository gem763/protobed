He is also a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, among other accomplishments.\n\nOne of his first votes in Congress was to pass the Voting Rights act of 1965 and he spent his entire life fighting to \u201censure every citizen could vote [and] have their voice heard,\u201d said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\n\u201cMay we all carry that cause forward and continue the fight for a fair, accessible and secure democracy,\u201d she said via Twitter.\n\nHis career, however, came to a dramatic and abrupt end in December 2017, when he retired amid allegations of sexual harassment, which he denied. He stepped down following calls for him to do so from then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and then-Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cMy legacy can\u2019t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,\u201d Conyers said at that time. \u201cThis, too, shall pass.\u201d\n\nFollowing news of his death, Democrats took to social media in mourning, with Rashid Tlaib, a Michigan congresswoman, calling Conyers \u201cour Congressman forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never once wavered in fighting for jobs, justice and peace,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe always knew where he stood on issues of equality and civil rights in the fight for the people.
