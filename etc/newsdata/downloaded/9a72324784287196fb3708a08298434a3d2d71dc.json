The Maine hamlet of Jerusalem\u2019s Lot, first dreamed up by the master of the macabre as a feral vampire stronghold, contends with a more earthbound set of problems in its newest iteration. The opioid epidemic sweeping New England has seeped into town, driving area pharmacists to install locked glass cases for select products. More pressing still is the mounting tension in town between the Somalian immigrant community and the largely Caucasian local populace, each distrustful and fearful of the other. The impending turf war reflects a widening cultural divide in American life, as xenophobic sentiments gain traction with an increasingly vocal faction of reactionaries.\n\nThe best Stephen King movies \u2026 ranked!

He politely praises the variety of the novelist\u2019s writing, the smoothness with which stories set in our own reality drift into more \u201cbatshit crazy\u201d dimensions. But the 60-year-old actor really gets animated when conversation turns to the more broadly political subtext of the show, about tribalism and the average suburb as a battleground in the culture wars.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a metaphorical element to this town, as a stand-in for small towns all over America,\u201d Robbins tells the Guardian from a hotel suite overlooking Central Park South, and from there he\u2019s off. He\u2019s fine with talking showbiz \u2013 but he\u2019s got bigger things on his mind.\n\nCrime and punishment \u2013 their arbitrary definitions, the imperfect methods by which they\u2019re put into practice \u2013 have taken up more of Robbins\u2019 waking thought as of late. He sees jumping-off points for larger debates everywhere in his work. Musing on the show\u2019s depiction of a widespread drug addiction, Robbins says: \u201cWe live in a society that has purposefully criminalized drug use as a punishment.\u201d He recently directed a documentary to this effect, using the feature 45 Seconds of Laughter to chronicle his time spent teaching prison inmates commedia dell\u2019arte as unconventional therapy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Robbins in Castle Rock. Photograph: Dana Starbard/Hulu\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with guys serving life sentences for possession of marijuana based on the three-strikes law,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWhen I was doing Shawshank, I talked to the actual prison guards working as extras and asked them what they would change about criminal justice if they could change anything. Most of them said they\u2019d legalize marijuana, which really surprised me at the time. The guards were saying it\u2019d make their jobs so much easier, it\u2019d make more space in facilities. Then they said that if you don\u2019t have the courage to do that, at least organize inmates by violent and non-violent offenders. A lot of these prisoners are kids sentenced to one or two years, and because there\u2019s a one-and-a-half-year waiting list for GED and job training programs, we\u2019re putting these kids into what they called \u2018crime school\u2019. They saw what growing up incarcerated does to a child.\u201d\n\nThe constant throughline of Robbins\u2019 career has been the marriage of his activist bona fides with his chosen work. His directorial debut, Bob Roberts, took a bite out of early 90s conservative doctrine, imagining a charlatan who charms the GOP with faux-lksy wisdom. (When asked where Bob Roberts would be in 2019, Robbins shrugs. \u201cMaybe he\u2019d be in the White House.\u201d) Robbins hopes that his next film, Todd Haynes\u2019 legal drama Dark Waters, will \u201cstart a dialogue about corporate crime, and institutions versus individuals\u201d. And he seems to be capable of steering any particular aspect of Castle Rock to something wider and more meaningful.\n\nIn King\u2019s predilection for haunted native burial grounds, Robbins sees a painful awareness of national sin. \u201cIn the world of Stephen King, physical spaces are haunted by the ghosts of the past,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you see the James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro? One of my favorite movies of the past few years. One of the things that still resonates with me was Baldwin talking about how we\u2019ll never be right as a society until we learn to truly accept responsibility. People need to understand their own history.\u201d\n\nHe illustrates that notion with The New Colossus, an original play from Robbins and his theater company, the Actors\u2019 Gang. With 12 actors from twelve different parts of the world speaking twelve different languages, they tell the story of \u201ctheir ancestors\u2019 journeys from oppression to freedom.\u201d The performance comes with discourse built right in, as Robbins and the actors speak after the show with the audience about themes of immigration and national identity. They ask for a show of hands on a series of questions \u2013 who\u2019s an immigrant, who has immigrant parents, grandparents \u2013 designed to expose how much we all have in common.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption.

That\u2019s the character of our country. People saying: \u2018No, I will not accept the world I\u2019m living in.\u2019 It\u2019s having that moral strength, then having the physical strength to actually leave and make a dangerous journey. And then, once you\u2019re here, having the strength to build a life from scratch. This is America\u2019s DNA. The servants at Jamestown who jumped over the wall and said that they didn\u2019t want to starve while a bunch of aristocrats had so much, they were Americans.\u201d\n\nTheater has given Robbins an creative avenue that splits the difference between his passions for entertaining and taking direct action. He\u2019s taken a stage production of Nineteen Eighty-Four to Hong Kong and Colombia, where Orwell\u2019s subtext all but overtakes the story on the surface. He penned a play called Harlequino: On to Freedom and got censored in China \u2013 not for the rabble-rousing anti-establishment content leading Shanghai crowds to bursts of spontaneous applause, but for a handful of off-color phallic jokes.\n\nCan someone so dialed-in to the ills of the world, someone unable to stop thinking about all that is wrong, still find cause for optimism? Robbins is a subscriber to the old maxim to think globally and act locally: \u201cIn order to not be living in frustration about things you can\u2019t change, it\u2019s important to find something that you can change. It might just be in your own life, but that\u2019s the first step.\u201d It helps to section off time to get away from \u201cthe keyboard reality\u201d, as he calls it, where the buffer of a laptop screen allows for too much \u201chatred in the abstract\u201d.\n\nMostly, though, he\u2019s staying in his lane and plugging away at the work of bettering what he can better. \u201cOur time has great potential for change,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s just that the power resisting that change is pervasive.\u201d The age-old struggle continues, in other words, and he\u2019ll continue to stake out his own little corner of it. Whether dispelling specters for Stephen King or bringing commentary to the four corners of the globe, he\u2019s staying on his beat without taking his eyes off the big picture.", "description": "The actor, director and activist talks about his return to the Stephen King universe and his frustrations with the state of the US", "authors": ["Charles Bramesco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/640cbe9583f9ed1d382200b62779054baebc423b/345_98_5076_3047/master/5076.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c1258c68b7c2618f1c211478cadcaf5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
