She reported that EMS was responding. She also said that more calls of more shooting were coming in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a shooter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got shots fired on the line, 911.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have an active shooter?\u201d a cop inquired.\n\n\u201cThe shooter left in a vehicle, Toyota, westbound on I-20,\u201d the dispatcher replied.\n\n\u201cWhat is the status of the trooper?\u201d another cop inquired.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working on the trooper right now,\u201d somebody radioed from the scene. \u201cHe is talking and responsive. They\u2019re going to transport the trooper.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher repeated, \u201cShooter in a Toyota headed westbound,\u201d adding, \u201ctoward Odessa.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher then announced, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a gunshot victim at marker 126.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have EMS on that one too?\u201d somebody inquired.\n\nA second ambulance was indeed on the way to mile marker 126 as the wounded trooper was loaded into the first one at mile marker 131.\n\n\u201cThey're transporting the trooper to the Memorial now,\u201d the dispatcher said meaning Midland Memorial Hospital. \u201cThe trooper is en route to the ER.\u201d\n\nSomebody asked the status of the other gunshot victim.\n\n\u201cHe was shot in the gut, left lower gut,\u201d a cop at the scene reported. \u201cTroopers are working on him right now.\u201d\n\nMore reports of more shooting were coming in and one of the emergency response operators was apparently having trouble keeping up\n\n\u201cDispatch... we have multiple lines, multiple gunshot victims. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d\n\nA field supervisor warned the responding paramedics over the air, \u201cEMS...Make sure you got your vest handy.\u201d\n\nGangs often do drive-by shootings and there have been serial shooters who periodically fire at random motorists one or two at a time. But this was a mass shooter committing mayhem on the move.\n\n\u201cWe have an active shooter on the interstate,\u201d a cop said.\n\nA moment later, the dispatcher reported, \u201cThere's another gunshot victim at mile marker 125.\u201d\n\nAnd then, \u201cGot another gunshot victim at 129. We need an ambulance at 129.\u201d\n\nAn EMS supervisor instructed an ambulance to go to \u201canother gunshot victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d a voice replied. \u201cI have four of them on I-20 right now. We\u2019re getting multiple calls for multiple victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got one in a ditch,\u201d somebody said.\n\nA cop offered a warning.\n\n\u201cAll units...Looks like a .223 round, long rifle.\u201d\n\nThat meant likely an assault rifle, which would make this mass shooter not so different than other shooters in terms of weaponry. A cop reported on a truck driver who had been found beyond saving.\n\n\u201cGunshot wound to the head of this victim in his 18- wheeler,\u201d the cop reported. \u201cHe is DOS [dead on the scene.]\u201d\n\nThe cop advised, \u201cThere is a gentleman going up and down the interstate right now shooting people. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d\n\nAnother report came from where three people had been shot.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve loaded two, headed to the ER. We\u2019re now waiting for an ambulance\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother gunshot victim,\u201d another voice said.\n\n\u201cAnother gunshot shot victim,\u201d yet another voice said. \u201cWe got a gunshot victim walking around, shot in the arm.\u201d\n\nA police supervisor radioed an order.\n\n\u201cAnybody in the direction where this guy\u2019s possibly headed, I need you to get civilians to cover immediately. I need you to gear up with hard plate [body armor] if you have them, long guns if you got it, but most important, get civilians to cover.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the direction, the direction the suspect is heading?\u201d somebody asked.\n\n\u201cThe last update I got, Odessa,\u201d the supervisor replied \u201cIn case he goes that way, protect your civilians.\u201d\n\nAn EMS crew reported. \u201cBringing another gunshot victim to your location in critical condition.\u201d\n\nAnother EMS member radioed, \u201cMy victim said it was a passenger vehicle with a long barrel sticking out the passenger window.\u201d\n\nSomebody reported that the suspect might now be in a different vehicle.\n\n\u201cA mail truck,\u201d she said, going on emphasize, \u201ca m-a-i-l truck.\u201d\n\nOne alarmed cop radioed for the whole city of Midland to be put on lockdown.\n\n\u201cGet on the news media, shut down Midland,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Midland was east.\n\n\u201cMail truck last seen heading westbound...toward Odessa,\u201d the dispatcher noted.\n\n\u201cWe just got a report of another gunshot victim at mile marker 126,\u201d a voice said.\n\n\u201cDo you have a victim at mile marker 126?\u201d somebody else inquired.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s affirmative,\u201d a third person replied.\n\nThen came a report of shooting the Cinergy cinema and entertainment center in Odessa.\n\n\u201cSounds like there\u2019s shots inside,\u201d a cop radioed.\n\n\u201cYou said there are shots inside?\u201d a supervisor asked \u201cGo! Go! Go! Don't wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaser tag area of Cinergy has been cleared,\u201d a cop reported.\n\n\u201cLaser tag is not cleared,\u201d somebody reported\n\nSo many more victims had already been taken to the hospital in Odessa that ambulances were instructed to take any others to Midland, which was also full, but was preparing to fly the overflow to Lubbock.\n\n\u201cBring the patients to Midland Memorial,\u201d an official said on the radio. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a helicopter coming \u2026We\u2019ll start flying them out.\u201d\n\nA voice came on to remind everybody to be on the lookout for the U.S. Postal Service van.\n\n\u201cActive shooting!\u201d a Midland cop radioed a moment later. \u201cShots fired right now... Suspect vehicle went westbound\u201d\n\nThe cop then cried, \u201cI\u2019m hit! I\u2019m hit. Headquarters, I\u2019m hit!\u201d\n\nA moment later, a Midland cop who identified himself by his number, began shouting into his radio.\n\n\u201c1456. SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!\n\nThe cops then reported, \u201cHe just left the vehicle behind Cinergy.\u201d\n\nA supervisor called for the armored car, saying, \u201cGet Bearcat toward Cinergy.\u201d\n\nThe officer who gave identified himself as 1456, reported he had officers from the Odessa Police Department and the Department of Public Safety with him.\n\n\u201cDo we have any other shooters we\u2019re looking for right now?\u201d a supervisor asked.\n\n\u201cNegative,\u201d 1456 replied.\n\n\u201cGive me a status on your people,\u201d the supervisor said.\n\n1456 was so adrenalized that his response is hard to make out in the recording, but he seemed to say everybody was okay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to push on,\u201d 1456 then said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be in a rush,\u201d the supervisor advised. \u201cMake sure you got plenty of personnel and plenty of coverage. We don\u2019t need to rush up on this.\u201d\n\nThe radio was filled with excited shouts.\n\n\u201cAny available units, we have civilians, they\u2019re in a bad crossfire,\u201d a cop reported. \u201cWe need them out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the shooter at?\u201d somebody asked.\n\n1456 returned to the the air, calmer, clearer.\n\n\u201cThe shooter that I shot at, shot is behind Cinergy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re checking on him now. I believe he\u2019s going to be DOS.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne suspect\u2019s down, in custody,\u201d somebody said, reiterating, \u201cOne guy\u2019s been shot, and he\u2019s down.\u201d\n\nSomebody added, \u201cSuspect wearing an orange shirt. White male, behind Cinergy.\u201d\n\nJust under an hour after that first report, it was over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need one more ambulance,\u201d a voice said.\n\nSeven people were killed and nearly 20 people were injured. Three cops had been wounded.
