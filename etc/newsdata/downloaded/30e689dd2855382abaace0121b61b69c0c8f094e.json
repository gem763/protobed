Students burned her book.", "language": "en", "text": "A Latina author challenged students at Georgia Southern University to think about their whiteness. Some of them refused, and burned copies of her book instead. And it\u2019s 2019.\n\nJennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet, an author and professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, was at the university to give a talk for a reading series for first-year students. Her book, Make Your Home Among Strangers, is about a Hispanic girl from a poor family who has been accepted into a selective college in New York.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session, some students questioned why the author had been critical of white people.\n\n\u201cI noticed that you made a lot of generalizations about the majority of white people being privileged,\u201d one student said, according to the student newspaper, The George-Anne.\n\nThe topic is uncomfortable: White racism course causes controversy at Florida university\n\nCap\u00f3 Crucet later tweeted that some people had made \"aggressive & ignorant comments\" during the question-and-answer session. One white student, she said in a statement, \"questioned whether I had the authority to address issues of race and white privilege on campus.\" Students in the room began shouting at each other, she said, until she asked faculty to follow up with the questioner and other students who were upset.\n\nSome students apparently walked out of the talk and congregated nearby. At one point, Cap\u00f3 Crucet said, students were waiting outside of her hotel, so the university changed her accommodations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how or when, but students started burning the author\u2019s books, which was chronicled by social media postings:\n\nso after our FYE book\u2019s author came to my school to talk about it... these people decide to burn her book because \u201cit\u2019s bad and that race is bad to talk about\u201d. white people need to realize that they are the problem and that their privilege is toxic. author is a woman of color. pic.twitter.com/HiX4lGT7Ci \u2014 elaina\u2b50\ufe0f (@elainaaan) October 10, 2019\n\nThe George-Anne also posted pictures of students criticizing Cap\u00f3 Crucet for making comments critical of \u201cwhite people.\u201d Many students said they disagreed with the actions of those burning the books.\n\nJohn Lester, a vice president of communications at the university, wrote in an email the incident was within the students' First Amendment rights. But, he said, \"book burning does not align with Georgia Southern\u2019s values nor does it encourage the civil discourse and debate of ideas.\"\n\nA second event was canceled at the request of the author's representative, Lester said.\n\nRussell Willerton, chair of the university's department of writing and linguistics, said his department had disavowed the incident. \"We were compelled to show our support for Prof. Crucet, to call our students to handle their frustrations in better ways, and to say that the actions of a few do not represent the Georgia Southern University that we are proud to serve.\"\n\nDespite the response from some students, Cap\u00f3 Crucet said others told her they could relate to the protagonist in the book and were thankful Georgia Southern had assigned it.\n\n\"To think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story \u2014effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space \u2014feels devastating,\" she said in a statement released Friday.\n\nThe student body at Georgia Southern University is 63% white, about a quarter black and 6% Hispanic, according to data from the federal government.\n\nBook burning has long been considered one of the most aggressive forms of anti-intellectualism, a reputation earned in part by similar activities that took place nearly a century ago in Nazi Germany. College campuses, in contrast, pride themselves on their openness to intellectual diversity.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped conservatives from accusing college campuses of political indoctrination. In fact, about 3 in 4 Republicans say colleges protect students from views they might find offensive, according to a recent report from the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn recent years, protesters on college campuses have shut down conservative speakers in high-profile incidents that added fuel to those concerns. Among the most prominent was a speech at the University of California at Berkeley by Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right provocateur. In that case, protesters broke windows, a fire was set, and police broke up the gathering.", "description": "A Latina author challenged students at Georgia Southern University to think about white privilege.
