Literally nothing.\n\nIt has become a sad routine to watch politicians salivate over violent carnage in America in order to push their bizarre agenda of depriving citizens of their right to protect themselves, their families and their neighbors \u2014 from exactly the violent carnage they claim to cry about.\n\nFailed Senate candidate Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke desperately tries to breathe life into his flailing mess of a presidential campaign by vowing to send armed government agents door to door rounding up the guns of law-abiding innocent citizens.\n\nIt is hard to understand how a politician could have such a dark, rotten soul that they would choose to exploit such tragedies for their own personal, political gain, especially when it is schoolchildren who have been slaughtered. The only possible explanation is that these politicians are so deeply heartless because they didn\u2019t personally know any of the dead.\n\nTurns out, that doesn\u2019t matter either.\n\nTwice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton knew Rep. Elijah Cummings personally, yet still chose to exploit his funeral as an opportunity to score political points on national television last week.\n\nIn an utterly classless \u201ceulogy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton made a barely veiled reference to President Trump as the wicked King Ahab from the Bible.\n\n\u201cLike that Old Testament prophet, [Rep. Cummings] stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel and looked out for the vulnerable among us. He lifted up the next generation of leaders. He even worked a few miracles. And he kept reminding us life is no dress rehearsal. The American people want to live their lives without fear of their leaders.\u201d\n\nNot sure who Queen Jezebel is in this strange passage. But nobody had any doubts about who King Ahab was.\n\nHer bitterness runs fathoms deep.\n\nPerhaps no display of political exploitation was more disgusting than the reaction of House Democrats to the thrilling news that ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi blew himself up after U.S. special operations forces cornered him in Syria.\n\nThis is a heinous butcher who raped women and girls, ripped out fingernails, burned people alive and preached beheadings for nonbelievers. His final act before plunging into the fiery pits of hell was to murder three of his own children.\n\nThe reaction of top Democrats in Congress? Outrage over the fact that President Trump had not told them about the raid beforehand. Mr. Trump, understandably, explained that the mission was simply too sensitive to risk looping in hopelessly partisan Democrats in Congress who might then go blabbing about the raid and endanger the lives of U.S. troops.\n\nProving Mr. Trump\u2019s point exactly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi specifically complained that Mr. Trump notified Russian officials. Get it? Because it sounds like more Russia \u201ccollusion.\u201d\n\nWith every passing day, these people become more and more impossible to take seriously.\n\n\u2022 Contact Charles Hurt at churt@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter @charleshurt.", "description": "Is there anything these people won\u2019t shamelessly exploit in pursuit of political power?
