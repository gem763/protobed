The location is an unusual one, given Mr Juncker is based in Brussels.\n\nThe choice of venue has led to speculation that the prime minister wants to avoid being seen to go to the EU capital begging for concessions from the EU \u2013 an attempt to learn from the past jaunts of Theresa May, which were always framed as such.\n\nFair enough: politicians will politic. But the focus on the optics of the visit does raise another question: is there actually any point to such a meeting? It will certainly provide a photo-op for the prime minister, who wants to be seen to be trying to get a deal. But what of the actual substance?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nEU sources have been very dismissive of any suggestion of progress in Brexit talks this week. The EU, famously, does not negotiate Brexit leader to leader \u2013 discussions take place between officials with grasp of detail. Despite endless predictions, all from London, that the bloc would break that habit, it has kept it up throughout all the talks.\n\nMeetings happened on Wednesday and Friday and the UK team, by EU accounts, has failed to present any \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d in talks. Mr Johnson isn\u2019t exactly known as a details man, so is unlikely to be charging to the rescue with a binder of technical specifications with a backstop replacement. Mr Juncker is also only going to be in office for another month or so anyway.\n\nThe idea that Mr Johnson is going to break some deadlock or make some nebulous, undefined \u201cprogress\u201d by going and talking to Mr Juncker is not based on anything concrete.\n\nThe EU, of course, cannot refuse to meet with the British prime minister or his negotiators, one EU official reminded me this week. So Johnson and Juncker will go through the dance for the cameras. But the visit is, in reality, pointless. The real action to watch is now in Westminster, and \u201cnegotiations\u201d on the Continent have been utterly subordinated to the needs of the Conservative party ahead of an election.", "description": "Boris Johnson is going to Luxembourg on Monday to meet with Jean-Claude Juncker for a \u201cworking lunch\u201d to discuss Brexit.
