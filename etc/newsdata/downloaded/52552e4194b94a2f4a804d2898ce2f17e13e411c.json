Trump banned more than a dozen news organizations, including The Washington Post, from his campaign events in 2015 and 2016 but said he wouldn\u2019t do so if he became president.\n\nKarem, who has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump, sued White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and the president last month. He argued that the suspension, which began Aug. 16, was arbitrary and violated his constitutional rights of free speech and due process.\n\nGrisham, however, cast the action as a matter of decorum, saying Karem\u2019s behavior was disruptive and warranted the punishment.\n\nU.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras agreed with Karem on Tuesday. He issued a preliminary injunction against the White House\u2019s action, ruling that Karem had shown that he is \u201clikely to succeed\u201d on his due process claim because Grisham \u201chad failed to provide fair notice of the fact that a hard pass could be suspended\u201d as a result of his actions on July 11. He ordered the White House to restore the pass while his lawsuit proceeds.\n\n\u201cWhat is deemed \u2018professional\u2019 behavior in the context of a state dinner may be very different from what is considered \u2018professional\u2019 behavior during a performance by James Brown,\u201d the judge said.\n\nKarem, in an interview Tuesday night, said the ruling \u201cis good for me, but it\u2019s really for everyone in the free press. [The judge] didn\u2019t buy anything the White House was selling. . . . As much as this president has tried to bully us, we\u2019re not going away. As much as he\u2019s called us the enemy of the people, the Constitution is clear about what free speech is all about.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Grisham said: \u201cWe disagree with the decision of the district court to issue an injunction that essentially gives free reign to members of the press to engage in unprofessional, disruptive conduct at the White House. Mr. Karem\u2019s conduct, including threatening to escalate a verbal confrontation into a physical one to the point that a Secret Service agent intervened, clearly breached well-understood norms of professional conduct. The press secretary must have the ability to deter such unacceptable conduct.\u201d\n\nShe declined to comment on any further action against Karem.\n\nContreras\u2019s decision was the second judicial ruling to go against the White House in its attempts to punish reporters for what it has deemed misconduct. Karem\u2019s lawsuit over the loss of his \u201chard\u201d pass, a credential that enables journalists to come and go on a daily basis, followed a similar suit last fall by Jim Acosta of CNN. Acosta was suspended on an indefinite basis by the White House after engaging in a heated exchange with Trump at a news conference. A federal judge quickly sided with Acosta, ruling that the White House had overstepped its authority. His pass was restored.\n\nBoth reporters were represented by the same lawyer, Theodore Boutrous Jr., and both made similar arguments in their lawsuits: that Trump was essentially seeking to punish the press in violation of the first amendment and had done so without any notice or established procedure in violation of the 5th and 14th amendments\u2019 guarantee of due process. In a response to Grisham, Boutrous argued last month that the White House\u2019s actions were \u201carbitrary and unfair.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Boutrous said: \u201cWe are very pleased with the court\u2019s order directing the restoration of Brian Karem\u2019s hard pass. The White House\u2019s suspension of his press credentials violated the First Amendment and due process and was a blatant attempt to chill vigorous reporting about the President.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department argued in court last week that the White House took appropriate steps before booting Karem, such as notifying him that he was facing suspension and giving him a day to respond.\n\nGrisham notified Karem last month that he would be suspended as a result of his exchange in July with Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide who is a talk-radio host.\n\nThe incident \u2014 recorded by multiple witnesses \u2014 followed remarks by Trump in the Rose Garden after a \u201csummit\u201d of social-media supporters. When Karem asked the president whether he would take questions and receiving no answer, he was taunted by some in the audience. He retorted that its members were \u201ceager for demonic possession.\u201d He said later the comment was meant in jest.\n\nGorka then jumped in, shouting across the audience at Karem, who invited Gorka to \u201cgo outside and have a long conversation.\u201d Although Karem later said he meant that comment in earnest, Gorka took it as an offer to fight and stormed across the grounds to confront Karem.\n\nHe called Karem \u201ca punk.\u201d\n\nTrump later praised Gorka, tweeting \u201c@SebGorka Wins Big, No Contest!\u201d\n\nKarem\u2019s case drew attention and support from journalism organizations and free-speech advocates, who said the White House was acting in an authoritarian manner.", "description": "Reporter Brian Karem sued President Trump, claiming his rights were violated by 30-day suspension of his White House credential.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DYO4TYGONII6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
