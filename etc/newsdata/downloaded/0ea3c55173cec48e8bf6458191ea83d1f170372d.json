Cut. Taxes.", "language": "en", "text": "Instead, the ugly years of fiscal cliffs and shutdowns and sequesters produced a certain amount of deficit reduction even without a grand bargain, Medicare spending has been coming in lower than expected, and interest rates have stayed historically low. We are not where the champions of Simpson-Bowles wanted us to be, but as Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, noted in a striking presentation to the Concord Coalition, without doing much entitlement reform, we\u2019re in much better shape than either the Simpson-Bowles commission or the deficit hawks of the 1990s projected.\n\nMeanwhile, economic growth is still sluggish, wage growth is tepid, and the work force participation rate is still below pre-recession levels. The best time for right-wing Keynesianism was probably four years ago \u2014 ah, for the Romney administration. But the economy is stagnant enough that you can make a decent tax-cuts-as-stimulus case, especially if Republicans were to focus on corporate and payroll taxes, on business and workers, instead of just aiming for the lowest possible top income tax rate.\n\nAnd if the tax cuts are pegged to expire in a decade, you\u2019ll have a built-in opportunity to negotiate deficit reduction in 2027, when the Rock is president, Kid Rock is running the Senate, and the speaker of the House is an as-yet-undiscovered YouTube star.\n\nSorry, slipped into nihilism for a minute there. Back to deficit-financed tax cuts: They\u2019re suboptimal and risky, but they have a basic appeal to Republican politicians, they\u2019re more politically marketable than what the party was trying (I use that word loosely) to accomplish with health care, and they might actually give the Trump economy a still-needed boost.\n\nPersonally I can live with a Trump administration that appoints conservative judges and fails at everything else, since judicial appointments are about the only thing I trust this G.O.P. to do.\n\nBut if Congress insists on continuing to try legislating, I will give a 10-year tax cut my official Trump-era seal of approval: They could certainly do worse.", "description": "Republicans might as well do the one thing they seem capable of doing.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/opinion/19douthatWeb/19douthatWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-19"}
