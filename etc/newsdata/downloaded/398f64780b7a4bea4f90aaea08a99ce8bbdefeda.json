It had opened more stores in existing sales areas to cut delivery times and labour costs, get closer to pick-up customers and boost sales.\n\n\"We are fortressing our business in all markets,\" he said. \"More stores helps us maximise our investment and deliver better service for our customers.\"\n\nDomino's has opened 22 stores in Japan this year, nine in France, its first stores in Denmark, and expects to open its first store in Luxembourg in coming weeks.\n\n\"We now have more than 1000 Domino\u2019s branded stores in our European business and are well on our way to opening 1000 Domino\u2019s stores each in France and Germany, two large pizza markets that will deliver growth to this business for many years ahead,\" Mr Meij said.\n\nDouble-digit profit growth ahead\n\nIn Australia, 22 stores taken back from underperforming franchisees under a program dubbed Operations 360 are being sold to existing store managers or franchisees.\n\n\"The initial results are pleasing, with the new store owners passionate about growing their businesses,\" he said. \"We believe the Operations 360 program will deliver a stronger franchisee base that will serve as a platform for future growth in the medium and long-term.\"\n\nDomino's is also reviewing its pricing in Australia after conceding at the full-year results in August that price rises to cover higher raw material and labour costs had crimped carry-out sales of its cheapest pizzas.\n\n\"We continue to work on this area of our business to win these customers back and to keep them returning to our stores,\" he said.\n\nCitigroup's head of research Craig Woolford expects Domino's to return to double-digit profit growth in 2020, lifting net profit by 12 per cent after 6 per cent growth in 2019.\n\n\"The improved growth reflects stabilisation in Australia, but another strong year in Japan and improved growth in Europe as a greater number of new stores are opened,\" Mr Woolford said in a report after Domino's annual investor day earlier this month.", "description": "Domino's same-store sales have risen 4.1 per cent and the pizza chain has opened a record 42 new stores, or two a week, so far this financial year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5734%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_87%2C$y_123/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/836ccd29e649fe9339cdb1ea11b3c88b3bcfe320", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
