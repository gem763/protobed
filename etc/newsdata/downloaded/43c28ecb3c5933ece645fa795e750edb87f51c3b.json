These range from expanded background checks to outright confiscation of firearms from law-abiding citizens. But this crowd doesn\u2019t have anything on the City Council in Burlington, Vermont. (Keep in mind that this is Bernie Sanders\u2019 old stomping grounds. He used to be the mayor there.)\n\nA story from Warner Todd Huston at Godfather Politics popped up on social media this morning and it deals with Burlington Councilwoman Perri Freeman. Self-identifying as a \u201cprogressive Democrat,\u201d Ms. Freeman isn\u2019t messing around with taking guns away from the rank and file citizens in her community. She\u2019s suggesting that they should take them away from the Police in her fine city. And no\u2026 this is not a satire piece.\n\nA liberal Vermont city councilwoman has proven to be so anti-gun that she even wants her own local police department to disarm. Burlington, Vermont, councilwoman Perri Freeman \u2014 who calls herself a \u201cprogressive Democrat\u201d \u2014 insisted that it makes sense because some foreign nations don\u2019t arm their police, according to 1360 KKTX radio. \u201cRealizing that there are actually several countries where they\u2019re not using firearms for their regular police duties. Just to name a few: the U.K., Ireland, Iceland,\u201d Freeman told the media. \u201cI started thinking critically about what is the next step in terms of policing practices, whether that\u2019s having more sophisticated training for officers, having a different expectation.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the police weren\u2019t immediately jumping on the bandwagon. The president of the local police union showed considerable restraint when he described an unarmed cop showing up in the middle of an armed robbery as being a \u201cdisadvantageous situation.\u201d\n\nAs noted by the police union president, the countries where cops frequently go around with no weapons \u2013 like Great Britain \u2013 tend to be the ones where their gun control laws are so onerous that virtually nobody out on the street has a firearm. (There are always exceptions, of course, but it\u2019s true for most of them.) Also, each and every one of those law enforcement precincts have weapons available back at the station with officers who are available to be deployed on a moment\u2019s notice if things get hairy.\n\nAnd even if the suspects don\u2019t have actual firearms, a police officer responding to a situation where multiple, potentially violent suspects have bats or knives could still leave them facing a potentially lethal situation if they\u2019re not armed. We have villains out there trying to run cops down with cars. You can\u2019t seriously be pushing for the theory of \u201cthe good guy without a gun\u201d here.\n\nIs this where the Democratic Party is eventually heading? Their presidential candidates are out there on the trail, constantly trying to one-up each other on gun control proposals. The media should start asking them what they think about the Burlington proposal and see how many will bite. Sanders would be a good one to start with since the reporter could bring up the subject in terms of the city where he used to be mayor.\n\nDo you think I\u2019m being unrealistic here? These are the same people leading the party that wanted to abolish one of our primary immigration enforcement agencies. Do you think they would shy away from disarming the police at this point? Heck, if you can get one of them to go along with this proposal, I\u2019d be willing to bet that the next one would suggest studying the possibility of doing away with police forces entirely.", "description": "How have the Democrats overlooked this so far?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PaPolice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
