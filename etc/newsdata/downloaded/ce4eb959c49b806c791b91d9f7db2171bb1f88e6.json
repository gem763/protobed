Shares fell 2% following the news but closed 3% higher at $32.38 on Sep 25.\n\n\n\nThe results mainly benefited from continued progress of the Returns-Focused Growth plan, given stellar average community count growth. Although the company\u2019s top and bottom lines declined on a year-over-year basis, it remains upbeat about improvement in fiscal fourth-quarter results.\n\n\n\nKB Home\u2019s $2.3-billion backlog is expected to drive strong growth in 2020. It believes that declining mortgage/interest rates, steady economic growth and favorable demographics \u2014 in particular household formation \u2014 will continue providing a healthy backdrop for the housing industry, which includes biggies like Lennar LEN, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI.\n\n\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\n\n\nQuarterly earnings of 73 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 12.3% but declined 16.1% from 87 cents a year ago.\n\n\n\nTotal revenues of $1,160.8 million missed the consensus mark of $1,170 million by 0.8%. In addition, the top line declined 5.3% year over year, mainly due to lower average selling price (\u201cASP\u201d) of homes delivered.\n\n\n\nSegment Details\n\n\n\nHomebuilding Revenues: In the reported quarter, the segment's revenues fell 5.3% from the prior-year period to $1,156.9 million due to lower ASP of homes delivered. While land generated $4.2 million in revenues (up from $2.3 million a year ago), housing revenues totaled $1,152.6 million (declining from $1,219.6 million). The decrease in housing revenues mainly stemmed from a decline in ASP in the West Coast region due to mix shift toward deliveries in lower-price inland markets and the absence of certain communities with relatively high ASPs that closed out in prior quarters.\n\n\n\nNet orders grew 24% from the prior-year quarter to 3,325 homes, increasing in double digits across all regions served by the company. Value of net orders also increased 25% from the year-ago quarter to $1.28 billion.\n\n\n\nMoreover, number of homes delivered increased 1.1% from the year-ago level to 3,022 units. Deliveries increased in three regions (West Coast, Central and Southeast). However, ASP fell 7% from a year ago to $381,400, mainly due to a shift in geographic mix of homes delivered. Lower ASP in the West Coast region also added to the woes.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the reported quarter, average community count was 255, up 18% year over year. Notably, net orders per community averaged 4.3 per month in the quarter, up from 4.1 recorded in the prior year. The company\u2019s backlog totaled 6,230 homes (as of Aug 31, 2019), up 14% from a year ago. Potential housing revenues from backlog grew 13% from the prior-year period to $2.04 billion.\n\nKB Home Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nKB Home Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise More\n\nKB Home price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | KB Home Quote\n\nMargins\n\n\n\nHousing gross margin increased 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.5% in the quarter. The increase reflects lower amortization of previously capitalized interest and a change in its accounting for certain model complex costs.\n\n\n\nAdjusted housing gross profit margin (a metric that excludes the amortization of previously capitalized interest and inventory-related charges) declined 80 bps year over year to 22.3%.\n\n\n\nAs a percentage of housing revenues, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 11.1%, up 170 bps from the year-ago figure. The rise was mainly led by lower housing revenues, higher marketing expenses to support new community openings and the impact of ASC 606 adoption.\n\n\n\nHomebuilding operating margin deteriorated 120 bps on a year-over-year basis to 7.4%. After adjusting for inventory-related charges, operating margin came in at 7.8%, down 150 bps.\n\n\n\nFinancial Services revenues grew 13.2% year over year to $3.9 million.\n\n\n\nFinancial Position\n\n\n\nKB Home had homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of $183.8 million as of Aug 31, 2019, lower than $574.4 million on Nov 30, 2018. Inventories were $3,919.1 million, up from $3,582.8 million as of Nov 30, 2018. KB Home had total liquidity of $610.8 million at the end of the quarter.\n\n\n\nThe company spent nearly $442 million, of which 39.4% was allotted for new land acquisitions in the quarter.\n\n\n\nIts debt-to-capital ratio was 45.1% (which improved 460 bps from Nov 30, 2018). Net debt to capital ratio was 42.6% in the quarter.\n\n\n\nFiscal Q4 Guidance\n\n\n\nKB Home expects average community count to increase 10% year over year in the fourth quarter and 12% in 2019.\n\n\n\nIt expects fourth-quarter housing revenues in the range of $1.56-$1.64 billion (up from $1.34 billion a year ago) and ASP to be around $400,000-$410,000.\n\n\n\nAssuming no inventory-related charges, the company expects housing gross margin to improve sequentially and on a year-over-year basis to the range of 18.8-19.5%.\n\n\n\nHomebuilding operating margin \u2014 excluding the impact of any inventory-related charges \u2014 is expected within 9.9-10.5% (up from 9.7% a year ago).\n\n\n\nMoreover, SG&A ratio is projected in the range of 8.8-9.2%.\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate is estimated to be 28% for the quarter.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank\n\n\n\nCurrently, KB Home carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
