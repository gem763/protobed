I would say he was less engaged with the sessions after this.\n\n'He was enthusiastic to work but he did not have the right documents to start employment. I was aware that he was going to the Grenada embassy to seek documentation with his mum.\n\n'He required just one form of ID but did not have any so struggled to find work lawfully.\n\n'He appeared really low about his situation and said there was little point in doing anything because he could not get a job.'\n\nAccording to the consultant, Mr Bristol also believed he was unable to see a doctor.\n\nShe added: 'He started to get really low from June 2017. It was getting to him that he could not get any access to medical help and could not register with a doctor.'\n\nA statement from his mother revealed how his right to reside in the UK came during a meeting with his employer and how she blamed his death on his fight for proof.\n\nMother: 'When he was eight I visited Grenada and when I returned I brought him back with me. At that time it was a British colony and we were British subjects.\n\n'Only his name and date of birth were entered in my passport.\n\n'He never returned to Grenada not even for a visit. He had spent most of his life in the UK and thought that he was British.\n\n'For several years he did not contact me but in the year before his death, I saw a lot of him.\n\n'In early 2017 he contacted me and asked me where his passport was. He told me that when he showed this old passport to his employer they told him that if the Home Office saw it they would deport him.\n\n'I contacted Jackelin McKenzie [a solicitor]. Dexter and I went to see Miss McKenzie who told him he would have to apply for a Grenadian passport and supply records of early life in Britain to get a British passport.\n\n'He got his Granadan passport. Throughout this period of his life he was stressed and depressed. He was in a world of his own. He did not come on Christmas in 2017 but he sent me a letter in which he told me he was a bitter person.\n\n'I'm hurt and upset that he had to prove his right to live in the UK I don't think he would have died aged only 58 if he had not gone through the year of stress and worry.'", "description": "Dexter Bristol, 58, from London, immigrated from Grenada aged eight with his mother in 1968.
