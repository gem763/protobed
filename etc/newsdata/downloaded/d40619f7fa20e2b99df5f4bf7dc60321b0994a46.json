Think back to Monica Seles, who arrived and soon defeated Graf. Think back to Williams herself, who arrived in her sister Venus\u2019s shadow and then seized the spotlight by upsetting Martina Hingis in 1999 to win her first Grand Slam singles title at the U.S. Open at age 17.\n\n\u201cIt goes full circle,\u201d Evert said Sunday. \u201cI was a teenager who had no pressure and beat the top players like Billie Jean King and Margaret Court when they were at the end of their careers. Steffi beat me at the end of mine. What goes around comes around. Serena is learning that now, but you have to and should play both roles if you want longevity.\u201d\n\nWas Andreescu intimidated by the Williams aura on Saturday?\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said after a pause. \u201cI just prepared myself the best way I could, like I do every match. But having that opportunity to play against her and then actually winning the match is just so crazy.\u201d", "description": "Her loss to Bianca Andreescu on Saturday marked her fourth consecutive defeat in a Grand Slam final.
