Given that the same thing almost certainly happens at exosolar systems\u2014and we now know there are a lot of those\u2014it\u2019s likely that the vast volume of interstellar space is lightly sprinkled with small objects, some of which may sporadically pass through our own Solar System. But up until very recently, we\u2019d had no evidence of their existence.\n\nThat situation changed with the discovery of \u2018Oumuamua, a strange, cigar-shaped body that was the first confirmed exosolar visitor. But \u2018Oumuamua was so strange that it set some astronomers speculating that it could be an alien craft. Earlier this year, however, scientists spotted a second potential exosolar visitor, and this one looked a lot like a comet. Now, the first data on the object, 2I/Borisov, is in, and it\u2019s clearly exosolar in origin but looks so much like our existing comets that we might not have realized where it was from if we didn\u2019t have a good grip on its orbit.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Timmer", "Arstechnica.Com Science Comet-From-Another-Solar-System-Looks-A-Lot-Like-Our-Own"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
