He checks the strip: the reading is somewhere between 10 and 20 parts per million. It confirms the water running off this field contains nitrates at levels that would be unsafe, and illegal, in drinking water.\n\nBrent, whose family have been farming in this part of south-west Iowa for five generations, never used to worry about the runoff from his fields. On a hot day, cutting thistles in the corn fields, he\u2019d go down to the creek and drink straight from the tile line \u2013 the water coming off the fields. \u201cCold, clean \u2013 it\u2019s the best water around,\u201d he says.\n\nThings changed when his local town, Griswold, started having problems with their drinking water. Nitrates are a soluble form of nitrogen that is added to fields as synthetic fertiliser and animal manure; nitrates from Brent\u2019s fields, and other neighbouring farms, were making their way into the town\u2019s wells. Nitrate from farmland in Iowa is already a major contributor to the chemicals making their way to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi river, suffocating marine life in the \u201cdead zone\u201d. Suddenly what had been a distant problem, more than a thousand miles away, was on the doorstep, threatening the health of friends and neighbours.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all have friends who drink the water in town; we drink the water in town, so we all had an interest in it.\u201d\n\nLike most small towns in rural Iowa, Griswold is surrounded by vast fields of corn and soya bean. Giant grain silos glinting in the spring sunshine are all that punctuate the landscape for miles around.\n\nIowa\u2019s world-famous soils are packed with nitrogen \u2013 a gift from nature that allowed commercial agriculture to take root here \u2013 but decades of adding synthetic fertilisers and animal manure to drive production has loaded the land with nutrients it can\u2019t hold on to. Crop production in Iowa is still the main source, but animal manure from the state\u2019s 20 million pigs has contributed to the problem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brent Bierbaum tests the water in a ditch alongside one of his family\u2019s fields.

It was introduced in 1962 to guard against blue baby syndrome, a potentially fatal condition affecting newborn babies and infants under one year old. It\u2019s caused by nitrates starving the body of oxygen, literally turning babies blue.\n\nThree public wells, fed by an underground aquifer, provide drinking water for Griswold\u2019s 1,000 residents. Between 2012 and 2019, according to Griswold City Council, a single well recorded 21 incidents over 9mg/l and four incidents over 10mg/l. Another recorded 18 incidents over 9mg/l.\n\nStudies by the National Cancer Institute found that drinking water with an average level of 5mg/l of nitrate, over a long period of time, may increase the risk of certain cancers. Other studies have linked nitrate intake above 5mg/l with birth defects in babies.\n\nJulie Adams, one of Griswold\u2019s busy city councillors, took it upon herself to knock on doors and ring around new mothers and daycare nurseries, warning them of the risks: \u201cI tell them, \u2018If you have small babies do not use the tap water when you\u2019re making formula. Use bottled water. Just to be safe.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u2018dead zone\u2019\n\nThe problem is that nitrates are on the move, and in higher volumes than ever before. Iowa is 90% farmland and exports more nitrate and phosphorus to the Gulf of Mexico than any other US state, killing marine life there.\n\nIt\u2019s not an isolated problem. A report from the Environmental Working Group (EWG) revealed that, across the US, 1,700 municipal water utilities \u2013 most of them rural \u2013 regularly have nitrates above the 5mg/l safe limit. Worryingly, 120 public waterworks breach the 10mg/l legal limit. On top of that, Iowa has up to 290,000 private wells, many on remote farms like Brent\u2019s, which are not required by law to be tested.\n\nThe state of Griswold\u2019s wells set alarm bells ringing at Iowa\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, which oversees water quality. They called a meeting and delivered a sobering ultimatum \u2013 either bring nitrate levels down or the council would be ordered to spend $1m on a nitrate removal facility. It would wipe out a third of Griswold\u2019s $3m annual budget.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Councillor Julie Adams at her home.

We have many more needs than we have money.\u201d\n\nFellow city council member Ryan Askeland, who owns and runs the town\u2019s only restaurant, was also at the meeting: \u201cThey described the harm it could do to infants under one-year-old and I thought, \u2018Holy cow, what they\u2019re putting on the fields is poisoning us.\u2019\u201d\n\nChecking himself, he looks around his restaurant and softens his language. \u201cAn uneducated person would say \u2018poisoning\u2019. What I mean is, it was contaminating the water.\u201d\n\nGriswold is a close-knit community. The town folk value their farmer neighbours and are careful not to cause conflict. \u201cOver 80% of the people in here are from the farming community at any given time,\u201d says Askeland. \u201cEverything in this area is pretty much funded by agriculture. We are all on the same team.\u201d\n\nIowa is agriculture. The state produces the most of many things \u2013 corn, hogs and eggs \u2013 and jostles with neighbouring Illinois for the top spot in soya bean production. Hefty property taxes paid by farmers keep the lights on in rural towns, many with dwindling populations, right across the midwest. It\u2019s no surprise there is inexhaustible goodwill towards them \u2013 even when some farming practices threaten their drinking water.\n\nIn Des Moines, the city\u2019s waterworks did blame the farmers, and brought a lawsuit, but it failed. Des Moines Water Works was bitterly disappointed \u2013 particularly their outspoken CEO, the late Bill Stowe, who died from cancer earlier this year. A controversial figure in Iowa, Stowe waged war on \u201cunregulated industrial agriculture\u201d and what he called the \u201cpowerful agro-elite\u201d. He likened those who downplay Iowa\u2019s water quality issues to climate change deniers and held the farming industry responsible for the public health risks associated with high nitrates in drinking water. \u201cIf a baby died,\u201d he said, \u201cthere would be a clear path between agriculture and the death of that baby.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian shortly before his death, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening: the image of Iowa as a sacrificed state at the mercy of industrial agriculture. We will continue to be advocates for agricultural producers taking responsibility for the water pollution they are inflicting on the rest of us downstream.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A water quality notice hangs near the beach at Big Creek state park, in Polk City, Iowa. Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nIn rural north-west Iowa, Gordon Garrison, a retired corn and soya bean grower, hopes to succeed where Des Moines Water Works failed.\n\nGarrison is allowing his farm to return to wetland. He points down to the creek where he has reintroduced beavers, and beyond to a single-storey white building in the neighbouring field \u2013 a hog barn, or confined animal feeding operation (Cafo), housing up to 8,800 pigs.\n\n\u201cThat building has no consideration for environmental impact at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI have got algal blooms in my downstream water. After they bought the farm, the nitrate level almost doubled.\u201d\n\nThe pig farm is owned and operated by Minnesota-based company New Fashion Pork. They bought 77 hectares (192 acres) next to Garrison\u2019s farm in 2014 and started producing pigs two years later. The building sits over a pit that can hold more than one million gallons of liquified hog manure, and Garrison claims that the manure was spread illegally on snow-covered ground in December 2018.\n\nIowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued New Fashion Pork with a notice of violation and a fine of $4,800 (\u00a33,900). Garrison filed a citizen\u2019s suit, which he believes will be a precedent-setting case in the US. Garrison\u2019s hope is that his legal action will set a precedent and pave the way for tougher regulation of pig Cafos in the context of water quality protection.\n\nNew Fashion Pork, which runs 53 pig confinements across Iowa, has said it complies with all manure application requirements and obtained permission from Iowa DNR to surface apply manure. \u201cField conditions were not good in most of the state last fall and winter and the DNR routinely granted permission to producers to surface apply manure in December of 2018,\u201d said a legal advisor for New Fashion Pork. The company also said that nitrate loss from crop fields is affected by many factors, but that the source of the nitrogen (manure or commercial fertiliser) has little, if any, effect on the amount of nitrate loss.\n\n\u201cThe only way to solve this problem is if there\u2019s peer pressure,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cWe can\u2019t let some guys abuse the system and profit from it. If they prevail in this lawsuit that\u2019s just a signal to build more and more.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of the Iowan countryside: crop fields stretch out as far as the eye can see.

It\u2019s long been said Iowa needs a third cash crop to break the dependence on corn and soya bean. As one farmer put it: \u201cWe\u2019ve found one. It\u2019s called bacon.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not without risk. In Marshall County, 25-year-old Ryan Pickard is a third-generation row crop farmer, growing 1,820 hectares of corn and soya bean who diversified into custom pig production in 2015 to spread the risk from low grain prices.\n\nRyan and his 29-year-old brother, Brandon, borrowed nearly $1.5m to build two Cafos, with one still under construction. They each house 5,000 newly weaned, 18-day-old pigs. They\u2019re thinned out as they grow bigger, with half being moved to another site. Ryan fattens the remaining 2,500, which are sent for slaughter direct from the farm.\n\nThe brothers do not own the pigs and receive none of the profit. They are paid instead for \u201chead space\u201d in the building. They do own the manure, which drops through slats into a pit holding up to 800,000 gallons. They also own all the risk associated with it.\n\nRyan is ruled by the pit. When it\u2019s full, it\u2019s full \u2013 and must be emptied. It\u2019s spread once a year on a nearby 80-hectare (200-acre) corn field. He tries to plan ahead, working around the weather, but if there\u2019s a spill or run-off, the full responsibility rests on him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I think about constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cIf not managed properly it could give me a very bad name and I don\u2019t want that. If the pit leaks, we need to find the problem and fix it before we can go back into production.\u201d\n\nFor Ryan the threat of being shut down is all the incentive he needs to manage the pit properly. But across Iowa there are more, and ever louder calls, for real regulation to protect water quality.\n\nAt the moment there is nothing in place but a voluntary approach, as laid out in Iowa\u2019s much-lauded nutrient reduction strategy (NRS) which calls for farmers to plant 5m hectares of cover crops, which are proven to reduce run off and pollution. Iowa-based environmental and citizen groups believe the NRS is a dismal failure, with no deadlines, no rules and no enforcement. The most generous estimate suggests cover crops have been planted on 307,500 hectares, just 2% of Iowa\u2019s farmland.\n\nJennifer Terry, executive director of the Iowa Environment Council, says. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to pretend to Iowans that we can get there in a reasonable timeframe via voluntary means. It will take us thousands of years to get these practices in place at the current rate of implementation.\u201d\n\nAnd do cover crops even work? In Griswold, faced with a $1m bill, the town started working with four local farmers to plant cover crops in the 250-hectare capture zone around the town wells. Brent Bierbaum is one of the farmers involved. \u201cWe explained to the farmers what was going on and that we were really hoping they would help us, and they were all on board,\u201d says councillor Julie Adams.\n\nBut despite their efforts, water quality has still not improved. Nitrate levels spiked in 2017 and 2018. At the most recent inspection in February, one well showed an increase of nitrates to 10.5 mg/l.\n\nAccording to the Department of Natural Resources, nitrates may continue to leach because of legacy nitrogen stored in the soil and continued rates of fertiliser application. One study of a row crop field that had been restored to prairie found that groundwater nitrate concentrations reduced at a snail\u2019s pace of approximately 0.6 mg/l per year.\n\nAdams is willing to give it more time but admits the trend is going the wrong way. Fellow councillor Askeland has resigned himself to what\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cI think cover crops are a band aid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wound that\u2019s bleeding and eventually we\u2019re going to need something bigger than a band aid \u2013 and that\u2019s the filtration system.\u201d", "description": "Decades of adding fertilisers and manure to drive Iowa\u2019s crop production has loaded the land with nutrients that are ending up in the water supply", "authors": ["Anna Jones In Cass County"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1ca369e8685062acb9ff490c05c4883b8d92ce/0_0_4310_2588/master/4310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c5379b387411b87c5f3f77c4262cc647", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
