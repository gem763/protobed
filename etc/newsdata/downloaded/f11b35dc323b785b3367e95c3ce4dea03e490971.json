What\u2019s creating the big cultural anxiety? For me, it\u2019s the anxiety of a reckoning,\u201d Lindelof said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cThe identification of white supremacy as a bad guy in a superhero comic book that could not be defeated\u2014the Klan wears masks, but why are its members never the villains in a superhero story? Those ideas felt like natural fits for Watchmen.\u201d Moore\u2019s opus was about the extent to which people place their trust in costumed avengers and asked the age-old question of who watches the watchmen. Lindelof\u2019s Watchmen takes the comic\u2019s most potent symbol\u2014the mask\u2014and shows how it can protect not only superheroes, but also the flawed institutions Americans rely on.\n\nThe show begins with a depiction of the Tulsa, Oklahoma, massacre of 1921, in which a white mob ransacked and destroyed the vibrant \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d neighborhood of Greenwood, dropping firebombs from planes and murdering hundreds. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote about Tulsa in his Atlantic piece \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d which Lindelof said served as an inspiration for the show. As the horror of Tulsa rages on-screen, men in Klan outfits parade around shooting at people\u2014a chilling, if detached, vision of supervillainy.\n\nIn delving into America\u2019s real history of racist violence, HBO\u2019s Watchmen initially seems a far cry from Moore\u2019s original work. The latter is steeped in its alternative reality, which unfolds through the personal recollections of its core cast of superheroes\u2014Rorschach, Doctor Manhattan, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, Ozymandias, and the Comedian. But the first scenes of Watchmen do slyly mix historical fact with comic-book lore, as ScreenCrush\u2019s Matt Singer identified. In the Tulsa sequence, viewers see two black parents trying to save their child from danger, arranging to have him smuggled out of the city as it explodes around him. The scene is reminiscent of Superman\u2019s famous origin story\u2014except the boy in Watchmen isn\u2019t eventually rescued by a kindly couple and must instead make it on his own.\n\nMuch like that sequence, Lindelof\u2019s show is a marriage of pulpy mythmaking and grim reality, telling a weighty story under the guise of mass-market entertainment. That\u2019s long been Moore\u2019s specialty: His Watchmen chronicled the seedy truths and vicious nihilism that often underlie superheroism, upending the cheerful idealism of old-fashioned comic books. The first issue features the creation of the Minutemen, a 1940s assemblage of costumed do-gooders formed as part of a publicity stunt. But their squeaky-clean, patriotic image is just a facade: After the group poses for press pictures, one of the members, the sardonic Comedian, attempts to rape another, the Silk Spectre\u2014a crime for which he goes unpunished.\n\nAnother attempt to create a team of heroes fails before it even begins: Years later, in 1966, the aged leader of the Minutemen, the polished Captain Metropolis, tries to start a new group called the Crimebusters. Metropolis, a throwback hero who wants to fight hippie-era social ills such as \u201cpromiscuity, drugs, [and] campus subversion,\u201d makes a rah-rah pitch but is thwarted by the Comedian, who sets his presentation on fire. \u201cWhat\u2019s going down in this world, you got no idea,\u201d the Comedian scoffs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter squat because inside 30 years the nukes are gonna be flying like maybugs.\u201d The crowd disperses, with a horrified Captain Metropolis shouting after them: \u201cSomebody has to do it, don\u2019t you see? Somebody has to save the world.\u201d", "description": "Damon Lindelof\u2019s new show advances the clock on Alan Moore\u2019s original series but retains the comic\u2019s skepticism of heroes in masks.", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/77c19f982c017d07307ad16da2f0e73f57f2a23994257e55d77bdc5261829c9591322fddf60e4d11a3cef5368f0b7c68/facebook.jpg?1571768821", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
