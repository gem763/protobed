Mr. Streitburger donated his family Bible to the table honoring missing military personnel and prisoners of war.\n\nBut the MRFF claims the inclusion of the World War II veteran\u2019s Bible on the Missing Man Table is a violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt was not the first time they made such an accusation and more often than not VA hospitals capitulated to their demands without even putting up a fight.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to tell the nation it was time to fight back.\n\n\u201cWe will always respect the freedom of religion of every veteran of every faith,\u201d the vice president said in remarks to the American Legion. \u201cAnd my message to the New Hampshire VA hospital is: The Bible stays.\u201d\n\nThe vice president affirmed what I have been reporting for over a decade at Fox News \u2013 the Obama administration was no friend to people of faith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no surprise because, under the last administration, VA hospitals were removing Bibles and even banning Christmas carols in an effort to be politically correct,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vice president vowed that the Trump administration would always respect the freedom of religion of every veteran of every faith.\n\n\u201cBut let me be clear: Under this administration, VA hospitals will not be religion-free zones,\u201d he said.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the founder of the MRFF, was enraged by the vice president\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cMike Pence is one of the most repulsive and repellent fundamentalist Christian supremacists and bullies on the scene today,\u201d he said in a prepared statement. \u201cIt is hardly surprising that he is lending his ugly bigotry and pervasive prejudice in support of keeping that Christian bible bolted down on that POW/MIA table.\u201d\n\nVA Secretary Robert Wilkie refused to be bullied by Weinstein\u2019s lawsuit or the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to eliminate religious symbols from VA facilities.\n\n\u201cThey did not know the makeup of the force,\u201d Wilkie told the Washington Examiner. \u201cThey did not know the history of this country when it came to religious foundations, the religious support for those in uniform.\u201d\n\nIn July the Department of Veterans Affairs announced an overhaul of Obama-era policies that limited religious liberty.\n\nMoving forward children will be able to send veterans religious-themed Christmas cards and patients will be able to use sacred texts during visits to VA chapels. And Bibles will be included in Missing Man Tables.\n\n\u201cIt is offensive to me that we send our troops into the most godforsaken places on the planet, and yet we have people suing us because they\u2019re offended by the presence of a Bible at a table memorializing missing soldiers,\u201d he told the Examiner.\n\nPeople of all faiths, especially Christians, owe the Trump White House a debt of gratitude for defending religious liberty and rolling back the anti-Christian infestation that took root during the previous administration.\n\nMr. Weinstein once bragged that his organization\u2019s influence was so vast during the Obama administration that he had a hotline to the Pentagon. Well, it looks like President Trump just disconnected the line.", "description": "For eight years the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and the .09/02/2019 20:01:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/57/a7a051b8-13bf-4f28-8bb1-ec7f87342a40.png"}
