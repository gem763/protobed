Col. Alexander Vindman, a 20-year Army officer assigned to the National Security Council, finds himself in the red-hot center of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nVindman testified Tuesday that he twice raised concerns that President Donald Trump and his European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, inappropriately pushed Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden.\n\n\"I sit here, as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, an immigrant,\" Vindman, the NSC director on European affairs, told House investigators in written testimony. \"I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics.\"\n\nThe Army officer was a specialist in the White House on Ukraine and Russia. His backstory \u2014 he's a Jewish immigrant who fled the Soviet Union with his family to become a decorated soldier and White House adviser\u2014 has the makings of an only-in-America movie.\n\n\"He comes from a hard-working immigrant family and is utterly self-made,\" said retired Brigadier Gen. Peter Zwack, who was the top Defense Department official for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Moscow during Vindman's tenure there. \"He is smart. He had the courage of his conviction and would tell me what he thought, and I think there's a little bit of that playing out now.\"\n\nVindman was only 3 years old in 1979, when he and his two brothers, father and grandmother fled Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, for the U.S. His mother died in Ukraine before they immigrated.\n\nHis family was highlighted in a photo essay by photographer Carol Kitman, who first spotted Vindman and his twin brother in 1980 walking hand in hand with their grandmother under elevated train tracks in Brooklyn's Little Odessa neighborhood.\n\nKitman struck up a relationship with the Vindman family and photographed the boys over the years, including their weddings. His twin brother, Yevgeny, is also an Army lieutenant colonel and serving as a lawyer with the NSC.\n\nYevgeny \"is always the smiling twin.\" Alexander \"is serious,\" wrote Kitman. \"At this age, it was very hard to tell them apart.\"\n\nVindman and his twin also made an appearance as boys in Ken Burns' 1985 documentary \"The Statue of Liberty,\" which explored how the landmark has become a symbol of hope and refuge for generations of immigrants.\n\n\"Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night,\" Vindman said in his prepared testimony. \"He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream.\"\n\nHe took part in the ROTC program while attending the State University of New York at Binghamton and later earned a master's degree from Harvard University in Russian, Eastern Europe and Central Asian studies.\n\nEarlier in his Army career, he served as an infantry officer and did tours in South Korea, Germany and Iraq. In October 2004, not long into his yearlong tour in Iraq, he was wounded by a roadside bomb and awarded the Purple Heart, according to the Defense Department. Vindman showed up to Tuesday's hearing in full uniform, including his Purple Heart ribbon, a Ranger tab and Combat Infantry Badge.\n\nSince 2008, he's served as a foreign area officer specializing in Eurasia, leading him to stints in Kiev and Moscow. He also served as a political-military affairs officer for Russia for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He moved to the Trump White House in July 2018 after being tapped to serve on the National Security Council.\n\nVindman told House investigators that he raised his concerns after he listened with other aides to Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and concluded that it was improper \"to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen.\"\n\n\"I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine,\" he said.", "description": "The Soviet-era immigrant who came to the U.S. as a toddler and grew up to become a decorated soldier and a White House aide saw it as his \"sacred duty\" to speak up.
