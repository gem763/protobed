In his testimony on Thursday, he indicated that he had conducted \"desktop research\" on companies that specialised in dairy production in New Zealand, the Netherlands and India.\n\nThabethe said he came across Paras, the partner company in the project, during his research.\n\nFrom the company's website, Thabethe said he contacted Paras and was put in touch with the CEO \u2013 a Mr Kumar.\n\nBased on this interaction, Thabethe organised a trip to India with Ashok Nayaran, advisor to former Free State premier Ace Magashule, to visit the company.\n\nEvidence leader for the commission, advocate Leah Gcabashe, asked Thabethe why he did not do further research on other companies and methods of dairy production in South Africa and overseas.\n\nThabethe said his desktop research included other companies overseas, but he was looking for one that would suit a developing country like South Africa, and Paras seemed best.\n\nThabethe said that after his visit to India, Paras came to South Africa where discussions were held about going into business together. After these discussions, Estina approached Thabethe's department saying they had a relationship with Paras.\n\nWhile Thabethe said he acquired an agreement, signed by both companies, that they were partners, Thabethe had done little due diligence on Estina before going into business with them.\n\nHe said the government had processes to check tax compliance and registration status. Other than this, however, nothing else was done.\n\nBecause of this, Thabethe seemingly missed the fact that before 2012, Estina was not registered as a business that dealt with agriculture or farming.\n\nThabethe said he missed this because his focus was on Paras, not Estina.\n\nZondo asked Thabethe whether, being a head of department with access to millions of taxpayer money, he should have made more of an effort to protect that money and go beyond government regulation to ensure its safety.\n\n\"Why didn't you protect taxpayer money?\" Zondo questioned.\n\nThabethe said he needed time to think about this. The commission then adjourned for lunch.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
