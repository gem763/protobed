(Stephen B. Morton/AP)\n\nThe Tennessee Titans meet the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night to kick off the NFL\u2019s Week 3. Follow along here for live updates and analysis.\n\nJags extend lead: Jacksonville increased its lead to 17-0 on a 40-yard field goal by kicker Josh Lambo. It should have been 21-0 but wide receiver Dede Westbrook dropped what should have been Gardner Minshew\u2019s third touchdown pass of the night. (Jaguars 17, Titans 0 with 7:54 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nRamsey beaten but Titans fail on fourth down: The Titans had a scoring chance when wide receiver Tajae Sharpe beat Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey to catch an on-target throw from quarterback Marcus Mariota on a third-and-11 play. But the frustrations continued for Tennessee. Coach Mike Vrabel left his offense on the field for a fourth-and-six try from the Jacksonville 11-yard line, but Mariota was sacked by the Jaguars\u2019 Calais Campbell. Jaguars linebacker Myles Jack left the field during the drive and was being examined, apparently for a possible head injury, in the medical tent on the sideline. (Jaguars 14, Titans 0 with 8:22 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nHalftime in Jacksonville: Jalen Ramsey is playing. Gardner Minshew is doing his thing. The rain is falling. The penalty flags are flying. And the Jaguars, at last, are looking like they hoped to look all season. They lead the Titans, 14-0, at halftime on a wet, windy night in Jacksonville as they seek their first victory of the season after an 0-2 start. Minshew, the rookie quarterback filling in for the injured Nick Foles, threw a pair of first-quarter touchdown passes. The Jaguars defense has taken it from there, shutting down Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota and the Tennessee offense, which had just 108 total yards in the first half. Jalen Ramsey, the NFL\u2019s self-proclaimed best cornerback, is playing \u2014 as promised \u2014 for the Jaguars even after requesting a trade following last Sunday\u2019s game. Ramsey had a sideline disagreement Sunday with Coach Doug Marrone but said Thursday in an \u201cUninterrupted\u201d podcast with Nate Burleson that he asked for a trade because \u201csome disrespectful things\u201d were said to him in a postgame meeting with team officials. This game mostly has been about the penalties. It\u2019s an all-too-familiar NFL flag-fest, with the Titans being penalized seven times in the first half. After it was mentioned on the NFL Network broadcast that Tom Brady wrote on social media that he was turning off the game because of all the penalties, analyst Troy Aikman said: \u201cI agree. This is ridiculous.\u201d (Jaguars 14, Titans 0 at halftime)\n\n[Troy Aikman says NFL officiating issues are \u2018maddening\u2019 and \u2018nauseating\u2019]\n\nMore questionable officiating: The officiating has been a major issue in the early stages of this NFL season. It came into focus again Thursday night when Tennessee\u2019s Kamalei Correa was called for roughing the passer on a seemingly clean and legal hit on Minshew. It didn\u2019t help the Jaguars, though, as they ended up punting on the drive on which penalty was called. The Tennessee offense needs to get moving. The Jaguars defense has been dominant so far on this rainy night in Jacksonville. (Jaguars 14, Titans 0 with 11:29 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nTwo TD passes for Minshew: The Jaguars are off to a great start. They forced a punt by the Titans and struck quickly for Minshew\u2019s second touchdown pass of the night. Minshew made a great throw to the sideline to wide receiver Dede Westbrook for a 28-yard gain to set up the touchdown. Then he dropped in a perfectly placed lob to wideout D.J. Chark for the 22-yard score. Minshew has thrown for 78 yards on five-for-six passing so far. (Jaguars 14, Titans 0 with 6:36 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nEarly TD for Jags on turnover: The Jaguars were called for holding on the game\u2019s first offensive play and ended up having to punt. But that worked in their favor when Tennessee\u2019s Adoree\u2019 Jackson mishandled the football on the punt return. The Jaguars recovered and cashed in quickly with a seven-yard touchdown pass from Minshew to tight end James O\u2019Shaughnessy. (Jaguars 7, Titans 0 with 13:02 left in the first quarter)\n\nTitans at Jaguars\n\nWhen: Thursday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nTV: NFL Network\n\nStreaming: Yahoo Sports, NFL.com, fuboTV\n\nPregame Reading\n\nWere the Jacksonville Jaguars really in the AFC championship game at the end of the 2017 season?\n\nThat seems like such a long time ago now.\n\nThe Jaguars have unraveled since then, going 5-11 last season and getting off to a 0-2 start this season, even after adding quarterback Nick Foles as a high-priced free agent. Now they\u2019re dealing with a trade request by cornerback Jalen Ramsey as they try to get into the win column for the season by hosting the Tennessee Titans on Thursday Night Football.\n\nRamsey is scheduled to play Thursday night. He said this week that he wanted to play against the Titans if he remained on the Jaguars\u2019 roster Thursday. There has been speculation that the Jaguars are seeking two first-round draft picks in a potential trade, and Ramsey undoubtedly would want a hefty contract extension from any new team. He is signed through the 2020 season after the Jaguars picked up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract.\n\n[No matter what the NFL does, its officiating headaches just won\u2019t go away]\n\nHe has proclaimed himself the league\u2019s top cornerback, and he very well might be right. His trade request came after he and Coach Doug Marrone had a sideline disagreement last weekend. If the Jaguars do trade Ramsey, it could signal that they would be all but surrendering on a 2019 season that began with high hopes of returning to top-contender status.\n\nFoles, the former Super Bowl MVP for the Philadelphia Eagles, was signed to a four-year, $88 million contract in March to replace Blake Bortles as the Jaguars\u2019 quarterback. But he suffered a broken left clavicle during the season opener, and the Jaguars have turned to rookie Gardner Minshew II. The sixth-round draft choice from Washington State has played well, throwing for 488 yards and three touchdowns since Foles was hurt. But the Jaguars\u2019 lofty aspirations for this season were pinned to Foles, not Minshew.\n\nThe Titans enter with a record of 1-1 after following a lopsided season-opening triumph at Cleveland with a Week 2 defeat at home to the Indianapolis Colts. Quarterback Marcus Mariota is off to a good start, with four touchdown passes and no interceptions in the two games. He\u2019s eligible for free agency after this season and is attempting to prove that he should be in the team\u2019s long-term plans. A road victory for Tennessee on Thursday would keep the Titans in the early-season conversation in the AFC South and would push the Jaguars further toward irrelevance.\n\nRead more NFL coverage:\n\nNFL power rankings Week 3: Cowboys, Ravens move up as others suffer QB unrest\n\nBrewer: If Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger can\u2019t stay healthy, good luck to the NFL\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you\n\nEli Manning being benched for Daniel Jones was inevitable.
