I was borrowing money. I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Then Vince Gilligan hired me.\n\nEl Camino is full of surprises (Picture: Netflix via AP)\n\nPaul played Jesse Pinkman for all five seasons of the hit drama Breaking Bad and is the star of the new spin-off movie, El Camino.\n\nThe Netflix movie, which picked up directly after the show\u2019s final fifth season, saw Jesse flee to Alaska for a new life after avoiding the pursuits of law enforcement.\n\nBut it turns out Paul predicted Jesse\u2019s outcome three years ago.\n\nYep, in a Reddit post from three years ago shared by Netflix UK\u2019s official Twitter account, the actor predicted Jesse\u2019s fate weirdly accurately, way before creator Vince Gilligan put pen to paper.\n\nIn the Reddit post, Aaron wrote: \u2018I\u2019d like to think Jesse got away. I like to think he kept driving. But we all know he has no money, he gave it all away, and we also know his fingerprints are all over everything where Walt was found dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They\u2019re gonna be searching high and low for Jesse, so I don\u2019t know. I like to think he was building something in Alaska\u2026 but he could be locked away in a prison somewhere. But we don\u2019t like to think about that version of the show. So, I think he\u2019s living happy on a lake somewhere in Alaska, fishing a lot, making things out of wood, probably kicked the habit of meth.\u2019\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad movie is available now on Netflix.\n\nMORE: Yungblud reveals he got death threats for wearing a dress on stage in Russia: \u2018It doesn\u2019t scare me\u2019\n\nMORE: Ricki Lake found X Factor Celebrity a hard watch after losing 20lbs since first audition: \u2018It\u2019s hard to see myself\u2019", "description": "Aaron Paul almost missed out on iconic role of Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aaron-Paul-1b10_1571470487.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
