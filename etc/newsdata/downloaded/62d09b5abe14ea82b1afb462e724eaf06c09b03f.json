The Biden campaign wants to ban Trump\u2019s lawyer from the news, for the crime of making news.\n\nJack Shafer is Politico\u2019s senior media writer.\n\nAs if inspired by Donald Trump, Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign shouted \u201cfake news\u201d at TV news on Sunday with a letter calling on the networks to stop booking Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWritten by Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn and deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield and first disclosed by Politico\u2019s Michael Calderone, the letter denounced the networks for allowing Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, \u201cto spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump.\u201d Specifically, the campaign objected to Giuliani\u2019s spurious claims about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden engaging in \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine. The campaign insisted that fact-checking Giuliani in real-time or disputing his wild assertions was insufficient. He must be banished from the airwaves.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn the surface, a Giuliani ban sounds like a good idea. Early in the Trump administration when the president thought his legal team wasn\u2019t adequately defending him, Trump plaintively asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d\u2014referring to his former say-anything, do-anything personal attorney, a ruthless operator who worked for Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. Trump seems to have finally found his contemporary Cohn in Giuliani, who relishes his role as the most unreliable of unreliable narrators in Trump world. Like Cohn, Giuliani will say anything in service of his client, whether that means energetically contradicting the Trump team\u2019s collusion denials or reversing himself inside a single paragraph when asked if he instructed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to ban Giuliani from the shows for truth-bending, shouldn\u2019t we have to do the same for the other prevaricators who peddle Trump and his talking points on television? Just this last Sunday, an entire squad of Trump dissemblers visited the shows to spread mounds of cock-and-bull for their man. While these mounds might not be as mighty or as stinky as the ones Giuliani spews, they are malarkey just the same. Here\u2019s a brief serving:\n\nOn CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, hosted by Margaret Brennan, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump as being based on \u201chearsay.\u201d But legal experts agree that the memorandum of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump leans on the Ukrainian is completely admissible non-hearsay.\n\nOn the same network\u2019s 60 Minutes, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said with a straight face that the Trump-Zelensky conversation produced evidence of \u201ctwo leaders having admiration, not intimidation.\u201d McCarthy aped Giuliani\u2019s technique of filling the air with chaff when he accused correspondent Scott Pelley of adding a word to what Trump said to Zelensky. (Pelley got the Trump quotation\u2014\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d\u2014absolutely right.) Then, when Pelley asked McCarthy how the president\u2019s defense would roll out, McCarthy played stupid, saying, \u201cThe defense of what?\u201d Pelley had to answer, \u201cWell, there\u2019s an impeachment process.\u201d\n\nJake Tapper, the host of CNN\u2019s State of the Union, came close to losing his Cronkite cool in the face of a swarm of falsehoods advanced by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on behalf of the president. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d Tapper responded to Jordan\u2019s erroneous account of the Biden-Ukraine story. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that Biden called for the prosecutor to be fired to protect his son,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace did everything but tackle White House senior adviser Stephen Miller and sit on his head to get him to explain why Trump used private attorneys, including Giuliani, to dig up dirt on Biden instead of using a federal government agency. Miller foiled Wallace by repeatedly changing the subject. The stalemate ended when Miller defiantly said, \u201cI understand that you have your question, I have my answer.\u201d Wallace desperately countered, \u201cYou have your non-answer at this point.\u201d\n\nBased on these deceitful responses, if you\u2019re going to insist on a TV timeout for Rudy, you\u2019d have to give Graham, McCarthy, Jordan and Miller the same treatment. But who would such timeouts ultimately serve? Earlier this month, Giuliani claimed on Fox News Sunday that \u201cthis town protects Joe Biden\u201d and accused the Washington press corps of \u201ccovering up\u201d for him for years. Giuliani\u2019s claim is demonstrably false\u2014the press has recently ripped Biden for conflating war stories, looked at his age problem, examined his family\u2019s businesses, and put his shifting views on abortion and criminal justice under their lens. But any move by the TV newsers to heed Biden\u2019s campaign and bar Giuliani from their shows would play to Giuliani\u2019s advantage by making his false claim come true. He could say, \u201cI told you! The press is in the tank for Biden and they\u2019ve proved it by blackballing me, Trump\u2019s most loyal defender, from the shows.\u201d And he\u2019d have an excellent point.\n\nThe Biden campaign fails to understand that there is news value in having not just humbug artists like Giuliani on their shows, but also charlatans and beguilers like Graham, McCarthy, Jordan and Miller. When forced to spar with critical news anchors, their lies become transparent and diluted. In his recent appearances, Giuliani has been a shvitzing, manic mess, plotting out imaginary treacheries and schemes by the president\u2019s political opponents. Graham comes off like the president\u2019s useful idiot. McCarthy looks like he\u2019s in over his head, and Jordan sounds like he should be sized for a straitjacket.\n\nNot even the most strident Trump partisan could come away from Sunday thinking that Stephen Miller was doing anything but bicycling away from Chris Wallace. The Trump gang\u2019s panicky, nonsensical answers were enough to convince a viewer with any horse sense that the president has yet to mount a genuine defense to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. It may be painful for the Biden campaign to watch, but this is valuable news that average news consumer can use to reach independent judgments on who is telling the truth about the Ukraine scandal.\n\nNews is made by both angels and devils. If the shows exclude the devils from coverage, they will be doing their audience a disservice. Don\u2019t make Rudy Giuliani a martyr.\n\n******\n\nIf Giuliani becomes a martyr, how long before Pope Francis beatifies him? Send your religious insights to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.
