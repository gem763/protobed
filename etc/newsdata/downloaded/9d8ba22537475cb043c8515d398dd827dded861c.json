Amy Klobuchar, anonymity wounds again", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWoman in gold coat takes selfie with John McCain and Bernie Sanders,\u201d Klobuchar recalled, as the crowd erupted with sympathetic laughter.\n\nLess funny, anonymity also has largely defined Klobuchar\u2019s role in the Democratic presidential contest \u2014 even though she has been a senator from Minnesota for 12 years and serves in leadership, even though she passes more legislation each session than most Democrats, even though she\u2019s regularly on cable news and is campaigning across the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the beginning of the latest Democratic debate earlier this month, Klobuchar \u2014 who was stationed at the last lectern on the far left of the stage \u2014 embraced reality.\n\n\u201cI may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we\u2019ve already got that in the White House,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIf you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you\u2019ve got a home with me.\u201d\n\nThe question for her campaign: In a primary driven by more combative activists, how many voters want that? And why her over other centrist candidates?\n\nKlobuchar has seen a small bump in some polls since that debate, delighting her and her staff. A September Focus on Rural America poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers found her support at 8 percent, and a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll released last weekend put her at 3 percent. Yet an average of national polls in September showed Klobuchar\u2019s support around 1 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe\u2019s leaning on the fact that most voters say their support is fluid. Yet, for months she\u2019s been overshadowed in the center by former vice president Joe Biden, who, like her, contends he\u2019s a champion of working-class Midwestern voters and union members and knows how to work with Republicans to get legislation passed. And she has no clear strategy for changing that.\n\nWhile most Democratic candidates have publicly challenged Biden \u2014 questioning his age and his comments on racial issues, among other things \u2014 Klobuchar largely has refrained and has even come to Biden\u2019s defense. When asked why she thinks she would have a better shot at winning Rust Belt states than Biden, who grew up in Pennsylvania, Klobuchar says that she is \u201cactually from the Midwest,\u201d is a woman and is \u201cin a new generation of politicians.\u201d (At 59, she is 17 years younger than Biden.)\n\n\u201cA generation that actually has governed during the Trump era, which I think is key,\u201d she said during a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. \u201cI was able to navigate this Congress during and before Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Klobuchar has repeatedly questioned and criticized policy ideas embraced by the two most prominent liberals in the race \u2014 Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 that she says are too costly and would be paid for by the already strapped middle class. That includes Medicare-for-all, which Klobuchar calls \u201ca bad idea\u201d that would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance plans, and making four-year colleges tuition free, which she says would force blue-collar workers to foot tuition bills of \u201crich kids.\u201d\n\nThese sorts of ideas \u201care better left in the college faculty lounge,\u201d Klobuchar said in Detroit last week \u2014 which sounded like a jab at Warren, a former law professor, although Klobuchar insisted it wasn\u2019t. Klobuchar has said that although Warren has a plethora of plans, her own plans \u201chave deadlines\u201d and are more likely to be passed and implemented.\n\nVia a small charter plane, Klobuchar recently took a whirlwind two-day trip through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three usually Democratic states that gave Trump the White House. During the trip she made sure to note that in 2018 she won 42 Minnesota counties that voted for Trump two years earlier, when he came surprisingly close to winning her home state.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKlobuchar said that presidential candidates need to keep voters in these states in mind now \u2014 and that a more moderate candidate would have better success there during a general election.\n\nDuring a visit to a carpentry training center in Pittsburgh, Klobuchar often finished the sentences of her tour guides as they spoke of the dire need for welders and their frustration that some parents push their kids into four-year colleges when a trade school would be a better fit.\n\nShe said the government should double the amount of money given to students through Pell grants, increase the income cap to qualify for those grants and make one- and two-year-degree programs free.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are so focused sometimes on one path to success and that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s path to success, and we need to make it easier for students to go to programs like this,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nThe next day, she took artisanal doughnuts to United Auto Workers members striking outside a General Motors assembly factory in Detroit.\n\n\u201cI stand with you guys,\u201d she told them. \u201cYou stood with the company when it was in trouble, right? Took a bunch of cuts, did things. And now the company is doing better, and you should share in that prosperity.\u201d\n\nSome responded positively.\n\n\u201cShe said all the right things \u2014 which they do, but she seemed heartfelt and genuine, and you don\u2019t usually get that from politicians,\u201d said Meoshee Edwards, 47, who has worked at the plant for 23 years, likes Sanders and knew nothing about Klobuchar before she showed up. \u201cShe seems to know exactly what we\u2019re fighting for and why we\u2019re fighting for it. . . . I am going to research her now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Klobuchar wasn\u2019t warmly embraced everywhere. During a tour of a dairy farm in rural Wisconsin \u2014 home to a young calf named \u201cAmy\u201d in her honor \u2014 a few of the local farmers who had gathered to meet her were upset that she spent more time talking to the media than to them. Later that day, she stopped by a training session in Milwaukee to share her ideas for expanding voting access with a group of African American activists and take a few questions about her time as a prosecutor. As she took a photograph with the group, one man declined to be included because he said she hadn\u2019t taken enough questions and hadn\u2019t fully answered the questions she was asked.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout the trip, Klobuchar made clear that to her, being a moderate isn\u2019t just about policy \u2014 it\u2019s also about her tone and approach. That\u2019s meant focusing on issues and legislation that Republicans are willing to work on, even if it doesn\u2019t excite a lot of Democratic primary voters. It has meant remaining calm and collected while questioning Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination hearing. It has meant being the un-snazzy mom on the debate stage who scolds the others when they bicker.\n\n\u201cWe need to not just change the policies in our country, but also change the tone of our politics,\u201d Klobuchar said to cheers in a Milwaukee coffee shop last week.\n\nAD\n\nSitting in the audience was Nancy Glissman, 59, who drove more than two hours with her husband from Illinois to be there. For many years, Glissman voted for Republicans for president but then voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. With Trump in office, she is now firmly a Democrat.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think Amy could lead us out of this without being divisive to our country,\u201d said Glissman, who is retired. \u201cWe need somebody strong, but somebody that everyone can trust and get around. I think she\u2019s that kind of person.\u201d\n\nGlissman sat with Brenda Dourseau, 60, a retired corrections officer who said the party needs to focus on reconnecting with young voters like her grandchildren \u2014 and she wasn\u2019t sure whether Klobuchar was the person to do that.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe need a candidate that can really touch these millennials. If they can lead them and get them excited, then [baby boomers] are going to follow, because we know that we have to get Trump out of there,\u201d she said. Democrats \u201cneed to go to the younger voters. They truly do.\u201d\n\nTom Glissman, Nancy\u2019s husband, said that he would give Klobuchar more consideration if she were doing better in the polls. He is leaning toward Warren \u2014 although he wishes she would abandon her calls for Medicare-for-all and instead embrace offering a public option, as Klobuchar has done.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI love Elizabeth Warren, I really do, but she\u2019s just a little too far left,\u201d Dourseau said. \u201cWith all of the fire in the belly she has \u2014 if she was a little more moderate, she would be a shoe-in.\u201d\n\nAll three agreed that they would vote for any Democrat in the general election.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait until this nightmare is over,\u201d Glissman said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until this Trump presidency is over. I will sleep better.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d Dourseau said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. The country is a mess.\u201d\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.", "description": "The Minnesota Democrat has tried to sell herself as an answer to the party\u2019s upper-Midwestern woes \u2014 but has yet to find traction.", "authors": ["Jenna Johnson", "National Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/S-oUzQy0Ot686uu0_kWDbVMzG2Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2DHJBXASYI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
