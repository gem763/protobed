When asked about what it means to have the Nats break through in a city where politics is its own sport, Rizzo weighed how the politics and power of the nation's capital have elevated the significance of this series.\n\n\"It's an incredible story -- we had a 0.1% chance of winning the National League pennant,\" Rizzo told ABC News' Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Jonathon Karl. \"The prognosticators didn't factor in or analyze the heart of this club.\"\n\nAfter having the third-worst record in Major League Baseball in May, the Nationals stunned the baseball world by surging back to secure a wild card spot against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nABC\n\n\"We can't undersell what this means for the D.C. area. I think the D.C. atmosphere is something special to these players,\" he said. \"The atmosphere of the city is palatable. They feel it, they sense it and they love it.\"\n\nTwo of the most recognizable names on the Nationals roster are veteran first baseman Ryan Zimmerman and 21-year-old outfielder Juan Soto.\n\nRizzo said Zimmerman, the team's first draft choice after moving from Montreal to Washington in 2005, brings a calmness to the team that allows him to thrive in the biggest moments.\n\n\"He excels between the lines and in the dugout, in the clubhouse and in the community. He's a Washingtonian through and through,\" he said. \"He's up there with the greats.\"\n\nPatrick Semansky/AP, FILE\n\nKarl noted to Rizzo that Soto may be the greatest player at the age of 20 he's ever seen.\n\nRizzo agreed, adding that Soto and Zimmerman are exactly the type of franchise cornerstones every successful team must have.\n\n\"We're looking under every rock to find a Juan Soto,\" he added.\n\nDuring most games, Rizzo sits in the first few rows with the team's analytics and operations personnel to discuss the game, but this is the World Series, he said.\n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images\n\n\"Tonight's game is a little different. We're going to be fans like everybody else,\" Rizzo said Friday. \"There's little we can do to affect the outcome of the game. ... I asked them to just let their hair down and enjoy the game.\"\n\nThe winning streak was broken for the Nationals Friday night, however, with the Astros taking home a 4-0 win.\n\nThe World Series picks back up Saturday night in Washington.\n\nPowerhouse Politics podcast is a weekly program that posts every Wednesday, and includes headliner interviews and in-depth looks at the people and events shaping U.S. politics.
