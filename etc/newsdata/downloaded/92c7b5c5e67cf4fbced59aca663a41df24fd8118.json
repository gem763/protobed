We are expecting the weather to turn, the wind has already started to pick up. We are expecting 4-metre waves ahead.\n\nOf course this will test the patience and the endurance of the people aboard Aquarius. These people have already spent a lot of time at sea and tell us that they are looking forward to finally reaching European shores.\n\nAnelise Borges, aboard Aquarius for euronews.", "description": "Migrants face misery of high seas and winds in cramped conditions before landfall.", "authors": ["Robert Hackwill"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/18/00/76/1000x563_cmsv2_af71009d-5a27-54ed-b257-aa279b8bcd65-3180076.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-13"}
