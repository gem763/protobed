But instead, followers found it looking similar to that of tattoos inked during the Holocaust.\n\nNew ink: Chrissy Teigen, 33, shared on Thursday her forearm tattoo with numbers to represent the birthday's of each of her family members\n\nLook like something?

It was originally placed on a prisoner's upper left chest before moving to the outer side of the left forearm.\n\nThese tattoos also were performed with blue ink, leaving permanent marks on the prisoner's body.\n\n'At least it's not blue ink...It's unfortunate but it's her tattoo,' another person wrote about the fresh tattoo.\n\nThe artist: The tattoo in black ink was done by celebrity tattoo artist Daniel Winter, who has previously inked celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga\n\nHorrific: People who were imprisoned in concentration camps received a forearm tattoo (pictured is one survivor's tattoo) as a way for authorities to identify each individual\n\nUpset: There were commenters who were surprised no one else made the connection to the Holocaust after seeing the tattoo\n\nNot good: Although most of the comments on Chrissy's post was positive, there were some people who were upset by the tattoo\n\nUnfortunate: Chrissy has not addressed any of the recent controversy surrounding her new forearm tattoo\n\nPeople who were upset by the tattoo choice expressed how Chrissy should've been more aware about what numbers on the forearm symbolize for specific communities.\n\n'Chrissy I love you I just wish people were more aware of the connection to the holocaust when they elect to get forearm tattoos of numbers,' one fan wrote.\n\nSome people attempted to come to the defense of Chrissy by saying she was using birthdays to be sentimental, making her tattoo completely different from the ones inked on Holocaust prisoners.\n\nBut these defenses did not halt the criticisms from specific commenters.\n\nChrissy has not addressed any of the recent controversy surrounding her new tattoo.\n\nThe model did receive a majority of positive comments about the new ink, though, after she unveiled it on Thursday.\n\nHinting that she had no reason to forget birthdays now, Chrissy's husband John commented: The ultimate mnemonic device!'\n\nOther commenters said they 'loved' the tattoo and stated it 'looked so good'.", "description": "Chrissy, 33, shared on Thursday her forearm tattoo with numbers to represent the birthday's of each of her family members. people believed it was reminiscent\u00a0of Holocaust tattoos.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19316666-0-image-a-3_1570225337801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
