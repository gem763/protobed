It's disappointing. They're just not bothered.'\n\nShe added: 'It was an tragic accident. But it has been made worse with the inability of our Government and police force in getting the answers to our questions.'\n\nDescribing the effect of the incident on Harry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, Mrs Harber said they needed 'time to reflect on what has happened'.\n\n'It's been a whirlwind and very hard for them,' she added.\n\nMr Harber said there was a sense of 'cover-up', and the family had still not received a satisfactory answer about when exactly Mrs Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity status was confirmed.\n\n'No-one really seems to want to give the correct answers,' said the 49-year-old.\n\n'We don't even know when she left the country, and that's important information.'\n\nHarry Dunn is pictured as a young boy holding his newborn niece, Lorna and Colin's baby, Lola Harber\n\nHarry's twin brother Niall has previously said Mrs Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity had felt 'like a punch in the face'.\n\nPictured: Anne Sacoolas, 42, wife of US diplomat Jonathan Sacoolas\n\nHarry's family want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK to answer key questions, not least about what happened as the teenager lay fatally injured.\n\n'Harry lost his life in a tragic incident,' said Mrs Harber, 29.\n\n'We need to know if Anne Sacoolas got out and comforted Harry. The thought of him being left on the grass verge on his own is devastating.\n\n'We need her to give us those answers, so we can grieve. We just want the truth.'\n\nMr Harber said he also believed the authorities' response to the incident had been impacted upon by sensitivities surrounding the fact Mrs Sacoolas was the wife of a US diplomat.\n\nHe said: 'Both administrations thought 'they're just some little family from Northamptonshire, this is all going to go away and disappear'.\n\n'But we've got fire in our bellies and promised Harry we would get justice \u2013 and we will.'\n\nA GoFundMe page to raise money for the family's legal costs has so far collected more than \u00a370,000.", "description": "Harry Dunn's stepsister Larna Barber and her husband Colin travelled from their home in Brackley to the US on Monday to keep Harry's case in the public eye.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20379074-0-image-a-15_1572445137816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
