The family did not know when they would be able to buy more.\n\n1 / 26 Slideshow \"I breakfast on either an arepa or a tamale, to eat, at least two times a day,\" said Mirella Rivero, posing with her son Jose Rivero.

The study of nearly 1,500 families found rising percentages of carbohydrates in diets, and found that 12 percent of those interviewed do not eat three meals a day. Government supporters have long pointed proudly to the improvement in eating under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who used oil income to subsidize food for the poor during his 14-year rule and won United Nations plaudits for it. But President Nicolas Maduro, Chavez's successor, has faced a collapse in the price of oil, which provides almost all foreign income. He further has blamed an opposition-led \"economic war,\" though critics deride that as an excuse. Either way, Venezuelans are tired and cross.\n\nA minimum wage is now only around 20 percent of the cost of feeding a family of five, according to one monitoring group.
