Suffice to say, Brown has had his fair share of dealings with the league office in just a few months.\n\nHis future in the NFL is also murky. The league is currently investigating the accusations made against him and could place him on the commissioner's exempt list if he's signed by another team. That, along with his Twitter tirade last Sunday aimed at several people\u2014including Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2014may keep teams from signing him for now.\n\nAdd in the fact that Brown has been three different teams in less than a calendar year, requesting a trade from two of them, and it's clear teams are justified in being very cautious.", "description": "Former Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots wideout   Antonio Brown  reportedly is set to make  NFL  history by becoming the first player \"poised to file ...", "authors": ["Timothy Rapp"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/565/hi-res-ab3de1a2093153c6af448a952a392a93_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
