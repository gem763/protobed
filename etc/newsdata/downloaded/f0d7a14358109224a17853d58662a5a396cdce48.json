The victory also eliminated the Phillies from winning the NL East.\n\nBut there was no celebrating in the postgame clubhouse, as the team remained concerned about utility man Charlie Culberson, who was struck directly on the right cheekbone by a 91 mph fastball in the seventh on the first pitch by Nationals reliever Fernando Rodney.\n\n\u201cHe was good when he went to the hospital. I mean, he was alert and all of that stuff,\u201d Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said of Culberson, who was pinch-hitting for starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz with two on and no out in the seventh of a 1-1 game.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t any of the extent of what\u2019s going on yet. We are just praying for him and his family. That\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nCulberson was helped to his feet with a towel pressed to his face and taken off the field on the back of a cart on his way to a hospital.\n\nSnitker then launched into a tirade against crew chief Tim Timmons that got the manager thrown out of the game for the 13th time, including four this season.\n\nTimmons assessed Culberson a strike since he squared up to bunt. The ball never made contact with the bat.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bunt when the ball is coming at your face,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cThat just sounds like \u2026 My God. I am not going to even get into that. I am sitting there looking at this guys, pooling blood on the ground. And I am like, \u2018Come on.\u2019\u201d\n\nSnitker was much more subdued after the game, at one point becoming choked up and nearly shedding a tear while talking about Culberson.\n\nHis players shared the sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt was very tough to see that. He\u2019s a phenomenal human being. One of the best teammates you could have,\u201d Foltynewicz said. \u201cI look up to him as a father. He actually has three kids. It his kid\u2019s birthday today, one of them. I want to be just like him as a father.\u201d\n\nThe Braves (93-57) did not miss a beat after Culberson was taken off the field and seemed to rally behind their fallen teammate.\n\nAcura and Ozzie Albies hit back-to-back doubles that drove in runs and ignited another bullpen meltdown for the Nationals.\n\nWander Suero (5-8) was charged with the loss, as the Washington bullpen gave up nine runs over the final four innings.\n\nFoltynewicz (7-5) earned the win after tossing six solid innings, allowing an earned run on four hits and striking out five. The Braves have won the last 11 games he has started dating to June 11.\n\nAtlanta will be making consecutive postseason appearances for the first time since 2012-13. The Braves reduced their magic number to clinch their 19th NL East title to four.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBraves: 1B Freddie Freeman (right elbow soreness) was back in the lineup after leaving Friday\u2019s game in the fourth inning for precautionary reasons. He was hitless in four at-bats with a strikeout and an intentional walk. Freeman said he knew he was good to go when he raised his arm in the shower to wash his hair.\n\nNationals: C Kurt Suzuki (right elbow inflammation) ran sprints and emulated blocking pitches in the bullpen prior to Saturday\u2019s game after taking swings in the batting cage Friday. He has not played since Sept. 7 and is still not throwing a baseball.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is getting the inflammation out of his elbow,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nRookie Raudy Read caught Saturday\u2019s game. Yan Gomes received a day off after catching seven consecutive games.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ronald Acuna Jr. ignited a four-run rally with the go-ahead, two-run double, and the NL East-leading Atlanta Braves clinched a playoff berth with a 10-1 victory over the Washington Nationals on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Swatek"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/braves_nationals_baseball_26226_c0-115-2768-1728_s1770x1032.jpg?558abcb68d80a2b354e18878d2f9a73b7639c8d5", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
