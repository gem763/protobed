As a result, it ended up untreated in landfill sites.\n\n\"That means, if we were confronted with a long line of trucks fully loaded with the plastic from e-waste, there would be more than 62,000 trucks stretching from Rome to Frankfurt,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"What is astonishing in all of this is that the recovery rate is so low. We can do substantially better.\"\n\nOne driver for the unprecedented growth in e-waste includes the notion of \"leap-frog\" technology.\n\nThis may involve parts of the world going straight to communicating and working on mobile networks (in some cases straight to 5G).\n\nIn this way, they skip the extensive and costly infrastructure associated with landline infrastructure.\n\nThis means that more than half of the world's population now have access to the internet or a mobile phone.\n\nThis means that there has been an explosion in the volume of demand for electronic devices, such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones.\n\nAlso, the amount of time before someone replaced their device with a newer model has fallen in recent years.\n\nAll of this is driving up the annual volume of e-waste.\n\nThe health hazards of the unregulated disposal sites of e-waste in regions of Africa and Asia have been well documented.\n\nWe also have a good understanding of the risks to people involved in the unregulated recycling of e-waste components.\n\nFor example, mercury poisoning is a serious risk to those who use soldering irons to free electronic components.\n\nThinking less, acting more\n\nWhile there is a growing awareness of the threats posed by plastic waste in general, little or no attention is placed on the impact of the waste plastic from the millions of disposed electronic devices around the world.\n\n\"Firstly and foremost, we want to raise awareness among consumers on the benefits of recycled plastics in electronics,\" explained Violeta Nikolova from PolyCE (Post-Consumer High-tech Recycled Polymers for a Circular Economy).\n\n\"We would also like consumers to start thinking more about the components of products, in the same way they're looking into appearance or design quality,\" she told BBC News.\n\nThe project's campaign is scheduled to run for two years until 2021.\n\nWhile plastics are essential for making many different components of electronic and electrical products, industry experts in the PolyCE consortium's network said products can be designed in ways that make material recovery of plastic components easier.\n\nMs Nikolova added: \"It is the beginning of this conversation. We are aware that it's not going to have immediate results but it would perhaps be the beginning of something that will that will create momentum.\"", "description": "Consumers need to demand electronic devices that use recycled plastic, campaigners say.", "authors": ["Mark Kinver", "Environment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1061F/production/_109230176_044099100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
