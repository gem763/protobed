That\u2019s partly due to deteriorating fiscal metrics caused by bailouts for state-owned companies such as Eskom.\n\n\n\nWhile price growth has shifted close to the middle of the band of 3% to 6%, expectations remain above 4.5%, suggesting that the rate has not yet been anchored at the midpoint, according to the Reserve Bank.\n\n\u201cWere inflation lower, the repo outlook could be more accommodative,\u201d it said. \u201cIf the sovereign risk premium were to come down, the neutral rate would moderate and monetary policy would enjoy more space. However, even a significantly more expansionary repo stance would very likely not deliver growth rates adequate to South Africa\u2019s challenges, given acute constraints elsewhere in the economy.\u201d\n\nBusiness groups and the Reserve Bank have urged the government to implement structural reforms. The National Treasury published a policy paper in August proposing a raft of steps that could increase the average economic growth rate by 2.3 percentage points and create more than a million jobs over a decade.\n\nSeveral of the ruling African National Congress\u2019s alliance partners have rejected it.\n\nPolicy Uncertainty\n\n\u201cThere are risks a change in the environment could force an outright-tight policy stance,\u201d the central bank said. \u201cTo control these risks, South Africa needs reforms. These are likely to entail some short-term pain. The cost of postponing reforms further, however, is rising.\u201d\n\nFinance Minister Tito Mboweni will present the mid-term budget on Oct. 30 and is expected to confirm a larger shortfall than projected in February after an additional R59bn bailout for Eskom. Investors are cautious of fiscal dynamics, with long-run sustainability coming in to question, the Reserve Bank said.\n\nSlowing wage growth, weak expansion in the tertiary sector and trade surpluses due to less imports show the economy has a shortage of demand. GDP will probably expand 0.6% this year and the potential growth rate has fallen to about 1%.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee left its benchmark rate at 6.5% last month after a 25 basis-point cut in July. Its quarterly projection model points to the rate being unchanged until the end of 2021.\n\nWhile weak demand should respond to interest-rate adjustments, policy uncertainty is a \u201cproblem larger than monetary policy,\u201d the central bank said. Business confidence is at the lowest level in more than three decades and an index measuring sentiment in the manufacturing sector fell to the weakest since August 2009 last month.\n\n\u201cWhere monetary policy enjoys margin for maneuver, weak demand is a problem that can be addressed with interest rates,\u201d it said. \u201cSupply-side shocks and policy uncertainty, however, are beyond the reach of the Reserve Bank.\u201d", "description": "The South African Reserve Bank\u2019s ability to cut interest rates to boost the economy is limited by political and policy uncertainty and inflation that\u2019s still not sufficiently anchored at the midpoint of its target range.", "authors": ["Rene Vollgraaff"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8228/3460197533b44cf192a17ab751b7c315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
