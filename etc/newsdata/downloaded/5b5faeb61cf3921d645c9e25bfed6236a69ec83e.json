And reads all my articles? Well, I can\u2019t say for certain, but yes. Totally. 100 percent. Otherwise there\u2019s no way the brand new AirPods Pro would be the way they are.\n\nIn case you aren\u2019t aware, yesterday Apple announced the new version of its true wireless earbuds. They feature noise-canceling tech, an ambient awareness mode (the company refers to this as \u201ctransparency\u201d), improved sound, and removable ear tips \u2014 something you can read about in more detail here.\n\nBut, what has got me convinced Mr. Tim Apple has been tracking me is how eerily similar these new updates are to an article I wrote earlier in the year telling Apple how they could\u2019ve made the AirPods better.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Well, let\u2019s have a look at what I advised and compare it to the reality.\n\n\u201cStop [the AirPods] from falling out by using some goddamn grips\u201d: Check. While the old AirPods were just sticks of smooth plastic, the AirPods Pro have flexible tips you can remove to get a perfect seal around your earholes. In other words, Apple has effectively added some grip to stop the AirPods Pro from falling out. Nice.\n\nCheck.

Nice. \u201cA way to control volume control on the AirPods themselves\u201d: A fail on this one, but you can\u2019t have everything. Apple did put controls for the noise-canceling and ambient mode options on the AirPods themselves though, so I feel I still won a spiritual battle here.\n\nA fail on this one, but you can\u2019t have everything.

Compared to the old models, the AirPods Pro\u2019s flexible silicone tips should reduce the amount of sound leakage.\n\nCheck again!

Apple put a new driver in the AirPods Pro, which provides bass down to 20Hz. Also, the company has introduced a feature called \u201cAdaptive EQ,\u201d which tunes the sound you\u2019re hearing to the shape of your ear. In practice, this should deliver a richer, fuller, and more bass-y tone.\n\nAnother point, another check. Apple put a new driver in the AirPods Pro, which provides bass down to 20Hz.

I did see rumors about the AirPods Pro coming in a range of different colors, but that looks to have been a big old lie. I would like the option for a black or gray pair of AirPods though, as those white ones are pretty damn conspicuous.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty accurate list, right? Almost\u2026 too accurate. Almost like Apple used it as a design guide for the AirPods Pro.\n\nSo, Tim, I know you\u2019re reading this. Drop me an email or send me a DM \u2014 I\u2019ve got an invoice that needs sorting.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
