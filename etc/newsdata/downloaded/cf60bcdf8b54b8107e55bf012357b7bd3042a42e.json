The feature apparently works, because it just caught someone keying the bejesus out of a Tesla Model 3. And now that person has turned herself in to face criminal charges.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently been covering the many woes of Tesla\u2019s \u201cSmart Summon\u201d feature, which is meant to allow Teslas to drive themselves slowly through parking lots to their owners. But though the California-based car company has suffered gaffes like cars crashing while being smart-summoned, so too has it enjoyed triumph.\n\nReports Of Tesla Smart Summon Crashes Are Now Under Investigation The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) isn\u2019t so thrilled with Tesla\u2019s rollout of a feature that automatically summons the company\u2019s vehicles in parking lots, telling Reuters they are investigating resulting crashes. Read more\n\nWe showed one example of this back in March, when a Tesla used its Sentry Mode to record alleged thieves breaking into the car. Now there\u2019s a more recent incident from last weekend in Broomfield, Colorado \u2014 one that involves a Tesla Model 3's Sentry Mode capturing footage of someone apparently keying the car\u2019s doors. Check it out:\n\nThe news comes from Denver\u2019s CBS4, who spoke with the Tesla Model 3's owner, Alan Tweedie, who described how his car\u2019s feature caught footage of the apparent vandal in a school parking lot. From the news site:\n\nTweedie said he found the damage when he got home. That\u2019s when he decided to test his car\u2019s newest feature: nine motion-activated cameras found in several strategic places. \u201cThen I found one where a woman distinctly came around with a key in her hand, dug it right in the side, walked it all the way up,\u201d Tweedie said. \u201cVery angry, very purposeful, definitely trying to conceal it.\u201d\ufeff\n\nThe video above shows the clip taken by one of the Model 3's cameras, apparently showing a woman keying the side of the car. That footage was evidently instrumental in solving the case, with CBS4 writing:\n\nWithout video, this type of crime would be difficult to investigate due to the usual lack of physical evidence, a spokesperson for Broomfield police said.\ufeff\n\nOn top of that, the Broomfield Police Department wrote on its Facebook page that the video yielded \u201chundreds of tips,\u201d and that police eventually identified the suspect who on Wednesday night \u201cturned herself in and was booked at the Broomfield Detention Centre on the charge of Criminal Mischief, a class 6 felony.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the community\u2019s help solving this case,\u201d the police\u2019s post concludes.\n\nCBS4 says officers estimate that repairing the paint damage will cost around $3,000. Tweedie described the long scratch in the CBS4 story, saying:\n\nYou can feel down to bare metal and you can see it\u2019s scratched all the way completely through the paint,\ufeff\n\nThere\u2019s no word on what might have caused the suspect to key this vehicle.\n\nWhile this situation is a pretty crappy one, it does highlight what seems like a pretty good feature. People spend so much money on their cars that it just makes sense to have a way to monitor that huge investment to make sure it\u2019s safe.\n\nIn case you\u2019re curious about how Sentry Mode works, here\u2019s how Tesla describes it on its website:\n\nWhen enabled, Sentry Mode enters a \u201cStandby\u201d state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car\u2019s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an \u201cAlert\u201d state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an \u201cAlarm\u201d state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the centre display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car\u2019s audio system. If a car switches to \u201cAlarm\u201d state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They\u2019ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\nIt seems like a nice, useful way to use the car\u2019s already-existing hardware.
