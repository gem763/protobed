It could result in tough punishments, Paxton signaled, if investigators determine Google broke the law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRoughly 40 state attorneys genera now have signed on to Facebook antitrust probe\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,\u201d he said during an interview with The Washington Post in his office in the Texas capital. Whether it\u2019s standing down or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself, Paxton stressed: \u201cAll of that\u2019s on the table based on what we learn.\u201d\n\nThe probe marks the first major U.S. antitrust action against Google in roughly a decade, after Texas joined other states and the federal government in scrutinizing the company\u2019s search engine in a competition probe that ended without major punishment for the tech giant.\n\nSince then, Paxton said, Washington has failed to pursue key signs that Google and Silicon Valley are in violation of federal law. \u201cAntitrust seems like it hasn\u2019t been focused on for decades, through several administrations, not just Democrats but also Republicans,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cI think this should have been looked at sooner than it is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result is a significant legal and political challenge on the horizon for Google and its executives. Bipartisan in nature, and born out of a belief that the tech industry has escaped government accountability for too long, Paxton and his team said nothing is off limits \u2014 words that threaten a broad review of Google\u2019s business in a way that could reshape not only the company but the rest of Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cIf we end up learning things that lead us in other directions, we\u2019ll certainly bring those back to the states and talk about whether we expand into other areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nFacebook, Google face off against a formidable new foe: State attorneys general\n\nOverseeing an office with nearly 800 lawyers, Paxton emerged this year as a convening force in the sort of antitrust probe that\u2019s long been sought by Democratic and Republican attorneys general alike. Eight states, including Arizona, Nebraska and North Carolina, are helping to steer the Google probe as part of an executive committee, but it\u2019s Texas that started the legal action by sending a legal demand with hundreds of questions to Google on behalf of the group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is not the only probe of the tech giant under way: Investigators at the Department of Justice in Washington also are homing in on Google and its lucrative ad empire, and they sent their own battery of questions to the company this summer. Members of Congress similarly have targeted Google and other tech giants as part of a sweeping review of federal antitrust laws. And European regulators continue to scrutinize Google and its search, ad and smartphone practices, having already slapped it with roughly $9 billion in antitrust fines over the past three years.\n\nFor state attorneys general in the U.S., the driving question comes down to dollars, Paxton said. Ads targeted to people\u2019s browsing behavior are Google\u2019s lifeblood, accounting for much of the company\u2019s roughly $117 billion in revenue last year, according to its financial statements. That puts Google in the pole position in the United States, where it takes in around 37 percent of all digital advertising revenue, according to eMarketer data from February. In search, Google captures even more -- 74 percent -- of the market, the firm computes.\n\nImportantly, ads provide financial fuel for Google\u2019s popular, free services, such as search, email and mapping, as well as its more audacious gambits, including self-driving cars. Paxton acknowledged these products are widely liked around the world, even if he personally doesn\u2019t use all of them regularly. But the attorney general stressed Google\u2019s dominance of the ad industry still has stifled the Internet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Consumers may feel really good about having free searches but the reality is nothing\u2019s free. And if there\u2019s no competition on the Internet for advertising, then consumers, unbeknownst to them, are paying much higher costs for products than they otherwise should,\u201d he said.\n\n50 U.S. states and territories announce broad antitrust investigation of Google\n\nGoogle has sought to tell a different story about its business. Appearing on Capitol Hill in July, Adam Cohen, Google\u2019s director of economic policy, said that Internet advertising is cheaper and more effective than ever before. \u201cWe have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,\u201d he said in testimony. \u201cWe have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.\u201d\n\nBut Paxton said state investigators have heard from a torrent of competitors, particularly in the publishing industry, who say they cannot compete with Google\u2019s scale, meaning they lose out on revenue that might fund their content or services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe vocal opponents include some of Google\u2019s long-time foes, such as News Corp., according to two Texas officials who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations in the probe. The Rupert Murdoch-backed empire previously has complained to antitrust regulators in Europe, Australia and elsewhere that Google\u2019s ad dominance results in fewer dollars for publishers, and News Corp. has gone as far as to call for the tech giant to be broken up at times.\n\nA spokesman for News Corp., James Kennedy, declined to comment on the company\u2019s interactions with Texas. But, he added in a statement: \u201cOur position regarding Google\u2019s damaging anti-competitive behavior and existential threat to journalism has been made clear over the years.\u201d\n\nIn probing those allegations, Paxton and his attorney general allies have turned to one of News Corp.'s past advisers. Among the experts the state has retained is Cristina Caffarra, who has assisted News Corp. and other Google foes on antitrust issues. A competition expert and economist at the consulting firm Charles River Associates, Caffarra boasts deep experience in Brussels, where Google has been repeatedly fined for competition violations. In those cases, including a recent decision finding Google\u2019s Android smartphone violated regional competition laws. Caffarra has supplied considerable economic evidence in opposition to Google\u2019s practices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCaffarra also has worked on behalf of other Google foes, including the Russian search engine Yandex on its complaint in Moscow and the EU about Google\u2019s business practices, she\u2019s indicated in public reports. She declined to comment on her role in the states\u2019 probe, other than to say that she is not working for a corporate client that\u2019s opposing Google presently. But her participation in the states\u2019 effort took center stage in September, when she appeared alongside more than a dozen attorneys general when they announced their plans from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor Google, the states\u2019 probe could easily broaden beyond its ad business and its effects on publishers. Democratic and Republican attorneys general long have criticized the company for the way it collects users\u2019 data and displays its search results, for example, along with the means by which it has piloted Android to become the world\u2019s most widely used smartphone operating system. Some state officials raised these issues when they announced their ads probe in September.\n\nPaxton\u2019s office has additional concerns of its own: Texas is in the early stages of a consumer-protection investigation focused on allegations that Google makes decisions about the content it displays and suppresses that are biased against conservatives. Jeff Mateer, Paxton\u2019s first assistant attorney general, confirmed the state\u2019s interest last week, four months after he aired his concerns at a conference in Omaha that big tech should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d if the industry misrepresents its political neutrality. Google has denied charges that it is politically biased.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJustice Department announces broad antitrust review of big tech\n\nTexas long has long been troubled by Google\u2019s behavior. Roughly nine years ago, it became one of the first to embark on an antitrust investigation of Google when it opened a probe into the way the company presents search results. It was Paxton\u2019s predecessor, Greg Abbott, now the state\u2019s governor, who sought to determine if Google demoted competing services, such as shopping-comparison sites, that rivaled its own offerings, violating a principle that Texas called \u201csearch neutrality.\u201d\n\nTexas issued some of the initial orders demanding key documents from Google, at one point going to court to battle the company over access to information. The answers the state obtained ultimately appeared to influence some of the thinking at the Federal Trade Commission, which assumed the role of Google\u2019s chief investigator in the United States. An inadvertently released staff report from that probe, which ended in 2013, cited emails, memos and other materials obtained by Texas in concluding Google had in fact put its rivals at a disadvantage.\n\nIn the end, though, the FTC opted against issuing steep penalties targeting the company\u2019s search practices, sparking widespread criticism that the federal government had failed to capitalize on the evidence trove that Texas helped amass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGary Reback, a lawyer at the firm Carr & Ferrell and a longtime Google foe, said the documents at the time showed that Google had \u201cjimmied their normal algorithm to demote certain sites.\" It\u2019s hard to \u201cgeneralize\u201d from one investigation to another, he cautioned, \u201cbut what we do know is the Texas attorney general can be effective in getting the kind of information that might lead to government action.\u201d\n\nBut the timing of the states\u2019 latest investigation \u2014 and the optics of their announcement \u2014 still triggered criticism that the attorneys general hoped to leverage their work for political gain. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a advocacy group that opposes antitrust law and has received contributions from Google, blasted the probe in September as an exercise that would \u201cbenefit state AGs\u2019 political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy.\u201d\n\nPaxton, in particular, has issued at least two emails to supporters through his campaign, including an Oct. 2 note that said he needed $25 or more to \u201cfight Google\u2019s dominance over so much of our lives,\u201d including the effects it has on publishers.\n\nAs such scrutiny intensifies, Paxton and his team cautioned they\u2019re at the beginning, not the end, of an investigation. With Google, in particular, \u201ca lot of people just didn\u2019t understand the model\u201d until recently, he said. \u201cThe way it\u2019s been done, it\u2019s been hard to get a grip on what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nWhile he said that the broad, national participation reflects the seriousness of states\u2019 concerns, Paxton stressed they hadn\u2019t reached \u201cany kind of conclusion, there\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever that leads to,\u201d he added, \u201cit leads to.\u201d", "description": "\"We're prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,\" said Paxton, explaining it could mean standing down in the probe or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself. \"All of that's on the table based on what we learn.\"", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bYtoyV0aLdbjbIf0bJuT-FanJes=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KKHXWIGTG4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
