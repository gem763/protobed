President Xi Jinping has required that food and drug safety supervision should be strengthened with the strictest standards and the severest punishment.\n\nAn education campaign, with the theme \"staying true to our founding mission\", was launched throughout the Communist Party of China in June. It urged all Party members to keep firmly in mind the Party's fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people.\n\nSince June, education activities for Party members, including seminars and lectures, have been held in the procuratorial organs at all levels. Zhang Jun, procurator-general of the SPP, urged all Party members at a meeting in June to put what they had learned into their work.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/18/5da913f0a310cf3e97a1d0f0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
