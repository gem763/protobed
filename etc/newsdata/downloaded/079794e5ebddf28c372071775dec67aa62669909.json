Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea level rise, and coastal extreme events are becoming more severe,\" it said.\n\nWhile sea levels rose by around 15 centimeters during the 20th century, \"it is currently rising more than twice as fast \u2014 3.6 mm per year \u2014 and accelerating.\"\n\nThe report predicts that sea levels will \"continue to rise for centuries\" possibly reaching around 30 centimeters to 60 centimeters by 2100, even if countries step up emissions cuts and global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees \u2014 the Paris Agreement's temperature goal.\n\nHowever, \"if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase strongly,\" then sea levels could rise by 60 centimeters to 1.1 meters.\n\nThe changes affect over a billion people.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, a leading scientist working on the report said that Wednesday's assessment also \u201crevised upwards the projected contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to sea level rise by 2100 in the case of high emissions of greenhouse gases,\u201d but cautioned that there are \u201cmajor uncertainties still remaining.\u201d\n\nDebra Roberts, another scientist working on the report, warned that global warming will only be kept to well below 2 degrees \u201cif we effect unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society\" including protecting ecosystems and carefully managing resources.", "description": "Sea levels are currently rising \u2018more than twice as fast\u2019 than in the 20th century and faster than previously estimated, according to the report.", "authors": ["Kalina Oroschakoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1016957366-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
