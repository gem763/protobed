Washington and Moscow have long condemned each other's involvement in the country, and the U.S. currently imposes sanctions on Russia for its support of Assad.\n\nMcGurk resigned from his position in December after Trump's shock announcement that the U.S. would withdraw all its forces from Syria, a move that meant abandoning U.S.-allied Kurdish troops who proved vital in the defeat of the so-called Islamic State's caliphate. Trump later walked back the decision after widespread condemnation from Republicans and Democrats, giving the impression that several thousand U.S. troops would remain in the region to assist its local allies.", "description": "The Trump administration is facing a torrent of criticism after it unexpectedly announced a full U.S. troop withdrawal from northern Syria to allow a long-planned military operation by Turkey.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106167886-1570456612537gettyimages-1174182549.jpeg?v=1570456669", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
