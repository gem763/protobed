REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nEarly market action showed Wall Street\u2019s three main indexes were headed for their third straight day of gains, after ending the previous session on optimism that the two sides could cool off their row before more U.S. tariffs kick in next week.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said trade talks between the U.S. and Chinese officials on Thursday went well, and is set to meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He later in the day.\n\nStill, the S&P 500 .SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI indexes were set for their fourth straight weekly fall, with risk appetite recently taking a hit from weak economic data and headlines about the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nChipmakers, which are heavily exposed to China, rose steadily in premarket trading. Intel Corp (INTC.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) all rose about 1.5%, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) gained 1.3%.\n\nWedbush hiked its price target for shares of the iPhone maker, as the brokerage remained bullish on the official launch of the company\u2019s Apple TV+ video streaming service.\n\nOther gainers included oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which rose 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively as a report of an attack on an Iranian oil tanker lifted oil prices.

S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 28.5 points, or 0.97% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 88 points, or 1.13%.\n\nFocus will shift to earnings next week as market participants brace for the impact of the trade war on Corporate America. Analysts are expecting a 3.1% drop in earnings for the third quarter from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, and that could mark the first decline since 2016.\n\nInvestors are also betting on a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve by the end of the month, to battle an economic downturn in the world\u2019s largest economy.", "description": "U.S. stock index futures rose strongly on Friday, as hopes grew for a partial trade deal and a delay in scheduled U.S. tariff increases, as top negotiators from the United States and China geared up to meet for a second day of talks.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439676713&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A14E", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
