General Assembly on Wednesday in New York. (Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nFor years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world\u2019s most notorious hacks.\n\nBut ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into Democratic Party computers in 2016 \u2014 findings President Trump repeatedly has attacked \u2014 CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and, finally, in July, into a call between the president and his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nThe release Wednesday of the text of that call prompted an ecstatic response on right-wing corners of the Internet. \u201cCROWDSTRIKE IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS,\u201d said one thread Wednesday on the Reddit message board \u201cthe_donald,\u201d devoted to pro-Trump discussion. In another thread, a commenter wrote, \u201cTrump just put \u2018Ukrainian CrowdStrike\u2019 into the consciousness and conversation of every normie that is following this story.\u201d\n\nBut more broadly, the vilification of CrowdStrike, a firm that long has worked closely with U.S. officials, illustrates the shape-shifting nature of misinformation as it moves across media, mixing fact with innuendo before ultimately reaching the president \u2014 owner of the world\u2019s loudest megaphone.\n\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d said Robert Johnston, CEO of Adluminin and a former CrowdStrike investigator who worked on the probe into the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers. \u201cThis is absolute babbling to the president of Ukraine. It\u2019s hard to finger exactly which conspiracy theory he\u2019s subscribing to. But none of them have any grounding in reality.\u201d\n\nThe month before the Ukraine call, Trump voiced dark suspicions about CrowdStrike in a call with Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. That same day, Breitbart News had published a story, based on documents that had emerged in Stone\u2019s trial on charges of lying, obstruction and witness tampering, about how the FBI relied on information from CrowdStrike in its probe of the DNC hack.\n\n\u201cTake a look at Ukraine,\u201d Trump said to Hannity in a conversation that was broadcast on his show. \u201cHow come the FBI didn\u2019t take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said he has come to suspect the DNC server hacked by Russian intelligence agents in 2016 may have been hidden in Ukraine. The president has been known to embrace conspiracy theories, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how he reached that belief about the DNC server or how that would even have been physically possible.\n\n[Trump-Ukraine live updates: Pelosi says rough transcript of Trump call with Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky confirms need for impeachment inquiry]\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the FBI did not take custody of the affected servers, people familiar with FBI hack investigations say the agency often relies on forensic analysis by outside firms, including CrowdStrike, which is among the nation\u2019s most prominent, having handled North Korea\u2019s hack of Sony Pictures in 2014, among others. CrowdStrike said it \u201cprovided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI.\u201d\n\nThe FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike, according to people familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe issue emerged again, on July 25, when Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike during a call in which he also belittled special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and urged investigation of the son of former vice president Joseph Biden. Notes from the call were released Wednesday amid a scandal over whether Trump improperly pressured a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent, using nearly $400 million in expected foreign aid as leverage.\n\nThe nature of Trump\u2019s reference to CrowdStrike is not obvious from the notes the White House released. At one point, he said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say, Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Zelensky appeared to agree to the request, saying his new prosecutor general \u201cwill look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned.\u201d\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity firm\u2019s assertion in June 2016 that Russia had hacked the DNC has been repeatedly confirmed by the Justice Department, members of Congress and Mueller\u2019s office, which indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers last year for their role in the breach.\n\nNevertheless, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists, who have falsely claimed that the company helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a secret party insider.\n\nTrump's comments on Wednesday helped solidify the company as a punching bag for his allies in the right-wing media. Talk-show host Rush Limbaugh said the \u201creference to CrowdStrike, mark my words, is momentous,\u201d and added, \u201cThe Democrats are bent out of shape that Trump even knows about CrowdStrike.\"\n\n[Offical readout: President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky]\n\nPresident Trump has long made CrowdStrike a target. He\u2019s echoed conspiracy theorists in claiming that the company is owned by, as he said in 2017, \u201ca very rich Ukrainian.\u201d The company\u2019s co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russia-born cyber and national security expert and a U.S. citizen. He is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a major Washington think tank whose donors include the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire.\n\nThe company has also been pulled into the QAnon conspiracy theory, after an anonymous author \u2014 purportedly, a top-secret intelligence officer slowly revealing Trump's plot to foil a global pedophile cabal \u2014 claimed last year that CrowdStrike had helped China access Hillary Clinton's emails. (No officials have alleged anything close to that.)\n\nCrowdStrike said in a statement Wednesday that it stands by its \u201cfindings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the U.S. intelligence community.\u201d The $14 billion company saw its stock fall roughly 1 percent Wednesday.\n\nAs CrowdStrike trended on Twitter Wednesday, driven by false claims about the company, Facebook also surfaced misinformation for queries of the firm's name. Among the top results was an article featuring a meme of DNC chairman Tom Perez in a wig along with erroneous claims about the \u201cCrowdStrike ruse.\u201d The site touts itself as \u201cThe First Stop on Your Daily Commute to the Truth.\"\n\nSuspicion about CrowdStrike\u2019s role appears to have first entered the conservative media ecosystem in early 2017, following a BuzzFeed report that the FBI had not requested access to the DNC servers before concluding that they were penetrated by Russian hackers. In January 2017, Breitbart ran an article conveying basic details about the firm\u2019s leadership and raising questions about its ties to Google. (CrowdStrike has plainly advertised investments made by a private equity firm affiliated with Google.)\n\nTwo months later, Tony Shaffer, a member of Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection advisory board, posted on Facebook, \u201cWhen the FBI accepts info from DNC-Hired Cybersecurity Firm & adopts the report as their own we have a big problem.\"\n\nIn June 2017, the conservative news site Daily Caller said \u201ca cloud of doubt (was) hanging over the DNC\u2019s Russia narrative\u201d in part due to the involvement by CrowdStrike, which it said was \u201cFunded By Clinton-Loving Google $$.\" A month later, the conservative Washington Times wrote that \u201cCrowdStrike\u2019s evidence for blaming Russia for the hack is thin.\"\n\nThat theory has been boosted by Stone, Trump's longtime adviser, who has argued in legal filings this year that CrowdStrike's analysis was fatally compromised. Stone and others in Trump's orbit have alleged without evidence that Democratic insiders spearheaded the breach.\n\nTrump\u2019s mention of CrowdStrike suggests he still doubts the intelligence community\u2019s findings of Russian involvement. DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted that it was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d and \u201csurreal\u201d that \u201cTrump used \u201ca call with a foreign leader to push conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nDevlin Barrett and Isaac Stanley-Becker contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump mentioned CrowdStrike in his conversation with the Ukrainian president.
