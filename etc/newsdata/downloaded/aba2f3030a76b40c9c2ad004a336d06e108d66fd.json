Justice?", "language": "en", "text": "Near the end of this year\u2019s hit Broadway show \u201cWhat the Constitution Means to Me,\u201d the audience hears a scratchy old recording of an oral argument at the Supreme Court. The year is 1965, and the justices are debating the topic of married women\u2019s right to birth control. Or that\u2019s the idea, anyway; for what feels like an eternity, the nine black-robed men do little but stammer and clear their throats.\n\n\u201cJust listening to all those male voices deciding cases about female bodies, the absurdity of it hit me so hard,\u201d Heidi Schreck, who wrote and performed the one-woman show, told me. \u201cThere was a gap in their ability to imagine lives that were very different from their own.\u201d\n\nThe scene was on my mind on Tuesday morning as I sat through oral arguments in a landmark trio of L.G.B.T.-rights cases at the Supreme Court. The cases involved three people \u2014 two gay men and one transgender woman \u2014 who were fired from their jobs, they alleged, because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. All three plaintiffs sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nFor two hours, the justices and the lawyers for both sides debated everything from the meaning of the word \u201csex\u201d to the nature of congressional intent to the wisdom of sex-segregated bathrooms. I couldn\u2019t help noticing what was missing: the voice, and the perspective, of an openly L.G.B.T. justice. Instead, nine straight people were deciding whether to afford some of the most basic measures of equality to people who identify as gay or transgender and who make up roughly 5 percent of the United States population , according to a Gallup estimate.", "description": "There might be fewer arguments about bathrooms, for starters.", "authors": ["Jesse Wegman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/13lbgt_sub/13lbgt_sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
