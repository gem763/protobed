Amy Klobuchar say what a good thing it was that we got Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u2014 and then go on to lambaste President Trump and his foreign policy. Ms. Klobuchar failed to mention that it is Democrats like her that keep Mr. Trump from implementing any policy. He cannot get the backing he needs from Democrats because they want all the credit.\n\nThe House and Senate Democrats are all un-American and none gives a hoot about this country\u2019s security.
