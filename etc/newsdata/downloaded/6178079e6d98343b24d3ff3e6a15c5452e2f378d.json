(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe popular anti-anxiety prescription drug Xanax is being recalled over the \u201cpotential presence\u201d of a \u201cforeign substance,\u201d according to a statement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMylan Pharmaceuticals has issued a nationwide recall of a single batch of alprazolam 0.5 mg (the generic version of Xanax), which comes in 500-count bottles and has the lot number 8082708, according to the FDA.\n\nThe medication was distributed in the U.S. between July and August 2019, and has an expiration date of September 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, Mylan Pharmaceuticals is asking retailers to pull the tainted batches from store shelves. This follows on the heels of drugmakers\u2019 recent voluntary recall of the stomach acid-blocking medication Zantac after an investigation revealed that the medications may be contaminated with low levels of a cancer-causing chemical called NDMA (N-Nitrosodimethylamine).\n\nAccording to an FDA statement on the Xanax recall, the risk of becoming ill from the contaminated medication is unlikely. \u201cClinical impact from the foreign material, if present, is expected to be rare,\u201d the statement said, \u201cbut the remote risk of infection to a patient cannot be ruled out. To date, Mylan has not received any adverse events related to this batch.\u201d\n\nMylan has not yet clarified what the \u201cforeign material\u201d is. A spokesperson for the pharmaceutical company would only refer Yahoo Lifestyle to their released statement.\n\nIf your medication is part of the batch being recalled, do not continue to take it. Instead, Mylan recommends contacting Stericycle, a medical waste disposal company, at 1-888-843-0255, which will provide the documentation packet to return the product to Stericycle.\n\n\u201cConsumers should contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to using this drug product,\u201d said the FDA in a statement. They can also report it to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The popular anti-anxiety prescription drug Xanax is being voluntarily recalled over the \u201cpotential presence of foreign substance,\u201d according to the Food and Drug Administration.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2i2ZR2JIAFNKGo1rD_moLw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d98393a0-fa74-11e9-9fdf-d1cd9b98f54a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
