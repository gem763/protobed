But it wasn't easy. @ronnieo147 fights back from 2-0 down to win 4-3. \ud83d\udc4f \ud83c\udfb1 Watch the #EnglishOpen LIVE:\n\n\ud83d\udcfa \u2013 Eurosport 1\n\n\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udda5 \u2013 Eurosport Player: https://t.co/0Fa7uXMVB9 pic.twitter.com/GcZNJ5eKYS \u2014 Eurosport UK (@Eurosport_UK) October 14, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Sullivan started the game with reckless abandon, playing some outrageously aggressive shots to afford his opponent numerous chances.\n\nO\u2019Neill showed that this was a seriously perilous tactic in the first frame when he stepped in to make a break of 114 to take the lead.\n\nThe Rocket was no more circumspect in the second frame, taking on a low-percentage plant on a red which would ultimately cost him the frame and give O\u2019Neill a 2-0 lead in a race to four.\n\nStill the five-time champion would not relent in his ultra-attacking style, stroking in an ill-advised double, but then missing a difficult long blue to give his opponent yet another chance. However, O\u2019Neill missed an easy long red and Ronnie stepped in, made a rapid-fire 90 and halved his deficit.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan took his average shot time to less than 14 seconds with that impressive break and certainly did not look like he was planning a long night in Crawley.\n\nThere was more of the same in the next as O\u2019Neill missed an early opportunity afforded to him, allowing the Rocket to step back in and breeze round the table, making 102 to level the match.\n\nThe fifth frame started with the first real safety battle of the match, dragging both men\u2019s average shot time up somewhat, it was O\u2019Neill who broke the deadlock with an impressive long red before putting together a tricky and impressive break of 63.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Sullivan stepped back in with a good chance but missed a straight forward pink, although there was a hint of a kick, and the world number 105 returned to go within one frame of victory.\n\nO\u2019Neill was in again early in the sixth and looking assured, but on 33 he clipped a red with his cue when hampered on a shot, letting the Rocket back in.\n\nHe took more than a couple of visits to the table to get over the line, but he did just that and forced a decider.\n\nA poor red from O\u2019Neill gave O\u2019Sullivan the first chance in the final frame, but he could only make 17 before missing a pink, however, he came back to the table with a two-point lead and another chance to wrap up victory. He made 81 and booked a spot in the second round.\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan says he could still have 15 years left at the top of snooker\n\nMORE: Snooker\u2019s English Open returns to Crawley in defiance of Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s \u2018hellhole\u2019 comments", "description": "Ronnie O'Sullivan survived a serious scare in round one of the English Open as he came from behind to scrape past world number 105 Jamie O'Neill 4-3.
