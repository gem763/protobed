They have a strong way of playing, they are well drilled (and) efficient,\u201d Lampard told reporters.\n\n\u201cThey are fantastic, the two strikers, the way they play together. They can give you big problems. It\u2019s a tough match... it will be a physical battle.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been good, I\u2019ve watched a lot of their games. They\u2019re scoring goals. They had a tough time at the early stages of last season (but) they are always a difficult game.\u201d\n\nChelsea have won six consecutive games in all competitions and are fourth in the league standings.\n\nAlthough Lampard is not looking too far ahead, he said he was pleased with his side\u2019s progress, especially after keeping two clean sheets in narrow 1-0 wins.\n\n\u201cWhether we win lose or draw my thoughts go to the next game but my thoughts don\u2019t go too far ahead,\u201d he added. \u201cI like it at the moment but I like to temper it a little bit with edginess.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased with the last six games (but) we could have picked up points at the beginning of the season.\n\n\u201cNewcastle was difficult for us, but we created a lot and kept a clean sheet. The pleasure from Ajax was probably the most that we had all season... We kept a clean sheet with our desire.\u201d\n\nLampard confirmed Antonio Rudiger, N\u2019Golo Kante, Andreas Christensen and Ross Barkley will miss the trip to Turf Moor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know (when Kante will return), I just want him fit,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe might be suffering from the big injury at the end of last season, there is no timeframe.\n\n\u201cRudiger had a bad injury, this is a fallout of last season, that is the nature of it... but he is close.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea must expect a physical battle when they play a \"well drilled\" Burnley side in the Premier League on Saturday and should keep a watchful eye on their two strikers Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes, manager Frank Lampard said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444879610&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O154", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
