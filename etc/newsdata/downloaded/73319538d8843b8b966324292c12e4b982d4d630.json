His government brought in a carbon tax to fight the climate crisis \u2013 but also paid billions to rescue a stalled pipeline project.\n\nMacCalder said he felt Trudeau has lost much of his appeal \u2013 likening the prime minister to Barack Obama, the former US president who swapped boundless hope for a bleaker pragmatism in his second term \u2013 but he nonetheless voted for the Liberals on Monday.\n\n\u201cI think: a good thing for the country and the ability to move forward,\u201d he said of the result.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s own father, Pierre Trudeau, also served his second term of office at the head of a minority government.\n\nBut the younger Trudeau took what experts say is the weakest popular vote ever, in a result which reflects an increasingly fractured country.\n\n\u201cParties are supposed to exist to build bridges and to keep us together. They\u2019re not supposed to exist to leverage different parts of the electorate \u2026 to never try to compromise or grow. This is bad,\u201d Turnbull, the professor, said.\n\nNot a single Liberal was elected in the western Prairie provinces, which Turnbull called a \u201cmajor problem\u201d for Trudeau.\n\nBut while the Conservatives were able to make marginal gains, Monday\u2019s result marked a clear defeat for Scheer, whose campaign pledges to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes failed to resonate with voters.\n\nScheer, who had openly mused about winning a majority in the days leading up to the election, nonetheless issued a stark warning to the Liberals on Monday evening.\n\n\u201cMr Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win,\u201d he told supporters at his concession speech.\n\nBut his own party\u2019s poor performance is likely to raise questions about Scheer\u2019s viability as a leader, after he failed to catalyze voter frustration and topple a wounded Trudeau. Heading into the final weeks, the incumbent prime minister was fending off attacks for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, as well as apologizing for images showing him in blackface.\n\n\u201cIf Scheer couldn\u2019t win now \u2013 when will he?\u201d said Turnbull, pointing out that the Tory leader failed to grow his base beyond the Prairies.\n\nWhile Monday\u2019s result marks a significant erosion of support for the prime minister, the narrow victory will be enough to ensure Trudeau\u2019s signature policies \u2013 including the national carbon tax \u2013 remain in place.\n\nNow, all eyes will be on how Trudeau reaches out to parties with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d deal, in which junior partners support the government on individual pieces of legislation, as opposed to joining in a fully-fledged coalition.\n\nJustin Trudeau's victory is a death knell for Canada's fledgling far-right Read more\n\nThe deal-making will leave the balance of power in the hands of the New Democratic party and the nominally separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nWhile it holds the necessary amount of seats the to prop up a Liberal government, the NDP is also cash-strapped and struggling, having literally mortgaged its office in Ottawa to help fund its national campaign.\n\n\u201cThe last thing the NDP want is an election,\u201d said Turnbull. \u201cBut if the [Liberal] government wants NDP support, they will likely have to make some kind of concession for it.\u201d\n\nSingh \u2013 who failed to convert immense personal popularity into electoral wins \u2013 has made a commitment to fighting climate change and funding healthcare key requirements, meaning Trudeau could steer his government further to the left.\n\nSince Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet took over as leader in January, the Bloc has roared back into relevance\u2013 and is also keen to do business with Trudeau. With 32 seats in parliament, it has more clout than the NDP. While Blanchet vowed to fight any effort that would negatively affect the francophone province, including any pipeline projects, he also left the door open to supporting the Liberals.\n\n\u201cThe government has options,\u201d said Turnbull. \u201cAs much as [Singh\u2019s] got the numbers to be a kingmaker, so too does somebody else. This will be interesting to watch.\u201d", "description": "PM faces landscape that will require skill to pass legislation \u2013 and rivals who could unseat his government on a whim", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31fd6df98062419af91f0d2f78dd2e1b555fbd9f/0_246_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9870ea3e58f4e1ea63a5a4d50bcf7760", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
