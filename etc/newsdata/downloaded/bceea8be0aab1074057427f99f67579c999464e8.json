While some of his supporters told Vox that the jokes are cheeky in-group references that acknowledge Yang\u2019s Asianness, other voters are concerned they reinforce longstanding racist stereotypes about Asian Americans and other minority groups,\" Zhou wrote.\n\nThe piece goes on to quote critics of Yang, one suggesting the stereotypes \"undermine\" his campaign.\n\nANDREW YANG'S CAMPAIGN CASH GIVEAWAY RAISING LEGAL CONCERNS, DESPITE DEM'S CLAIMS\n\n\"Given his role as a high-profile Asian American presidential candidate, his message is setting the tone for how many people may see Asian Americans and perpetuating a damaging caricature in the process,\" Zhou argued. \"Because of his ascent to prominence, however, his words carry significant weight and frame not only his own candidacy, but how Asian Americans are perceived overall.\"\n\nThe Vox writer went on to slam his \"MATH\" campaign slogan, which is an acronym for \"Make America Think Again.\"\n\n\"Here\u2019s a major reason why Yang\u2019s broader use of stereotypes is so harmful: they help reaffirm a trope about Asian Americans commonly known as the \"model minority\" myth, a term that\u2019s pretty much as offensive as it sounds,\" she continued.\n\nThe piece was criticized on social media, with some knocking the author for her \"inability to take a joke.\"\n\nTRUMP WEIGHS IN AFTER WRITER'S ANDREW YANG TWEET\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYang has seen a climb in the polls in recent months.
