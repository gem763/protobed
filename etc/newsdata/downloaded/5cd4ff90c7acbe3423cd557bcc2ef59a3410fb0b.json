But that's not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\"\n\n\"The Irishman\" debuts in select theaters on November 1 in New York and Los Angeles before expanding, and will be available to stream on Netflix on November 27.\n\nBut it won't be playing at major theaters chains like AMC Theatres (the world's largest theater chain), Regal, Cinemark, or Canadian chain Cineplex.
