When I reached him by phone this morning, following House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s release of the full whistle-blower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal, he was, put simply, very angry.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero,\u201d Giuliani told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government,\u201d he continued, sounding out of breath. \u201cAnything I did should be praised.\u201d\n\nRead: What exactly is Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role?\n\nGiuliani unleashed a rant about the Bidens, Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, Barack Obama, the media, and the \u201cdeep state.\u201d He has spoken freely about all these topics since the moment he became a surrogate in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Giuliani has aired far-right conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health on national television. He has discussed his convictions about alleged Biden-family corruption with Trump in the White House residence. Still, until the Ukraine scandal broke, Trump\u2019s allies were almost uniformly supportive of Giuliani to reporters, and current and former administration officials would often praise him for his loyalty.\n\nNot until the back-to-back release of the summary of the Trump-Zelensky call and the full whistle-blower complaint did the mood change among this group.\n\nThis morning, a former senior White House official told me this \u201centire thing,\u201d referring to the Ukraine scandal, was \u201cRudy putting shit in Trump\u2019s head.\u201d A senior House Republican aide bashed Giuliani, telling me he was a \u201cmoron.\u201d Both individuals spoke on condition of anonymity in order to be candid.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of cowards,\u201d Giuliani told me in response. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The president knows they\u2019re a bunch of cowards.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he\u2019s looking forward to watching the State Department \u201csink themselves\u201d as officials try to create distance from him. In the complaint, the whistle-blower wrote that officials, including Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, \u201chad spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to \u2018contain the damage\u2019 to U.S. national security,\u201d and that the ambassadors had tried to help the Ukrainian administration \u201cunderstand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels on the one hand, and from Mr. Giuliani on the other.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked him about this specifically, Giuliani nearly began shouting into the telephone. \u201cThe State Department is concerned about my activities? I gotta believe [the whistle-blower] is totally out of the loop, or just a liar,\u201d he said.\n\nGiuliani went on to say that State Department officials had asked for his assistance. \u201cIf they were so concerned about my activities, why did they ask for my help? Why did they send me a bunch of friendly text messages reaching out for my help, thanking me for my help?\u201d Giuliani said he planned to make sure these \u201cfriendly text messages\u201d came out \u201cin a longer story.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney unleashes in a new phone call with The Atlantic while Trump allies turn on him.", "authors": ["Elaina Plott"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_963760790_copy/facebook.jpg?1569526580", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
