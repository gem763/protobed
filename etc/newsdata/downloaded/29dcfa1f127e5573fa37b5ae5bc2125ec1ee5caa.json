BTC Price Facing Its First Significant Test Right Now", "language": "en", "text": "After creating another leg down that marked another new low since this bear move started, Bitcoin showing signs of recovery.\n\nDespite the above, Bitcoin is currently getting close to its real major test, which is the 200-days moving average line (marked light green on the following daily chart). That line is considered, by many, the ultimate barometer of the market.\n\nIf the price is traded above \u2013 then the bulls are in control of the market and vice versa. On April 2nd, 2019, Bitcoin made a huge daily price surge of 20%, starting the day at $4000, breaking up the $5000 mark along with the 200-days MA line in one decent green candle. The breakout was so strong that since then Bitcoin never saw the $4K prefix again as well as trading below or even near the 200-days MA.\n\nYesterday was the first daily close below the 200-MA since April 1st. This can turn quickly into a bear market. However, Bitcoin is showing some signs of recovery and might prove that this was a fake-out, for the sake of the bulls.\n\nTotal Market Cap: $218 billion\n\nBitcoin Market Cap: $148 billion\n\nBTC Dominance Index: 67.8%\n\n*Data by CoinGecko\n\nKey Levels to Watch\n\n\u2013 Support/Resistance:\n\nAfter a day of consolidation around the $8000 support mark, Bitcoin finally shows some respect to the bulls, with a decent move to the $8300. However, the later support turned resistance couldn\u2019t get breached, and after rejecting, the coin is trading steadily around $8200.\n\nA break of $8300 is likely to lead to $8390 where currently lies the 200-days MA line. If Bitcoin succeeds in closing (daily) above the MA-200, the bulls might start to think positive again. The next obstacles are the support turned resistance levels of $8500 \u2013 $8600 and further above at $9000 and $9400. To get back on the longer-term bullish track, there must be a move back to the triangle area above $9400 (and not test and get rejected).\n\nFrom the bearish side, the first level of support is $8000. Further below is the current move\u2019s low at $7733, before the next support of $7600. Down below is $7200, which is also the Fibonacci level of 61.8% since reaching the 2019 high last June.\n\n\u2013 The RSI Indicator (Daily): After reaching overextended RSI areas for the first time since November 2018, the RSI is showing a little recovery. However, the indicator is still overextended in the oversold territory. This might support a further correction to the upside.\n\n\u2013 The Trading Volume: The huge selling volume is declining over the past days, the sellers\u2019 power is decreasing; but they are still around, and the danger is not over yet.\n\nBTC/USD BitStamp 4-Hour Chart\n\nBTC/USD BitStamp 1-Day Chart\n\nClick here to start trading on BitMEX exchange and receive 10% discount on fees for 6 months.\n\n\n\nby TradingView.\n\nTechnical analysis tools by\n\nCryptocurrency charts by TradingView.Technical analysis tools by Coinigy\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "After creating another leg down that marked another new low since this bear move started, Bitcoin showing signs of recovery.
