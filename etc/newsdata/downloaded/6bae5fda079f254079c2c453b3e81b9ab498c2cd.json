According to the latest data, this comet clocks in at 3.7.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly coming from outside the solar system,\u201d says Gareth Williams, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to revert into something going back into our solar system.\u201d\n\nSometimes, passing by a larger object can jostle small cosmic travelers, but no planetary nudge can explain this kind of orbit, he says.\n\nWilliams is the associate director at the Minor Planet Center, the international organization in charge of confirming discoveries of new objects in the solar system\u2014or, in this case, the stuff just passing through. The center has not yet formally bestowed C/2019 Q4 with the label of \u201cinterstellar,\u201d but Williams and other astronomers say the evidence so far is undeniable.\n\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope\n\nAstronomers are still getting to know this new visitor from beyond. And so far, it\u2019s nothing like the last one.\n\n\u2018Oumuamua was discovered in October 2017 by a telescope in Hawaii programmed to scan the sky for icy comets and rocky asteroids. It didn\u2019t look like that any astronomers had seen before. \u2018Oumuamua is elongated and narrow, like a cigar, a decidedly unnatural shape in a universe where gravity loves to smooth things into spheres. The thing was unusual enough, in fact, that a project to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life, funded by a Russian billionaire, had a radio telescope check it for artificial signals. (It didn\u2019t detect any.)\n\nIt took months for scientists to conclude that \u2018Oumuamua is probably a comet, even though it wasn\u2019t acting like one as it passed the sun. A comet has a tell: When it gets close enough to the sun, some of its ice melts, producing a shimmery tail of gas and dust known as a coma. \u2018Oumuamua showed some signs of gas emission, but it didn\u2019t have the unmistakable cometary haze.\n\nC/2019 Q4 does. \u201cThe behavior has been reasonably straightforward,\u201d says Michele Bannister, a planetary astronomer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \u201cThis is the interstellar object that we expected to see first.\u201d\n\nThe rather uncomplicated nature of C/2019 Q4 only makes \u2018Oumuamua more mysterious. Astronomers have long suspected that celestial bodies from other solar systems pass through our own all the time. Before \u2018Oumuamua came barreling through, they had expected the first one they found to be a clear-cut comet.\n\nIcy objects are the most susceptible to being kicked out of their solar systems and thrust on a journey through interstellar space. The universe can be a turbulent place, especially around a young star, just ignited into existence. Cosmic dust grains around the new orb clump together until they become whole planets and moons. The jostling can send smaller bits and pieces flying deep into space, toward other stars. Astronomers predict that comets\u2014forged at the edges, where their sun is too weak to melt them away\u2014would probably be the first ones out.", "description": "The second known visitor to our cosmic neighborhood from another star is making quite an entrance.", "authors": ["Marina Koren"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/interstellar_object_16/facebook.gif?1568823118", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
