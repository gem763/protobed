The lifestyle I lead is as per the rules and regulations,\" she added.\n\nAlthough the letter she received from the Vatican says she could \"present a new recourse\" if she felt that the ruling was \"against her lawful rights\", she said she had no plans to appeal.\n\n\"I am allowed a second appeal but I don't see any point in doing that since they have made up their mind. I will now go to court on behalf of all the people who are being suppressed and facing illegal behaviour from authorities of the congregation,\" she told the BBC.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why is India's Catholic church silent about sexual abuse?\n\nOther nuns who protested against the Bishop have accused the church in Kerala as well as the Vatican of turning a blind eye towards the incident.\n\nThey say they sent a letter to the Vatican's ambassador to India and even wrote to the Vatican but did not receive a response from either.\n\nThere have also been a number of punitive measures taken against the nuns who protested, including disciplinary warnings and transfer notices.\n\nWhile testifying in a local court, one of them told the judge that the church was attempting to \"sabotage\" evidence in order to protect the Bishop.", "description": "Sister Lucy Kalappura was expelled after protesting against an Indian Bishop accused of rape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10910/production/_109265876_gettyimages-1033627924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
