They can cost up to \u00a310 ($12.90) an hour.\n\nExperts used data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to assess how many children suffered an injury after playing on a trampoline.\n\nDr Nancy Hadley Miller and colleagues will present their findings at a paediatrics conference in New Orleans. The results have not been published in a journal.\n\nResearch is needed to understand why the increase has occurred, the researchers admitted.\n\nBut an 'significant increase' in the odds of a fracture occurring at a place of sport or recreation is thought to be the main reason.\n\nThe authors wrote in an abstract that the increase in fractures 'coincided with a rise in popularity of trampoline parks'.\n\nStudy author Dr Hadley Miller said: 'Historically, advocacy campaigns have focused on trampoline injuries in the home.\n\n'However, our study indicates future messages to parents and legislators should also focus on injuries that happen in these entertainment facilities and businesses outside of the home.\n\n'While trampolines are a great source of fun and exercise for children, the potential for injury, particularly in recreational areas with an underlying business incentive, needs to be recognised.'\n\nMore than half (56 per cent) of all fractures were in the arms or other areas in the upper half of the body.\n\nResearchers blame the emergence of indoor trampoline parks for the trend\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said it was 'concerned' about the US figures, but said the UK have different regulations for safety.\n\nA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Trampoline parks are fun activity and help get kids active but they are not without risk.\n\n'Like all businesses trampoline parks should comply with their legal duty of care to staff and customers.\n\n'We would expect any trampoline park to have a more detailed risk assessment for trampolining activities that takes into account the wide spectrum of their customers' ages and abilities.\n\n'As part of this, trampoline parks should acknowledge the inherent risks associated with their business.\n\n'We are concerned to hear about the accidents in trampoline parks in the US and hope that lessons are learnt and applied from this study.'\n\nIn 2018, a hospital audit in England found ambulances were called out to three incidents at trampoline parks a day.\n\nThe NHS mainly treated broken bones, sprains, and ligament damage after 1,181 call outs, figures from the BBC revealed.\n\nA voluntary safety code was introduced in August by industry body the International Association of Trampoline Parks UK (IATP), British Standards and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.\n\nThis lays down minimum standards for design, construction and operation \u2013 but not all parks are members.\n\nThe findings of the study are being published at The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2019 National Conference and Exhibition in New Orleans.", "description": "Researchers in Colorado blamed the emergence of indoor trampoline parks for the trend and said the risks of these 'fun' birthday party venues needs to be recognised.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20140920-0-image-a-81_1571933036127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
