That\u2019s not a bailout, that\u2019s an investment in the future of our country,\" the Sun-Times reported.\n\nLightfoot said last week that the strike shouldn't even be taking place because she has already given in to many of the union's demands, including offering a 16 percent pay raise, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.\n\n\"We value the workers ... Honoring that value is who I am and what I stand for,\" Lightfoot said, according to publication. \"But I also must be responsible for the taxpayers who pay for everything that goes on.\"\n\nLightfoot said the city's offer would provide \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d for contracts with both the teachers union and SEIU, the labor organization representing bus aides, security officers and others in a similar battle with the city, according to The Chicago Tribune.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSEIU negotiators met separately with the city to express dissatisfaction regarding the pay offer for their members.\n\nBus aides, who work part-time, make an average of $15,759 a year with full health-care coverage while full-time custodians make $34,491 and full-time special education assistants make $36,333, according to the Tribune, which cited a source close to the negotiations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.", "description": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot told the City Council that no\u00a0money is available beyond the billions already committed\u00a0for Chicago Public Schools.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/chicago-teachers-strike-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
