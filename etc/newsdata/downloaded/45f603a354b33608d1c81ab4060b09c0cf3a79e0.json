Zero commitment from the club to employing and training appropriate staff.' Stirling also claimed that United, who last month announced record revenue, were doing things on the cheap.\n\n'It's price-driven,' he added. 'Stick them on minimum wage and accept a high turnover of staff. How can anyone show such a lack of care for an 80-year-old supporter?'\n\nStirling called on United to listen to fans, who have been raising concerns over stewarding at Old Trafford for some time. 'They need to stop seeing supporters as a problem and take our views seriously,' he added.\n\nMeanwhile, it is understood that local MP Kate Green will be raising her concerns over the tragedy in Parliament.", "description": "MIKE KEEGAN AND IAN HERBERT: Manchester United have been accused of showing 'zero commitment to employing and training appropriate staff' in the wake of the death of an 80-year-old.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan", "Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/20/19509840-0-image-a-14_1570735756402.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
