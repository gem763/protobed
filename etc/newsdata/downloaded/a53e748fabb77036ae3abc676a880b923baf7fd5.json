USA TODAY\n\nMost daughters dressing up as their mothers may look a little, well, less glamorous. And probably a little more tired.\n\nBut Stormi Webster's mom is Kylie Jenner.\n\nThe model and cosmetics guru posted pictures to social media Sunday of her daughter dressed up as none other than herself, Kylie Jenner, in what we can only guess is the 1-year-old's Halloween costume.\n\nThe toddler's look? A miniature version of the feathered purple gown by Versace that Jenner wore to the 2019 Met Gala.\n\nJenner captioned the post, \"My baby!!!!!!!! I cant handle this!!!!\" and added several purple heart emojis.\n\nNo word on whether the toddler's gown is Versace, but it appears to be a close replica (yet smaller), so we can only imagine how much it cost.\n\nKylie Jenner arrives for the 2019 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6, 2019, in New York.

She's adorable,\" wrote another.\n\nOthers were a little more critical of the idea.\n\n\"What level of narcissism do you have to be on to dress your kid as yourself for Halloween,\" wrote one on Twitter.\n\n\"Kylie really dressed up Stormi as herself,\" another shared to Twitter which was later retweeted by someone else with \"Kylie a narcissist for sure.\"\n\nWhat level of narcissism do you have to be on to dress your kid as yourself for Halloween I'm- pic.twitter.com/NfvOeDrUAS \u2014 natalie grim reaper \ud83d\udc80 (@natalieegrim) October 28, 2019\n\nTiny Jenner does look a adorable, but it's certainly a far cry from the sweatpants and messy buns most babies would be rocking if they dressed up as their mamas.\n\nIn other mom-daughter twinning news, Gabrielle Union also dressed her almost 1-year-old daughter Kaavia as herself for Halloween, rocking matching \"Clover\" cheerleading uniforms. Their sweet look is from the 2000 movie hit \"Bring It On,\" in which Union starred as cheerleading team caption Isis.\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/28/kylie-jenner-purple-met-gala-look-daughter-stormi-halloween-costume/2483517001/", "description": "Kylie Jenner posted photos to social media of her daughter Stormi Webster wearing a mini replica of her 2019 Met Gala dress.
