The limited-time duos playlist goes live on November 5th, developer Respawn announced today, and it will break with the game\u2019s strict three-person squad format. In the past, Respawn has added limited-time solo events, but it\u2019s never before allowed just two people to team up. If previous events are any indication, it\u2019s likely Respawn will stick to 60-person matches, so 30 teams per game.\n\nWith the launch of Apex Legends back in February, Respawn has stuck to its guns with a tight focus on three-person squads. The entire game \u2014 including how firefights are designed to play out and the way subclass abilities combine together \u2014 is oriented around trios and being able to adequately provide cover, heal, and revive members of your squad throughout an intense fight. The approach has earned Apex Legends 70 million registered players as of this month, making it one of the most popular shooters on the market.\n\nStarting next week, for a limited time, it takes \u270c.\n\n\n\nDive in to Duos 11/5. pic.twitter.com/uJkk7txcNE \u2014 Apex Legends (@PlayApex) October 30, 2019\n\nBut requiring players to team up with total strangers over the internet is indeed a big ask, even with the game\u2019s robust nonverbal communication features. It\u2019s not always fun to play Apex when you can\u2019t adequately rely on your teammates and you keep getting cleaned up by more skilled and organized squads. And Apex, more so than competing battle royale games like Fortnite, doesn\u2019t offer players a lot of in-game activities that don\u2019t revolve around winning. The harder it is to win or even place high, the harder it is to enjoy the game.\n\nSo Respawn has been experimenting with casual, limited modes that could give the solo crowd their fix without compromising the game\u2019s core mode and its competitive playlist. Now, we\u2019re going to get to see how duos will work as well.", "description": "Battle royale shooter Apex Legends is getting a unique game mode fans have been asking about for months: duos.
