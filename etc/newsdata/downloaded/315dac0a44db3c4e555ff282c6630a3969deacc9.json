This comes after it was revealed it had lost $5.2 billion in the three-month period ending in June -- its largest quarterly loss ever\n\nHowever, the firm is set to release technology that uses ultrasound waves that will know when the rider is in the car.\n\nThe 'Real-Time ID Check', released in 2016, has been updated to make drivers move their hear around, blink and smile while looking in to a smartphone camera.\n\nFinally, riders will be notified if they are dropped off near a bike line in a bid to avoid accidents.\n\nThe new safety features may be a result of Uber's relaxed approach on rider safety in the past.\n\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi (pictured at the event where the app merge announcement was made) insists the company is on the right track, and even expressed confidence in its business model \u2013 which may of been his way of hinting of the new application merge\n\nAll safety concerns that have been reported to Uber's special investigation team have been basically hidden, as they are prohibited from share them with law enforcement or file official police reports 'even when they get confessions of felonies,' according to The Washington Post.\n\nThey are also not allowed to advise victims or potential victims of crimes to seek legal counsel.\n\n'We don't think trust can be won with one thing,' Kansal told The Verge. 'I think the way we want to win trust is by showing commitment, and that's going to be long term.'", "description": "Uber Eats is testing a new feature that lets you book culinary classes and dinner at their favorite restaurant.
