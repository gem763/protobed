However, after backlash from numerous YouTubers who got emails saying their channels would get un-verified, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki promised to reevaluate the company\u2019s recently revamped policy.\n\nOn Twitter, Wojcicki said, \u201cTo our creators & users \u2013 I\u2019m sorry for the frustration & hurt that we caused with our new approach to verification. While trying to make improvements, we missed the mark. As I write this, we\u2019re working to address your concerns & we\u2019ll have more updates soon.\u201d\n\nTo our creators & users\u2013I\u2019m sorry for the frustration & hurt that we caused with our new approach to verification. While trying to make improvements, we missed the mark. As I write this, we're working to address your concerns & we\u2019ll have more updates soon. \u2014 Susan Wojcicki (@SusanWojcicki) September 20, 2019\n\nIn YouTube\u2019s original blog post, the company said that many users had recently begun to associate a verification checkmark as \u201can endorsement of content\u201d, instead of simply being a way to confirm a YouTuber\u2019s identity.\n\nPreviously, the main requirement for getting verified on YouTube was having a channel with more than 100,000 subscribers. However, for its new verification process, YouTube\u2019s updated criteria was designed to prioritise \u201cverifying prominent channels that have a clear need for proof of authenticity\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, following the update, YouTube began sending out notices such as the one above, saying that as part of the change certain channels no longer met YouTube\u2019s criteria, and would be losing their verification status sometime in the future.\n\nWhile a later update to YouTube\u2019s blog post confirmed that no channel had lost its verification just yet, the whole chain of events left many content creators baffled at the opaque nature of YouTube\u2019s new verification process.\n\nFor example, Brian Brushwood is the owner of two YouTube channels that were potentially scheduled to be unverified, one with around one million subs and another with two million subs, the latter of which has been around for over nine years. After that much time, it seems incredibly strange for YouTube to remove his verification.\n\nAnd without any insight as to why they were being penalised, many YouTubers were forced to try to appeal YouTube\u2019s decision.\n\nWith Twitter having suspended its verification process back in 2017 for similar reasons, YouTube\u2019s latest flub calls into question the entire point of verification on social media.\n\nAnd with YouTube having previously come under fire for directing users to extremist content and encouraging paedophiles to watch videos of children playing, YouTube\u2019s latest uproar over verification feels like another issue in a long string of unforced errors.", "description": "This week, YouTube rolled out new guidelines for its verification requirements intended to reduce confusion and better highlight artists, celebs and other creators.
