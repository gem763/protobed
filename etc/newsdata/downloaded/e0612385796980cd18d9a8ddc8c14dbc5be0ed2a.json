So in a way, it's quite clear on which side of the dispute Poland locates itself,\" Michnik told ZDNet.\n\nThe deal can also be seen as a part of a broader strategy by the Polish authorities to align the country more closely with the US, thus gaining access to the technologies they are offering, he adds.\n\nMichal Vit, researcher at the Europeum Institute for European Policy, said the agreement is in line with Polish foreign-policy priorities.\n\n\"There's no surprise that Poland fulfills the role as the main US ally in Central and Eastern Europe,\" Vit told ZDNet.\n\n\"Poland doesn't see China as a strategic alternative for the central and eastern European region, despite a possible financial gain in the short term. On the other hand, the decision could strengthen Hungary's standing as the most China-friendly country in the region.\"\n\nLater on Monday, Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, did mention Huawei in a statement, calling on other nations to \"ensure that only trusted providers have access to their developing networks\".\n\nIn a statement, Huawei responded that it opposes the \"politicization of 5G technology\" and that it has \"provided services to Poland for decades and trusts the nation's government to make the right decisions for its citizens\".\n\nHuawei's business efforts in Poland took a hit in January this year when Polish police authorities raided their offices in Warsaw and arrested a Chinese citizen who served as Huawei's sales executive in the country.\n\nAfter the arrest, he was fired by the Chinese company, and currently remains in detention, ahead of a trial on espionage charges.\n\nIn the declaration, the US and Poland add that rigorous technology evaluations should examine whether a supplier is subject to control by a foreign government, whether it has a transparent ownership structure, and whether the supplier has a record of ethical corporate behavior and is subject to a legal regime that enforces transparent corporate practices.\n\nMore on Huawei in Europe", "description": "The 5G agreement between the US and Poland comes amid a worsening trade war with China.", "authors": ["Bojan Stojkovski"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/01/2145cdd4-e5a0-4a78-9541-ac5534b36dbf/thumbnail/770x578/bceebf167d8617ec1b4c9201a28d9e71/huawei-security-significant-engineering-5ca1e2fd2f64e300b8f9c850-1-apr-01-2019-19-34-43-poster.jpg"}
