What is this tech, which now lurks on the Apple U1 chip? And how is it going to change how you use your phone in the future? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThe basics are that this is a wireless, short-range communication protocol. A bit like Bluetooth, it lets devices talk to each other. You\u2019ll see it appearing in a few headlines now thanks to the launch of the 2019 iPhones, but it\u2019s by no means a technology that\u2019s exclusive to Apple, and it\u2019s actually been around for decades.\n\nLike a lot of technology though, it\u2019s taken a while for ultra-wideband chips to get cheap and compact enough to squash them inside a smartphone. Like Bluetooth, it transmits data across short distances, but its particular party tricks are the ability to precisely determine location, the ability to broadcast with minimal interference, and the ability to run using very little power at all.\n\nAs the name suggests, it sends data across a wider frequency \u2014 from 500MHz up to several gigahertz \u2014 compared with \u2018narrowband\u2019 wireless technologies. The drawback is a shorter overall range, but that doesn\u2019t matter so much when you\u2019re dealing with two devices that are in a room together.\n\nWhat we can\u2019t give you is an exact spec-by-spec breakdown of UWB against Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, because several different versions of it exist \u2014 and Apple hasn\u2019t revealed exactly how it\u2019s implemented the technology in the iPhone 11. Like Wi-Fi, UWB has gone through several 802.11 wireless versions, as defined by the IEEE.\n\nWhen it comes to Apple and the U1 chip in the new iPhones, we do know it\u2019s going to mean an improved version of AirDrop \u2014 better spatial awareness (so it knows where your phone is pointing and where you are), and a more precise and reliable way to communicate with other iPhones that have a U1 chip inside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u2019s going to lead to amazing new capabilities,\u201d according to Apple promotional materials. \u201cWith U1 and iOS 13, you can point your iPhone toward someone else\u2019s, and AirDrop will prioritise that device so you can share files faster. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d\n\nThat hints at more to come \u2014 most probably those Apple device-tracking tags that have been rumoured for months. Where UWB has the advantage over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (used in Tile tags) is that it can measure distance based on the time it takes for radio waves to travel between devices.\n\nBluetooth can measure distances, but it does it by assessing the strength of a signal between two devices, and calculating how far away the two gadgets are based on that. It\u2019s not the most reliable approach (signal strength can be affected by more than just distance), and UWB\u2019s way of timing radio waves is much more accurate.\n\nThe short pulses used by ultra-wideband are less prone to interference and noise and are less likely to overlap with one another. All this helps when you want accuracy and reliability to be priorities, whatever you\u2019re transmitting or measuring. Those kinds of features might be deployed in smart home devices, for instance, maybe when you want to adjust the output of a speaker set based on where you\u2019re sitting.\n\nAnother area we might see ultra-wideband utilised in iPhones is with augmented reality. A better sense of where your phone is in a room, and what it\u2019s pointed towards, could help improve the immersiveness of digital overlays and experiences, especially if you\u2019re trying to use multiple (U1-toting) iOS devices together.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said though, UWB isn\u2019t exclusive to Apple. The tech could potentially be used in everything from wireless printers to streaming video, depending on which way the market moves \u2014 cost and compatibility have previously been factors in preventing widespread adoption of ultra-wideband, but they might not be such a problem in the future.\n\nAll this depends on manufacturers getting on board with the tech and possibly finding that \u2018killer app\u2019 or function that makes it worth putting UWB inside every phone that rolls off the production line, iPhone or otherwise.\n\nApplications like keyless entry and indoor location mapping are now back on the table for ultra-wideband, and having the standard built into a device as ubiquitous as the iPhone can only help its chances of becoming more commonly used in the future. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to replace Wi-Fi, NFC, or Bluetooth \u2014 it can work with them.", "description": "There\u2019s a new (ish) technology in town, one that\u2019s made it to the consumer smartphone market with the arrival of the iPhone 11: ultra-wideband (UWB).
