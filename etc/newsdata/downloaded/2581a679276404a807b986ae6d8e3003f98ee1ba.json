That means the county is averaging about 3 deaths per day and is on track to surpass 1,000 deaths this year. The exact breakdown of the causes of these deaths is still being put together by the Coroner\u2019s office, but the Times\u2019 story suggests addiction is a big part of the problem:\n\nBodies are being found in virtually every corner of the county, a grim consequence of the intensifying epidemic of homelessness. In 2012, 407 homeless people died in L.A. County. The number has gone up sharply every year, to last year\u2019s record high of 921\u2026 The first 666 deaths of the year included 42 homicides and 27 suicides. Males vastly outnumbered females, 83% to 17%, and the victims included 253 white people, 220 Latinos and 168 African Americans. Substance abuse and heart conditions, sometimes in conjunction, were among the leading causes of death, but no cause had been determined in about 100 of the cases.\n\nObviously, addiction to meth, fentanyl, heroin or other opioids is a serious problem for people who have homes as well as those who don\u2019t. In 2017, approximately 47,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses. The number of people dealing with opioid addiction is more than 10 times that number. According to the National Institutes of Health, \u201cAbout 80 percent of people who use heroin first misused prescription opioids.\u201d The Times spoke to a physicians assistant named Carrie Kowalski who works at a clinic in Venice. Kowalski said many of the homeless addicts she encounters have similar personal stories:\n\nOn her street medicine rounds, she had told me, she sees every conceivable malady and a lot of addiction. A common theme among her patients, she said, is that \u201csomething went wrong from childhood and started someone on a path\u201d to physical, mental and addiction issues. \u201cIt can be physical violence, abuse in the foster care system, sexual abuse, the experience of veterans, and you become homeless and now you\u2019ve got more trauma,\u201d Kowalski said.\n\nIn other words, many of these people are medicating themselves because of some private pain they can\u2019t deal with sober. That\u2019s not an argument for letting the homeless take over the sidewalks and use the streets as a bathroom. On the contrary, getting them off the street should be a priority, whether they say they want the help or not.\n\nWhat\u2019s not helpful is turning a blind eye to the problem and letting addicts live in a law-free zone when you know the next dose of illegal narcotics could be their last. What\u2019s also not helpful is pretending the hardcore drug addicts and alcoholics who make up a significant percentage of the chronic homeless are going to be helped by building more high-density apartments. The worst aspects of this problem go beyond lowering rent payments.", "description": "\"something went wrong from childhood and started someone on a path\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LA-homeless-2.jpg"}
