CBC via REUTERS.\n\nFollowing are reactions from his political rivals and other commentators in the Oct. 21 national election:\n\nCONSERVATIVE LEADER ANDREW SCHEER:\n\n\u201cI was extremely shocked and disappointed when I learned of Justin Trudeau\u2019s actions this evening. Wearing brown face is an act of open mockery and racism. What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who\u2019s not fit to govern this country.\u201d\n\nGREEN PARTY LEADER ELIZABETH MAY:\n\n\u201cI am deeply shocked by the racism shown in the photograph of Justin Trudeau. He must apologise for the harm done and commit to learning and appreciating the requirement to model social justice leadership at all levels of government. In this matter he has failed.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE\u2019S PARTY LEADER MAXIME BERNIER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to accuse Justin Trudeau of being a racist.\n\nBut he\u2019s the master of identity politics and the Libs just spent months accusing everyone of being white supremacists. He is definitely is the biggest hypocrite in the country.\u201d\n\nNEW DEMOCRAT LEADER JAGMEET SINGH, WHO IS SIKH WHO WEARS A TURBAN:\n\n\u201cI face a lot of racism in my life and I\u2019ve got to be honest with you, I fought back with my fists. But there were a lot of people who weren\u2019t able to do that. One of my friends told me how he was not able to do that.\n\n\u201cAnd seeing this image today, the kids that see this image, the people who see this image, are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to those people right now. I want to talk to all the kids out there, all the folks that live this and now are grown up and are still feeling the pain of racism.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that you might feel like giving up on Canada. You might feel like giving up on yourselves. I want you to know that you have value, you have worth, you are loved. And I don\u2019t want you to give up on Canada and please don\u2019t give up on yourselves.\u201d\n\nDARRELL BRICKER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF POLLING FIRM IPSOS PUBLIC AFFAIRS:\n\n\u201cIt will take a couple of days before we know if there is any lasting damage to the Liberals\u2019 re-election prospects.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that the Prime Minister\u2019s image has been critical to the Liberals\u2019 political success. This picture runs completely contrary to the image of tolerance the Prime Minister has so scrupulously cultivated. It can\u2019t be good for him or his Party.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologised on Wednesday for wearing brown face make-up in 2001 after an embarrassing picture emerged less than five weeks out from a tightly contested general election.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431464532&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I06L", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
