They\u2019re also quite divisive and not everyone\u2019s cup of tea,\u201d Nick said.\n\nHe's not alone in being a fan though - and within 18 months Snaffling Pig had taken off to the degree that both him and his business partner working on it full time.\n\nIt\u2019s now forecast to bring in a whopping \u00a35million this year.\n\nNick \u2012 who now describes himself as the \u2018Duke of Pork\u2019 - says that the idea for Snaffling Pig came out of a frustration with the standard of existing pork-based snacks.\n\nIn short, he felt the pub favourite was due a makeover.\n\nSuggesting that other producers have stood still with \u201cstale recipes that hadn\u2019t changed for years and see-through packaging\u201d, Nick argued that double-cooking the best parks of the pork rind and seasoning them with exciting flavours he could make people \u201cfall in love with this epic snack again\u201d.\n\nNick\u2019s mum, a vegetarian, was the first employee - going pub to pub across Essex and Suffolk to try to get people to buy into the products.\n\n\u201cShe'd never done sales before, nor eaten meat for 35 years, but she got us listed in over 150 pubs. I owe the success of this brand to her,\u201d Nick said.\n\nNick admits that the biggest challenge with getting Snaffling Pig off the ground was the simple fact that he didn\u2019t really know how things were supposed to work, from manufacturing to selling to how to deal with orders.\n\nBut that didn't stop him trying to find out.\n\n\"It\u2019s a steep learning curve and I guess my main skill is that I'm not afraid to look like an idiot. I'm very happy to ask questions and I'm curious how things can be started and improved upon,\u201d Nick explained.\n\nNick says that spreading the word about Snaffling Pig was a question of \u201chard graft\u201d.\n\nOnce the team had got enough pubs selling them, they could build a case study for how well it was selling against other brands and approach bigger suppliers.\n\nBut Nick is clear that nothing has been a more effective sales tool than offering samples.\n\n\u201cThe more chance people have of trying our products, the more likely they are to buy it,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking on the Dragons\n\n(Image: BBC Two)\n\nTwo years after launch, Nick and his team decided that they needed to boost the funding and awareness of Snaffling Pig. So they went on Dragon\u2019s Den.\n\nNick admits this was a risk, as not only are the products not for everyone, you can get a rough time from the Dragons.\n\nHowever, it went well, with the firm attracting a \u00a370,000 investment from Moonpig founder Nick Jenkins.\n\nThe firm has since tapped into the crowdfunding market, offering up a 9.73% stake in the business to investors, aiming to raise \u00a3750,000.\n\nIt was hugely oversubscribed - eventually bringing in more than \u00a31million from almost 1,500 investors.\n\nSnaffling Pig may have started with pork crackling packets, but its growth has meant moving into other products too.\n\nFor example, it now has its own beer, which you can get in a gift set alongside a host of the regular pork products, as well as a hot sauce and apple sauce. Pork remains its focus though, from scratching and crackling packs to even an advent calendar.\n\nIt\u2019s also now found on the shelves at Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, selling flavoured gammon steaks, with plans to launch bacon, sausage and gammon joints, as well as on the go snack bars.\n\n'You don\u2019t need to be rich to succeed'\n\n(Image: Snaffling Pig)\n\nNick emphasises that would-be entrepreneurs cannot let money \u2012 or rather a lack of it \u2012 put them off following their dreams.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you have an idea, just get out there and start selling it, even if you only have \u00a3500.\n\n\"You don't need to be clever or rich to start a company, you just need to work hard and figure things out as you go.\u201d", "description": "Snaffling Pig has sales in the millions and now produces gammon steaks, sauces and even beer - but all began with a bet and man who just really loved pork scratchings", "authors": ["John Fitzsimons", "Image", "Bbc Two", "Snaffling Pig"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article20650337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_piggy-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
