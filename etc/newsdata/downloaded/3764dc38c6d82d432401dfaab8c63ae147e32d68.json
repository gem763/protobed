Van der Poel played it safe in a gruelling final stage and kept Trentin in his sights, with a series of breaks hauled back in by teams seeking to secure their own success in a sprint finish.\n\nTour of Britain \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (@TourofBritain) \ud83c\udfc6 @mathieuvdpoel \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 wins stage eight of the 2019 @OVOEnergy Tour of Britain \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 in Manchester to claim the overall race victory!#OVOToBpic.twitter.com/OXiyv2wja2\n\nMovistar\u2019s Michal Golas was central to a pair of late breaks but they were brought back into the pack with 10km remaining as Trentin\u2019s teammates did their best to manufacture a win for their man.\n\nInstead it was Bol who seized the initiative heading round the final bend. He looked to have done enough until Van der Poel came round him to sneak victory in a photo finish.\n\n\u201cComing into the [race] I didn\u2019t really think that winning was possible, because of the time trial [on stage six] as I hadn\u2019t done one in a really long time,\u201d said Van der Poel. \u201cAfter the time trial I started to believe I could win overall but today was harder than I thought it would be.\n\nVuelta a Espa\u00f1a: Primoz Roglic set to triumph after retaining red jersey Read more\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy day today. A lot of teams tried to attack us. I think I timed my jump perfectly so, yeah, I\u2019m glad to win.
