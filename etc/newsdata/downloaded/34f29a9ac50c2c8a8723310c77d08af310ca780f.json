It's a lot,\" the 43-year-old Woods said of his 82nd official Tour victory. His first came 23 years ago this month in Las Vegas when he was just 20.\n\n\"It's been a long week, five days at the top of the board is a long time. It was definitely stressful.\"\n\nWoods led from gun to tape in the inaugural US PGA Tour event in Japan, which saw Friday's play washed out by the fringes of a typhoon that dumped almost 10 inches of rain on the course 50 miles (80km) from Tokyo, forcing play into an extra day.\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy finished birdie-birdie for a 67 and a share of third place on 13-under par with South Korea's PGA Tour Rookie of the Year Im Sung-jae who carded a fine five-under 65.\n\nWoods resumed his final round, suspended due to darkness on Sunday, at 7.30 am on the long par-12th at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club but saw his overnight three-shot cushion over Matsuyama immediately cut to two.\n\nThe 15-time major winner missed the green with his approach and fell back to 17-under par as he failed to get up and down.\n\nWoods's early-morning putter was cold, and on the short 13th he failed to take advantage from six feet for a birdie.\n\nUp ahead on the 14th green, Matsuyama inexplicably spurned an easy opportunity to reduce the deficit to one as he missed a four-foot birdie putt.\n\nWoods was then faced with a similar line of putt as Matsuyama on 14, but from 20 feet further away. He did not miss, and restored his three-shot advantage with four holes remaining.\n\nWoods missed another birdie chance, from 10 feet, at the 15th and was watching from the 16th tee 181 yards away as Matsuyama walked in a 20-footer for his first birdie of the day to get to 16-under.\n\nMatsuyama crushed a drive down the middle of the 491-yard 17th and found the putting surface with his approach.\n\nMatsuyama's fine attempt to hole the putt slid by on the left and he found sand twice on the par-five 18th as he went in search of an eagle.\n\nMatsuyama's greenside bunker shot flew the flag and when he missed the long putt back his brave challenge ended at 16-under for the tournament after a final-round 67.\n\n\"This was big,\" said a smiling Woods.\n\n\"Hideki made it tight. It was a lot closer than what people probably thought. Hideki put heat on me.\"\n\nFinal scores on Monday after the fourth round of the US PGA Tour's Zozo Championship at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club, Inzai City, Chiba, Japan (par 70):\n\n261 - Tiger Woods (USA) 64-64-66-67\n\n264 - Hideki Matsuyama (JPN) 65-67-65-67\n\n267 - Im Sung-Jae (KOR) 71-64-67-65, Rory McIlroy (NIR) 72-65-63-67\n\n268 - Gary Woodland (USA) 64-66-68-70\n\n269 - Billy Horschel (USA) 68-67-64-70, Corey Conners (CAN) 69-64-66-70\n\n270 - Charles Howell III (USA) 70-65-66-69, An Byeong-Hun (KOR) 70-68-66-66\n\n271 - Ryan Palmer (USA) 67-68-69-67, Xander Schauffele (USA) 68-66-65-72, Danny Lee (NZL) 70-65-68-68\n\n272 - Shane Lowry (IRL) 71-69-67-65, Keegan Bradley (USA) 69-63-71-69, Matthew Wolff (USA) 69-65-67-71, Ian Poulter (ENG) 71-71-64-66\n\n273 - Paul Casey (ENG) 69-69-68-67, Daniel Berger (USA) 67-66-70-70, Justin Thomas (USA) 70-69-69-65, Patrick Reed (USA) 72-68-65-68, Kang Sung-Hoon (KOR) 67-69-70-67\n\n274 - Dylan Frittelli (RSA) 71-69-67-67, Jason Day (AUS) 73-66-67-68, Adam Schenk (USA) 69-67-68-70, Collin Morikawa (USA) 71-64-69-70, Tommy Fleetwood (ENG) 71-69-67-67\n\n275 - Keith Mitchell (USA) 69-68-71-67, JT Poston (USA) 70-65-72-68, Harold Varner III (USA) 72-70-69-64\n\n276 - Troy Merritt (USA) 71-68-70-67, Emiliano Grillo (ARG) 69-69-68-70, Rafael Cabrera (ESP) 73-66-70-67\n\n277 - Sergio Garcia (ESP) 70-71-67-69, Adam Scott (AUS) 73-67-66-71, Joaquin Niemann (CHI) 68-68-67-74, Rory Sabbatini (SVK) 71-68-68-70\n\n278 - Kim Si-Woo (KOR) 76-67-66-69, Satoshi Kodaira (JPN) 69-66-69-74, Kevin Tway (USA) 69-72-71-66, Lucas Glover (USA) 72-69-68-69\n\n279 - Vaughn Taylor (USA) 70-73-71-65, Chan Kim (USA) 71-69-72-67, Adam Hadwin (CAN) 71-69-71-68, Abraham Ancer (MEX) 74-68-68-69, Viktor Hovland (NOR) 75-65-67-72\n\n280 - Louis Oosthuizen (RSA) 69-69-71-71, Tomoharu Otsuki (JPN) 70-68-67-75, Max Homa (USA) 71-68-66-75, Kevin Na (USA) 71-70-68-71, Wyndham Clark (USA) 74-68-70-68\n\n281 - Bubba Watson (USA) 69-69-68-75, Adam Long (USA) 71-70-74-66, Pat Perez (USA) 72-70-69-70, Ryo Ishikawa (JPN) 68-68-70-75, Rikuya Hoshino (JPN) 68-71-72-70, Shaun Norris (RSA) 73-67-72-69\n\n282 - Jazz Janewattananond (THA) 74-67-71-70, Jinichiro Kozuma (JPN) 75-69-71-67\n\n283 - Shugo Shugo Imahira (JPN) 74-69-72-68, Andrew Putnam (USA) 68-72-73-70, Tony Finau (USA) 72-69-69-73, Cheng Tsung Pan (TPE) 68-75-71-69\n\n284 - Seung-Su Han (USA) 72-69-68-75, Yosuke Asaji (JPN) 72-67-70-75, Park Sang-Hyun (KOR) 71-70-74-69\n\n285 - Jordan Spieth (USA) 74-71-69-71, Kevin Kisner (USA) 75-70-68-72, Scott Piercy (USA) 78-68-68-71\n\n286 - Marc Leishman (AUS) 76-70-69-71\n\n287 - Chez Reavie (USA) 77-70-66-74\n\n288 - Jason Kokrak (USA) 74-70-70-74\n\n289 - Ryan Moore (USA) 72-69-72-76, Mikumu Horikawa (JPN) 72-75-68-74\n\n291 - Kevin Streelman (USA) 78-69-72-72\n\n292 - Matthew Fitzpatrick (ENG) 75-71-74-72\n\n298 - Joel Dahmen (USA) 72-76-72-78\n\nWithdrawn: Nate Lashley (USA), Graeme McDowell (NIR)", "description": "Tiger Woods said it was \"crazy\" after he made golfing history to win the weather-delayed Zozo Championship by three shots.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8671/a993f63e9db54881b51e760f4c2305c4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
