The candidates running a strong second and third, Sens. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenBiden faces dual challenges from Trump, Warren Donald Trump thinks you're dumb Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks MORE (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersBiden faces dual challenges from Trump, Warren Immigrant rights groups slam Trump policy requiring migrant health insurance Sanders released from hospital after doctors say he had heart attack MORE (I-Vt.), are making the rigged political and economic system the central story of their campaigns. And the front runner, Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump criticizes supposed second whistleblower North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Trump told House Republicans that he made Ukraine call because of Perry: Report MORE, is campaigning hard as middle-class Joe, uniquely able to reach white, blue-collar voters.\n\nMoreover, the state of the economy is seen as a key issue in the election, as presidents are more likely to be reelected in times of economic and wage growth. President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump criticizes supposed second whistleblower North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Window narrows for Trump trade deals MORE\u2019s abundant fear of a recession underlines its importance.\n\nBut you\u2019d never know any of that from the questions asked by the moderators during the five evenings of debate so far. There has been just one sizable section, in the first debate, on the economy. And there has not been one single question, of 58 asked by my count, on issues related to political inequality, like voting and campaign finance. Not one.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nClearly, Democrats in the House of Representatives understand the political potency of democracy and corruption as an issue. That\u2019s why they numbered their legislative package on campaign finance, voting and lobbying H.R. 1, with every Democrat present (all but one) voting for the legislation.\n\nPresident Trump has also demonstrated the political potency of corruption, with his 2016 campaign call to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d His record once in office, a Cabinet full of millionaires (and one billionaire) and corporate lobbyists heading up major departments like the EPA and Interior, should make this a prime issue for debate moderators to ask about.\n\nBut despite the centrality of voting, money and politics and the role of lobbyists in our democracy and clear indicators of political saliency, not one question about any of these topics was asked in the five nights of debate.\n\nEconomic inequality is clearly one of the biggest concerns of Democratic voters, as demonstrated in two polls this year, by Ipsos and by ABC/Washington Post, where it was named the second biggest issue concern after health care.\n\nWhen it comes to the economy, the debate moderators have done a little better (they literally couldn\u2019t do worse). Actually, the first debate was a good start. All 10 candidates were asked variations of the opening question from NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie to Warren: \u201cYou have many plans \u2014 free college, free child care, government health care, cancellation of student debt, new taxes, new regulations, the breakup of major corporations. But this comes at a time when 71 percent of Americans say the economy is doing well, including 60 percent of Democrats. What do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut that was the last significant chunk of time given to economic inequality and the economic issues facing American families. There has been a smattering of other questions on issues like taxes, pay equity, technology and jobs and college affordability, but none were given much time and most were asked of just one or two candidates.\n\nDebate time has been given to tariffs and trade, but that\u2019s an issue driven by Trump\u2019s actions rather than a major economic concern of voters. In a July poll, \u201cinternational trade and tariffs\u201d was ranked at the very bottom of 11 issues by Democratic voters.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s health care, which has received by far the most time in the debates. But rather than asking about health care as an economic issue \u2014 high out-of-pocket costs and premiums, prescription drug costs, the fear of losing health coverage \u2014 the moderators love the issue because it highlights one of the few differences among Democratic candidates. Typical is how NBC\u2019s Lester Holt framed health care in the first debate: \u201cWho here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan?\u201d\n\nWe saw this before, in the 2008 Democratic debates between Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBiden faces dual challenges from Trump, Warren Collins: Trump's call for China to probe Biden 'completely inappropriate' Trump compares his impeachment to Clinton email server MORE and Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaAxelrod blasts Trump's Romney tweet: He thinks laws and norms 'are for losers' Trump has ordered national security staff cut: report Lawmakers mourn death of 'Julia' star Diahann Carroll MORE, where health care was given the most debate time for the same reason. While the two candidates had almost identical health plans, the debate moderators focused on their one difference: Clinton was for an individual mandate and Obama was opposed (he quickly switched his position when in office).\n\nThe debate moderators may not get it, but voters know better. There have been numerous news articles pointing out that the questions Democratic candidates get on the hustings are related to economic and political inequality. Typical is the lead from a \"New York Times\" piece on Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegBiden faces dual challenges from Trump, Warren Bullock pulls in .3 million in third quarter, trailing most rivals Poll: Biden holds 24-point lead over Democratic field among black voters MORE\u2019s campaign: \u201cOn the day House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry of President Trump last week, Pete Buttigieg was being grilled by Iowa voters on other subjects: how to loosen the grip of the rich on government, how to restore science to policymaking, how to reduce child poverty.\n\nAt an event in eastern Iowa, a woman rose to say that her four adult children were \u201cstuck\u201d in life, unable to afford what she had in the 1980s when a $10-an-hour job paid for rent, utilities and an annual vacation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time that the D.C. journalists who moderate the debates get out of the beltway bubble in which the dominance of money and corporate power in politics is taken for granted, as are high salaries, fancy vacations and comfortable retirements. It\u2019s time they start asking the questions that most animate voters.\n\nRichard Kirsch is the director of Our Story: The Hub for American Narratives and the author of \"Fighting for Our Health: The Epic Battle to Make Health Care a Right in the United States.\" Follow him on Twitter: @_RichardKirsch.", "description": "The state of the economy is seen as a key issue in the election, as presidents are more likely to be reelected in times of economic and wage growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/democraticdebatesmiami1_062619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
