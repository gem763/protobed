Harris says that she plans to stand in solidarity with unions who are responsible for creating a middle class. She said that the middle classes are under siege by the Trump administration\n\nHarris doubled back and looked sternly towards the dissenters and appeared visibly shocked with their disagreement.\n\n'Well, yes they are,' Harris argued, causing a ripple of laughter through the hall.\n\nThe California Senator said earlier in the speech that she wanted to 'not waste your time' and 'engage in real talk' about the 2020 campaign race.\n\nHarris's blooper reminded many on social media of Jeb Bush's blunder before the 2016 election when he asked people to 'please clap' at a campaign stop.\n\nOn a campaign stop in 2016, Jeb Bush asked audience members 'please clap' as he ended his speech. Unlike Harris, Bush's audience obliged him\n\nSome social media users suggested that Harris had modified her accent and adopted the slang term 'real talk' to speak to the town hall in Reno\n\nOthers said that her use of the term 'real talk' and a different accent were attempts to change her image for different demographics.\n\nTwitter user Ranimal said: 'Is she trying to be like \u201chip\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d with how she talks?'\n\n'Why does she always sound drunk or high?' added MarilynBojanow1.\n\nOthers, however, believe that the presidential candidate is inauthentic and not prepared for campaigning across the country.\n\n'She's never had to campaign outside of her liberal bubble of San Francisco and California and is falling flat on her face,' tweeted Stallion2011.\n\nThe Democratic hopeful has taken a swing at negative tweeting in the past, targeting on the President's online presence. She asked Twitter to suspend Trump's account, arguing that his posts caused people harm and 'beat them down.\n\n'The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,' Harris said on CNN Monday night.\n\nKamala Harris called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account\n\n'Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting today directed at the whistle-blower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be - his Twitter account should be suspended,' she added.\n\nHarris has dropped in popularity over recent weeks after starting a strong campaign. She received just seven per cent of support among likely Democrat voters, according to a Fox News poll.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted between Friday and Monday, surveyed 506 Democratic primary voters. Biden has good reason to worry about Warren, who holds an advantage in voter enthusiasm.\n\nOf those polled, 35 per cent of voters say they\u2019re \u2018enthusiastic\u2019 about Warren - which is up 9 points since June. Another 35 per cent said they were \u2018comfortable\u2019 with Warren as the nominee. Just six per cent said they were \u2018very uncomfortable.\u2019\n\nBiden, on the other hand, has just 23 percent of voters who are enthusiastic about his candidacy, while 41 per cent are comfortable.Biden saw his support jump by five percentage points compared to July, while Warren\u2019s position improved by six percentage points.", "description": "Californian Senator, and Democrat White House hopeful, Kamala Harris, asked a crowd whether America was ready for her presidency and members of the audience responded with a  'no.'", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/09/19288098-0-image-a-13_1570177238702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
