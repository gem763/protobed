And they are putting on an old-school beatdown on the Houston Astros.\n\nThe Nationals are proving that it\u2019s still cool to believe in old-fashioned scouting, treat players like human beings instead of assets and value experience as a positive instead of a negative.\n\nThe first World Series game in Washington since since 1933 will be played Friday night with the Nationals up 2-0, and they\u2019ve got a chance to wrap up the first title in franchise history this weekend.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all thrilled to see what\u2019s happening because of what the Nationals represent,\u2019\u2019 said Arizona Diamondbacks special assistant Gary Hughes, 75. \u201cThey still value scouting. They actually go to the ballpark and scout. They see what happens with their own eyes.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t stay home, watch it on video and TV and make their own reports just off numbers. That\u2019s ridiculous. Really, it\u2019s arrogance.\u2019\u2019\n\nASTROS: Down in the series, Houston still confident\n\nWORLD SERIES:Donald Trump plans to attend Game 5*\n\nThis is an organization that values old-school scouting and experience perhaps more than any other. They have a staff that includes six former scouting directors, four former managers, two former GMs and every member of their pro scouting staff played professional baseball.\n\nThe Nationals blanketed the landscape with scouts this postseason. They had two on every team in the playoffs, including five alone on the American League Championship Series.\n\nThe Astros, who don\u2019t have a traditional pro scout, never bothered to send a soul to advance the Nationals during the playoffs.\n\nSo take a wild guess who the scouting industry wants to win this series.\n\n\u201cMy phone is just blowing up,\u2019\u2019 Nats special assistant De Jon Watson said. \u201cWhen we beat the Dodgers, I had close to 200 friends and people around the industry congratulating us. They know this is great for the game.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd a subtle reminder this is still a people\u2019s game, played by players, not assets, where clubhouse culture is critical to a team\u2019s success.\n\nSure, the Nats wouldn\u2019t be two victories away from a World Series championship without stars Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto, who celebrates his 21st birthday Friday. They also wouldn\u2019t be here without 36-year-old Howie Kendrick and 32-year-old reserve outfielder Gerardo Parra.\n\n\u201cThe Astros have computer chips to equate their formulas,\u2019\u2019 said Johnny DiPuglio, the Nationals' director of international scouting. \u201cWe have people. We don\u2019t get caught up with all of that Trackman , Blast , Statcast stuff that\u2019s being used.\n\n\u201cWe watch the players ourselves, sit down with everyone, smoke a cigar and come up with a consensus.\u2019\u2019\n\nYep, a whole lot like the old days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proving the old-school ways still work, and that\u2019s the message we\u2019re sending,\u2019\u2019 said Nats special assistant Dan Jennings, a former GM, manager and farm director. \u201cThe last five years, there\u2019s this thought there\u2019s only one way to do things. Hey, this game has been played for over 150 years; there\u2019s definitely more to it than analytics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the veteran scouts used to say: 'Those who can, evaluate. Those who can\u2019t, measure.'\n\n\u201cAs long as there are human beings in that dugout, you better understand compassion, heart and all of the things that evaluate the person, and not just the measurement of ability.\"\n\nNo understands this more than Nats GM Mike Rizzo, who has taken full advantage of all the scouting layoffs in the industry, plucking some of the greatest minds in the game.\n\nHe surrounds himself with vast experience. One night, he\u2019ll spend games sitting alongside Jack McKeon, 88, the former World Series champion manager and GM. The next night, it's his 89-year-old scout, his father, Phil Rizzo. He\u2019ll have four-time All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove catcher Bob Boone sitting to his left, and Cy Young winner Pete Vuckovich to his right.\n\nThere\u2019s an eight-person analytical department that will sit in the back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sneaky techies,\u2019\u2019 Rizzo said, \u201cwe just don\u2019t talk about it much. But we\u2019re proud of the analytic staff we put together. We didn\u2019t have anyone when I got here, but now we created our own database.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe name?\n\nThe Pentagon, of course.\n\n\u201cThey are sort of sneaky,\u2019\u2019 Astros GM Jeff Luhnow said. \u201cThey\u2019re a smart organization. People label us as an analytical organization, but we\u2019ve got really good evaluators. They use their eyes and their guts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more similar than people think.\u2019\u2019\n\nRizzo, 58, is beloved by the scouting community. He\u2019s worshiped for his loyalty and willingness to hire veteran scouts. Luhnow is loathed in the scouting industry, blamed for the rash of scouts out of work with his passion for analytics.\n\n\u201cI just know that I need their minds, I need their information and I knew their experience,\u2019\u2019 Rizzo said. \u201cThe only rule I tell our guys is that when I call, answer the damn phone. I\u2019m not here to chit-chat. I want information.\u2019\u2019\n\nSays special assistant Bob Schaefer, 75: \u201cSome people shy away from baseball guys. Rizz wants us around. He tells us, 'Everybody can looks at stats. I\u2019m looking for guys who know how to win.' He believes in chemistry and culture.\n\n\u201cSome of these other guys are trying to find guys on Twitter. It\u2019s embarrassing for baseball. You\u2019d think in a $10 billion industry, you\u2019d want experienced guys.\u2019\u2019\n\nSaid Jennings: \u201cThe thing about him is that he\u2019s smart enough to change with the times, and incorporate the analytics as needed. But he\u2019s also an evaluator at heart. He trusts his eyes. He trusts his people. And no one is more loyal.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd as long as he\u2019s going old-school, Rizzo is making sure to keep the tradition of superstition alive, too.\n\nHe is the one who told his scouts to dress elegantly when they arrive at the World Series games, recommending they wear suits. Well, the scouts did just as instructed, but guess who showed up for Game 1 of the World Series in Houston looking like Bill Belichick, dressed in a red Nats hoodie?\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been wearing this during our winning streak,\u2019\u2019 Rizzo moaned. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t change now. I just can\u2019t.\u2019\u2019", "description": "While analytics certainly play a role for the Nationals, GM Mike Rizzo has put scouting first, bringing several veteran scouts to his staff.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/25/USAT/ac118b51-e02c-4450-9856-ca43ff462340-GTY_1183026968.JPG?crop=1330,748,x1340,y379&width=1079&height=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
