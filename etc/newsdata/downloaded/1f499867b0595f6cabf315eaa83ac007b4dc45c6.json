(Khalil Ashawi/Reuters)\n\nFighting between Turkey and Kurdish organizations continued into Friday morning despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the two sides, according to numerous local reports.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors fighting in Syria, reported sporadic clashes in or near Ras-al-Ayn, a Syrian town near the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cFive civilians were killed in Turkish air strikes on the village of Bab al-Kheir, east of Ras al-Ayn,\u201d the organization said.\n\nFighting appeared to die down by the afternoon, and the ceasefire held in other parts of the region.\n\nThe ceasefire negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday, requires Kurdish fighters to retreat from a large swath of territory near the Turkish border within five days. The agreement consolidates Turkish gains since its invasion began on October 9.\n\nKurdish forces have not yet pulled back from Ras-al-Ayn, and their willingness to do so may put the ceasefire to the test, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cWe will do whatever we can for the success of the cease-fire agreement,\u201d commander of Kurdish forces Mazloum Abdi told Kurdish TV on Thursday. However, another Kurdish official said the Kurds could not countenance living under Turkish occupation.\n\nPresident Trump hailed the ceasefire brokered by his administration, saying it was \u201ca great day for civilization.\u201d\n\nTrump announced on October 7 that he had ordered American troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria in advance of a planned invasion of the region by Turkey. Turkey aims to resettle 3.6 million Syrian refugees in the region, while Kurds say the operation is meant to weaken their demographic hold on the area by flooding it with Sunni Arabs.\n\nKurdish groups, some of which Turkey considers terrorist organizations, were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS in Syria. Trump has faced bipartisan fury for effectively abandoning them in the face of Turkey\u2019s invasion.", "description": "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported sporadic clashes in or near Ras-al-Ayn, a Syrian town near the Turkish border.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
