It's gone from being the worst drought in history for us, to being the worst drought in history to a factor of whatever.\n\n\"When things are really, really bad I think it's a good time to make a big change but we don't want to get that mixed up with the next six, 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nMr Littleproud revealed he had written to the premiers of Victoria, NSW and Queensland on September 19, asking them to facilitate deferrals of council rates and payroll taxes for drought-affected communities.\n\nHe said urgent consideration was needed for domestic and irrigation water support, as well as food and fibre energy tariffs for primary producers.\n\nMr Littleproud released 20 new regional weather and climate guides from the Bureau of Meteorology, designed to give farmers up-to-date climate information to guide business decisions.\n\nThe $2.7 million project is part of the government's funding for drought assistance.\n\n\"We are in unchartered territory with this drought,\" he said before travelling to Warwick in south-eastern Queensland to meet local business representatives.\n\nMr Frydenberg and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said the trip was about measuring the impact of the promised $7 billion in support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat includes more than $180 million for household assistance payments, $50 million in rebates for on-farm emergency water infrastructure and boosts to financial counselling and local projects.\n\nBarnaby Joyce, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Byron Station owner Ben Swan and Drought Minister David Littleproud at Byron Station. AAP\n\nThe main component is the Drought Future Fund, which is expected to hit $5 billion within a decade, with $100 million from interest to be spent from 2020.\n\n\"We don't have all the answers just now, otherwise we wouldn't be here,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\n\n\"What we want to do is continue to provide that support as necessary and as needed.\"\n\nColin Dight, whose family has worked on the land for 180 years, said farmers needed assistance so a viable industry could withstand the prolonged drought.\n\n\"We've got to get there without the whole district and the whole social infrastructure collapsing.\n\n\"We need our business to be ready [to] hit the ground running again.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Dight and his wife Kate have held on to their one-, two- and three-year-old heifers but have let go their other breeding stock. The family is concerned for their contractors, who are also under financial pressure and mothballing equipment.\n\n\"Most people are down to 20 per cent stocking rates. We're doing our best at the moment with our own cotton seed and the last little bit of irrigation water we had.\n\n\"The short-term problem is cash,\" he said.\n\nThe Southern Downs Regional Council, which includes Warwick, has imposed critical-level water restrictions, asking residents to keep their personal use to 100 litres per day. All outdoor water use is prohibited.\n\nLabor leader Anthony Albanese said the Coalition was poorly managing the drought and needed a new national strategy.\n\n\"We need one for this country. This government has been there for seven years. They talk a lot, but they're not acting,\" he said.", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Drought Minister David Littleproud have met eighth-generation farmers selling off stock to wait out the drought.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2291%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bac627bf6dd0009c9d1d4c955db4a9470f4e283", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
