In a bad way, actually. All of that stuff puts so much \u00adpressure on a relationship.\n\n\u201cFor her, if you were going out somewhere, it would take so long to get out of the door because you\u2019re just so worried.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who first started romancing in 2015, have remained amicable following their split for the sake of their young son Bear, two.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nNow time has passed, Liam had no qualms revealing the truth about his split from Cheryl.\n\nHe pinpointed he and Cheryl had broken up around the release of his Fifty Shades Freed track For You which featured Rita Ora.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe broke up around For You, actually, which is quite interesting.\u201d\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Uni)\n\nLiam confessed his high-flying career could have \"killed\" him so he took the time to slow down with his fast-moving job.\n\nThe pop star confessed the couple were both \"definitely overworked\" which had an impact on their romance.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were definitely overworked. I had no personal life, I learnt nothing about myself.\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Uni)\n\n\u201cI remember getting to therapy and the guy was like, \u2018What do you like to do?\u2019\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue. I just lived so long as this reclusive pop star who was afraid of people, who just stayed inside all the time. I needed to stop, definitely. It would have killed me.\u201d\n\nLiam has mended his heartache with brunette model Maya Henry, 19.\n\nHe shed some light on their low-key romance as he got gushy that she makes him a \"happy guy\".\n\nHe wrote: \"Sometimes I don't recognise this happy guy...sure glad you brought him back though.\"", "description": "Speculation had been rife that the couple had parted ways but they put on a defiant PDA-heavy display yet it was fake after all", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Filmmagic", "Getty Images", "Dave Benett Getty Images For Uni"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587853.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-BRIT-Awards-2018-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
