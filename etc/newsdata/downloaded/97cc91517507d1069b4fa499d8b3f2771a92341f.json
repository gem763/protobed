Everyone\u2019s heard the stories by now about Roberts supposedly wimping out in the ObamaCare ruling seven years ago, initially agreeing with Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and then getting cold feet. Result: A tortured and dubious majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of the mandate as a tax. Rumors swirled within days of the decision that Roberts had switched his vote because he feared the Court would be attacked as a partisan institution if the five Republican appointees joined to kill Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.\n\nBut Roberts pays attention to media coverage. As chief justice, he is keenly aware of his leadership role on the court, and he also is sensitive to how the court is perceived by the public. There were countless news articles in May warning of damage to the court \u2013 and to Roberts\u2019 reputation \u2013 if the court were to strike down the mandate. Leading politicians, including the president himself, had expressed confidence the mandate would be upheld. Some even suggested that if Roberts struck down the mandate, it would prove he had been deceitful during his confirmation hearings, when he explained a philosophy of judicial restraint. It was around this time that it also became clear to the conservative justices that Roberts was, as one put it, \u201cwobbly,\u201d the sources said.\n\nNo one outside the Court knows why or even whether Roberts switched his vote. But the perception of him ever since among righties is that, ironically, for all his concern about the Court being perceived as \u201cpoliticized,\u201d his alleged switcheroo is one of the most glaring examples of judicial politicization in American history. If Roberts is casting his votes based not on the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments but on how he thinks partisan critics are likely to react then politics is guiding his deliberation. Not in a straight-line \u201cRepublican appointee must vote Republican\u201d way but in a circuitous \u201cRepublican appointee occasionally must vote Democratic to preserve perceptions of institutional integrity\u201d one.\n\nDid it happen again in the controversial ruling earlier this summer about Trump\u2019s power to include a citizenship question on the forthcoming census? That decision resembled the ObamaCare ruling in that both were written by Roberts and both began with arguments for the conservative position. The individual mandate is unconstitutional as a function of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power, Roberts agreed in 2012; the president does have the power to add citizenship questions to the census, he conceded this past June. But, he went on to say in the ObamaCare decision, the mandate is valid as a tax. But, he went on to say in the census decision, the Commerce Department appears to have been deceptive in its reasons for wanting to add a citizenship question to the census. In both cases, it seemed as if Roberts was persuaded by the logic of the conservative view before conveniently finding an argument that allowed him to avoid joining in what would have seemed like a highly partisan decision.\n\nAnd now here comes CNN citing sources familiar with the Court\u2019s deliberations for the claim that Roberts switched his vote in that case too:\n\nChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote against President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but only after changing his position behind the scenes, sources familiar with the private Supreme Court deliberations tell CNN. The case was fraught with political consequences. Democrats and civil rights advocates claimed the query would discourage responses to the decennial questionnaire from new immigrants and minorities and affect the balance of power nationwide\u2026 After the justices heard arguments in late April, Roberts was ready to rule for Ross and the administration. But sometime in the weeks that followed, sources said, Roberts began to waver. He began to believe that Ross\u2019 rationale for the citizenship question had been invented, and that, despite the deference he would normally give an executive branch official, Ross\u2019 claim had to matter in the court\u2019s final judgment, which Roberts announced on June 27.\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts is the Supreme Court\u2019s James Comey,\u201d said a Twitter pal. Is he? In extraordinary circumstances, both men seem to be willing to dispense with institutional protocol and pull a Leeroy Jenkins in the name of some perceived greater moral/ethical/institutional good.\n\nRight, right, we need to be fair. Caveat one: God only knows if the CNN report is true. No hard evidence exists of Roberts\u2019s vote switch. It\u2019s all coming from \u201csources\u201d who might have axes to grind. Caveat two: A judge is entitled to change his mind. Just because Roberts switched his vote doesn\u2019t mean he did it for political reasons, to dodge some political heat from liberals. Maybe the liberal wing of the Court lobbied him on their view and persuaded him. Caveat three: It\u2019s not like Roberts has been a reliably anti-Trump vote on the Court. The Supremes have mostly tilted Trump\u2019s way during his presidency. Literally yesterday Roberts sided with Trump on another hot-button political issue, whether the president has the power to summarily deny asylum claims filed by migrants who declined to seek asylum in Mexico while litigation is pending. He\u2019s not David Souter.\n\nBut if you\u2019re suspicious that Roberts\u2019s supposed vote-switch in the census case had a political motive, there is a bit of extra evidence to consider. That decision was delivered on the same morning, the very last day of the term, as another closely watched political case, the one having to do with whether partisan gerrymanders can be challenged in court. Roberts wrote that one too and joined the conservatives for a 5-4 majority in ruling that gerrymanders can\u2019t be litigated. The partisan implications weren\u2019t perfectly clear in that one since Democrats have also engaged in partisan gerrymandering, but broadly speaking the left supported court challenges to gerrymanders and the right was more suspicious. Roberts knew the Court would take partisan flak for its decision; for him to join with conservatives again for another 5-4 majority in the census case posted on the same day would have made the partisan criticism many times louder. \u201cThe GOP appointees are in the tank!\u201d liberals would have cried.\n\nAnd so, insofar as Roberts may have felt pressure not to hand two major wins to righties in the same morning, the vote-switch in the census case seems that much more dubious. Did he decide to \u201csplit the baby,\u201d handing the right a win on gerrymandering and the left a win on the census? Or did he really change his mind in the census ruling on the merits? Who would trust him after the reporting on his ObamaCare switcheroo?", "description": "Switcheroo.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
