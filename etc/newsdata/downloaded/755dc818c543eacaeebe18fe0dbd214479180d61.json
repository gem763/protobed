While his elder brother was in perfect health, he was diagnosed with multiple diseases at the time.\n\nThe family decided to give up medical treatment on him, and they held a ceremony to bury the boy after it appeared he had died at home, he said.\n\nHe only realized the truth that the boy was still alive after watching TV news on Saturday, and chose to come forward to police.\n\nThe man is under investigation at the Yangliu Police Station in Xintai, a county-level city near Jinan in Shandong province.\n\nThe child was found in late August by two villagers surnamed Zhou and Jiao in Nanbaita village of Jinan when they were digging for mushrooms on a remote mountain and heard a faint cry beneath the ground.\n\nThey started digging immediately, and uncovered a cement plate buried underground. Thinking there might be an infant, they reported it to the local police and then, with the help of a third villager, they unearthed a paper box with a living newborn inside.\n\nThe three men took the infant to a local hospital, where a doctor conducted a basic check-up on the child.\n\nThe baby was not in critical condition, but was jaundiced, according to the doctor.\n\nThe infant was later sent to the Second Children and Women's Healthcare of Jinan city for further examination and treatment.", "description": "A man in his 50s surrendered to local police on Sunday, saying he is the grandfather of a child who was found buried alive on a mountain in Jinan, East China's Shandong province, two months ago, Shandong Business Daily reported.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/21/5dad54c0a310cf3e97a23abe.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
