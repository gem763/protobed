They\u2019re everywhere. Falling out the tree dead, one after the after.\u2019\n\nThe RSPCA are investigating (Picture: Joshua Brown)\n\nJoshua told CoventryLive: \u2018I didn\u2019t see any hit windows, but I\u2019ve spoken to the RSPB who have taken a look at the video, and they think that most of the birds have twisted necks, like they\u2019ve hit something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I spoke to a security guard who thought that some birds had got into the building and the birds falling out of the sky had something to do with pest control.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s also a conspiracy theory about 5G causing it, but I don\u2019t know enough about it to say.\u2019\n\nThe RSPCA have since launched an investigation to try and determine the cause behind the deaths.\n\nA spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We are aware of this distressing video and are now investigating the possible cause.\n\nThe birds were filmed lying dead all over the ground (Picture: Joshua Brown)\n\nIt is not known what caused the deaths (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Anyone with information about this should call the RSPCA appeals line on 0300 123 8018 and leave a message for AWO Ben Jones.\u2019\n\nUniversity Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire has been contacted for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
