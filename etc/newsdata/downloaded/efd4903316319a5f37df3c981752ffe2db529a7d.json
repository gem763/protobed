There must be the maximum respect.\n\n\u201cToday I was treated well and wasn\u2019t insulted, other times it hasn\u2019t happened like that and it\u2019s not nice.\u201d\n\nLautaro Martinez had opened the scoring just before the half-hour only for the hosts to level through Joao Pedro soon after the break.\n\nInter lead Serie A after two rounds on six points along with Torino and champions Juventus, while Cagliari have yet to pick up a point.\n\nThe Milan club had got their season off to the perfect start with a 4-0 home win over promoted Lecce, but they struggled to find the same swagger against a Cagliari side featuring former Inter midfielder Radja Nainggolan.\n\n\u201cIt was a different game to the win against Lecce, as I had warned everyone this would be tough,\u201d Conte added.\n\n\u201cComing to Cagliari is never a walk in the park. Let it be known, I am very demanding and there is a lot we need to do in order to improve, but I also say we are glad to have won in a difficult arena.\u201d\n\nMartinez headed the visitors in front after 27 minutes but his celebrations were cut short by a raised offside flag, although the goal was awarded after a lengthy Video Assistant Referee (VAR) review.\n\nThe Sardinian side levelled five minutes into the second half when Pedro powered a header home from a whipped Nahitan Nandez cross.\n\nStefano Sensi\u2019s free-kick rattled the bar for Inter on the hour mark and the midfielder then proved crucial in the winning goal as he was tripped by Fabio Pisacane to hand Lukaku the chance to convert from the penalty spot.\n\nConte\u2019s side welcome Udinese to San Siro in their next league fixture after the international break.", "description": "Inter Milan's Belgium international Romelu Lukaku was subjected to racist abuse as he scored a second-half penalty to earn his new side a 2-1 victory at Cagliari in Serie A on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425323178&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810L3-OZASP"}
