The Mrs. Doubtfire Musical Is Coming to Broadway in 2020", "language": "en", "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire. Photo: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nSoon, you won\u2019t just be able to watch Mrs. Doubtfire in doctor\u2019s office waiting rooms and on airplanes and everywhere else that movie is mysteriously always playing, because it\u2019s also coming to Broadway. The musical\u2019s producers have announced that, after an industry reading and a run in Seattle that starts this November, Mrs. Doubtfire will head to Broadway, starting performances at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre March 9, 2020, and opening April 5. The musical reunites the team behind Something Rotten!, with a book from Karey Kirkpatrick and John O\u2019Farrell and music and lyrics by Wayne Kirkpatrick and Karey Kirkpatrick. Jerry Zaks, of Hello, Dolly! and the forthcoming Music Man, will direct, with choreography from Lorin Latarro, and music supervision by Ethan Popp. Beetlejuice\u2019s Rob McClure leads the cast, with Jenn Gambatese as Miranda Hillard, Brad Oscar as Frank Hillard, Analise Scarpaci as Lydia Hillard, Jake Ryan Flynn as Christopher Hillard, Avery Sell as Natalie Hillard, J. Harrison Ghee as Andre, Mark Evans as Stuart Dunmeyer, Charity Ang\u00e9l Dawson as Wanda Sellner, and Peter Bartlett as Mr. Jolly. Given the original movie\u2019s reliance on cross-dressing for humor, one really, really hopes that this show learns from the Tootsie musical, but we\u2019ll see!", "description": "The musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire is coming to Broadway in 2020, starring Rob McClure, directed by Jerry Zaks.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-mrs-doubtfire.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
