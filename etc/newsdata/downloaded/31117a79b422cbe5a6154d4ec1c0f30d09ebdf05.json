Failure to do so by July 1 puts their Joint Commission accreditation at risk.\n\nDavid Baker, the commission\u2019s executive vice president for health care quality evaluation, credited a USA TODAY investigation with pushing the safety standards forward, saying the two-year Deadly Deliveries series \u201chelped to open up all of our eyes to the magnitude of the problem.\u201d\n\nRead: USA TODAY's Deadly Delivery series\n\nThe standards call for maternity units to keep life-saving medications immediately accessible. Hospitals also must plan for the rapid release of blood supplies for transfusions.\n\n\u201cMinutes matter in these really life-threatening emergencies,\u201d said Baker of the Joint Commission, which provides oversight to about 70 percent of U.S. hospitals by ensuring that they have voluntarily met quality standards.\n\nUSA TODAY exposed how hospitals across the nation fail to follow nationally promoted best practices to prevent harm. Each year in the United States, about 700 women die and 50,000 suffer serious injuries \u2013 many preventable \u2013 from childbirth complications. Hemorrhage is the leading preventable cause of severe maternal injury and death.\n\nThe detailed standards also call for birthing hospitals to assess every patient\u2019s risk, seeking to address racial disparities in childbirth. Black mothers are three times as likely as white mothers to die, the Joint Commission\u2019s guidance to hospitals notes.\n\nRead: The secret number maternity hospitals don\u2019t want you to know, and why we\u2019re revealing it\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of billing data from 7 million births found that one in eight hospitals in 13 states have complication rates of at least double the norm. The results called into question how hospitals have long blamed societal problems, such as poverty and pre-existing medical conditions, for the nation\u2019s rising rates of maternal death and injuries.\n\nThe Joint Commission also has issued specific actions to address dangerously high blood pressure, another top cause of preventable maternal death and injury. The group plans to help hospitals struggling to meet its deadline.\n\nChildbirth complication rates at maternity hospitals More\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s investigation also has helped spur political action in Washington:\n\nCongresswoman Anna Eshoo quoted USA TODAY\u2019s finding that \u201cthe United States is the most dangerous place in the developed world to deliver a baby\u201d during a September hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives on maternal health.\n\nThe House Committee on Ways and Means last year asked the operators of major hospitals nationally to answer sweeping questions about their actions to reduce maternal death and harm. Thousands of pages of feedback were submitted, and the Republicans who launched the investigation are working with the current Democratic leadership to review federal programs.\n\nA U.S. law was enacted to help states to determine why woman are dying from pregnancy and childbirth, bolstering efforts to confidentially collect and analyze standardized data on every mother\u2019s death.\n\nMost mothers soon will also be delivering at hospitals newly required to adopt established best practices to prevent harm, building on efforts that have been credited with reducing maternal injuries and deaths in California.", "description": "About four in five U.S. babies are delivered at hospitals that must adopt new safety standards to combat the nation's high maternal mortality rate.", "authors": ["Letitia Stein", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p89SIsznE.xyLO4A1U4u3Q--~B/aD00NzE7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/57c9c41e5f17433d9621b0c77fc5b854", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
