REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nNews of the video was first reported by the New York Times after someone who attended the gathering leaked a cell-phone video of it to the newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe WHCA is horrified by a video reportedly shown over the weekend at a political conference organized by the president\u2019s supporters,\u201d Jonathan Karl, president of the association, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the president\u2019s political opponents,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nThe video shows Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a man wearing a pinstriped suit opening fire at a \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d with some parishioners faces with logos of various news organizations, the Times reported.\n\nReuters has not obtained a copy of the video for review and had not been able to contact organizers of the event.\n\nBut the political action group hosting the event, American Priority, said in a statement on Twitter that it had not been aware of the video and did not approve it.\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that an unauthorized video was shown,\u201d the group said, adding that the video had been shown in a \u201cside room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis video was not approved, seen or sanctioned by the ... organizers.\u201d\n\nAmerican Priority states on its website it supports free speech as protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nA spokesman for Trump\u2019s campaign said he knew nothing about the video, the Times reported.\n\n\u201cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,\u201d said spokesman Tim Murtaugh.\n\nTrump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, and a former spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, were scheduled to speak at the three-day conference in Miami but the Times reported that neither had seen the video.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of any video, nor do I support violence of any kind against anyone,\u201d Sanders told the Times.\n\nThe Times reported that the video appeared to include edited scenes from the 2014 dark comedy \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d.\n\nEvent organizers, speaking to the Times, denounced the violence in the video and are investigating as to how it was shown.\n\n\u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review,\u201d organizer Alex Phillips told the Times.\n\nTrump, during his campaign for re-election for 2020 has repeatedly called the media \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nA gunman killed five people in a Maryland newspaper office in 2018 in one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history.", "description": "The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association (WHCA) condemned on Sunday a video that depicted a fake image of U.S. President Donald Trump slaughtering members of the news media, shown at a gathering of his supporters.", "authors": ["Rich Mckay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440612469&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0EC", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
