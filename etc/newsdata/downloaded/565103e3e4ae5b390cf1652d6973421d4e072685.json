And he thought he was next.\n\nOther children believed their parents had abandoned them. And some suffered physical symptoms because of their mental trauma, clinicians reported to investigators with a government watchdog.\n\n\u201cYou get a lot of \u2018my chest hurts\u2019, even though everything is fine\u201d medically, a clinician told investigators. The children would describe emotional symptoms: \u201cEvery heartbeat hurts,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t feel my heart.\u201d\n\nChildren separated during the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance policy last year, many already distressed in their home countries or by their journey, showed more fear, feelings of abandonment and post-traumatic stress symptoms than children who were not separated, according to a report from the inspector general\u2019s office in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), released on Wednesday.\n\nThe chaotic reunification process only added to their ordeal. Some cried inconsolably. Some were angry and confused. \u201cOther children expressed feelings of fear or guilt and became concerned for their parents\u2019 welfare,\u201d according to the report.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Migrant families enter to be processed at the central bus station before being taken to Catholic Charities in McAllen, Texas, 29 June 2018.

As they become adults, they face greater risks of mental and physical challenges, from depression to cancer.\n\nAmong the separated children, he foresees \u201can epidemic of physical, psychosomatic health problems that are costly to society as well as to the individual child grown up. I call it a vast, cruel experiment on the backs of children.\u201d\n\nThe AP obtained a copy of the report in advance of the official release, the first substantial accounting by a government agency on how family separation under the Trump policy has affected the mental health of children. It was based on interviews with about 100 mental health clinicians who had regular interactions with children but did not directly address the quality of the care the children did receive.\n\n\u201cFacilities reported that addressing the needs of separated children was particularly challenging, because these children exhibited more fear, feelings of abandonment and post-traumatic stress than children who were not separated,\u201d said the deputy inspector general, Ann Maxwell. \u201cSeparated children are also younger than the teenagers facilities were used to caring for.\u201d\n\nThe report covers a period last year when facilities were overwhelmed by the policy under which at least 2,500 children were separated from their parents. They stayed behind in border custody while their parents were taken to federal court for criminal proceedings.\n\nThe watchdog said the longer children were in custody, the more their mental health deteriorated, and it recommended minimizing that time. It also suggested creating better mental health care options and hiring more trained staff.\n\nThe department assistant secretary, Lynn Johnson, said in a letter to the watchdog that the average length of stay was much shorter now and noted the report was not a clinical review of treatment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andy, seven, is reunited with his mother, Arely, at Baltimore-Washington international airport 23 July 2018.

Those included a surge in children at the border, the children\u2019s unique mental health needs and a shortage of qualified bilingual clinicians, especially in rural areas.\n\nShe said that efforts had been made to bring in more medical health professionals, but \u201cadverse media coverage and negative public perception ... have hampered efforts to expand\u201d.\n\nAfter a federal judge ordered the children reunified with their parents, guidance on how to do it kept changing and that led to further anxiety and distress, according to the report.\n\nIn one case, a child was moved from a Florida facility to Texas to be reunited with her father. After the child made several trips to the detention center, she was returned to the Florida facility \u201cin shambles\u201d, without ever seeing him.\n\nInvestigators visited 45 facilities in 10 states during August and September of 2018, interviewing mental health clinicians. During the interviews, there were almost 9,000 children in shelters; nearly 85% were 13-17 in age, 13% were 6-12 and 2% were infants to age 5.\n\nA separate report also released Wednesday by the health and human services inspector general found that migrant detention facilities were woefully substandard. Specifically, many case managers did not meet the minimum education requirements for the Office of Refugee Resettlement. In addition, the review found 28 of the 45 facilities didn\u2019t have enough mental health workers.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic presidential hopeful, called the report a confirmation of the psychological toll taken on separated migrant children.\n\n\u201cThis confirms what we already knew: the children separated from their families, locked in cages, forced to sleep on concrete floors under tinfoil blankets, will live with this trauma for the rest of their lives,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ll have it on our consciences for the rest of ours.\u201d", "description": "Children also experience night terrors and separation anxiety, and as adults face greater risks of mental and physical challenges", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ee80092c5480b5c0d95d51f55704963de19647b/0_200_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab18e0225c615805dfcf0ea45058ca6e"}
