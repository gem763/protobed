After 11 years, we have made the mutual decision to separate.\n\n\u2018We will always love each other, just in a different way as friends. This will never change what a great team we make and we are really proud of everything we have achieved together.\n\n\u2018Our shared love of dance means we will keep working and dancing together as well as exploring different individual projects.\n\nKatya and Mike performed a Magic Mike themed dance on this week\u2019s show. (PA)\n\n\u2018No matter what we do we will always support and respect each other.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Katya seemed quite unsteady on her feet during this week\u2019s show, tweeting after the performance she denied being \u2018drunk\u2019 and also said the second fall was staged.\n\n\u2018Guys! I\u2019m totally fine! No idea what happened. So sorry. But so proud of @mikebreakfast for carrying on and delivering \u201cthe dolphin\u201d!\u2019 she wrote.\n\nKatya and Mike scored 18 points from the judges for their routine, which saw journalist Mike sliding down a pole in a fireman\u2019s outfit, before ripping it off the reveal his glittery costume underneath, making it a memorable performance in a variety of ways.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing returns Saturday at 6.40 on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
