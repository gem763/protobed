Why, it\u2019s the day we found out there\u2019s yet another Christmas Carol adaptation in the works, sir! According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney has enlisted Beauty and The Beast director Bill Condon for a new musical version of A Christmas Carol entitled Marley. This film is unrelated to Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds\u2019 upcoming Christmas Carol musical film, unless, of course, we\u2019re referring to plot, characters and general holiday-themed moral takeaways. Condon will both direct and write the film.\n\nStephen Schwartz, Oscar-winning composer of Pocahontas and The Prince of Egypt, among numerous other scores, will write the music. To give the movie a different spin from previous Disney Christmas Carols, including 1992\u2019s The Muppet Christmas Carol and 2009\u2019s CGI Christmas Carol featuring Jim Carrey, Marley will tell the classic Charles Dickens tale from the perspective of the late Jacob Marley.\n\nScrooge\u2019s infamous dead business partner famously sends him three Christmas ghosts to warn Ebenezer away from a life of greed, which has bound Marley\u2019s ghost in chains symbolizing his avarice. Come to think of it, that\u2019s just about nicest thing a coworker could do for you. You\u2019ll be lucky if your cubicle buddy remembers to get you that Secret Santa gift, and it will absolutely be a Blu-ray copy of 2009\u2019s A Christmas Carol featuring Jim Carrey.", "description": "Disney and Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon are developing the film Marlet, a new Christmas Carol musical movie.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/28-A-Christmas-Carol-Disney.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
