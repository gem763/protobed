But the culprit germ has been frustratingly elusive, making confirmation difficult. Other researchers have hypothesized AFM is an autoimmune disorder.\n\nBut in a new study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers \u201cdetected the immunological remnants of a common seasonal virus in spinal fluid from dozens of patients diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis,\u201d according to a news release from the University of California, San Francisco. A research team from the university led the study.\n\nThe findings, according to the release, \u201cprovide the clearest evidence to date that AFM is caused by an enterovirus (EV) that invades and impairs the central nervous system.\u201d\n\nFor the study, researchers checked patients' spinal fluid for signs the immune system had fought an invading virus. The results showed children who got sick harbored antibodies that target enteroviruses.\n\n\"This is circumstantial evidence that this is what's going on, but it's a powerful piece of circumstantial evidence,\" Dr. Michael Wilson of the University of California, who helped lead the research, told the Associated Press.\n\nFor the study, researchers customized a Harvard-developed tool to search for evidence of hundreds of viruses simultaneously \u2014 including herpes, measles, chickenpox, Zika and other enteroviruses. The researchers found antibodies for the enterovirus strains D86 and A71 in the majority of patients studied.\n\n\u201cAntibodies against enterovirus were found in the spinal fluid of nearly 70 percent of AFM patients; less than 7 percent of non-AFM patients tested positive for these antibodies,\u201d per the release. \u201cFurthermore, because spinal fluid from AFM patients did not contain antibodies against any other virus, every other known virus could be eliminated as a possible culprit.\u201d\n\n'POLIO-LIKE' ILLNESS CASES INVESTIGATED BY CDC: SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?\n\nStill, more research is needed to understand why only a tiny fraction of those infected develop the ailment. It\u2019s also not clear why only children are affected.\n\nThere have been 22 confirmed cases of AFM in 2019. But doctors are preparing for potential spike next year, as the CDC says AFM cases have increased every two years since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all holding our breath for 2020,\u201d Dr. Ryan Schubert, a clinical fellow in the university's Department of Neurology and lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The mysterious polio-resembling illness that sickened hundreds of children last year may have been caused\u00a0by a viral infection, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
