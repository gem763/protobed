With iPhone sales dwindling, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant has increasingly focused on other burgeoning product areas such as its services and wearables division. We're likely to hear more about what Apple has in store for those product categories as well.\n\nHere's everything we're expecting to see from Apple CEO Tim Cook and his crew of execs at the big event, which starts at 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday.\n\nThree new iPhones\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe star of the show will undoubtedly be the introduction of three new iPhones to succeed the iPhone XS, the iPhone XS Max, and the iPhone XR. It's unclear what these new iPhones will be called, but rumors suggest the two new high-end iPhones could be called the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nThe biggest change coming in this year's iPhone is likely to be the introduction of a triple-camera sensor, which would put Apple's smartphones on par with their Android rivals. That third camera would most likely be an ultra-wide-angle camera much like the one found on Samsung's Galaxy S10, which offers a significantly wider field of view.\n\nOtherwise, the new iPhones are expected to feature reverse wireless charging, which would allow users to power accessories like AirPods just by resting them on the back of the phone, and improved Face ID. The less expensive iPhone XR may also come in new colors including green and purple.\n\nThat's all according to reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal and comments made by the TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that have been reported by 9to5Mac and other Apple blogs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new Apple Watch\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nApple traditionally releases a new Apple Watch alongside its fresh iPhones in September, so there's a chance it could do so again this year.", "description": "Apple is likely to announce the iPhone 11, the Apple Watch Series 5, and much more at its September event.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ioQhy0uVkQT6MhdqOMscRw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/62fd4ed352d793854f1fd4f262b4652d", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
