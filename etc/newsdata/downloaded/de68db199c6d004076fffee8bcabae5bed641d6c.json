For several years running, the company has followed up on its flagship X-series mirrorless camera with a more portable (and more affordable) option that still offers many of the best features and capabilities of the flagship. This step-down series is actually Fujifilm\u2019s most popular camera line; the X-T20, introduced in 2017, became the company\u2019s best-selling camera ever. And now its successor is here.\n\nWith the $899 X-T30, Fujifilm is trickling down some of the most impressive aspects of the X-T3 into a camera that costs a whopping $600 less. And considering that many have hailed the X-T3 as Fujifilm\u2019s best camera ever, that\u2019s a very good starting point. It\u2019s got the same fourth-generation 26.1-megapixel APS-C sensor, processing power, speedy burst shooting, and Fujifilm\u2019s whole set of film simulations that require little retouching. The X-T30 can record excellent-looking 4K video, and its 425-point phase-detect autofocus system spans the entire frame. In fact, right now the X-T30 actually delivers better autofocus accuracy and face detection than the X-T3 \u2014 at least until a firmware update arrives for the latter sometime this month.\n\nOur review of Fujifilm X-T30 Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Same sensor as X-T3 at much lower price\n\nExcellent autofocus and burst shooting capabilities\n\nCompact and light\n\nNice 4K video Bad Stuff Probably too small for people with big hands\n\nNo weather sealing\n\nViewfinder is improved from X-T20, but no match for X-T3\n\nStandard carry-a-spare mirrorless battery life Buy for $899.00 from Amazon Buy for $899.00 from B&H\n\nYou give up some niceties for the lower price, of course: this camera isn\u2019t weather sealed and its electronic viewfinder isn\u2019t quite as immersive or sharp as the X-T3\u2019s. But those trade-offs are fairly standard at this price. Everywhere else, it\u2019s hard to find something that surpasses the X-T30 \u2014 especially if you\u2019re drawn to Fujifilm\u2019s many dials and knobs for manual control when the moment calls for it.\n\nThis is a far more compact and light camera than the X-T3. The X-T30 is only 0.844 pounds as opposed to the 1.19-pound flagship. But size-wise, for me the X-T30 is actually a little too tiny. As with my past Fujifilm cameras, I had to buy the metal hand grip for the X-T3 to keep my pinky from always hanging off the bottom. With the X-T30, my ring finger also has nowhere to go, which makes for an awkward, but still secure, grip. Fujifilm\u2019s heavier telephoto lenses might pose some discomfort. If you already own the add-on grip for the X-T20 or even the older X-T10, it\u2019ll also fit the newer camera. That said, I can also appreciate the argument that the X-T30\u2019s light load and small footprint in a bag are some of its best perks \u2014 especially for a camera this powerful. It\u2019s just not a great choice for those of us with giant hands. Sony\u2019s A6400, perhaps the X-T30\u2019s most direct rival, does a little better at ergonomics despite its similar size.\n\nThe X-T30 looks identical to the X-T20 from the front and top. You\u2019ve got the same dials for mode, shutter speed, and exposure compensation. You lose the dedicated ISO dial that\u2019s present on the larger X-T3, but it\u2019s very easy to assign ISO to the front or rear control knob for instant adjustments. There\u2019s also still the tiny, hidden pop-up flash, which isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll get on Fujifilm\u2019s larger cameras. But honestly, I never found much use for it. Same goes for the camera\u2019s Advanced SR (scene recognition) Auto mode, which you can switch to by flipping a lever near the shutter speed dial. You\u2019re not buying a Fujifilm camera to use it in full auto.\n\nThis is a lot of camera in a little, lightweight body\n\nAround back are where the X-T30\u2019s changes are most pronounced. The four-direction d-pad is gone completely, replaced by an eight-way autofocus joystick that is also how you\u2019ll navigate the camera\u2019s menus. The Q button (for fast access to your basic settings) has also been repositioned slightly. I\u2019ve seen some complaints that it\u2019s easy to push accidentally, but this was never the case for me. Fujifilm has slimmed down the 3-inch touchscreen display, which still pulls out and articulates vertically, but won\u2019t fully flip to face forward for vlogging. As with the X-T3, I really like using the touchscreen to quickly move my focus point when looking through the viewfinder.\n\nThere\u2019s a 2.5mm microphone jack among the X-T30\u2019s ports, but if you want to monitor audio when recording video, you\u2019ll either need USB-C headphones or to use a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter. Fujifilm supports USB 3.1, allowing full operation of the camera when you plug in an external battery pack (with USB Power Delivery) or charger even when its battery is fully depleted. The single SD card slot is found right next to the battery slot.\n\nThe X-T30\u2019s viewfinder is brighter than the X-T20\u2019s, according to Fujifilm, and it\u2019s more responsive with a lag of 0.005 seconds and a very smooth refresh rate of 100 fps. The latter only applies when you put the camera into boost mode, which eats up the battery quicker. But it\u2019s worth doing if you\u2019re shooting action. Even with those improvements, this is still no match for the X-T3\u2019s EVF. For one, it\u2019s smaller (0.39 versus 0.5 inches) with a lower magnification (0.62x instead of 0.75x), and that difference is noticeable when you peer through both of them back to back. It also can\u2019t match the pricier camera on resolution (2.36 million versus 3.69 million dots). Lastly, the X-T3 has a larger eyecup that extends outward from the back of the camera more; as someone with glasses, the X-T30 simply wasn\u2019t as nice to shoot with, and my nose constantly pressed up against the rear LCD.\n\nThe X-T30\u2019s viewfinder isn\u2019t ideal if you wear glasses\n\nAs I said earlier, the X-T30 has even better autofocus abilities than the X-T3 at the moment. Both cameras can detect faces in a frame, but the X-T30 will actually let you pick which face you want as the primary subject. It can also detect and lock onto faces that are smaller (farther away) in a shot. And apparently black hair could throw off Fujifilm\u2019s face detection before, so that\u2019s been resolved, too. Those are the main improvements, and they\u2019ll be coming to the X-T3 in short order. Otherwise, the X-T30 has the same dependable and fast autofocus system of the pricier camera. It can shoot up to 8 fps in continuous mode with the mechanical shutter, a tad slower than the X-T3\u2019s 11 fps. But both cameras can shoot in a lightning-quick 30 fps sports mode that applies a 1.25x crop. There\u2019s no blackout in the viewfinder when you do this, and continuous autofocus keeps running the entire time.\n\nVideo is where the X-T30 is a rung below the X-T3. It can still shoot beautiful 4K footage (downsampled from 6K), but you\u2019re limited to 10-minute clips. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some arbitrary restriction, as this small camera would probably start to overheat if you went much over that. And 4K frame rate tops out at 30 fps instead of the X-T3\u2019s buttery-smooth 60 fps. (You can also record at 120 fps in 1080p for slow-motion footage.) Professional videographers will definitely lean toward the X-T3 for its longer shooting times, but the X-T30 is no slouch, able to record 8-bit 4:2:0 video direct to the SD card or 10-bit 4:2:2 video to an external recorder. That allows for plenty of post-processing flexibility, but if you\u2019re not a pro, Fujifilm\u2019s Eterna color filter makes for natural-looking video that\u2019s easy to quickly tune and adjust.\n\nAs always, JPEGs from the X-T30 look downright terrific. All of Fujifilm\u2019s signature film simulations are included, and it\u2019s a lot of fun testing them and seeing what works best for a given shooting scenario, whether you\u2019re looking for more vivid colors, moody black and white shots, or something with softer tones. The company recently launched a redesigned mobile app for iOS (it\u2019ll come to Android this summer), but I\u2019ll just say that there\u2019s still room for improvement in terms of speed and eliminating unnecessary steps. The Wi-Fi connection between phone and camera is stable, and sending photos over to your phone for a quick Instagram post is a great option to have. That\u2019s all I really ever do with the app, but you can also use it as a remote shutter via Bluetooth.\n\nYou can buy the X-T30 in several kit configurations; I\u2019d recommend pairing the camera with Fujifilm\u2019s excellent 35mm f/2 prime lens. Just like the body, it\u2019s designed to be lightweight and compact and has the makings of a perfect street setup. The X-T30 is facing some stiff competition in its price class (especially from Sony). But if you\u2019ve already invested in Fujifilm\u2019s lens lineup and have been waiting for an irresistible upgrade, this might just be it \u2014 if you\u2019ve got the right hands for it.", "description": "The $899 Fujifilm X-T30 offers a lot of what was great about the X-T3 \u2014 excellent autofocus, nice 4K video, and speedy continuous shooting \u2014 in a smaller, cheaper package.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/quWYIclXKOu9O5UM0-q1UPp91cE=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16023726/akrales_190410_3350_0223.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-12"}
