Dogs are an excellent motivation for their owners to get outdoors and walk them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this is what many people think about when adopting a dog,\u201d said Dr. Haider Warraich, director of the heart failure program at the Boston VA Healthcare System and who was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThey think they\u2019re doing it for the animal, not for their own health. But these studies suggest that adopting a dog may be as much of a service to your own health as the dog\u2019s,\u201d he said, according to NBC News.\n\nHowever, Dr. Warraich said more research needs to be done and added: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have me recommend patients adopt a dog to lower their risk of death.\u201d\n\nIn the heart attack study, 181,696 Swedes ages 40 to 85 who had a heart attack or stroke between January 2001 and December 2012 were monitored through a database. Of them, 5.7% owned dogs. Factors like age, other health issues and marital status were factored out.\n\nA second cardiovascular health study included in the report examined data of 3,837,005 people from ten previous studies. Margins of error were not provided for either study.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
