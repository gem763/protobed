The strength of this team is the leadership.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think it would go well whoever is in that position.\u201d\n\nJapan can expect a physical encounter with Samoa, who they beat 26-5 at the previous World Cup in England.\n\n\u201cTheirs is a physical game and what I want to do is the same, keep facing them head on,\u201d centre Ryoto Nakamura said on Friday.\n\n\u201cI feel that will be the focus point also for us as a team.\u201d\n\nSamoa have beaten Russia but lost to Scotland so far and so know a win against the hosts is imperative if they are to progress from the pool.", "description": "Jamie Joseph caused a stir when naming his starting lineup for Japan's Rugby World Cup Pool A meeting with Samoa on Saturday as, although he brought back regular captain Michael Leitch at flanker, Pieter Labuschagne was named skipper.", "authors": ["Jack Tarrant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436999727&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930UO", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
