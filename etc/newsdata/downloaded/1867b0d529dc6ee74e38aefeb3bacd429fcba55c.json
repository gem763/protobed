We asked her to scare up her high school yearbook photo, and take a short walk down memory lane.\n\nWhen was this photo taken?\n\nIt's my senior year graduation picture.\n\nWhere did you go to school and when did you graduate?\n\nI went to West Morris Central High School in Chester, NJ and graduated in 2005.\n\nDid you like this photo then, and do you like it now?\n\nI thought it was fine. If I had to grade it back then I would give it a \"C\"... and now, I just can't believe how young I looked.\n\nWhat was your general style back then? (Preppie, punk - whatever.)\n\nI went through a hippie phase in high school so I wore a lot of flowy skirts and headscarves and beads, and I am currently laughing thinking back to it.\n\nWhat memories does this photo bring up when you look at it?\n\nHigh school football games were a big thing at my school. Every now and then I would moonlight as the mascot. We were the wolfpack so I'm talking full wolf costume and mascot wolf head.\n\nDo you have any good/embarrassing yearbook quotes?\n\nWe didn't do quotes which is good because aren't they all a little cringy when you look back at them?\n\nWhat's your favorite high school memory?\n\nOhhhh \"the bagel rebellion.\" My entire graduating class walked out of school during a free bagel breakfast. How ungrateful does that sound?! We were really a good group of kids, very out of character I swear. I can't even remember why we did it, but we all walked out of school and onto the football field in protest. Protest of what? I don't know! But the event went done is class history and it was called \"the bagel rebellion.\"\n\nWhat was your favorite subject in school?\n\nI've always really enjoyed history, English and political science, which probably isn't surprising.\n\nWhat was your worst subject?\n\nSpanish and science, and that is ironic because my mom's first language is Spanish (from Puerto Rico) and my dad is a chemist!\n\nWere you voted \u201cmost likely to\u201d anything?\n\nThis is embarrassing - I was voted \"most gullible.\"\n\nWhat was the best advice you got in school?\n\nMistakes are a key part of growth.\n\nAny advice for students today?\n\nBe kind to each other.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "We asked\u00a0Carley Shimkus to give us her high school yearbook photo, and take a short walk down memory lane.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Carley-final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
