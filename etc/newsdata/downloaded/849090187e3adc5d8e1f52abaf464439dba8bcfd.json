Members of the House and Senate intelligence committees were allowed to see the complaint on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there\u2019s no there there when there\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling there,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said after reading the document.\n\nThe Senate passed a resolution calling for the report\u2019s release by unanimous voice vote on Tuesday. The House passed a similar measure by 421-0, with two Republicans voting \u201cpresent,\u201d on Wednesday even after the administration backed down and agreed to let the Senate and House intelligence committee members view the classified report in secure rooms on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe dispute over the report is the latest chapter in an ongoing power struggle, with the Trump administration resisting efforts by Democratic lawmakers investigating the president\u2019s business dealings and actions to obtain documents, records and testimony from the White House and senior officials.\n\nThe whistleblower report is believed to include an account of a telephone call on July 25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate a political rival, former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, in coordination with the U.S. attorney general and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nThere is no evidence that Biden, or his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian company, acted improperly.\n\nThe call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which the administration only later released.\n\nThe Trump administration released the official account of the half-hour call on Wednesday, a day after Pelosi announced that the Democratic-led House was launching the official impeachment inquiry.\n\nCOMMITTEE FOLLOW UP\n\nDemocratic Representative Adam Schiff, who will lead the hearing as chairman of the House Intelligence panel, said after reading the whistleblower report that it was well-written, and called the allegations \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe complaint... certainly provides information for the committee to follow up,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiff has said the Justice Department misinterpreted the law in blocking Maguire from disclosing the complaint.\n\nMaguire may also face questions about a report in the Washington Post on Wednesday that he had threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might press him to withhold information from lawmakers. Maguire, the former director of the National Center for Counterterrorism, issued a statement denying that report.\n\nAfter the public hearing at 9 a.m. on Thursday, Maguire is due to appear before the Senate intelligence committee in a closed session at 11 a.m.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a bilateral meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019.

Trump has yet to nominate a permanent candidate, who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy appeared side by side in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday and denied impropriety in their call. The Ukrainian president told reporters: \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nAnd at a news conference closing out three days of meetings around the U.N. General Assembly, Trump accused Democrats of launching the impeachment inquiry for political gain, \u201cbecause they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump's top intelligence official will be grilled by U.S. lawmakers on Thursday over the administration's handling of a whistleblower report central to an impeachment inquiry into the president.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434018048&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P09J", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
