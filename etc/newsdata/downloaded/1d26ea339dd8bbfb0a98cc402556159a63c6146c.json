REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\nThe brewing giant, which in July tried to raise up to $9.8 billion through an initial public offering (IPO) of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, said on Tuesday it would offer 1.3 billion shares at between HK$27 and HK$30 ($3.45-$3.83) apiece.\n\nThe new offering includes a rare \u201cupsize\u201d option that will enable the company to sell up to 36.8% more shares. Assuming it exercises the option in full at the top end of the price range, the sale could raise up to $6.6 billion before any regular overallotment option is included.\n\nThe Belgium-based company would raise up to $4.8 billion without the upsize option.\n\nProceeds will help AB InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer, reduce debts of more than $100 billion, accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller in late 2016.\n\nEven at the low end of the price range, the IPO would be the second biggest globally this year, trailing the $8.1 billion flotation of Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) in May, data from Refinitiv shows.\n\nThe IPO would also provide a boost for Hong Kong after China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) last month delayed a listing worth up to $15 billion amid political unrest in the city.\n\n\u201cYou could say that the conditions are more challenging, but when we listen to potential investors we believe that there is solid excitement about this business and its IPO,\u201d said Jan Craps, CEO of Budweiser APAC, referring to the protests in Hong Kong.\n\nSo far this year, companies have raised $10.8 billion in IPOs in Hong Kong - well short of the $41 billion raised in New York, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nAB InBev\u2019s revived deal excludes the brewer\u2019s Australian operations, which it agreed to sell to Japan\u2019s Asahi Group (2502.T) for $11 billion shortly after the IPO was shelved.\n\nWithout Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations would be more focused on faster growth markets such as China, India and Vietnam, which could make it easier to achieve a higher valuation, sources have said.\n\nIt would also give Budweiser APAC, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, a market capitalization of $45.6 billion-$50.7 billion prior to the IPO, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.", "description": "Anheuser-Busch InBev NV will kick off a second attempt to spin off its Asian business in Hong Kong with the launch on Wednesday of an IPO worth up to $6.6 billion that could be the world's second largest flotation this year.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430795574&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0PE", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
