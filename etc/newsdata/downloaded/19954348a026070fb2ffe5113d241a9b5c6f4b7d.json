That ended Tuesday.\n\nMr. Buttigieg sparred sharply with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke on guns. He rebuked Representative Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy. And, most notably, he engaged in the most substantive and sustained contrast of any candidate yet with Ms. Warren.\n\nIt was Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s exchange with Ms. Warren over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class \u201ccosts.\u201d)\n\n\u201cA yes or no question that did not get a yes or no answer,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d He rattled off how her plan would \u201cobliterate\u201d the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d alternative.\n\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s rebuke of Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage\u201d \u2014 may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.", "description": "Warren was called out by rivals for a change while Biden failed to stand out, and Sanders calmed concerns about his health. Buttigieg had his biggest night yet. But no game-changing moments for other candidates.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "Reid J.
