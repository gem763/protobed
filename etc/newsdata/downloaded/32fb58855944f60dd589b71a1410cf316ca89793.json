ISE, also known as information security analysts, help businesses safeguard sensitive and confidential information.\n\nAccording to the 2019 MidYear Data Breach QuickView Report, 3,813 breaches were reported in the first six months of 2019, up 54 percent from the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOccupying the four top spots, however, are health care roles with physicians holding tight to the number one spot since 2015.\n\nAccording to the report, physicians earn the most with a median U.S base salary of $193,415. Following close behind are pharmacy managers, dentists and pharmacists earning above $120,000, according to the report. Coming in at number five, with a median base salary of $122,585, are enterprise architects- earning the most within the tech industry which occupies the majority of the list.\n\nThose salaries are determined through an algorithm which controls for factors such as location and seniority. The high paychecks within health care and the tech industry signify the high demand for workers who are trained and ready to take on these roles. But companies are also in stiff competition to pay top dollar for these employees.\n\nIn their report, Glassdoor also identifies the top 25 highest paying companies in America in 2019. The three highest paying employers in 2019 were all tech companies with a median total salary over $160,000 a year. Palo Alto Networks paid the highest with the median total compensation at $170,929, the report cited. Among those employers are tech giants like Twitter, Google and LinkedIn.\n\nThe companies identified in the report have the highest median total compensation package including base salary and other forms of compensation, such as commissions, tips, and bonuses.
