The franchise is looking for a new home with its lease set to expire at FedEx Field in 2027.\n\nRFK Stadium hosted the Redskins from 1961 until 1996. It has also hosted teams like the Washington Senators (1962-71), Washington Nationals (2005-07) and D.C. United (1996-2017).\n\nIn a written statement to DCist, interim deputy mayor John Falcicchio said it\u2019s time to \u201crevive the RFK campus.\u201d\n\nLast year, mayor Muriel Bowser advocated for the Redskins to \u201ccome home,\u201d noting they were the only Washington sports franchise who played outside the District. In a radio interview in July, Redskins president Bruce Allen said he\u2019d like to have a stadium agreement done within the next year.\n\nSites near Dulles International Airport, National Harbor in Maryland and the RFK site are all thought to be considered as possibilities for Washington\u2019s next stadium.\n\nSpeaking with The Associated Press in July, Allen said the Redskins\u2018 next home will be for \u201cthe next generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA stadium location and building is for the next 40 years \u2014 where you\u2019re going to be and the home,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken into account where technology is going and where people want to work, live and play in the same location. It\u2019s critical. It\u2019s critical for the way you\u2019re going to present your team to your fans and how accessible you can be for your fans.\u201d\n\nEvents D.C., the agency which controls RFK Stadium, is seeking bids from contractors to demolish the stadium. The city pays $3.5 million annually to maintain the facility, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the news.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
