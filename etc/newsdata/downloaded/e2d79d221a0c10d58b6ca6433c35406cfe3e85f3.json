Photo: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nWe may be living in a golden age for cat owners looking for fancy litter boxes or designer perches, but choosing the right food for our feline friends can still be surprisingly difficult, due to confusing labels and the lack of transparency required of food companies. \u201cOwners are trained to look at the ingredient list as the only way to judge the quality of pet food,\u201d says Martha G. Cline, a certified veterinary nutritionist at Red Bank Veterinary Hospital in New Jersey. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the quality of that ingredient or the nutrient provided in that ingredient.\u201d Jennifer Coates, a veterinary expert at Chewy, says cats need more protein than many other species and stresses that the protein \u201cshould be sourced from animals.\u201d But aside from noting the kind and amount of any cat food\u2019s animal protein, the labels on many brands won\u2019t give you much useful information, according to the professionals we spoke with.\n\nFortunately there are a few resources out there that can help you better choose your cat food. \u201cProbably the most important part when you\u2019re buying [food] for your pet is looking for the nutritional-adequacy statement and making sure it\u2019s for the appropriate life stage for your pet,\u201d says Cline. All pet food should have a nutritional-advocacy statement from the American Association of Feed Control Officers (AAFCO) noting whether they meet the standards for growth (good for kittens), adult maintenance (for maintaining a healthy weight), or all life stages (any age). Several vets we spoke with also pointed us to the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA)\u2019s tool kit with questions pet owners should ask when they\u2019re shopping for cat food, including about the percentages of protein, fat, and carbohydrates in a particular food (this data isn\u2019t required on labels). After asking many of these questions herself, veterinarian Lisa Pierson compiled a thorough chart of the nutrient profile for hundreds of cat-food flavors. As for what to look for on that chart, Jennifer Berg, founder of Tribeca Veterinary Wellness, says \u201cmore protein than fat, and then very little of any kind of carbohydrate is what we feel is probably ideal.\u201d She advises looking for food that\u2019s at least 45 percent protein and less than 10 percent carbohydrates, noting that nutrient profiles can vary widely between flavors of the same cat-food brand, so be sure to check the chart for each individual flavor.\n\nWith obesity and related conditions like diabetes on the rise among cats, you\u2019ll also want to make sure your kitty isn\u2019t eating too much. To maintain a healthy weight for your cat, vets suggest canned (or wet) food, which is less calorically dense than dry food, and feeding two to three times per day on a regular schedule, rather than just leaving the food out. \u201cKitties should not be grazing all day, every day,\u201d says veterinarian Karen Becker. \u201cWe cannot leave a bowl of food out and expect them to maintain their body weight.\u201d Some vets we spoke with say it\u2019s fine to feed cats a mix of dry and canned food, but the consensus seems to be swinging in favor of wet food, not only because it contains fewer calories but because it\u2019s richer in moisture (cats don\u2019t have much of natural thirst drive, so it\u2019s important to ensure that they\u2019re getting enough water from their food). With the consensus on wet over dry food in mind, below are the best canned foods you can feed your feline friend, based on our seven vets\u2019 recommendations. And if you also own a dog, or prefer four-legged friends of the canine variety, be sure to check out our picks for the best vet-recommended dog foods.\n\nBest food for adult cats\n\nPurina Pro Plan True Nature Natural Chicken & Turkey Entree in Gravy Canned Cat Food $23 (was $29, now 21% off) Cats generally require 200 to 250 calories per day, but this varies based on frame size, activity level, and whether your cat needs to lose or gain weight. Megan Shepherd, a veterinary nutritionist at the Virginia Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Tech, advises checking with your veterinarian for more specific guidance and consulting this body-condition score chart to see if your cat is under- or overweight. Because Purina employs full-time veterinary nutritionists and invests heavily in research and development, it\u2019s a favorite brand of veterinarians like Cori Blair of Feline Health (a cats-only practice in New York City) and Valerie Parker, an associate professor of small-animal internal medicine and nutrition at Ohio State University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cThe meats in gravy are generally what I feed my cats,\u201d says Blair, who explains that these flavors are usually palatable to most cats, which can help if you\u2019re transitioning from dry to canned food. According to Pierson\u2019s chart, this formula contains 57 percent protein, 37 percent fat, and 6 percent carbohydrates, so it meets the standards Berg recommends for healthy adult felines. $23 for 24 at Amazon Buy $23 for 24 at Chewy Buy\n\nWeruva Paw Lickin' Chicken in Gravy Grain-Free Canned Cat Food Berg points out that this chicken-in-gravy flavor from Weruva also hits her nutritional requirements. Although it\u2019s labeled as \u201cgrain-free,\u201d vets are wary of this marketing term that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the food is low in carbs. \u201cIf you think about grain-free pet food, they\u2019re replacing those things with starches or a potato or a legume,\u201d explains Cline, \u201cand if the whole idea in the marketing of feeding grain-free food is because it\u2019s not part of the natural diet of a cat, you just replaced it with other things that are also not part of the natural diet of the cat either.\u201d This Weruva food is formulated with potato starch but contains only 3 percent carbohydrates (along with 65 percent protein and 32 percent fat), so if your cat likes the taste, it\u2019s still a healthy choice. $46 for 24 at Amazon Buy $46 for 24 at Chewy Buy\n\nTiki Cat Puka Puka Luau Succulent Chicken in Chicken Consomme Grain-Free Canned Cat Food If you browse Pierson\u2019s list, you\u2019ll see that Tiki Cat offers many healthy foods that are high in protein and low in carbs. Lots of Tiki Cat food is fish-flavored, which is extremely attractive to cats because of its salty taste, but vets like Berg and Becker actually discourage feeding cats fish because of its high iodine content, which could lead to hyperthyroidism. Fortunately, this all-chicken flavor is just as nutritious, with 77 percent protein, 23 percent fat, and no carbohydrates. $18 for 12 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) food for adult cats\n\nFancy Feast Roasted Turkey Feast Canned Cat Food There\u2019s nothing wrong with saving money on cat food as long as you\u2019re picking a food that\u2019s nutritionally sound. \u201cA lot of people will say Fancy Feast is kind of the \u2018McDonald\u2019s for cats,\u2019 but it\u2019s actually not the case,\u201d says Berg. \u201cPlenty of the Fancy Feast [formulas] are actually quite high in protein and very low in carbohydrates.\u201d With 56 percent protein, 38 percent fat, and only 6 percent carbs, this turkey flavor fits the bill. Since canned food is less calorically dense than dry food, feeding with it is generally more expensive, but you\u2019ll likely save on medical care in the long term. $17 for 24 at Amazon Buy $17 for 24 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest human-grade cat food\n\nTo further maximize your cat\u2019s nutrition, Becker recommends looking for human-grade food, meaning it contains meat that has been approved by the USDA for human consumption. Most pet food is made from feed-grade meat, which, according to Becker, \u201cmeans it\u2019s lesser quality with potentially less-than-healthy ingredients.\u201d Although human-grade pet food is generally more expensive and more difficult to find, some brands are starting to offer it for discerning cat owners. Small and NomNomNow are two relatively new, direct-to-consumer brands that use all-human-grade ingredients and formulate their food to cats\u2019 ideal nutritional needs. If you\u2019ve thought about feeding your cat a fresh- or raw-food diet but are concerned about food safety or convenience, a preservative-free, human-grade, commercial food is the next best thing, according to Becker. (I\u2019ve given my cat a sample of NomNomNow, and she was a big fan.) Prices vary, as both companies offer customized portion sizes based on your cat\u2019s age and weight.\n\nBest food for senior cats\n\nWeruva Truluxe On The Cat Wok with Chicken & Beef in Pumpkin Soup Grain-Free Canned Cat Food If you look at Pierson\u2019s chart, you\u2019ll see that the fourth column tracks how much phosphorus is in each food. This might not be the first thing you look for when shopping for your own food, but this mineral is actually very important in cat health. Berg says limiting phosphorus is crucial for senior cats, as too much of it can cause or worsen kidney disease, a common problem among older cats. Previously, vets would advise reducing protein in senior cats\u2019 diets, but Berg contends that protein \u2014 and moisture \u2014 levels should stay high while reducing phosphorus. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the phosphorus tends to go up as the protein goes up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are some proteins that are higher in phosphorus than others.\u201d So while there\u2019s no AAFCO standard for senior cats, a low-phosphorus food (Berg says to try to stay under 200 milligrams per 100 calories) could benefit your cat that is ten years old or older. This nutritionally balanced Weruva food contains only 163 milligrams of phosphorus per 100 calories. $40 for 24 at Amazon Buy $40 for 24 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest food for kittens\n\nRoyal Canin Mother & Babycat Ultra-Soft Mousse in Sauce Wet Cat Food If you\u2019re buying food for a kitten, make sure to look for the AAFCO nutritional-adequacy statement for growth. \u201cBecause kittens are growing and developing, they require more calories than adult cats do on a per-pound basis,\u201d says Coates. \u201cKitten foods are generally higher in fat than are foods designed for adults to provide them with these extra calories.\u201d Blair and Parker are both fans of Royal Canin, and the brand\u2019s just-for-kittens food is packed with protein and fortified with all the vitamins and minerals the littlest kitties need to thrive. $35 for 24 at Amazon Buy $27 for 24 at Chewy Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
