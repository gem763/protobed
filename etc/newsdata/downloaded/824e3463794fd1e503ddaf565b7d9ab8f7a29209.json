The Cherries were sixth in the league with ten points from six matches after an impressive 3-1 away win against Southampton at St Mary\u2019s in mid-September.\n\nSince then, Eddie Howe\u2019s side have failed to register a league victory, losing one and drawing two.\n\nA Draw No Bet with Bournemouth could be a good option as they fight to get back to their best form and is being offered at 5/4 by William Hill.\n\nWill the Hornets\u2019 wait for a win end?\n\nIt feels like a lifetime since Watford picked up three points in the Premier League. The last time they won was in April when they beat Huddersfield 2-1 away from home. In fact, Watford have only won six of their last 29 games since Christmas Day.\n\nHowever, they were unlucky not to come away from Tottenham victorious after a controversial late equaliser in north London and with Bournemouth currently experiencing a dip in form of their own this could be the weekend Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores bags his first three points of the campaign.\n\nThe Hornets have shown some improvement and William Hill have them at 23/20.\n\nWilson to rescue Bournemouth\n\nCallum Wilson has not scored in two Premier League matches and that should worry Watford fans.\n\nThe England international last scored in the 2-2 draw with West Ham in September but was kept quiet by Arsenal and Norwich.\n\nWilson last went longer than two games without a goal at the start of the season when he endured a four-match goalless streak.\n\nWith England places up for grabs, he\u2019ll be keen to get back among the goals and will view this match as a great opportunity to do so.\n\nWilliam Hill have Wilson to score first at 4/1 to score anytime and 6/5 at anytime.\n\nExpect goals\n\nBoth Watford and Bournemouth have been leaking goals all season.\n\nThey have managed just one clean sheet each, with Bournemouth\u2019s coming last weekend against Norwich and Watford\u2019s against Sheffield United earlier this month.\n\nWatford\u2019s Ben Foster has let in five more goals than any other Premier League goalkeeper as his team have conceded 21 times.\n\nThis is a game where both teams will fancy their chances of getting goals. However, Bournemouth\u2019s attacking threat is arguably the more potent of the two and the Cherries will be keen to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle.\n\nWilliam Hill has Both Teams To Score at 5/7 or a Bournemouth win and Both Teams to Score at 4/1.", "description": "Betting preview as Watford look for their first three points in the Premier League this season and an out-of-form Bournemouth provide a perfect opportunity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/betting/Better-Collective/bournemouth-celebrate-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
