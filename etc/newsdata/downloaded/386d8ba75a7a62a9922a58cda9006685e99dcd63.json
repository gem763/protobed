She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump\u2019s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it\u2019s almost inevitable.\n\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.\n\nPelosi\u2019s conversations \u2014 and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive \u2014 come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party\u2019s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.\n\nSeven freshman Democrats with previous service in the military, defense and U.S. intelligence said in a Monday night Washington Post op-ed that if the allegations against Trump are true, \u201cwe believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country, and throughout our careers, we have sworn oaths to defend the Constitution of the United States many times over. Now, we join as a unified group to uphold that oath as we enter uncharted waters and face unprecedented allegations against President Trump,\u201d the seven wrote.\n\n[Seven freshman Democrats: These allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect]\n\nPelosi\u2019s office declined to comment Monday night about her conversations.\n\nBut an official familiar with her thinking warned that just because she was considering impeachment didn\u2019t mean it would happen right away. The person said the process still needs to play out.\n\nThe same individual also said that members have been calling Pelosi for advice on the matter while she has been consulting with investigative committee chairs and fellow leaders on next steps. Those conversations have focused on how to force disclosure to Congress about a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that alleges Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukraine constituted an \u201curgent concern\u201d regarding the nation\u2019s security.\n\nThe White House has refused to turn over the document.\n\nDemocrats say there\u2019s been a significant shift in the tenor of the discussion following reports that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his family.\n\nTrump on Monday denied that he offered military aid to Ukraine\u2019s leader only if the country launched a probe.\n\nThe drama is all building toward Thursday, a make-or-break moment in the eyes of House Democratic leaders. Pelosi gave the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, until then to turn over the whistleblower complaint. Under the law, any matter deemed of \u201curgent concern\u201d is supposed to be shared with Congress. But the Trump administration has refused to hand over the material \u2014 despite an inspector general\u2019s determination that it has met that threshold.\n\nPelosi had made it clear on Sunday that she would no longer stand for months of administration stonewalling. In a letter to Republicans and Democrats, she wrote, \u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nThe letter did not specify what \u201cnew stage of investigation\u201d meant. But people familiar with Pelosi\u2019s conversations say there\u2019s been a shift in her thinking on impeachment.\n\nSenior Democratic officials cautioned that no steps have been finalized, and there were still questions about timing and how to conduct the proceedings. Some Democrats, for example, want House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to have a role in whatever impeachment process moves ahead. Democratic leaders are also discussing the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence.\n\nIn the meantime, House leaders are planning to hold a vote on a resolution to either condemn Trump\u2019s actions or express the sense of the House that the administration turn over the whistleblower complaint, a move liberals are already dismissing as insufficient. The language has not been finalized.\n\nOn Monday night, 146 Democrats backed impeachment, well over a majority of the caucus. But Pelosi has long said that any impeachment would need public support as well as backing from some Republicans.\n\nCurrently, she has neither. Voters still overwhelmingly disapprove of Democrats impeaching the president \u2014 though those polls were conducted before last week\u2019s reports about the whistleblower complaint. In the Senate, Republicans have made it clear that they are standing with Trump and are unlikely to convict him if a trial occurs.\n\nYet in interviews with multiple Democratic lawmakers and aides on Monday, almost everyone said the House had reached a point of no return on impeachment.\n\nFor example, impeachment dominated a meeting of chiefs of staff for lawmakers in competitive districts on Monday, according to one official familiar with the talks. The individual said the session grew heated and angry, pitting those congressional aides who thought it was time to back impeachment against those who worry about the political fallout.\n\nMeanwhile, freshman Democrats \u2014 most of whom were back in their districts Monday \u2014 have been in constant discussion about how to respond to the Ukraine controversy, with plans for a conference call Monday night. Many were debating privately whether they should come out in favor of impeachment before Pelosi or wait until after she makes a public move to take a position.\n\n[Analysis | The House Democrats who want to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump]\n\nThe seven lawmakers who backed impeachment in the Post op-ed \u2014 Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia \u2014 said they did not arrive at their decision lightly. They called on their colleagues to use all congressional authorities, including impeachment hearings, to \u201caddress these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.\u201d\n\nThey weren\u2019t alone. Reps. Angie Craig and Dean Phillips, two moderate Democrats from Minnesota, also joined those impeachment calls Monday.\n\nIn another telling shift, Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) issued a lengthy statement Monday calling Trump\u2019s conduct a \u201creckless abuse of power\u201d and a \u201cturning point.\u201d A close Pelosi ally of similar views and temperament, she described being previously reluctant to pursue impeachment for similar reasons as the speaker has stated: the fear that it would divide the country and that a Senate acquittal might backfire. But she said her thinking had changed, writing that an impeachment inquiry \u201cmay be the only recourse Congress has\u201d to reproach Trump.\n\n\u201cCongress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation\u2019s history with decisive action,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAnother significant shift came from Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), who has urged Democrats to sharpen their appeal to Trump voters and protect the party\u2019s centrist flank. On Monday night, she announced support for an impeachment inquiry \u201cbecause we must follow the facts and hold the President accountable.\u201d", "description": "The speaker, a longtime skeptic of impeachment, is gauging whether to pursue proceedings after a whistleblower\u2019s complaint raises new allegations against the president.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jGavZ9qH0QWBSoFpNnLl6AjXvCA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O3MZQAW5RAI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
