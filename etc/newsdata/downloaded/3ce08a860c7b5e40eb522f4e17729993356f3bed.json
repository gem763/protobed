We also have hundreds of books around the house, including favorites that I read often.\n\nHow could it get any cheaper than that?\n\nNow that I\u2019m a semi-retired grump with more time on my hands for shaving nickels, I realize how wrong I was.\n\nKindles and their ilk are great devices for cheapskates. You just have to use them right.\n\nThe wrong way is for impulse buys of books you wouldn\u2019t buy otherwise.\n\nThe right way is to get books in the public domain on the cheap.\n\nAmazon will sell you the entire works of Shakespeare, Dickens, and Twain for less than $1 apiece.\n\nI\u2019m not sure when I will next read Hamlet or Hard Times or Huckleberry Finn, but I now have them on my Kindle for whenever I want them, wherever I am. And for those who are really cheap, you can get free versions of many books online through Project Gutenberg.\n\nThe Kindle is even better for foreign authors, which is the actual reason I finally shelled out $99 for the device. I bought all the works of Jules Verne and of Alexandre Dumas in French for $2.99 apiece. In the past, I purchased used copies of French-language books from Amazon. It usually cost a good bit more than $2.99 for each book, plus I had to spend several dollars in shipping and handling, and wait for the book to arrive.\n\nE-book readers are also great for minor authors who can be hard to find in public libraries. I bought electronic versions of the complete works of John Buchan, author of \u201cThe Thirty-Nine Steps,\u201d and of H. Rider Haggard, author of \u201cKing Solomon\u2019s Mines,\u201d for 99 cents apiece.\n\nWe live in a world where free internet access has upended the livelihoods for musicians and writers, among others. That\u2019s not good. But I see no harm in getting the works of authors who have been dead for decades, if not centuries, on the cheap.\n\nOf course, the implications of electronic books go way beyond that. I\u2019m writing this in a room lined with books. Some have followed my family around for decades.\n\nIf we go whole hog for electronic books, do we really need all these books? For that matter, do we need this room?\n\nI put the idea of a book-free house to my wife, Clarissa. She gave me a look. She sighed. She spoke: \u201cYeah, we also won\u2019t need beds. We\u2019ll just be hanging from the ceiling like bats.\u201d\n\nI knew that Clarissa would react like this. But I can\u2019t resist pulling her chain from time to time.\n\nTo be honest, I mostly agree with her. There is something comforting about being surrounded by books.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I could live in a house without them. If I can\u2019t fall asleep, I can grab David McCullough\u2019s wonderful biography of Truman or a Willa Cather masterpiece like \u201cDeath Comes for the Archbishop\u201d or the best baseball book ever, \u201cThe Boys of Summer\u201d by Roger Kahn. They\u2019re all there.\n\nThat brings us to one of my favorite places in the world: the public library. Is there any better place to spend a rainy day than in one? Is there any better place to spend a sunny day?\n\nEvery library I\u2019ve frequented has gems on its bookshelves ignored by much of the public. I live in fear that some efficient librarian will realize that I\u2019m the only person who ever checks them out and chuck them. Fortunately for me, libraries go years without pruning their book collections.\n\nHow much is the e-book revolution shaking up public libraries? Less than you might think.\n\nE-books make up just 11% of circulation in the public library in South Orange, N.J., my current hometown. And other non-print products, including videos and audiobooks, account for 6%.\n\nLibrary Director Melissa Kopecky doesn\u2019t see paper books disappearing soon. Paper books are more durable than electronic books, she says, and often cheaper for libraries because of new restrictions from publishers.\n\n\u201cWhatever is going to replace the paper book in the library doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many readers still prefer traditional books. \u201cPeople who love paper just love paper,\u201d she says.\n\nStill, the world is changing. We recently went to visit friends in Geneva. In the past, I would have stuffed two or three tried-and-true books, either ones I owned or ones from the library, in my travel bag. This time, I brought the Kindle.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Ideas on how to stretch your dollars in retirement?
