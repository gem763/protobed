You probably don\u2019t either.\n\nYou hear all the time about wealthy celebrities dying without a will. The most recent was Aretha Franklin, who died last year.\n\nFranklin had three handwritten wills, one left under a couch cushion. The artist\u2019s failure to do proper estate planning has left a legacy of discord. Her children \u2014 four sons \u2014 are in a heated court battle. Things have gotten so bad that a judge put the estate\u2019s administration under court supervision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut if you think this just happens with the rich and famous, you need to talk to Rhonda Green.\n\nGreen knows all too well what happens when individuals fail to plan for their death, and I\u2019m not talking just about leaving instructions on the distribution of assets. She\u2019s been the eyewitness to fights over funeral arrangements.\n\nGreen is the funeral services manager at my place of worship, First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland. It\u2019s her full-time job, and there\u2019s no cost to the families she assists in planning the funerals of their loved ones.\n\nGreen can tell you some stories. Here\u2019s just a glimpse of what\u2019s she\u2019s seen:\n\n\u25cf A woman, with no will, died with four adult children. Two of them wanted to cremate their mother to save money. The other two wanted to honor their mother\u2019s wishes for a burial. They ended up in court, where it was discovered that the mother had purchased a cemetery plot for herself. She received her burial, but the conflict left the children divided.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf An older man passed away, leaving a $125,000 life insurance policy to his much younger girlfriend of two years. His adult children had no idea she was the sole beneficiary. The girlfriend, as was her right, refused to use any of the insurance proceeds to pay for the funeral or burial. The man\u2019s children had to come up with the money themselves. When the girlfriend tried to attend the funeral, the police were called.\n\nBut here\u2019s a tale that should send you straight to an attorney\u2019s office to draw up a will of your own:\n\nA man died and his current wife didn\u2019t want his children or their mother (his ex-wife) to have anything to do with planning the funeral. Well, it turned out that the husband had never taken his ex-wife\u2019s name off the house, nor had he removed her as the beneficiary of his insurance policy. The ex got everything. To her credit, the former wife did pay for the funeral and burial, but she reclaimed the house that was rightfully hers. The widow had to go live with her mother.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are the documents you need to bulletproof your wishes after you die\n\nAfter having to act as a mediator for warring family members, Green developed a guide to encourage people to plan for their death. This document turned into a book, \u201cMy Exit Plan: Getting My House in Order.\u201d It\u2019s the Color of Money Book Club pick for this month. You can order it at rhondagreen.org or on Amazon.\n\nThis self-published book is impactful largely because of Green\u2019s experience at the front lines of family disputes and dysfunctions. You cannot help but shake your head reading about a wife trying to snatch the microphone from her dead husband\u2019s two stepdaughters during his funeral. A forgotten will gave the stepdaughters some justice.\n\nGreen is careful to protect people\u2019s privacy, but the drama she chronicles should be the needed push that gets you to do some estate planning.\n\nAD\n\nThe book covers the basics, and there\u2019s a companion workbook where folks can list important information, such as the location of a will or insurance policy. But Green\u2019s ultimate goal is to motivate you to act \u2014 and now.\n\nAD\n\nRecently Green coordinated an exit plan symposium at our church that drew about 1,300 people.\n\n\u201cIf you really love your family, then put your wishes in writing and make it legal,\u201d she said during the symposium.\n\nYou will die. Don\u2019t exit leaving a hot mess behind.\n\nAs one symposium attendee testified: \u201cThere\u2019s no drama in the universe like death drama.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m hosting an online chat about \u201cMy Exit Plan\u201d at noon Eastern on Oct. 30 at washingtonpost.com/discussions. Green will join me to answer questions about getting your own house in order.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
