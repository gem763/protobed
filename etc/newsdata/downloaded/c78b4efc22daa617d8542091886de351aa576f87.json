Fearing he\u2019d never leave jail alive, it was only when Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic was ousted in 2001 that he was let go.\n\nWhat he found was a Kosovo free of Serb soldiers but stuck in a limbo he now likens to going from a \u201cSerbian prison to an international hospital.\u201d Now the strategically important nation, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is at the center of a struggle for influence in the Balkans contested by Russia, the European Union, China and Turkey.\n\nAnd it will probably be up to the bookish IT engineer, who has ditched his signature long hair and flannel shirt for a crisp suit and white pressed shirt, to turn the nation of 1.9 million around after his party won this month\u2019s snap elections.\n\nKurti may be designated prime minister as early as this week, when his first task is to try to form a government. Then he\u2019ll have to get to work trying mend ties with Serbia -- a key requirement to starting accession talks with the EU. But he\u2019s a controversial choice.\n\nAs an anti-corruption crusader, he organized protests targeting the international administrators who oversaw Kosovo\u2019s transition from war-torn territory to fledgling democracy. In 2007, two activists from his ethnic-Albanian party died and dozens were injured in a clash with United Nations police. Kurti, 44, was himself arrested and detained for nine months.\n\nHe\u2019s also a fierce critic of both Kosovo President Hashim Thaci -- who comes from a rival political party -- and his Serb counterpart Aleksandar Vucic, calling them \u201cauthoritarian leaders.\u201d He denounced them for trying to reach a secret reconciliation deal last year that he said could lead to more violence in Europe\u2019s most volatile region.\n\nArmy Generals\n\nThe scars between Serbs and Kosovo\u2019s Albanian majority run deep. The 1998-99 war killed 13,535 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. Now Kosovo is recognized by the U.S. and most EU members. Five nations from the bloc joined Russia and China in siding with Serbia, which refuses to acknowledge Kosovo\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThat poses a hurdle for Kurti, who must now find a way sit down at a negotiating table with Thaci and Vucic. Also, unlike Thaci or former Premier Ramush Haradinaj, Kurti wasn\u2019t a guerrilla fighter. And he wasn\u2019t part of Milosevic\u2019s close circle, while Vucic served as the late Serb leader\u2019s information minister.\n\nKurti has been a harsh critic of the Brussels-mediated talks since they started in 2013, saying there\u2019s little to negotiate apart from war damages from Serbia, which he says \u201cowes us a lot.\u201d And he staked out a tough position before the election, slamming a proposal from Thaci and Vucic to redraw borders so the neighbors can incorporate areas inhabited by their ethnic kin.\n\nDialog Needed\n\n\u201cNo deals without dialog. No dialog with maps. No maps with presidents around who like to behave as army generals,\u201d Kurti said in one of two interviews with Bloomberg this year.\n\nAfter 2013, when Thaci and Vucic signed a framework agreement envisioning some autonomy for Serbs in Kosovo, Kurti\u2019s party repeatedly disrupted parliament by setting off tear gas grenades. He also criticized Thaci and blamed the international community that helps to keep the small economy running for having \u201cclosed an eye and a half toward corruption and criminal matters.\u201d\n\nAutonomy for the remaining Serbs in Kosovo, as envisaged by the EU-brokered deal, is out of the question, Kurti said this week. That drew a swift rebuke from the Serbian government, which accused him of undermining what little had been agreed on.\n\nWhen it comes to geopolitics, Kurti doesn\u2019t mince words about who\u2019s stoking tensions in the Balkans: It\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to be very careful in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where he is using Serbia as an instrument,\u201d he said.\n\nNo rush for Deal\n\nWhile he has spoken of needing to advance with the talks, he says Kosovo is in no rush to reach a deal. He\u2019s sent mixed signals on how he now feels about a possible unification of Kosovo and Albania, which he used to champion. He remains adamant there should be no territorial exchanges with Serbia as part of a mutual-recognition deal.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- When NATO jets bombed Serb forces 20 years ago to push them out of Kosovo, Albin Kurti was packed onto a red bus with other political prisoners to be used as a human shield.He was beaten in custody, convicted of terrorism by a Serb court and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
