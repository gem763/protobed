McMaster\u2019s comments yesterday all the more notable. From a Foundation for Defense of Democracies event:\n\nREPORTER: Is it appropriate for the president of the United States to solicit foreign interference in our political process? MCMASTER: Of course, no. No, it\u2019s absolutely not. And of course, what has to happen here is seeing our democracy play out, our separation of powers play out. And for the American people, through their representatives in Congress, to make a judgment of whether that happened.\n\nRepublicans senators such as Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst and Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner should take note. There\u2019s a core question about whether a president should seek foreign campaign assistance, and McMaster, a retired three-star Army general, answered it the right way.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not appropriate. It\u2019s \u201cabsolutely not\u201d the right thing to do.\n\nIt took a little courage for the president\u2019s former national security adviser to effectively denounce his former boss\u2019 actions, but McMaster did it anyway. Trump has reportedly kept in touch with the retired general \u2013 by some accounts, the president has told McMaster he misses him \u2013 though it seems likely their relationship will turn frostier now that McMaster took a principled stand in public.\n\nJust as importantly, the former White House national security adviser isn\u2019t impressed with his former boss\u2019 new policy in Syria, either.\n\n\u201cOur forces there served as a useful means of preventing what we see now, which is a Turkish-Kurdish civil war that has profound political as well as humanitarian consequences,\u201d McMaster said yesterday, characterizing the shift in U.S. policy as \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nIf the president starts publishing rude tweets about McMaster, at least we\u2019ll know why.", "description": "It took a little courage for the president's former national security adviser to effectively denounce his former boss' actions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/mcmaster_trump_intel_051617.jpg?itok=lzJTATfi", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
