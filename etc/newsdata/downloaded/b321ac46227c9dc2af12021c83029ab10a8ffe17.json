Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that U.S. troops will stay in eastern Turkey to protect Kurdish-held oil fields for at least the coming weeks and that he was discussing options to keep them there.\n\nA video by the Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of armored vehicles driving through the northeastern city of Qamishli. People in the street hurled potatoes at the vehicles, shouting, \u201cNo America,\u201d and \u201cAmerica liar,\u201d in English.\n\n\u201cLike rats, America is running away,\u201d one man shouted in Arabic. Another shouted obscenities and talked of babies in Kurdish-held who have died in the Turkish offensive.", "description": "", "authors": ["Time.Com Syria-Withdrawl-Potatoes"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
