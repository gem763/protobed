The offences are so serious only a prison sentence can be justified.'\n\nProsecutor Robin Rouch said: 'The boy was scared after Smart kissed him in the bathroom at his home.\n\n'Smart expected the boy to pay off \u00a3700 he ran up on the Xbox by allowing him to repeat what had happened.'\n\nWhen the second boy's mother found the mirror, Smart said he was lonely and it was his way of having intimate contact with people.\n\nShe called police who seized recording equipment and computers from Smart's property. The court heard he gave officers passwords to examine their contents.\n\nAfter hearing of Smart's arrest, a woman became concerned because her 12-year-old son had stayed with him for four nights in December 2017.\n\nMr Rees said: 'The boy was in bed early one morning when his mother asked him if Mr Smart had ever touched him. The boy pulled the duvet over his head and said: 'Yes'.'\n\nMerthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Smart carried out more serious sexual assaults on the younger boy including one which the judge described as the 'headline offence'.\n\nJonathan Rees, defending, said: 'He is horrified, hugely ashamed and hopes both boys can recover from the trauma he has caused them.\n\n'He accepts the offences are sexual and the motivation was to seek intimacy with the two boys. He had betrayed their trust and that of their parents.'\n\nSmart admitted charges of sexual assault, inciting a child under 13 to engage in a sexual act and possession of indecent photographs of children.\n\nThe court heard the offences were out of character and committed at a time when he was 'distressed' at the loss of his wife Sian from a brain tumour.\n\nSmart had left his London home and relocated to the picture postcard village of Talybont-on-Usk, in the Brecon Beacons National Park.\n\nFather-of-one Smart has referred himself to a psychiatrist to 'address his issues' and has been receiving treatment for 18 months.\n\nMr Rees said: 'These offences occurred during an isolated and distressing period for Mr Smart. They do not form any wider pattern of offending.'\n\nSmart, in gold-rimmed spectacles, grey suit and dark blue tie showed no emotion as the details of his sordid offences against both boys were read to the court.\n\nHe retired from the British Franchise Association three years ago but the organisation still gives an award for international development in his name each year.\n\nThe 69-year-old worked alongside Margaret Thatcher's press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham who was president of the organisation for 18 years up until 2012.\n\nThe British Franchise Association describes itself as the voice of ethical franchising in the UK and works closely with industry and the Government.\n\nThe association declined to comment on Smart's conviction.", "description": "Brian Smart, 69, worked at the British Franchise Association alongside ex-government adviser Sir Bernard Ingham.
