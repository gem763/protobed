Instead, it sets up a new bureaucracy that leaves Americans vulnerable to out-of-control health care prices.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s experience shows that to truly protect patients, we need a solution that establishes fair, locally-based, competitively-negotiated reimbursement rates. Studies have shown that market-based benchmarks lower costs; the Congressional Budget Office confirmed it would save taxpayers $25 billion over 10 years. California found that a benchmark-based approach meant more care is being delivered by in-network providers and the percentage of in-network doctors is going up. A locally-based benchmark ensures doctors are properly compensated and patients get the care they need without being price-gouged.\n\nPrivate-equity companies that fund specialty doctors want to use arbitration to settle surprise medical bills \u2014 which will cost Americans double-digit billions over 10 years. Patients\u2019 health and financial security shouldn\u2019t be put at risk for private-equity profits. Locally-negotiated benchmarks are effective in protecting patients from surprise medical bills.\n\nMATT EYLES\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insuraance Plans (AHIP)\n\nWashington\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
