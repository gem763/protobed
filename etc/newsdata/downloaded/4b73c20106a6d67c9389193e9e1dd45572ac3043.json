This is mostly because the original Defender is seen by some as an icon of non-design in the taillight world, a vernacular design that has achieved notoriety despite itself. Can a modern re-interpretation capture the essence while making valuable updates? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nFirst, in the very remote chance that, somehow, you\u2019re not familiar with the original Land Rover Defender taillights, let me show them to you:\n\nBy the looks of these taillights, it\u2019s easy to believe that Defenders were designed and built with no taillights at all, and it was only at the last minute, as the first batch was leaving the factory, that mid-level manager noticed that something was missing, and sent an intern out in a pickup truck and the company credit card to buy up as many of the cheapest trailer (or maybe even bicycle) taillights they could find at whatever auto parts stores were within a ten-minute drive from the factory.\n\nThe lights are small, barely-adequate off-the-shelf tiny round lights for brake/taillights (red) and turn indicators (orange). There\u2019s also a pair of larger round lamps, one red for the rear foglamp, and one clear for the reverse light. Below these are a pair of small rectangular reflectors, slapped on with a mix of adhesive and apathy.\n\nSomehow, despite the obvious lack of shit-donation that went into the design of this taillight setup, it kind of works. The basic, no-bullshit approach fits well with the overall aesthetic of the car, and the minimal rear lighting has become part of the Defender\u2019s identity.\n\nOf course, they\u2019re also way too small, not easily visible, too easily damaged, and don\u2019t really do their basic job very well. An opportunity for improvement is certainly welcome, and whatever efforts are taken with the taillight design of the new model will likely represent the first time anyone has given a shit about Defender taillights at all.\n\nHence, this is a big deal. So, what did they do? Let\u2019s look at the new one and the old one, side by side:\n\nInteresting! Clearly, someone finally gave a shit. Land Rover has had some excellent lighting designers at work for a while, with vehicles like the Discovery having some particularly well-designed taillights, and it\u2019s interesting to see how they\u2019ve adapted some very modern taillight design ideas while making at least some attempt to evoke at least the spartan character of the originals.\n\nI think the most notable design concept I see here is a bit of an attempt to hide the larger elements of the new taillights, and emphasise more those four tiny lamps on the outermost rear panels. Note how the larger taillight units are almost hidden in those vertical black bands:\n\nAt an initial glance, in daylight at least, those tiny lights pop out at you first as the taillights, and those do sort of evoke the tiny outboard lights of the original. Where most modern cars have taillights that consume a vast amount of the real estate on a vehicular butt, here the visually prominent taillamps are deliberately small and swimming in a vast body-coloured panel.\n\nI suspect those small lights will just have taillamp/running lamp duty, though they may be hiding turn indicators as well; I\u2019m just not sure yet, not having seen them in action.\n\nThe real taillight work seems to be done by the dual stacked rounded-corner square units inset in that black area. These lamps are interesting, highly dimensional things; not so much blocks as they are little cubbies of light.\n\nAs far as the reverse lamp goes, it appears to be small and hidden here:\n\nThe legally-required rear reflectors appear to be inset into the bumper corners:\n\nI\u2019m wondering if maybe the small outer lamps are turn indicators in their centre areas, and the larger ones are brake lights? I\u2019d like that arrangement.\n\nOverall, I think Land Rover\u2019s lighting design team has done a great job with the Defender\u2019s taillights, and have managed to find something that evokes just enough of the incredibly limited original source material while finding ways to be novel and modern as well.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to being stuck behind these things in the near future, where I can bathe in their various red, amber and clear glows.", "description": "Over the past few weeks there\u2019s been a lot of heated discussion at The Red Lantern (the taillight enthusiasts bar and social club I hang out in) regarding the new 2020 Land Rover Defender\u2019s taillights.
