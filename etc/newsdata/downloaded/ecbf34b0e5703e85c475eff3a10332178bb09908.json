Maybe it is because she is a woman and gives relatively few interviews. More likely it is because people do not see her on the touchline or in the coaching box each week. Whichever it is, her visionary work will be staring everyone in the face in Saturday\u2019s World Cup final.\n\nShould England win she will also be entitled to a unique place in rugby history. Only a handful of oval-ball legends \u2013 Richie McCaw, Steve Hansen, Kieran Read \u2013 have shared in two World Cup triumphs. No one, male or female, has ever achieved three. Step forward England\u2019s unobtrusive secret weapon, Dr Sherylle Calder, now just 80 minutes away from an unprecedented global hat-trick.\n\nEngland sweat on Kyle Sinckler after restricted part in training session Read more\n\nSixteen years ago, when many were dismissing the concept of a \u201cvision specialist\u201d as a gimmick, Calder was a valued member of Clive Woodward\u2019s backroom staff during England\u2019s lengthy climb to 2003 success. In 2007, in the green and gold tracksuit of her native South Africa, she helped the Springboks conquer the world. And now here she is again, back in the red rose fold at the behest of Eddie Jones, who knows a winner when he sees one.\n\nHave you ever wondered exactly why, say, Jonny May looks a more rounded, confident player; why Henry Slade is snaffling more interceptions, or noted the increasingly deft handling of Maro Itoje and England\u2019s other big forwards? A significant part of the explanation can be traced back to the regular eye exercises Calder has conducted with Jones\u2019s squad for almost three years.\n\nIn her previous role with the Springboks she turned the winger Bryan Habana into world rugby\u2019s greatest try poacher to the point where Habana was still going through last-minute reflex-sharpening work with her just seconds before the 2007 final against England kicked off. As a former South African hockey international, Calder is that rarest of mentors: someone who both understands the psyche of top athletes and can provide specific tools to help them improve on a daily basis.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sherylle Calder with South African golfer Ernie Els in 2012.

If you\u2019d told me then I\u2019d ever be involved in a World Cup I wouldn\u2019t have believed you,\u201d Calder says. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me I\u2019d be involved in three World Cups I\u2019d have said: \u2018You\u2019re dreaming.\u2019 If you told me I\u2019d win even two World Cups I\u2019d have said you were completely crazy.\u201d\n\nFamously, Calder is on record as saying that spending too long on mobile devices, not least on match days, hinders athletic performance because it does not encourage peripheral vision, spatial awareness or increase eye movement. Her focus, instead, is on helping players to train their instincts and, as a result, make more effective decisions under pressure. \u201cHandling is only one aspect. Your eyes will show you, for example, which running line to take or where not to go. Timing of tackles, timing of runs, judgment of kicks and passes \u2026 people forget that for the past three years the players have been training that.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones takes inspiration from what made South Africa great in 2007 | Ugo Monye Read more\n\nSo when Itoje scoops a ball improbably off his toes or Tom Curry emerges almost overnight as a top-class lineout option, it is not quite the happy accident it might appear at first glance. Habana, for one, felt Calder\u2019s exercises made a massive difference to his game. \u201cHe used to say to me: \u2018Thanks for making my eyes as fast as my feet.\u2019 He felt that even though he was really quick that didn\u2019t mean his timing of runs and tackles would be correct. Timing comes from what you see. High balls? I believe all players should be able to take them. When commentators say: \u2018That\u2019s a great catch,\u2019 I think: \u2018That\u2019s what he should be doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalder is adamant her techniques can be applied \u201cto every walk of life\u201d and all ages. \u201cWe do a lot of work with young kids. Parents started coming back to us saying: \u2018Our kids\u2019 academic results have improved.\u2019 If you can read information quickly, comprehend it immediately and then use it effectively \u2026 that\u2019s exactly what happens on a sports field as well. It\u2019s about picking up information early and then being able to execute it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Sherylle Calder working with South Africa wing Akona Ndungane in 2006. Photograph: Touchline/Getty Images\n\nThe proof of her worth will be even more glaring if England can replicate their 2003 triumph this weekend. Calder still has fond memories of that era, having been convinced for a long while that Martin Johnson\u2019s squad would rule the world. \u201cThey were definites to win, I always knew that. But they also did the right things, both as a management and as a player group. That\u2019s what wins World Cups. I remember talking to Jonny Wilkinson on the field afterwards. \u2018Wow, fantastic,\u2019 I said. \u2018Well done.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Thank you for what you\u2019ve done for my game.\u2019 For him, at that moment, to have the presence of mind to say that shows what a quality bunch they were. They were an amazing combination of people together.\u201d\n\nWinning with the Boks in 2007 \u2013 and subsequently at the Suntory club in Japan \u2013 also cemented her professional respect for Jones. \u201cI see him as a rugby mastermind. That\u2019s my experience of him. He\u2019s great at what he does.\u201d She also knows the Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus but any split national loyalties will disappear out of the window should the Webb Ellis Cup once again find its way into England\u2019s \u2013 and her own \u2013 hands. \u201cIt would be marvellous. Words probably couldn\u2019t describe it but I\u2019m not a person who counts their chickens before they\u2019re hatched. I\u2019m just blessed. I created the science, I love what I do and I know it makes a difference.\u201d\n\nTo say this England squad have their eyes on the prize is a serious understatement.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u2019s secret weapon is eyeing her share of a third Rugby World Cup crown thanks to reflex-honing exercises that have sharpened England\u2019s timing and decision-making", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1dc95a0420bd484d9c5bd603a9b21a6734cec88/1264_22_2808_1685/master/2808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00888caa5775fa95a1053d044ddd5924", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
