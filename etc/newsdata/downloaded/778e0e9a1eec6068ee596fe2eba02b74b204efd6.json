But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts.\n\n\u201cApple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision.\u201d\n\nHKmap.live published the App Store Review\u2019s statement on its Telegram channel, which has more than 70,000 subscribers.\n\n\u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThis use of your app has resulted in serious harm to these citizens.\u201d\n\nThe developer did not comment further.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Apple on Thursday removed a Hong Kong map application used by pro-democracy protesters, saying it endangered police, after China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/d9a2ee_china-state-app-helps-rioters-apple-pulls-hong-kong-app-by-protesters-china-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
