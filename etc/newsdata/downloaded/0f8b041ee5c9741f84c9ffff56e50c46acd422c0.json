With their young bosses, origins in garages and revolutionary products, US tech companies were worshipped for bringing information, choice and innovation to the world.\n\nAs reporting season for the US tech sector revs up this week the sheen has come off as campaigners, politicians and the wider public have asked questions about the darker side of the digital revolution. Facebook, Amazon, Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple are all reporting in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMisuse of people\u2019s data, aggressive tax avoidance, treatment of workers, enabling hate speech and the sheer size and power of the tech giants are all in the spotlight. The US government is conducting an antitrust review and Elizabeth Warren, the new frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination, has pledged to break up the digital monopolies.\n\nAmazon, which reports third-quarter results on Thursday, is a case in point. Jeff Bezos\u2019s company has faced repeated questions about working conditions at its warehouses in the US and the UK, where it is running an ad campaign featuring happy workers. Critics hold it partly responsible for the crisis on the high street.\n\nAmazon's deal with Deliveroo examined by competition watchdog Read more\n\nAmazon\u2019s sprawling business \u2013 from retail sales and computer gaming to advertising and entertainment streaming \u2013 is in Warren\u2019s sights and in Britain the competition authorities are investigating its investment in Deliveroo. It could also be affected by proposals to make big tech companies pay more tax in countries where they make sales.\n\nThe Seattle-based company has told investors to expect third-quarter sales to jump by as much as 24% to a maximum of $70bn as it piles on revenue from cloud computing and its Prime service\u2019s one-day delivery offer. Operating profit, though, is set to fall from $3.7bn to between $2.1bn and $3.1bn as Amazon spends on transport to expand its fast delivery offer.\n\nAmazon\u2019s shares have fallen by about 10% since disappointing second-quarter results in July as investors digested its heavy spending message, amid general wariness about the tech sector made worse by dud share sales by companies such as Uber, Lyft and Slack.\n\nNeil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud Securities, said: \u201cThere is an overhang on big tech at the moment which is weighing on Amazon. You have got very high expectations and companies with very high valuations, and when a sector is priced for perfection that creates extra risk.\u201d\n\nThe shares are worth more than six times what they were just five years ago and Wall Street analysts reckon there is more to come. The company has so many irons in the fire that it\u2019s hard to understand what\u2019s going on. Supporters have to believe that its size, ability to invest and Bezos\u2019s relentless focus on keeping customers happy is a magic combination.\n\nAndrew Murphy, managing partner of US tech investor Loup Ventures, says Amazon is still a high-growth company because of its willingness to experiment, and will escape a forced break-up despite its size. \u201cWhile they\u2019ve demonstrated the capability of turning on the profitability spigot at will in a given quarter, they are still in investment mode,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAmazon will experiment and spend to test seemingly anything.\u201d\n\nIs Amazon a risk-taking innovator or a relentless sucker up of other people\u2019s business? Campling points out that Amazon\u2019s cloud service supports many other companies, \u201ccreating an economy of its own\u201d, but adds that Amazon can use the information it gets from the service to move in on the next trend.\n\n\u201cAmazon is affecting every part of our lives,\u201d Campling said. \u201cSome people will think it\u2019s the devil and others will think it gives us choice.\u201d", "description": "Investors have been promised a 24% sales jump as analysts place their bets on the Jeff Bezos magic", "authors": ["Sean Farrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bab90284afd83725c1f82dfe5ef63fef7d72ae76/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ef17777c65078950097118d401bbd7ab", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
