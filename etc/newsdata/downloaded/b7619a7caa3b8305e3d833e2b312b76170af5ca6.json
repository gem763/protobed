customers.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges I face as a buyer is that we plan 18 months ahead so it takes time for changes to become a reality. I\u2019m always searching for new, more sustainable products which will make Christmas sparkle but won\u2019t end up spoiling our environment.\u201d\n\nJohn Lewis and Waitrose are just two of the major retailers that have implemented major changes in recent months to reduce their plastic output.\n\nIn August, Tesco pledged to ban any brands that use excessive packaging from its stores to reduce plastic waste while Sainsbury\u2019s recently became the first major UK retailer to replace plastic flower bags with paper packaging.\n\nFood companies are taking note too. In September, McDonald\u2019s and Burger King revealed they would also be removing plastic toys from its children\u2019s meals following a petition launched by two school girls urging both fast food chains to \u201cthink of the environment\u201d.", "description": "The John Lewis Partnership, which includes John Lewis and Waitrose, has announced it will stop selling Christmas crackers containing plastic toys.
