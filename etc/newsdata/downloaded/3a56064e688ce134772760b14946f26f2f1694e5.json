And you\u2019ve let us know. We\u2019ve heard you.\n\nAfter testing various solutions, including replacement Sleepbuds and software/firmware updates, Bose determined that there was an underlying issue with the Sleepbuds battery:\n\n[...] we learned that while the battery we chose functions safely, it doesn\u2019t work as consistently or predictably as it should to meet our standards.\n\nBecause of this issue, Bose is discontinuing its Sleepbuds product and offering a full refund to everyone who purchased a set of Sleepbuds. Request your refund by December 31, 2019 if you want to take advantage of this offer. You\u2019ll have to turn in your Sleepbuds to get your refund.\n\nIf you are happy with your Sleepbuds and want to keep using them, Bose supports that decision (\u201cIf your sleepbuds\u2122 are still working fine, we encourage you to keep using them\u201d).\n\nYou should also be aware that Bose claims its newer Sleepbuds are \u201cless likely to be susceptible to problems\u201d than older Sleepbuds, so if you have a pair of glitchy Sleepbuds and would rather take your chance on a newer pair than claim your refund, that\u2019s one option.\n\nBose will continue to replace malfunctioning devices for as long as supplies last. They estimate they\u2019ll run out of new Sleepbuds in early 2020, so request a replacement now if you want one.\n\nIf you purchased Bose Sleepbuds, did you get the sleep you wanted or were you stuck with battery issues? Are you going to request your refund, roll the dice on another pair, or keep the Sleepbuds you currently have?", "description": "If you bought a pair of $379 Bose Sleepbuds in order to get a better night\u2019s sleep, you should know that Bose just discontinued its noise-masking Sleepbuds and is offering customers a full refund....", "authors": ["Brendan Hesse", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wi0wbbpk6zvmlc51xsii.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
