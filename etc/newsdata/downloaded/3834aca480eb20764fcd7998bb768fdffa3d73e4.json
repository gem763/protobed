Hunter was being paid $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company, despite having no natural energy experience, all while his dad was handling international relations with Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration.\n\nIt turns out this isn't the first time Hunter has benefited from his father's connections.\n\nBack in 2008, Tom Brokaw grilled Joe Biden about Hunter being hired by MBNA, a credit card company based in Delaware, right out of law school. Biden had received campaign contributions from the company before and was even working on a bill MBNA backed.\n\n\"That\u2019s a reference to your son being hired right out of law school by a big company here in Delaware that is in the credit card business, MBNA. He got about $100,000 a year, as I recall. You received $214,000 in campaign contributions from the company and from its employees,\" Brokaw said. \"At the same time, you were fighting for a bankruptcy bill that MBNA really wanted to get passed through the Senate, making it much tougher for everyone to file bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"Senator Obama was opposed to the bill. Among other things you couldn\u2019t, in fact, claim that you had a problem because of big medical bills. You voted against an amendment that would call for a warning on predatory lending. You also called for \u2014 you opposed efforts to strengthen the protection of people in bankruptcy,\" Brokaw explained. \"This has been an issue that you\u2019ve heard about before. Your son was working for the company at the same time.\"\n\n\"In retrospect, wasn\u2019t it inappropriate for someone like you in the middle of all this to have your son collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the floor protecting its interests?\u201d Brokaw asked bluntly.\n\nNaturally, Biden did was he does best: defend Hunter and claim that the two incidences are \"coincidental.\"\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. My son graduated from Yale Law School. The starting salary in Wall Street is $140,000 a year if you want to lawyer. Options he had,\" Biden replied. \"He came home to work for a bank. Surprise, surprise, number one.\u201d\n\nHow many more incidents of impropriety do we need before the Democratic Party wakes up and realizes that the Bidens are the very definition of the swamp? Their so-called \"frontrunner\" embodies everything Americans hate about politics: the corruption, the dishonesty, the good ol' boy's club?\n\nHunter Biden vowed not to have any dealings with foreign companies if his father becomes president, but don't hold your breath.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Whoa..10/14/2019 20:01:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/287/36e05c69-d82a-4775-90bf-743d174777a9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
