There\u2019s even a portmanteau for it: sharenting. Almost a quarter of children begin their digital lives when parents upload their prenatal sonogram scans to the internet, according to a study conducted by the internet-security firm AVG. The study also found that 92 percent of toddlers under the age of 2 already have their own unique digital identity. \u201cParents now shape their children\u2019s digital identity long before these young people open their first email. The disclosures parents make online are sure to follow their children into adulthood,\u201d declares a report by the University of Florida Levin College of Law. \u201cThese parents act as both gatekeepers of their children\u2019s personal information and as narrators of their children\u2019s personal stories.\u201d\n\nRead: The perils of \u201csharenting\u201d\n\nPreschools and elementary schools often keep blogs or upload photos of kids to Instagram accounts and Facebook pages so that working parents can feel like a part of their kids\u2019 day. Sports scores are recorded online, as are notable moments from after-school clubs.\n\nWhen Ellen, an 11-year-old, finally decided to Google herself, she didn\u2019t expect to find anything, because she doesn\u2019t yet have her own social-media accounts. She was stunned when she found years of swim scores and sports statistics on the web. A personal story she wrote in third grade was also published on a class website with her name attached. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be out there like this on the internet,\u201d she told me.\n\nEllen said that while she didn\u2019t find anything too sensitive or personal, she was frustrated that all the information about herself had been posted seemingly without her consent.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you do, it\u2019s out there for people to know,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re just swimming\u2014the rest of the world will know. My meet records are out there; now people know I\u2019m a swimmer. [The internet] tells you where all the swim meets are, so that would probably tell my general location. It tells you my school. Parts of my story online were in Spanish. Now people know I speak Spanish.\u201d\n\nAllie was in fourth grade the first time she Googled herself. Like Ellen, she wasn\u2019t expecting to find anything, since she doesn\u2019t yet have her own social-media accounts. Google turned up just a few photos, but she was shocked that there was anything at all. She immediately became hyperaware of the image her mother was building for her on Instagram and Facebook. \u201cMy parents have always posted about me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was basically fine with it \u2026 then I realized I was making an impression and I was an actual person online too, through her page.\u201d\n\nNot all kids react poorly to finding out they\u2019ve been living an unwitting life online. Some are thrilled. In fourth grade, Nate searched his name and discovered that he was mentioned in a news article about his third-grade class making a giant burrito. \u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI was surprised, really surprised.\u201d But he was pleased with his newfound clout. \u201cIt made me feel famous \u2026 I got to make new friends by saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m in a newspaper [online],\u2019\u201d he said. Ever since, he has Googled himself every few months, hoping to find things.", "description": "Googling yourself has become a rite of passage.", "authors": ["Taylor Lorenz"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/shutterstock_1299583525/facebook.jpg?1550244524"}
