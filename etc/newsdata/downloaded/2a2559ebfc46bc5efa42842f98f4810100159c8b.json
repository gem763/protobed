(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Associated Press\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Joe Burrow tossed four of his school-record six touchdown passes to Ja'Marr Chase and threw for 398 yards Saturday, leading No. 4 LSU to a 66-38 romp over Vanderbilt in the Tigers' Southeastern Conference opener.\n\nLSU (4-0) beat Vanderbilt (0-3, 0-2) for the eighth straight time and improved to 12-5 all-time in Nashville in the first game between these SEC charter members since 2010.\n\nThe Tigers showed off their new high-powered offense, scoring their most points this season and against an SEC opponent. They needed 2:11 or less on their first seven scoring drives, and LSU scored 4 seconds after Micah Baskerville returned an onside kick 46 yards to open the third quarter on Burrow's fifth TD pass.\n\nBaskerville later blocked a punt he recovered for a TD.\n\nBurrow had a game for the record books.\n\nHe became both the first LSU quarterback to throw for 350 yards or more in three straight games, and his 357 yards passing by halftime also was the most in school history. Burrow opened the game hitting 13 of his first 14 for 244 yards before his second incompletion at 9:19 in the second quarter. He finished 25 of 34 before leaving the game early in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnd Burrow kept throwing to Chase.

He finished with 10 receptions for 229 yards, . had 204 against Furman in 2013.\n\nVanderbilt had never played two of the nation's top five teams within the first three weeks before in program history. At least the Commodores scored on their first drive, which they didn't manage in an opening loss to No. 3 Georgia or a loss at Purdue. They scored their most points yet this season but turned it over twice.\n\nLSU led 28-7 after the first quarter, 38-17 at halftime and 59-31 after the third. Clyde Edwards-Helaire ran for 106 yards and a TD, and John Emery added a TD late.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLSU: The Tigers came in second in the SEC defending the run, giving up just 80.3 yards a game. They gave up a 41-yarder to Ke'Shawn Vaughn on Vandy's first offensive play, and he broke loose for a 52-yard TD run in the third quarter \u2014 the longest run this season for the SEC's top returning rusher. Vaughn finished with 20 carries for 130 yards.\n\nVanderbilt: The Commodores came in as the only FBS team without a sack this season, and the was on a roughing the passer penalty in the first quarter. Then Jaylen Mahoney sacked the LSU quarterback early in the second quarter a play after Burrow had plenty of time to roll to his right before finding Stephen Sullivan on a 30-yard completion. Kenny Hebert also got a sack, and Elijah McAlister recovered an Edwards-Helaire fumble for a touchdown in the final minute of the first half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLSU: Open date before hosting Utah State on Oct. 5.\n\nVanderbilt: Hosts Northern Illinois on Sept. 28.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.
