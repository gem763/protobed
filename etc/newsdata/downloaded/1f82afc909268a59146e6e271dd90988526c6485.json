That didn't end up happening. But according to a recent benchmark on Geekbench, Microsoft might be readying a new model Surface Go with a faster processor.\n\n\n\nThe Surface Go -- Microsoft's tablet for students, firstline workers and others wanting a small, thin and light device -- ships with a Pentium Gold CPU. But a Geekbench benchmark from April 2019 first noticed by Windows Latest raises the possibility that there could be a Surface Go with a dual-core Intel Core m3 processor.\n\n\n\nWhen Microsoft rolled out the Surface Go in July 2018, the 10-inch, 1.15 pound tablet came in a couple of different configurations. There was Windows 10 Home in S Mode variant upgradable for free to Windows 10 Home which started at $399 (without a keyboard). And there was a Go With Windows 10 Pro for business users. The Geekbench benchmark was for a device running Windows 10 Pro.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's fall Surface hardware launch is just around the corner. On October 2, the company is expected to introduce a number of new Surface devices, including an AMD-based Surface Laptop; an ARM-based Surface two-in-one; and an updated (with USB-C) Intel-based Surface Pro, sources have said.\n\n\n\nI haven't heard any rumors about a refreshed Surface Go being part of this October 2 launch. But Microsoft does sometimes add new models of its Surface devices to its lineup with little fanfare. If the company does end up giving the Surface Go a processor upgrade, I could see Microsoft going the quiet route.\n\n\n\nI've asked Microsoft to comment on the possibility of a Core m-based Surface Go.
