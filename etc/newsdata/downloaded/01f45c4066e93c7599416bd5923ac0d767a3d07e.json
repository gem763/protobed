But my fiance and I don't feel like we're asking for anything that unreasonable.\"\n\nThe post has attracted thousands of comments, leaving Redditors divided over whether it was fair to expect guests to attend a dawn wedding.\n\nThe most up-voted comment suggested a compromise.\n\nThe user suggested the couple have a private ceremony at 5.30am, followed by a second ceremony at a more reasonable time for the guests.\n\nThey wrote: \"The first one can be just the two of you reciting your vows to each other, or the two of you with a willing officiant and a handful of close friends/relatives who are willing to join.\n\n\"If having two ceremonies is too costly and unreasonable, then just do the first option with the two of you only, speaking private vows.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMany backed the suggestion, adding that a private vow exchange would capture the \"magic\" of the sunrise without the risk of drama from guests disgruntled about being there so early.\n\nAnother commenter suggested that attending the early ceremony could be optional for guests who should be assured the couple would not mind if they attended the reception only.\n\nBut others poured scorn on the very idea of a sunrise wedding- pointing out bad weather could easily scupper the dream light and ruin the photographs.\n\nSome commenters pointed out the hassle for businesses involved in the early morning wedding plans, such as the hairdresser and makeup artist.\n\nBut some felt that the couple should do what they want for their special day.\n\nOne commenter wrote: \"Too often I have seen the bride and groom burn out accommodating their guests. Enjoy your personal, and meaningful sunrise. Let everyone else enjoy your union at their leisure. Or not.\"", "description": "The couple are getting backlash about their plan for a sunrise wedding some guests will have to travel an hour to get to", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20736678.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wedding-at-Twilight.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
