They had been held in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran since early July.\n\nAt the same time Iran\u2019s state TV reported Iranian scientist, Reza Dehbashi, who was detained for 13 months in Australia for purchasing a defense system for his country from the United States, had returned home.\n\nDehbashi had been a research student at the University of Queensland.\n\nAttorney General Christian Porter confirmed Dehbashi would not be extradited to the United States but refused to comment on speculation of an apparent prisoner swap.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government does not comment on the details behind its consideration of particular cases,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAnd while it is likely that because of Mr Dehbashi Kivi\u2019s nationality some will speculate regarding this matter, consistent with prior practice I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case, particularly when any such response from me may diminish our government\u2019s capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia\u2019s best interests,\u201d he said.\n\nKing and Firkin thanked the Australian government and released a statement, saying: \u201cWe are extremely happy and relieved to be safely back in Australia with those we love. While the past few months have been very difficult, we know it has also been tough for those back home who have been worried for us.\u201d\n\nThe couple requested privacy as they try to \u201cget back to [our] normal lives.\u201d\n\nThe pair originally left Perth, Western Australia, in June 2017 by off road vehicle bound for the UK, planning to travel for two years driving across 36 countries. They have been documenting their travels on Instagram and Youtube with a stated aim of going to countries less likely to fall on the average traveller\u2019s radar due to unsympathetic media coverage.\n\n\u201cOur biggest motivation behind making the vlogs is to hopefully inspire anyone wanting to travel, and also try to break the stigma around travelling to countries which get a bad wrap (sic) in the media,\u201d they said in a post on crowd-funding platform Patreon.\n\nDeals can be made with Iran for the release of prisoners however this often involves the transfer of large amounts of cash to the Islamic republic.\n\nJust such a prisoner exchange was brokered by former U.S. President Barack Obama in January 2016 that freed Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans. It saw the U.S. make a $1.7 billion cash delivery to Iran the same day the hostages were allowed to walk free.\n\nThe Obama administration defended the payment to Iran as a \u201ca very good deal for U.S. taxpayers.\u201d", "description": "Iran released\u00a0two travel bloggers from three months detention on Saturday after they were arrested for flying a drone near a military zone.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/arrested-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
