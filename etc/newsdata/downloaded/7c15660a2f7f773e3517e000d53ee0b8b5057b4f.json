The Common App and 'ban the box' are on the right track.\n\nThe Common Application's recently removed question concerning criminal records. (Photo: Jym Wilson/USA TODAY)\n\nFor young people with justice system involvement, records of their past can be a major barrier to future success. One such barrier was lifted last week.\n\nSince 2006, the Common Application, used by over 750 colleges and universities to standardize the online application process, required prospective students to respond to a question about their juvenile and criminal history. Although research shows that many schools don\u2019t necessarily deny admission based on this information, the majority of youth with records who see this check box do not complete the application. The Common App Office decided to remove this question for the upcoming application cycle.\n\nColleges still ask about criminal records\n\nConsistent with a broader \u201cban the box\u201d initiative to limit questions about juvenile or criminal records for both education and employment, this is a significant first step. But there remains opportunity for individual colleges and universities to continue using criminal history information against applicants.\n\nThese institutions have broad discretion to add questions about a young person\u2019s history with law enforcement or the justice system. Colleges can then use this information to conduct official background checks of students. Two-thirds of colleges and universities collect criminal justice information during the admissions process. Of those, about 20 percent have denied admission based on the young person\u2019s record and the erroneous assumption that rejecting youth with records will make campuses safer.\n\nMore: Amy Wax said black students can't excel in law school. Bless her heart, we can and do.\n\nWhy is Harvard discriminating against Asian Americans? 'Diversity' is no excuse for racial bias.\n\nYes, we deserve to be at Harvard: Trump's shameless affirmative action attack\n\nMoreover, the Common App still asks applicants to disclose school disciplinary incidents, which disproportionately affects students of color. They are more likely to be subject to school discipline than their white peers. Black students are suspended and expelled at rates three times higher than their white counterparts, even for similar school disciplinary infractions.\n\nThese racial disparities are mirrored in the justice system, where young people of color are arrested and found guilty at higher rates than white youth. This in turn exacerbates persistent cycles of poverty and the structural racism in our modern justice system. Barriers to higher education likewise forestall opportunities for these youth to move beyond their records.\n\nTeens grow out of bad behavior\n\nReliance on information about students' school disciplinary records or past involvement in the juvenile or criminal justice system also ignores common sense and scientific research confirming that indeed, adolescents grow up. They grow out of their teenage mistakes and behaviors. Banning the box acknowledges this.\n\nColleges and universities should follow the Common App\u2019s lead and remove this question from their applications. And, more importantly, they should not disqualify young people with potential the opportunity to benefit from college enrollment.\n\nRiya Saha Shah is senior supervising attorney at Juvenile Law Center.
