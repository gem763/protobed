About 70% of the cacao fruit is typically discarded in the traditional process of making chocolate, which is increasingly regarded as very wasteful.\n\nThe company says using the entire fruit, from beans to peels, pulp and juice, \u201cresults in a range of high-quality ingredients that can be used in \u2026 juices, smoothies, frozen desserts, bakery and pastry products, and snacks all the way to chocolate\u201d.\n\nThe so-called WholeFruit chocolate is the latest innovation from the Swiss chocolatier, which is facing pressure to innovate and experiment with new products amid growing competition in the global market. Higher cocoa prices have squeezed the profits of chocolate-makers already under pressure as consumers shift toward healthier alternatives.\n\nThe company develops and supplies chocolate to major brands such as Nestl\u00e9, Hershey, Unilever and the confectionery giant Mondelez International, which owns brands including Cadbury and Toblerone.\n\nMondelez will make the first new products under a new CaPao brand, being launched in the US this week, while a new line for artisan chocolate-makers will follow in May. Launch in the UK and Europe is planned but is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nA Mondelez spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the launch of CaPao, which offers consumers a new range of plant powered snacks by making greater use of the cacao fruit. The products have been launched to start with in the US, but we will be looking to roll them out to other countries, including the UK, in the future.\u201d\n\nLast year, Barry Callebaut launched ruby chocolate, a pink blend with a berry flavour that has been used in Nestle\u2019s KitKat bars. The ruby chocolate KitKat was launched last year in Japan and Korea, followed by the UK, Europe and the US. Ruby chocolate \u2013 a fourth chocolate variant after traditional dark, milk and white \u2013 attracted huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September 2017. It is now on sale in more than 50 countries, under 75 brands.\n\nIn July, Nestl\u00e9 said it had developed a new chocolate made entirely from cacao beans and pulp, with no refined sugar added. That month Cadbury released a new version of its Dairy Milk bar that contains 30% less sugar and more fibre.\n\nPablo Perversi, chief innovation, sustainability and quality officer at Barry Callebaut, said: \u201cOur goal is to develop innovations that are on trend, satisfy unmet consumer needs and taste great. This will respond to the needs of millennials and centennials for \u2018healthy indulgence\u2019. By using more of the cacao fruit and wasting less, we are having a positive impact on the planet.\u201d", "description": "Recipe is the latest innovation from Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut", "authors": ["Rebecca Smithers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d7c88025a3da9b8279f3cc0dfaba1a93b04211/0_66_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e15a4a7abbc4d19a5a78ff122798ad3d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
