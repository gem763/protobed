Yet, it was a historic moment simply because of its distinction as the 6,106th round-tripper in the major-leagues this season, which shattered the previous all-time single-season record set back in 2017. It was only fitting that the team that has served up a big league-leading 280 big flies this year would be the ones to actually breaking the record. The league-wide proliferation in over-the-fence power has been the prevailing narrative of the 2019 campaign. Not only has the single-season mark fallen already, but hitters have nearly three more weeks to extend the record into uncharted territory. Entering play on Wednesday night, an eye-popping 108 hitters had already reached the 20-homer plateau, which is the third-most of any season in the last half century. According to MLB.com\u2019s Sarah Langs, there have been five months with at least 1,000 or more home runs this season, which is the most of any season in major-league history.\n\nFrom a pure fantasy perspective, the central question moving forward is whether Major League Baseball will institute changes to the baseball manufacturing process with the goal of reducing over-the-fence power next season, or if the current league-wide power environment is here to stay for good. If this is the new normal, fantasy owners should feel confident in their ability to acquire cheap one-dimensional sluggers and place an even greater emphasis on five-category impact contributors, especially those that offer 20-plus stolen base potential in drafts next spring.\n\nStory continues\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMets Surpass Snakes in Wild Card Race\n\nThe Mets roller coaster playoff push continued on Wednesday evening when they crushed the Diamondbacks 9-0 in Citi Field. New York has won three consecutive games against a red-hot Arizona squad and will have an opportunity to complete an improbable four-game sweep when they hand the ball to mid-season trade acquisition Marcus Stroman in the series finale on Thursday afternoon. Not only have the Mets jumped ahead of the Diamondbacks in the hotly-contested race for the final Wild Card berth in the National League, but they\u2019re now only three games out of a playoff spot thanks to yet another Cubs\u2019 loss to the Padres on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Mets\u2019 offensive explosion began right away when they chased Diamondbacks\u2019 left-hander Robbie Ray from the contest in the opening frame, plating five runs on five hits, including back-to-back homers from Todd Frazier and Brandon Nimmo. Frazier also tacked on a solo tater in the third inning to record his second multi-homer effort of the season. The veteran third baseman wasn\u2019t the only one to go deep on multiple occasions in this one. Versatile outfielder Jeff McNeil also slugged a pair of home runs, including a solo shot in the second inning and a two-run dinger in the sixth inning, to eclipse the 20-homer plateau for the first time in his brief major-league career. The unheralded 27-year-old top-of-the-order tablesetter still has a shot at the National League batting title if he can put together a strong two-week finish to the 2019 campaign. He\u2019s hitting .325/.394/.536 with 76 runs scored, 20 homers, 68 RBI and five stolen bases across 513 plate appearances this season. Not too shabby for a guy who was nearly universally ignored in standard mixed-league fantasy drafts this spring.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

The 21-year-old southpaw lived up to the considerable hype after relieving veteran starter Brett Anderson in the sixth inning. He recorded a pair of strikeouts and allowed only one hit -- a solo homer by Martin Maldonado -- and retired the other nine batters he faced in this one. He averaged nearly 96 mph on his fastball, showcased some incredible movement on those heaters and needed only 36 pitches to navigate three frames. The Athletics are expected to keep him on a tight schedule, with his next appearance likely to come in the next four or five days. It seems likely that Oakland will keep him in a manageable long relief role moving forward, but he certainly has the ability to shift into the rotation if the need arises. He may not make a major fantasy impact over the final two weeks of the 2019 campaign, but Luzardo looks like a potential fantasy ace for years to come.\n\nYelich To Avoid Knee Surgery\n\nAccording to a report by Jim Bowden of The Athletic late on Wednesday night, Brewers\u2019 outfielder Christian Yelich (knee) will be out for at least six weeks, but will not require surgery on his fractured right kneecap. The 27-year-old slugger had already been ruled out for the remainder of the 2019 campaign, but this latest development is outstanding news for his long-term future and immediate 2020 outlook. Obviously, the Brewers will miss their main offensive catalyst as they make a playoff push over the next two weeks, but barring any setbacks, he should be ready to go by the time spring training rolls around. Considering that there don\u2019t appear to be any long-term ramifications from the injury, fantasy owners can safely lock the reigning National League MVP into a top three slot on their draft board for next spring.\n\nYankees, Tigers Set For Twin Billing\n\nWednesday's scheduled contest between the Tigers and Yankees was postponed due to inclement weather. The game will be made up on Thursday with a straight doubleheader, with the first game beginning at 1:10 EST and the second game taking place 30 minutes after the conclusion. J.A. Happ will take the ball for the Yankees, opposed by Tigers\u2019 ace Matthew Boyd, with CC Sabathia -- to be followed by ace Domingo German in relief -- and Spencer Turnbull squaring off in the nightcap.\n\nAL Quick Hits: Mike Trout (foot) remained out of the Angels\u2019 starting lineup on Wednesday.
