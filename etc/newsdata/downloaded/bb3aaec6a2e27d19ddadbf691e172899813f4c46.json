A dozen of the starters beat the All Blacks less than a year ago. The preparation week was one of the best, and had the players buzzing. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything,\u201d lock James Ryan said.\n\nBut they hadn\u2019t counted on change by the All Blacks, who invariably raise the bar in response to infrequent defeat.\n\nFailing a second time to lead Ireland to a first Rugby World Cup semifinal will haunt Schmidt, who steps down as coach following six transformative years.\n\nBut the New Zealander\u2019s legacy from a decade in Ireland is a far greater parting gift. His impact has been cultural, not just technical.\n\nHired after guiding Leinster province to consecutive European club crowns, Schmidt\u2019s biggest achievement was to turn the Irish back into believers and winners. No longer do they go into tournaments thinking they might win. They believe they will, and they have.\n\nFullback Rob Kearney spoke for the team when he said, \u201cDeep down in the back of your mind there\u2019s always this little voice that\u2019s chatting away to you if you haven\u2019t achieved something. We\u2019d been saying for the best part of 10 years that as an Ireland team we could beat the All Blacks, but until you actually achieve it, you never 100% believe it.\u201d\n\nOn Schmidt\u2019s watch, Ireland climbed that Everest in 2016, ending 111 years of failure. Just to prove it was no fluke, they beat the All Blacks again in 2018. Other milestones included a first win over the Springboks in South Africa, and a first series win in Australia since 1979. At home, Ireland won three Six Nations, including a third ever Grand Slam, in their best run since the early 1980s. They rose to No. 1 in the rankings for the first time.\n\nBut those were the achievements on TV. Schmidt was tireless behind the scenes. He took his job title literally by accepting invites to clubs and schools all over the island. Always dignified, he gave inspiring talks and left positive impressions on people, even those who didn\u2019t follow rugby.\n\nHe would turn up without fanfare at age-grade and club games. He offered detailed advice to players who weren\u2019t even in the national squad, and generally demanded improvement from everyone.\n\nHis style is heavily structured. Every player is drilled to fit into a micro-managed game plan. Mistakes aren\u2019t tolerated.\n\n\u201cHe can talk your head off, he\u2019s generous with time, but in the dressing room is absolutely ruthless,\u201d retired captain Brian O\u2019Driscoll said. \u201cThe smile comes in different forms. In one of my first trainings, a player passed at my ankles and I dropped it. And Joe said, \u2018Good players take them.\u2019 The boys thought that was brilliant, so they used to fire passes down at my ankles all the time.\u201d\n\nSchmidt\u2019s style isn\u2019t for everyone\u2019s taste, but his record makes him one of the modern coaching greats. And it was all an accident, to his way of thinking.\n\nWhile teaching at Palmerston North Boys\u2019 High School in New Zealand, Schmidt wanted to coach basketball. The head of a school which has produced 14 All Blacks liked the idea. But the rector said basketball was on Friday nights, which freed Schmidt on Saturdays to coach rugby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m my own worst enemy when it comes to working,\u201d Schmidt said when he announced last November his intention to step down as coach after this Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cI tend to be a little bit of a workaholic and so if there\u2019s a competitive advantage that I can find that I can help players attain then I\u2019m going to be looking as hard as I possibly can. And that means that I\u2019m out of the house a fair bit, or even at home I\u2019m plugging away, looking at things with a microscope. So that\u2019s probably a character flaw. If you probably talk to some of the people on the staff, it\u2019s one of many I have.\u201d\n\nBeside an intense attention to detail, Schmidt is renowned for concocting set-play moves, and Jacob Stockdale\u2019s winning try against New Zealand in 2018 made even the All Blacks admit they were outfoxed.\n\nBut the All Blacks also warned Schmidt after that win capped the greatest year in Irish rugby history, that it was harder to be the hunted than the hunter. England coach Eddie Jones piled on the warnings by saying, \u201cPraise makes you weak,\u201d and Ireland was weak all of this year, struggling to score and plagued by injuries.\n\nTypically, Schmidt engineered a seamless transition for the coaching reins. Andy Farrell, his defense coach since 2016, will take over.\n\nSchmidt said after the quarterfinal defeat, \u201cAll I can do is work as hard as I can and try to help the players develop as best they can, and try to build the collective as strong as it can be. So it is disappointing to finish on a note that doesn\u2019t represent how, I believe, how far we\u2019ve come. We\u2019ve scaled a number of challenges, this is the only one we haven\u2019t. Andy Farrell, at least he\u2019ll have something to aim up for in four years\u2019 time and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do a super job.\u201d\n\nSchmidt, who added Irish citizenship in 2015 to his Kiwi one, said he will remain in Ireland and spend time on family projects while he takes a 12-month break from coaching, although his wife, Kellie, quipped he would probably last 12 days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an incredibly planned life for so many years,\u201d the 54-year-old Schmidt said. \u201cSo I\u2019m kind of looking forward to having 12 months where I can just invest that energy in one direction and also not have a daily itinerary or a weekly plan.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The pause in play is an ideal time for fresh rapid-fire instructions from the coaches' box.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
