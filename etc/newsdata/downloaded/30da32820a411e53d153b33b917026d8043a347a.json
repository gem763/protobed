Some of her works have celebrated the rich ethnic heritage of Poland, which was a cultural and religious melting pot before the Nazi German genocide during World War II and the postwar resettlement of ethnic populations.\n\nHer very appearance, with a dreadlock style known as a \u201cplica Polonica\u201d or Polish tangle, which has roots in Polish history, makes her stand out as a progressive icon as the country\u2019s leadership seeks to put its conservative mark on the nation.\n\nShe was photographed recently at a gay pride parade in her hometown of Wroclaw holding small rainbow flags at a time when the ruling Law and Justice party has been depicting the gay rights movement as a mortal threat to Poland\u2019s culture.\n\nJust this week, Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski lashed out during a campaign stop at filmmakers and other cultural elites who he claims have tried to \u201cdestroy Poland\u2019s reputation\u201d with their explorations of Polish crimes, including the participation of some in killing Jews during the war. He said under his party, cultural elites will be \u201cno longer working for our enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who work (for the enemy) are being stigmatized and will be stigmatized further,\u201d Kaczynski said.\n\nThose remarks sparked sharp criticism by some opposition politicians, while others found poetic justice in the world\u2019s most prestigious literary award going to Tokarczuk.\n\n\u201cOlga Tokarczuk is an outstanding representative of the elites hated by Kaczynski,\u201d said Tomasz Lis, the editor of Newsweek Polska.\n\nOn Thursday, however, the country\u2019s conservative authorities had only words of praise for Tokarczurk, with Polish President Andrzej Duda calling it a \u201cgreat day for Polish literature.\u201d\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said recently that he had tried to read her books but just couldn\u2019t finish them, said he would try harder now. And he was happy to claim her accomplishment as one for the Polish nation.\n\n\u201cA Nobel Prize is a clear sign that Polish culture is well appreciated in the world,\u201d Glinski tweeted. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d\n\nEuropean Union leader Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is also a critic of the current government, said on Twitter: \u201cWhat joy and pride!\u201d\n\nSpeaking Thursday before readers in Bielefeld, Germany, Tokarczuk described her surprise at winning, and had a message for people back in Poland: \u201clet\u2019s vote in a right way for democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nLaw and Justice is leading opinion polls ahead of the country\u2019s parliamentary election on Sunday, its popularity boosted by generous state spending and an assertive Poland-first foreign policy.\n\nTwo Nobel Prizes in literature - one for 2019 and one for last year - were announced Thursday after the 2018 literature award was postponed following sex abuse allegations that had rocked the Swedish Academy. The recipient of this year\u2019s Nobel award for literature was Austrian writer Peter Handke.\n\n___\n\nMonika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Swedish Academy's decision to bestow the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature on Polish author Olga Tokarczuk has given a rare morale boost to liberal Poles only three days before a national election that is likely to be won by the country's right-wing populist party.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vanessa Gera"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/britain_nobel_literature_42770_c0-739-1612-1678_s1770x1032.jpg?b0560eecabca78fa62d7944531678e549f46bbba", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
