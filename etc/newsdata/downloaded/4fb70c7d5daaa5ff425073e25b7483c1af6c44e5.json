INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term.\u201d\n\nThe idea is flawed. While it\u2019s true that the government could sell bonds at lower interest rates than those on much of its outstanding debt, it would have to pay a big premium to buy back and retire some old bonds, effectively negating the financial benefits. Certain mature treasuries, for instance, fetch prices of as high as $1.40 for every $1 of face value.\n\nMonetary authorities such as the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan have had policies on interest rates that are effectively below zero, as a way to boost demand for loans and stimulate sluggish economies. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is currently 2%-2.25% following a quarter-point reduction on July 31 -- the first cut since the Fed lowered rates effectively to zero in 2008, during the worst financial crisis and economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nWith Trump polling behind several Democratic candidates in his 2020 re-election campaign and Americans fearing a recession within the next year, the president is seeking to deflect blame for any economic ills. He has repeatedly blamed the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, who goes by Jay, for raising interest rates too steeply in 2018 and constraining the economy as the president pursues a trade war with China.\n\n\u201cNo Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing,\u201d Trump continued in the post. \u201cA once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u2018Boneheads.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reference to refinancing debt followed an online commentary last week by Stephen Moore, who withdrew his candidacy for the Fed board earlier this year. \u201cThe Trump administration should take advantage of today\u2019s bargain-basement borrowing costs by immediately refinancing the national debt,\u201d Moore wrote on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nPolicy makers are widely expected to make another quarter-point cut when they next meet Sept. 17-18, though hardly anyone sees interest rates headed to zero in the next two years, according to a Bloomberg survey earlier this month. Meanwhile, economists in a separate poll predict the ECB will cut its deposit rate to minus 0.5% from minus 0.4% on Thursday.\n\nFed officials balked at cutting rates below zero during the last downturn in part because of fears doing so would hamper money-market functioning and hurt rather than help banks. There are also questions over whether the Federal Reserve Act even allows it to deploy negative rates.\n\nA recent study published by the University of Bath found negative rates decreased lending. Fed Bank of San Francisco research also concluded the introduction of the policy in Japan actually lowered inflation expectations.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see the cost/benefit there being very attractive\u201d Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in an Aug. 5 televised interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\n(Updates with additional context in 3rd paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Kathleen Miller in Washington at kmiller01@bloomberg.net;Scott Lanman in Washington at slanman@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Craig Stirling\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to a level typically reserved for recessions or periods of persistently weak growth, suggesting that such a setting could allow the government to refinance Treasury debt at a lower cost.The Fed should \u201cget our interest", "authors": ["Kathleen Miller", "Scott Lanman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XHr5SB47mbVLNXuncdyikQ--~B/aD0zNzgyO3c9NTY3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/22fc27fae4665a63bc5412715e5b02f7", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
