Mr. Mapplethorpe took her to a dinner, when they were together and she was still working at Scribner\u2019s, where a young Mr. Trump pitched Trump Tower.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know who this guy was, he was with his wife, Ivana, except he was the most obnoxious person I have ever experienced in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cAll he talked about was how it was going to be the greatest thing ever in New York City and anyone who bought into this was going to be part of the most important thing. Me and Robert left and I thought, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t live in his tower for free.\u2019 I can\u2019t believe that fate would let that guy. \u2026\u201d She shudders.\n\nI tell her what Mr. Iovine said about his disillusionment with young musicians for not being more political. Indeed, the night before, at the Video Music Awards, Taylor Swift, whose critics have dinged her for staying mostly mum in this era of political outrage, offered some mild, oblique criticism of the president.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a pop star who\u2019s under tremendous scrutiny all the time, and one can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like,\u201d Ms. Smith says sympathetically. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to not be able to go anywhere, do anything, have messy hair. And I\u2019m sure that she\u2019s trying to do something good. She\u2019s not trying to do something bad. And if it influences some of her avid fans to open up their thoughts, what does it matter? Are we going to start measuring who\u2019s more authentic than who?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree that artists and musicians have more responsibility to speak out than anyone else. I think everybody has to be more active. Art is inspiring and art can really bring people together. A song can rally people, but it\u2019s not going to make change.\u201d\n\nShe says she got punished for speaking out against the Iraq invasion: \u201cAll of a sudden, no radio play, couldn\u2019t get into festivals. People, even cool people \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to say that, but some people that I really loved and respected and still love and respect \u2014 they were so frightened by this infusion of patriotism that they weren\u2019t able to see the whole picture. To me, patriotism is just a few steps away from nationalism if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d", "description": "She is working toward a third act as a novelist, and her new book, \u201cYear of the Monkey,\u201d blends fact and fiction.", "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/fashion/19PATTISMITHf/19PATTISMITHf-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
