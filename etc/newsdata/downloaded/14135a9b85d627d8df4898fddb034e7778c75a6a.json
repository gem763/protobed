companies are driving a boom in private jet sales, with almost 8,000 expected to be sold over the next decade as the demand for the newest and flashiest models grows.\n\nEach of the jets will burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as normal commercial flights despite growing concerns about emissions.\n\nAlmost 690 new business jets are expected to fly in 2019, a nine per cent increase on the previous year.\n\nAviation expert Brian Foley said: 'People want to be the first to take a new product, it's like iPhone mania but for jets.'\n\nThe demand for the newest and best private jets is driving a boom in the industry among the super-rich and multinational businesses\n\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg has helped raise global awareness of the climate crisis and insists on avoiding planes\n\nBuyers will fork out a combined \u00a3193billion over the next ten years, buying 7,600 private planes according to a report quoted in The Guardian.\n\nGaetan Handfield, senior manager of marketing analysis at Honeywell Aerospace and author of the report said: 'It is the introduction of many new aircraft models at the same time, with new clean streamline designs, that is driving demand for new private jets.\n\n'People like to have the newest and best jets.'\n\nHandfield said new jets by Bombardier, Gulfstream and Cessna are proving especially popular because of their longer range.\n\nBombardier recently launched the Global 7500, the world's largest and longest range business jet (pictured)\n\nThe Global 7500 boasts a full-size kitchen, four living spaces and what it claims is the largest cabin of any private jet\n\nHandfield said new jets by Bombardier, Gulfstream (pictured) and Cessna are proving especially popular because of their longer range\n\nBombardier recently launched the Global 7500, the world's largest and longest range business jet which boasts a full-size kitchen, four living spaces and what it claims is the largest cabin of any private jet.\n\nBrian Foley, an aviation analyst, said the rich and famous account for between 15 and 25 per cent of the world's private jet market, with the majority bought by multinational businesses.\n\nBut a recent report shows how corrupt or suspicious wealth has flowed through the UK, including seven private jets worth \u00a3170million.\n\nThe ten famous flyers identified by researchers in Sweden\n\nBy analysing over 400 corruption cases, Transparency International says it has identified hundreds of firms and businesses that have 'unwittingly or otherwise' helped individuals move corrupt funds through the UK, which then trickle down to asset purchases, Forbes reported.\n\nThe wealth is known to include seven private jets worth \u00a3170million, three luxury yachts worth \u00a3237million and real estate worth over \u00a35billion.\n\nIt comes after Harry and Meghan were criticised for their frequent use of private planes despite preaching about climate change.\n\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg has helped raise global awareness of the climate crisis and insists on avoiding planes when she travels around the world.\n\nShe even sailed from the UK to the US by boat last month.\n\nSwedish academics analysed the carbon footprints of ten famous people who travel the globe, with Bill Gates (pictured) topping the list with carbon footprint of more than 1,600 tons of CO2\n\nSecond was socialite Paris Hilton (pictured), who flew 171,346 miles by various private jets, emitting more than 1,260 tons of CO2 in the process\n\nAccording to research by Lund University in Sweden, the biggest celebrity emitter is Bill Gates, who took 59 flights in 2017, travelling more than 200,000 miles, releasing an estimated 1,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe average person releases around 5 tonnes in a year.\n\nOther 'super-emitters' include Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nJennifer Lopez is pictured on the steps of a private plane in 2018\n\nEmma Watson, the only Briton on the list, had the tenth worst environmental impact out of the group of celebrities selected, based on their social media accounts.\n\nShe flew 14 times in 2017 and travelled 42,253 miles, all on scheduled airlines, spending 71 hours in the air, the researchers calculated.\n\nHer carbon footprint from flying alone was 15.1 tons of CO2 \u2013 three times that of the global average from all activities.", "description": "Almost 8,000 private jets are expected to be sold over the next decade as the demand for new and flashier models grows among the super-rich
