The same then happened in 2010 due to torrential weather.\n\nFive years ago in Japan, Jules Bianchi hit a recovery crane in torrid conditions before succumbing to his injuries nine months later.\n\nThe FIA's decision to cancel Saturday's racing comes just days after England's Rugby World Cup match with France, which was set to take place in Yokohama on Saturday, was cancelled due to the threat of the typhoon.\n\nTournament organisers also made the decision to call off the Pool B between New Zealand and Italy, while Scotland's decisive Pool A clash with Japan is under review alongside Sunday's other matches.", "description": "Qualifying now moved from Saturday to Sunday at 10am local time - hours before the race.", "authors": ["Andrew Gilpin", "Image", "Nasa Earth Observatory Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556575.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Japanese-Grand-Prix-Qualifying-Suzuka.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
