The Google-branded smartphone has been beset by a copious amount of leaks - and it just hit the equivalent of an iceberg. The latest spill has revealed every major specification, including the camera, battery, display resolution, storage capacity and system information. You don't need to take some spy's word for it either - all the specs are right there on the Pixel 4's screen. Here are the photos.\n\nThe Verge was recently sent a cavalcade of Pixel 4 photos by the Vietnamese e-store D Store Mobile. This is the same outfit that recently leaked a prototype model to the YouTube channel Anhem TV. (These new images are apparently of the same test model.)\n\nThe pics show off the device from a variety of angles. In terms of appearance, they don't really reveal anything new. It's the same camera-stacked oblong we've seen multiple times already, including from Google itself.\n\nWell, since there seems to be some interest, here you go! Wait 'til you see what it can do. #Pixel4 pic.twitter.com/RnpTNZXEI1 \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) June 12, 2019\n\nHowever, when you take a look at what's being shown on the phone's screen, things get a lot more interesting.\n\nIn short, they provide out best look yet of the Pixel 4's hardware specifications yet - from general system settings to the battery size. If the images are genuine, it looks like we'll be getting a Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM, up to 128GB of storage and a 90Hz display. All of these specs have long been rumoured, but now we have proof right there on the Pixel 4 display.\n\nHere are the most revealing images - open them in a separate tab for a closer look at the listed specs.
