According to The Washington Post, he claimed Trump put him in charge of Ukraine relations and expressed in a meeting how Ukraine's corruption investigations \u201cneed to be started up again\u201d\u2014which officials understood to be a reference to the Biden probes.\n\nYovanovitch is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight Committees on Friday behind closed doors. Hill is also expected to testify before Congress on Oct. 14.", "description": "The Trump lawyer reportedly bypassed official means of diplomacy while pushing for Ukrainian probes against Joe Biden\u2014and Congress is about to hear first-hand testimony.", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570754313/GettyImages-963760780_m6feig", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
