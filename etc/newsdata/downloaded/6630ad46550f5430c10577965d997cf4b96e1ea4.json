One man had been hospitalised.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Live WS)\n\nInvestigations traced the cause of salmonella from a hog roast which hadn't been cooked to a temperature beyond 75 degrees which would have killed off salmonella.\n\nWhen environmental health inspectors visited the premises days later they discovered food out of date, mould in the fridges, and raw meat chopping boards were being mixed with other foods.\n\nMr Christopher Russell, representing Galloping Gourmet (Coulsden) Ltd, said: \"The company has no previous convictions and has a five star rating at its other nine sites. Further improvements and safeguards have been made to ensure this never happens again.\n\n\"The company would like to apologise for what happened to Mr and Mrs Kemp and their wedding guests.\"\n\nKevin Grego, district judge, said: \"This had a devastating affect on Mr and Mrs Kemp on their wedding day. In total 53 guests were affected by salmonella poisoning.\n\n\"Records involving the hog roast were not proper, in fact fraudulent. The hog roast should have been heated to over 75 degrees but it wasn't and this caused salmonella to be present.\"\n\nIn a statement released by solicitors Irwin Mitchell, Mr Kemp said: \u201cThe wedding had been a really fantastic day and everyone had enjoyed it so much but I couldn\u2019t believe it when I started to feel unwell.\n\n\"It got to the point where I had to go to a local walk-in centre and after tests I was told I had salmonella \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cMy illness lasted around 10 days all in all, but the symptoms were so bad that we had no option but to cancel our honeymoon to the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"I was totally devastated and we never got any money back from the tour operator or insurer in relation to it.\n\n\u201cWe did go away eventually, but this was obviously an extra cost on top of everything we had already paid. It was heartbreaking.\"\n\nOther guests affected by the illness problems have gone on to suffer issues including irritable bowel syndrome and psychological conditions as a result of what they have been through.\n\nPhil added: \u201cNews of today\u2019s prosecution is very welcome and I hope that it is an outcome that caterers across the country pay attention to and learn from.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Live WS)\n\n\"No one should have to go through what we have, especially in relation to their wedding day \u2013 it is just not acceptable.\n\n\u201cSadly a lot of the memories about what should have been the happiest day of mine and Vikki\u2019s lives are spoilt by what happened.\n\n\u201cNothing will change what has happened, but we now just hope these issues will never happen again.\u201d\n\nVenue Packington Moor, which hosted the October 2017 event, was not at fault, the council said.\n\nA spokesperson for Galloping Gourmet said: \u201cWe can\u2019t express how sorry we are for the distress and discomfort this incident caused.\n\n\u201cFood safety is a responsibility we take extremely seriously. Our priority is to serve safe, tasty and well-presented food and drink to our customers, but on this isolated occasion, our food safety procedures were not followed correctly.\n\n\u201cWe have investigated the incident thoroughly and made a significant investment in technology to improve our procedures and minimise the possibility for individual human error.\n\n\u201cSince we started out in 1990, we have served well over a million people and we\u2019ve never had a problem like this before. However, we have accepted full responsibility today and we are confident that the changes we\u2019ve made will help ensure that this never happens again.\u201d", "description": "The hog roast for the wedding of Phil and Vikki Kemp at Packington Hall, Warwickshire, was uncooked and caused widespread food poisoning", "authors": ["Andy Richardson", "Image", "Birmingham Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vikki-Kemp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
