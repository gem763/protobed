He sprayed the bear, and that\u2019s what made the bear leave.\u201d\n\nThe men sought medical treatment in the small town of Ennis. After leaving hospital they visited the shop to buy new clothes and seemed in high spirits, according to Ms James, who posted pictures of the bloodied hunters on Facebook.\n\nThe third man was attacked at 6.30pm while hunting with a friend, who was unharmed. They drove the bear away, and the injured hunter was treated in the village of Sheridan before being transferred to the city of Butte.\n\nMontana Fish, Wildlife and Parks said both attacks remained under investigation. Wildlife authorities sometimes capture and kill bears that have become habituated to people, and also do so more rarely when an animal is believed to have intentionally sought out its victims.\n\nOfficials urged people to be cautious and carry bear spray when grizzlies are active in spring, summer and autumn.\n\nThe grizzly population in and around Yellowstone National Park, which includes the Gravelly Mountains, has increased from an estimated 136 when they were granted federal protection in the mid-1970s to about 700 today.\n\nLast year, a bear and its cub fatally mauled a hunting guide in northwestern Wyoming.\n\nRead more\n\nMan fights off grizzly bear by stabbing it in neck with pocket knife", "description": "Three hunters were badly hurt in two separate grizzly bear attacks in Montana on the same day, state officials have said.All three suffered \u201cmoderate to severe\u201d injuries after being mauled by a lone bear in the Gravelley Mountains on Monday, according to the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks agency.", "authors": ["Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AoPp1OUu9Y0.q22Hz.kRKA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/03bbf8bb2fb67a8a44df0f068ebc4818", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
