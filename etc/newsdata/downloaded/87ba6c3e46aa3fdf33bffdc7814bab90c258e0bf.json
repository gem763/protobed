Bernstein & Co. analysts said Mr. Knobel lacked commercial operating experience and pointed to the executive\u2019s involvement in a 2016 deal to acquire Sun Products Corp. for about $3.6 billion\u2014a transaction they described as disastrous.\n\n\u201cHe is not an external, experienced hire that Henkel now requires to solve its fundamental strategic, operating and cultural problems,\u201d they wrote.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts added that Mr. Knobel \u201cis part of the same management board that failed to deliver on operational execution.\u201d\n\nHenkel, whose stock price declined 1.8% Thursday and another 1.4% Friday, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile many companies start looking internally for a new leader, most times they opt for an external candidate as CEO, said Mickey Matthews, international chairman at executive search firm Stanton Chase.\n\nAnd often, the new CEO comes from an operations role. Promotions from CFO to CEO at Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies are expected to be about 6.9% this year, the same as last year, according to Crist|Kolder Associates, a recruitment firm.\n\nAnd while a CFO-to-CEO elevation might be intended to convey an aura of stability and confidence, such promotions run the risk of underwhelming the market. \u201cThe perception is that this a missed opportunity,\u201d Mr. Matthews said.\n\nOutside observers could interpret such a move as a sign that the company is anticipating an economic slowdown and wants a person familiar with the financials at the helm during that time, he said.\n\nHenkel\u2019s adhesives business has been struggling in recent months, and sales in its beauty care also have been lagging. Net income declined 7.3% to \u20ac558 million ($618.2 million) in the second quarter, down from \u20ac602 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe choice of Mr. Knobel, who joined Henkel in 1995 and has been leading the company\u2019s finance department since 2012, could cast doubt among observers over Henkel\u2019s willingness to alter the structure of the company, either through mergers and acquisitions or through a breakup, JPMorgan analysts wrote.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at nina.trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Consumer goods giant Henkel said it was promoting its finance chief to CEO, a decision that a number of analysts criticized.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120978/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
