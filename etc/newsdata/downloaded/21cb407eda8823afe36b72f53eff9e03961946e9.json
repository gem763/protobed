In that time, no one has stepped forward to identify her.\n\nThe group cited pollen analysis of the remains in efforts to identify the girl, whose remains were found by a man mowing grass near Madisonville, Texas.\n\nThe girl, known only as \u201cMadisonville Jane Doe,\u201d was believed to be between 2 and 6 years old and was found wearing a pink dress; she also wore a diaper and had a feeding tube, which would have been surgically implanted, authorities said, adding that she was found wrapped in garbage bags.\n\nNEW JERSEY COPS SEARCH FOR GIRL, 5, LAST SEEN AT PLAYGROUND\n\nMedical experts believe she likely had a condition called micrognathia, which would have affected her ability to eat on her own.\n\nREMAINS OF MISSING CALIFORNIA MOTHER OF 3 DISCOVERED, HUSBAND ARRESTED, SHERIFF'S OFFICE SAYS\n\nAuthorities said the girl was likely dead for three to five months before she was found. Forensic experts believe the girl was Caucasian or Hispanic and had thick, dark hair. Genealogy research revealed she also had Native American lineage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal for anyone who has compassion to be bothered by this case. This is a young child,\u201d Madison County Sheriff Travis Neeley said, according to a National Center for Missing and Exploited Children blog post. The death was ruled a homicide.\n\nHe said that \u201cthese kinds of cases are the worst kind,\u201d adding that \u201cthey're frustrating because you feel helpless. I mean, I cannot bring nobody back to life by no means, but I want to bring some kind of peace, if nothing else.\u201d\n\nNeeley, who is planning to retire from his 20-year law enforcement career, said he is determined to solve the mystery of the little girl before he steps down.\n\nWhile the girl was found in Texas, the pollen analysis suggests she was from the southwest U.S. or the adjacent region in Mexico. It's even more likely she was from southeast Arizona, officials said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nForensic artists created a facial reconstruction image using a CT scan of her skull to help identify the girl.", "description": "An unidentified girl whose remains were found in a suitcase in Texas three years ago, may be from Arizona, The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
