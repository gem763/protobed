Ireland head into their quarter-final showdown against the All Blacks with recent history on their side. Two of the last three meetings between these giants have seen Joe Schmidt\u2019s men emerge victorious \u2013 the first coming in Chicago three years ago, followed by the Dublin Test last year. For all their trials and tribulations at this Rugby World Cup, Ireland will know that this is mission possible.\n\nMore assuringly for Schmidt, 12 of those players who surged to glory at the Aviva Stadium 11 months ago take to the Tokyo turf this weekend. Conor Murray and centre Robbie Henshaw missed that encounter due to injury but both will be on hand this Saturday, with the Irish more or less operating at full strength \u2013 excluding Bundee Aki, whose red against Samoa has ruled him out of the rest of the tournament.\n\nSo far, so good. But despite Ireland\u2019s recent exploits against New Zealand, this World Cup has demonstrated that the men in green aren\u2019t the side they were in 2016 or 2018. There are, of course, some qualities that have endured: the iron defence (Ireland have conceded just two tries at this tournament), the organisation and structure, the assured kicking game, the attacking prowess of the likes of Jacob Stockdale and Keith Earls.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut at times here in Japan, the side has felt like it's been missing something distinctively, well, Irish. The blooded aggression. The zip and fizz. The fear factor. In the win over Russia \u2013 despite the convincing 35-0 scoreline \u2013 there was no firebrand rugby, no fluency, no flair. It was laboured and error-strewn \u2013 and this against a team which, for 20 minutes of the match, was one man down.\n\nIt was a similar story against the Japanese. Despite a bright start, as was the case in the Russia clash, Ireland were guilty of taking their foot off the pedal. The hosts made sure to punish such insouciance, their charged surges down the flanks and ferocity at the breakdown leaving the Irish spinning. Any such lapses in concentration during tomorrow\u2019s showdown will be ruthlessly exploited by the All Blacks.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nNonetheless, there is optimism among the side. Talisman Johnny Sexton \u2013 whose absence from the Russia and Japan matches can perhaps explain his team\u2019s rough patches \u2013 is confident that the Irish are peaking at the right time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building pretty well apart from that poor 60 minutes against Japan; everything else has pretty much gone to plan,\u201d said Sexton earlier this week. \u201cWe haven\u2019t hit our best performance yet and we need to get close to that to get the right result on Saturday.\u201d\n\nAs for criticism that Ireland are struggling to return to the heights of 2018, during which the side consolidated their status as the best team on the planet, the fly-half is unconvinced.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some negativity around us and we\u2019d feel that\u2019s been pretty strange,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that having lost a pool game that we\u2019ve got that quarter-final performance out of our system that we\u2019ve had in other tournaments.\u201d The Irish may well believe themselves capable of felling the All Blacks, but it\u2019ll take a monumental step-up in form to get close to knocking the world champions off their perch.\n\nStill, Ireland aren\u2019t the only ones who are struggling to recapture the glory of former years. New Zealand may be the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to lift the Webb Ellis Cup next month, but there\u2019s an undeniable sense that they are now at least beatable \u2013 which hasn\u2019t always been the case for Steve Hansen\u2019s men.\n\nTheir composed and controlled win over South Africa showed what they\u2019re capable of, but they now head into this clash perhaps a little undercooked, having faced no-one of significance since that opener \u2013 though an All Blacks side operating even at room temperature remains a dangerous entity.\n\nThe two-week break that has followed since the 71-9 win over Namibia, after the Italy match was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, could well serve against them too. Time to fester, to mull over the endless possibilities, to scour the headlines and dwell upon what is in front won\u2019t have been conducive to their preparations.\n\nBut matters of the mind rarely trouble the All Blacks. Their \u2018soft spots\u2019, if we can call them that, are far less subtle. Richie Mo\u2019unga\u2019s field kicking game at 10 will come under scrutiny. The set-piece could be another area to focus on. New Zealand\u2019s starting tight five can be matched in terms of physicality, with Brodie Retallick perhaps a figure to target given his recent injury and limited game time in Japan.\n\nThe All Blacks\u2019 dual playmaker approach could equally help Ireland\u2019s cause. Former Irish coach Eddie O\u2019Sullivan said this week that having Mo\u2019unga at No 10 would allow Schmidt\u2019s men to look after their own territory better. \u201cWe probably play our wings high and take away the space in the corners,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can do that against Richie Mo\u2019unga, I\u2019m not sure you can get away with it against Beauden Barrett as much.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m really happy about Barrett being at 15 because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get his hands on the ball as much. He\u2019s a massive catalyst for New Zealand in attack. He can really cause problems when he\u2019s on the ball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s practically impossible to bring him into the game as much as Richie Mo\u2019unga will be.\u201d\n\nWith Barrett at 15, that could nullify the threat posed by Murray and Sexton\u2019s high balls; after all, why hand possession back to your opponents\u2019 most potent player? But with rainfall expected for the match, the Irish need to keep their options open and their game plan flexible.\n\nThe breakdown will similarly come under the spotlight. Officiating at this World Cup has proven costly for a number of sides that have found themselves on the wrong side of a referee\u2019s interpretation. The All Blacks will know that they\u2019ll be walking a dangerous line if they try to pull the tricks of the past over Nigel Owens tomorrow. Assuming they can rediscover their bite on this particular battlefront, with Peter O\u2019Mahony far from his best in recent weeks, Ireland could well use the current climate to their advantage in drawing crucial penalties.\n\nAfter speculation whether these two teams would meet in Japan, the stage is now set. In one corner, a side that knows what it takes to get under the All Blacks\u2019 skin but which heads into this match on the back of a flawed group campaign. In the other, the three-time world champions who remain an exhilarating force of nature, but nonetheless are without the aura of invincibility which once hung from their shoulders. With so much riding on this, and the margins so fine in their last encounter, this clash will be nothing short of explosive. Pull up a chair and enjoy the fireworks. It\u2019s going to be a big one.", "description": "They\u2019ve done it before, so can they do it again?
