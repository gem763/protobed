So what do they do with Dwayne Haskins?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s best for him,\u201d Washington Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said this week of rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nMost days, the Washington Redskins\u2019 most salable asset walks in quiet limbo around the team\u2019s locker room, caught in an awkward purgatory between a crumbling present and an uncertain future.\n\nDwayne Haskins is the one Redskin whose jersey fills store shelves and holds the potential to sell tickets, a star at the nearby Bullis School brought home to save a withering franchise. The team took him with the 15th pick in last April\u2019s draft because he is supposed to be the quarterback for the next decade, the one whose gifted right arm will bring the winning back.\n\nBut Haskins is a rookie who started just 14 games at Ohio State. Washington\u2019s coaches have deemed him not ready to play, all but voicing a preference for him to sit a full season so he can learn the intricacies of the game\u2019s most important position. And yet this is an age in which first-round quarterbacks often start right away. This makes him the center of an increasingly contentious public debate about whether he should be playing, and what is best for his future.\n\nComplicating matters is the lingering question, dating back to draft day, of whether Redskins Coach Jay Gruden viewed Haskins as the right choice for the team. Before Haskins was selected, ESPN reported that Washington\u2019s coaching staff preferred a more experienced college player \u2014 like Duke\u2019s Daniel Jones, who was selected sixth overall by the New York Giants \u2014 only to be overruled by owner Daniel Snyder.\n\nA person with knowledge of Gruden\u2019s thinking has confirmed that the head coach did not want Haskins, and while Haskins has publicly downplayed any suggestion that he wasn\u2019t Gruden\u2019s choice, a person close to the rookie quarterback said that Haskins has sensed that to be the case.\n\nStill, they move forward \u2014 with Gruden and his staff teaching Haskins everything they know and Haskins coming to each quarterback meeting prepared, asking all the right questions \u2014 treading carefully through a season that has thudded to an 0-4 start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s best for him,\u201d Gruden said this week, although unspoken was the fact that Gruden, whose job is at risk during his sixth season as the team\u2019s head coach, also has a pressing need to win games now to save his job \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t fit neatly with developing a rookie quarterback who hasn\u2019t yet shown he\u2019s ready to play.\n\n[How Gardner Minshew went from college nomad to mustachioed cult hero to NFL\u2019s top rookie]\n\nThose two dynamics came crashing together last Sunday when Haskins was thrust into his first game, replacing starter Case Keenum against the New York Giants. Gruden thought the move might bring a \u201cspark\u201d to his faltering team, with Keenum nursing a sore foot and missing key throws. Instead, Haskins looked lost and was intercepted three times in a 24-3 loss.\n\nThis week, Haskins, Keenum and Colt McCoy are part of a three-man competition to start against the New England Patriots and one of Haskins\u2019s childhood heroes, Tom Brady. It\u2019s the kind of midseason quarterback battle NFL teams rarely have, and the outcome could range from Haskins starting to being the backup to not even dressing.\n\nDepending on who you ask, none of these results will be desirable. A public debate rages on radio and television: Should Haskins be playing now or not?\n\n\u201cNo matter what we do with him, we\u2019re going to be wrong,\u201d Gruden said testily this week, seemingly acknowledging the criticism he has taken in recent days, \u201cso it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\n\nRedskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins made his NFL debut last week versus the Giants. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nGruden never seemed to want a big project at quarterback this year. He had kept his job at the end of last season partly because of the way he kept the team together despite a series of calamities, including quarterback Alex Smith\u2019s likely career-ending broken leg and McCoy\u2019s leg break two games later. At the time Smith went down, the Redskins were 6-3 and led the NFC East.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a leap for Gruden to think, this spring, that a suitable veteran replacement for Smith could take Washington to the playoffs \u2014 something that would be much harder to do with a rookie who only started one season in college. He probably was never more publicly candid about this than a month before the draft, when during a breakfast at the league\u2019s annual meeting, he said: \u201cAnytime you start a quarterback, you are expected to win. There is no developmental process here. This is not Triple A baseball, we\u2019re [not] trying to develop a pitcher here, we\u2019re trying to win a game right now.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that Haskins wasn\u2019t Gruden\u2019s first choice, the Redskins coaches were excited about their rookie quarterback. They acknowledged that he was significantly behind veterans McCoy and Keenum in training camp, often working with the third and fourth teams, but expressed optimism that he would eventually come along.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a really bright future,\u201d offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said not long before the start of the season.\n\nStill, the coaches were quick to say that they were essentially teaching Haskins how to play quarterback in the NFL, a process made even more challenging because of Haskins\u2019s inexperience. Had McCoy not suffered a setback to his leg injury, he likely would have been the team\u2019s starter and Keenum its backup, making Gruden\u2019s decision on Haskins simple: He would be the team\u2019s third quarterback. Instead, McCoy was out for the next eight weeks, making Keenum the starter and forcing Haskins into backup duty.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to executing in [an NFL] game there is so much for a quarterback to learn,\u201d says former Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, who was around training camp and speaks to the team\u2019s coaches. \u201cKnowing to keep an eye on the 25-second (play) clock. Knowing down and distance. Knowing what\u2019s going on on the other side of the field with the opposing team\u2019s defense. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of things you have to think about more than just throwing the football. \u2026 Someone who\u2019s done it for several years in college is going to have more experience at that.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that to get more experience, you have to play \u2014 and this is where the public debate about Haskins gets most intense.\n\nSome, like former Redskins safety and current ESPN analyst, Matt Bowen think Haskins should play this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said \u2018it\u2019s hard to learn from someone else\u2019s game film,'\u201d Bowen said, while acknowledging Gruden\u2019s current dilemma, which might require him starting McCoy or Keenum in the next few weeks. \u201cThe film [Haskins] needs to watch is where he does self-scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThere are others, though, like fellow ESPN analyst and former Redskins front office executive Louis Riddick, who are irate that Gruden put Haskins into the game against New York, without giving him time to properly prepare in practices.\n\n\u201cDo you think Dwayne Haskins feels totally supported in this process?\u201d Riddick said Monday night. \u201cThese are the kinds of things I talk about all the time: setting people up for success. That young man right now is being set up for failure. Dan Snyder needs to recognize that.\u201d\n\n\n\nRedskins owner Daniel Snyder before Sunday's game against the Giants. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nSnyder stormed out of New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium following the Redskins\u2019 loss to the Giants and has not given a public indication about how Haskins is being used, though one person with knowledge of the situation said after the draft that Snyder was willing to let the coaches be patient with Haskins, realizing that Haskins needed time to grow.\n\nHaskins himself has said little about the situation he is in with the Redskins. When asked, earlier this week, if he felt properly prepared to play against the Giants, he diplomatically replied: \u201cYou just got to make the most of every opportunity. \u2026 This is my first year in the NFL and I have plenty more to go, and it\u2019s just one steppingstone.\u201d\n\nHe ducked any questions about this week\u2019s current situation, which most acknowledge is less than ideal for everyone, especially a young quarterback trying to learn the NFL.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want musical chairs at quarterback,\u201d Bowen said, adding that a quarterback can\u2019t be allowed \u201cto lose confidence\u201d being yanked between playing and sitting.\n\nGruden doesn\u2019t seem to want the current situation, either, but appears stuck with it due to a combination of Keenum\u2019s foot soreness, McCoy\u2019s slow recovery and Haskins\u2019s inexperience. He says \u201cstability\u201d would probably help, and yet there is little stability on a team that missed five offensive starters last week and has 10 players on injured reserve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world if [Haskins] doesn\u2019t play another snap [or] if he starts every game and doesn\u2019t do very well, it\u2019s a good experience for him,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nFor now, though, the Redskins\u2019 future strolls their locker room almost caught in some alternate dimension, stuck between being the team\u2019s most important player and an afterthought to be used at some undetermined time. The room is not exactly his, so he doesn\u2019t march with the entitlement of a franchise quarterback. He stops to joke with players, feeling comfortable enough to do things like walk up to right tackle Morgan Moses, whose locker is next to his, and knead Moses\u2019s shoulders with his hands and elbows. Haskins appears to be well-liked by most of the players with some, like star running back Adrian Peterson, constantly offering advice.\n\nSomeday the team will be his. For now, though, he stays mostly quiet until that day and time comes.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nThe Redskins would be a lot of fun if they were as good as Bill Belichick says they are\n\nFive Redskins bright spots on a humiliatingly bad team\n\n\u2018Coaching malpractice\u2019: Analysts rip Jay Gruden for playing Dwayne Haskins against Giants", "description": "With Washington off to an 0-4 start, there are differing opinions on how best to develop the team's rookie quarterback.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "October At Am", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/m_kdXtlLkAasHlwm9IAq1_oPQOM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BUFPYSG6K4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
