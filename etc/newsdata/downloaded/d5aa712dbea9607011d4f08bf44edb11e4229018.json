As Hollywood\u2019s reigning queen of the LBD, Aniston keeps her red carpet style minimal and monochrome. Though she\u2019s been spotted in chic new pieces from Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen during this latest press tour, Aniston outdid herself for last night\u2019s premiere of her Apple TV+ series, The Morning Show. Dressed in a vintage gown from James Galanos, Aniston gave the crowd at Lincoln Center a taste of old-school glamour with the classic piece that she bought at the Beverly Hills boutique, LILY et cie.\n\nAn icon of 20th century design who outfitted everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Nancy Reagan, Galanos helped to define American fashion with his ready-to-wear collections and onscreen costumes. Known for clean lines and a commitment to refinement, his work meshes well with Aniston\u2019s less-is-more philosophy. With its halter neck and navy color, the gown was striking yet understated\u2014completely in line with the looks Aniston and her stylists, Nina and Clare Hallworth, have chosen of late. A blast from the past that seemed completely modern, the dress was a welcome reminder that the most impactful outfits are the ones that come with history.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "In a retro piece from James Galanos, the actress delivered a lesson in fashion history.", "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YSFEFn59c1zpbWwJOXJhwA--~B/aD0xMDQyO3c9MTg1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/e90eebdd973a469b2889a3b1a4ce265b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
