And as other kinds of citizen-powered crime-tracking form an ever-widening panopticon over our urban space, the act of recording and displaying those data has become more fraught.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Ring doorbells\u2014video-surveillance devices homeowners affix to their front doors\u2014are now being used by more than 400 police departments around the country to catch criminals. Citizen, a crime-tracking app that scrapes 911 and police-dispatch data and allows onlookers to live-stream and comment on in-progress emergencies, offers users a real-time glimpse of urban disorder, which may have psychological effects that change the way residents think about their cities. On the social-media platform Nextdoor, neighbors can post updates on purse snatchings and \u201cshady characters\u201d alongside furniture giveaways and lost-dog notices, leading some to see the site as a kind of petri dish for racial profiling. And a BuzzFeed News investigation found that even regular city-run 311 nuisance-complaint portals have been increasingly used to report noise violators in gentrifying neighborhoods.\n\nRead: The doorbell company that\u2019s selling fear\n\nAmidst this landscape of technology designed to maximize opportunities for urban narcing, a bike-lane-defender app stands out as a beneficial means of evening the balance of power between cyclists and drivers. But does it also take us one more step down the slippery slope to a self-surveillance society?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this cultural shift of normalizing that it\u2019s okay to be taking photos and videos of other people in public,\u201d says Rachel Thomas, the founding director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco\u2019s Data Institute, and the co-founder of the online coding school Fast.ai. The illusion of privacy in the public sphere may have always been an illusion, but with many more eyes and lenses trained on the streets, the age-old practice of \u201cbeing seen\u201d can evolve quickly into being shared, and being stored. And perhaps being unfairly tried and convicted in the court of public opinion.\n\nThese new citizen-reporting technologies come in varying stripes and levels of stakes, and in many ways they reflect a wider and older trend: the use of social media as a tool for tattling on peers. (See: This gotcha image of Ivanka Trump\u2019s motorcade blocking the bike lane in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a growing desire to create a centralized site for such records of bad behavior\u2014one that anyone can access, and that can function as a deterrent for other prospective offenders. It\u2019s driven in part by the understanding that local governments aren\u2019t fully up to the task of policing, and don\u2019t always act swiftly, efficiently, or in the public\u2019s best interest. And it\u2019s compounded by the techno-chauvinist conviction that collecting data from anyone and everyone is the first and most crucial step to solving the world\u2019s problems. Many bureaucracies won\u2019t even think about overhauling systems\u2014like bike infrastructure\u2014unless given compelling evidence. Many cities simply don\u2019t have the resources to collect that evidence themselves.", "description": "Apps that track bike-lane offenders help cyclists feel a sense of agency.
