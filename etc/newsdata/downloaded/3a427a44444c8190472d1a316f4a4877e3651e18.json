A sliver of higher-income taxpayers, however, was clobbered by the law\u2019s $10,000 limit on the amount of state and local tax payments that can be deducted from filers\u2019 federal taxable income. Republicans knew this change would especially hit high-tax states where people tend to vote Democratic \u2015 like New York and California.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate failed to approve a resolution that would have benefited those blue state inhabitants by striking a Treasury Department regulation that prevents state governments from using tax credit schemes to help households dodge the limit. The resolution went down by a vote of 43 to 52, with one Republican voting in favor and one Democrat against.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that the resolution would nullify a \u201chorrible rule and put power back in the hands of homeowners.\u201d (Homeowners tend to have higher local tax burdens due to property taxes.)\n\nNot all Democrats were on board. In a floor speech on Tuesday, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), the lone Democratic no vote, lambasted the 2017 law as a giveaway to the rich. He said the Treasury Department\u2019s regulations were sloppily written, but that undoing them would primarily help the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of this resolution goes to people at the very top,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cThe top 0.1%, who are people who have $3.3 million of income on average; the top 1%, who have an average income of $755,000; and the next 4%, who make $319,000.\u201d\n\nOutright repealing the limit on state and local tax deductions would benefit 9% of households overall and only 3% of middle-income households earning between $49,000 and $86,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. But political definitions of the middle class often extend further up the income scale than income-based definitions, and Democrats have their eyes on the 15.6% of households earning between $100,000 and $200,000 that could benefit from even indirectly raising the limit.\n\nBennet said he knew his colleagues didn\u2019t want to do favors for the rich, \u201cbut the way we approach these issues really matters to the American people so they know whom we are fighting for.\u201d\n\nInstead of repealing the tax regulation, the senator said, Democrats should vote on a different piece of legislation that he introduced earlier this year, the American Family Act, which aims to reduce poverty through a new child tax benefit. Other developed countries have similar policies and lower levels of child poverty. But in the U.S., children are the most impoverished age group.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) echoed Bennet on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that my Democratic colleagues want to unwind tax reform,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cBut it\u2019s downright comical that their top priority is helping wealthy people in blue states find loopholes to pay even less.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Senate Democrat on tax issues, said the proposed resolution was more about correcting sloppy governance than effectively boosting the state and local tax deduction, otherwise known as SALT.\n\n\u201cThis is not a referendum on SALT,\u201d Wyden told HuffPost before the vote.\n\nSome states tried to get around the $10,000 limit on SALT deductions by allowing tax filers to make federally deductible \u201cdonations\u201d to the state government in exchange for credits that offset their state tax bills. The Treasury rule forbids taxpayers to take federal deductions for charitable donations that result in a quid pro quo state tax benefit.\n\nUnder the Congressional Review Act, Congress has the power to strike recently issued regulations \u2015 a power that Republicans put to extensive use right after Trump took office in 2017.\n\nWyden pointed out there have been complaints about Treasury\u2019s rule, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who wrote to the department this month asking for a carveout for donations to state-run charitable programs. And the conservation group Ducks Unlimited said in a 2018 letter responding to an initial draft of the rule that it would undercut additional state tax incentives for conservation easements that are federally tax-deductible.\n\nEven if the Senate had approved the resolution Wednesday, and then the House had followed, Trump could still have vetoed it. And whatever happened, the limit on SALT deductibility remains on the books, since the resolution only targeted the one regulation preventing the tax dodge.\n\nThe story has been updated to note the Senate\u2019s failure to pass the resolution and to add more detail about the reach of the SALT deduction.", "description": "They want to restore a legal dodge around the law's cap on state and local tax deductions, which notably hit blue states.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db06cee210000c72534ad4a.jpeg?cache=uj1v9xaw4d&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
