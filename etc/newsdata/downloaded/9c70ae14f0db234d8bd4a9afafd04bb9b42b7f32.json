(Sheriff Danny Perkins/Garfield County Sheriff's Office/AP)\n\nFour people were killed in a tour bus crash outside Utah\u2019s Bryce Canyon National Park that left at least a dozen others with critical injuries, the state\u2019s highway patrol said Friday.\n\nThirty people, including the driver, were on the bus Friday morning when it went off state Route 12, rolled and landed on a guardrail, authorities said. Five people remained in \u201cpretty critical condition\u201d Friday evening, Utah Highway Patrol Cpl. Chris Bishop said.\n\nEarlier in the day, the highway patrol said via Twitter that 10 people had sustained \u201cminor to serious injuries\u201d in addition to the 12 to 15 people with critical injuries. The passengers were all from China, and the driver was Chinese American, Bishop said.\n\nInvestigations so far indicate that the driver \u201cfor whatever reason drifted off the road\u201d and then steered too hard to the left trying to correct course, Bishop said. The vehicle rolled but ended up wheels-down when it hit the guardrail.\n\nThose killed died on the scene, he added.\n\nThe crash occurred 10 miles east of the small town of Panguitch, according to the highway patrol. Authorities received calls about the crash just after 11:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty overwhelming for a little county of 4,900 people,\u201d Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock told local news media. \u201cThis is just horrible for us, and we feel terrible for those who are injured and their families.\u201d\n\nIntermountain Healthcare\u2019s facilities received 22 patients, and five others were flown elsewhere for care, said spokesman Lance Madigan, adding that he could not yet describe the conditions of all of the patients.\n\nNineteen passengers were taken to Intermountain\u2019s Garfield Memorial Hospital in Panguitch for treatment, Madigan said. At least 14 of those people were in critical or serious condition, the hospital said. Three patients were taken to Intermountain\u2019s Sevier Valley Hospital in Richfield, Utah.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is sending a 10-member team that would arrive at the site Saturday to investigate the crash, the agency said on Twitter.\n\nBishop said officials expect to wrap up their on-scene work Friday evening. But reconstructing what happened could take weeks or months, he said.\n\nAuthorities will be pull from equipment on the vehicle data such as speed and are examining where the bus came from, the driver\u2019s activities and whether he was impaired, Bishop said.\n\nState Route 12 was closed after the crash, KSL.com reported.\n\nIn a tweet, the Chinese Embassy in Washington expressed sadness over the crash and thanked authorities in Utah for their response.\n\n\u201cThe Embassy has initiated its emergency protocols, sent personnel to the area, and will assist the victims as needed,\u201d it said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHiker killed after falling 500 feet from Half Dome cables in Yosemite\n\n'Water was knocking at my door\u2019: Tropical Storm Imelda floods Texas as two people reported dead", "description": "The crash also left at least a dozen people critically wounded and another 10 with \u201cminor to serious injuries,\" officials said.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
