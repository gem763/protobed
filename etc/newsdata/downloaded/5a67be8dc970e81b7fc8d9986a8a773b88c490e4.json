Apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border are 62 percent lower than they were three months ago, but authorities believe they could surge again when the summer heat subsides. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe dead man was face down near the riverbank, visible mostly because of the slivers of red on the soles of his sneakers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a floater,\u201d U.S. Border Patrol agent Deborah Villarreal called out to the rest of her unit. She swung the patrol boat around to get a closer look.\n\nIt was predawn, early in Villarreal\u2019s shift, and the purplish-pink sky reflected in the placid waters of the Rio Grande. She furrowed her brow at the grim start to her day, and she thought about the family out there somewhere, missing this man, wondering where he was, not knowing he was dead.\n\n\u201cI hate to see that,\u201d she said.\n\nVillarreal sees dead bodies regularly, floating in this river that separates Mexico from the United States. This was the second her unit had spotted along this particular stretch in about a week.\n\nBy the end of her day, she would have steered the boat up and down the river a couple dozen more times, passing the body again and again before Mexican authorities arrived to take it away. She would pass the same series of concrete sheds \u2014 holes drilled into the sides so the drug cartels can use them as lookout points \u2014 and the same run-down riverfront cafe, where a black car loitered, and a man watched the boat pass. She would wave to the Mexican national guardsmen at their sleepy encampment, push through a cloud of skunk odor \u2014 it was their mating season \u2014 scour the river reeds for signs of footsteps into the United States, and send her agents up the bank and into the brush after a pair of Mexican migrants, ultimately catching up to them on the edge of a cane field.\n\n\n\nA Border Patrol agent chases migrants through a cane field while patrolling the Rio Grande in Texas. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThis, relative to recent months, was a slow day in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe winding body of the river here in South Texas \u2014 with its submerged remnants of rafts, its banks trampled by migrant families and cartel workers, and now, by Mexican forces \u2014 is a microcosm of all the ebbs and flows of the nation\u2019s approach to immigration. This sliver of the 1,954-mile border with Mexico is primed to deliver a verdict on the effectiveness of the Trump administration\u2019s border policies.\n\nIt is here that the spring influx of migrant families and children reached its peak, inundating U.S. Border Patrol stations with too many detainees. But apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley have dropped 55 percent since May, down from nearly 50,000 to just more than 22,000 in August. Though this area still sees more migrant crossings than any other sector of the border, border agents here have witnessed how Washington policies aimed at decreasing the flow have played out in real time.\n\nTo them, it is President Trump\u2019s deal with Mexico to intercept migrants before they cross into the United States that has seemed to have the most impact. They do not know the details of the accord or how long it will last, but they can see the Mexican forces on the other side of the Rio Grande.\n\n\u201cYou see a difference,\u201d said Ryan Ansbro, a Border Patrol agent who works alongside Villarreal.\n\nVillarreal and her team, who patrol the river by boat, rush to intercept migrants and smugglers before they cross, and they pluck people from the water when they wind up in it. The precipitous summer decline in migrant crossings has meant quieter shifts on a river that is suddenly more manageable, less frantic.\n\nBut the constants remain: the desperation that cannot be deterred by danger; the drug cartels that devise new methods as fast as authorities try to thwart them; the everyday logistical challenges facing the Border Patrol, even as Trump focuses money and rhetorical energy on a border wall.\n\nThough lower than earlier in the year, last month still saw more crossings than any other August in a decade. Will large groups of families and children \u2014 sometimes as many as 300 people at once \u2014 again pull agents away from their patrol duties, forcing them to become processors and jail guards? Will Mexican troops be able to sustain their efforts?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in limbo,\u201d Villarreal said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to skyrocket again or if this is going to be what helps us. It\u2019s just an unknown.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwo migrants who had tried to elude authorities in brush and cane along the Rio Grande are taken into custody on Sept. 5. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe chase is always on\n\nOn the river, the chase is always on. Cartel scouts along the Mexican side keep watch for the Border Patrol, launching rafts to the United States full of migrants or drugs whenever they find a gap.\n\nThe agents, in turn, speed back and forth, hoping to keep up. They rely heavily on eyes in the sky: helicopters, blimps with cameras, and stationary surveillance technology mounted on the edges of walls and fields to warn them of a raft hitting the water. If they get to the launch point quickly enough, the rafts often double back \u2014 sometimes tossing migrants into the water as they do.\n\n\u201cOur job is more of a deterrence unit,\u201d Villarreal said. \u201cAnd we are involved in a lot of rescues.\u201d\n\nThe pale-green water in this region is flat and still, its current barely discernible from the boat deck, as it winds snakelike through the thick scrubland, with curves and switchbacks. Some of the narrowest areas and favored crossing points are less than a football field wide. But the water can be deceiving.\n\n\u201cYou look at it right now, and you think there\u2019s no current,\u201d Ansbro said. \u201cBut you get in, and you find out there is a current. And a lot of them can\u2019t swim,\u201d he said of the migrants. Others get disoriented in the thick brush on the U.S. side, and in their exhaustion, they try to swim back.\n\nThick tangles of reeds, known locally as carrizo cane, create dense jungles that stretch from the riverbanks inland, thwarting the movements of migrants and the Border Patrol agents seeking to apprehend them.\n\n\n\nTwo migrants are taken into custody during routine U.S. Border Patrol operations.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Border Patrol agents tell stories of the people they have found: the 18-year-old who medic Salvador Pastran discovered face up and arms spread in the middle of a dirt road a few years ago, the body reminding him of a snow angel; the young woman and three babies that agent Sheymarie Rosa and colleagues spotted recently, so close to a road, but all dead; or the group of 20 children and adults who Villarreal and her team rescued from the reeds at the water\u2019s edge earlier in the summer.\n\nIn three days on the river this month, agents from the McAllen Border Patrol station, including Villarreal\u2019s unit, encountered migrants during every shift who were suffering from heat exhaustion in the cane fields and citrus orchards between the river and the roads, even though the weather was cooler \u2014 in the 80s \u2014 than it had been in weeks.\n\nLinda Rivas is an El Paso-based immigration attorney whose work regularly takes her to the dangerous Mexican border city of Juarez, where thousands of migrants are stranded as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s new asylum policies. The work is pushing her to the limit, and there are too many people who need her help. (REF:murphyz0-v/The Washington Post)\n\nThere was a Nicaraguan man who told agents he had lost consciousness in the brush after being deposited there by smugglers early in the morning. Hours later, he came to and crawled out onto a levee, where he was able to seek help from two U.S. National Guardsmen who have been deployed to the border in recent months to assist the Border Patrol.\n\nThere was another migrant, who agents believed to be a Chinese national, who began vomiting incessantly \u2014 a common symptom of heat exhaustion, Pastran said \u2014 shortly after they gave him water to drink.\n\nMany of the migrants are leaving behind abject poverty, gangs, violence \u2014 and the dangers of a northbound trek and a hazardous crossing do not dilute the potential promise of life in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe conditions here are still better,\u201d Ansbro said.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Border Patrol riverine unit catch and detain migrants Sept. 5 near Mission, Tex. Though crossings were lower than earlier in the year, last month still saw more than any other August in a decade. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nEchoing the broad contours of arguments the Trump administration has made about why it is necessary to more aggressively deport those who are in the country illegally, Villarreal, Ansbro and other agents said they believe little can be done to stop the flow of migrants without tightening the laws to make it more difficult for asylum seekers and illegal entrants to remain in the United States.\n\n\u201cIf they think they can come and stay, they\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Villarreal said.\n\nPolicies such as the administration\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols, which pushes asylum seekers back into Mexico to await U.S. court hearings, and other restrictions such as requiring migrants to first seek asylum in countries they transit on their way to the United States, are aimed at preventing people from even attempting a crossing.\n\nBut the Mexican forces are the only policy that the agents on the river can see for themselves.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Mexican national guard wave to U.S. Border Patrol agents as they patrol the Rio Grande. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nChange on the Rio Grande\n\nThe change came earlier this summer.\n\nEarly one morning, Villarreal and her unit caught a glimpse of something unusual in the dark.\n\nThere, on the Mexican side of the river, was a collection of colorful tent canvases, like a family campsite at a national park. But this was the bank of the Rio Grande, just north of the Mexican city of Reynosa, where the government had notoriously little authority in the face of cartel control. It was only after the tents\u2019 occupants came to life under the beams of the Border Patrol\u2019s flashlights that Villarreal and her agents realized what they were seeing.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s the Mexican military,\u201d she said, recalling her surprise, referring to the Mexican national guard forces. \u201cWe woke those poor guys up.\u201d\n\nThere is little direct communication between the agents and the Mexican authorities. An international liaison handles that.\n\nBut on this day, Villarreal waved to the men in fatigues as her boat passed. We haven\u2019t seen much today, she calls out to them in Spanish through the boat\u2019s loudspeaker, \u201cbut we\u2019ll let you know if we do.\u201d\n\nTwo of the men responded with a thumbs-up.\n\nWhen a late morning call came in over the radio about a group crossing downriver, the intelligence was coming from an agent watching an aerial camera, and Villarreal\u2019s boat unit took off at 47 mph, past the inlet where agents have seen alligators, and past the remnants of a dozen green plastic rafts snagged on tree branches in the shallows.\n\n\u201cMira,\u201d Rosa told Villarreal in Spanish. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nThe boat slowed next to a forested bank across from an empty Mexican cafe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a guy right there.\u201d Across the river, a man was watching them.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Mexican national guard camp along the edge of the Rio Grande just north of Reynosa, Mexico. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThey moved up and down along the river bank, searching for signs of trampled reeds. The raft had already crossed. Finding fresh footprints in the mud, Ansbro and Rosa set off in pursuit through the brush, where their uniforms snagged on blades of cane and the air felt heavy and suffocating.\n\nThey followed the tracks out to a dirt road along another dense field of cane, and up the road, a snake slipping over the sandy berm to get out of their way. A helicopter moved in overhead.\n\n\u201cFifty yards ahead of you, there\u2019s going to be two of them,\u201d came a voice from the helicopter over the radio after several minutes. \u201cRight shoulder. Go into the field right there.\u201d And the agents plunged into the cane, emerging seconds later with two muddied men handcuffed together.\n\nThey sat them down on the road to collect their belongings and to begin the typical questioning. One was a 44-year-old fisherman from the southern Mexican state of Veracruz. The other was a 32-year-old from Guerrero. Both were fathers of three. Both were exhausted.\n\nThey had not eaten in two or three days, the fisherman said. They had come to the United States to look for work.\n\nThe agents led them back to the boat, took them upriver, and handed them off to another agent with a truck. They would likely face swift deportation.\n\nIn the afternoon, the tiny boat Villarreal had been waiting for since dawn appeared around a river bend. Two bomberos \u2014 Mexican firefighters in red vests \u2014 stood side-by-side as they steered upriver. Villarreal\u2019s team guided them to the body they had reported that morning.\n\nThe man, whose name they would likely never know, was just as they had left him, the red of his sneakers still peeking above the murky green in the shadow of the reeds. They guessed he had been dead for days, and Villarreal furrowed her brow again, this time in pity for what the firefighters would have to do.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for the bomberos. They pay them nothing,\u201d she said as she watched them delicately tie the body to a rope attached to their boat.\n\nWhen bodies end up on the U.S. side of the border, agents call the local sheriff\u2019s office or justice of the peace to handle the remains and seek identification. When they are on the Mexican side, it is up to the bomberos.\n\nAnsbro and Rosa asked what would become of him. Villarreal shrugged. If he has no identification, she said, he will probably be placed in a grave of unknowns.\n\nThe bomberos motored away, dragging the man in the boat\u2019s wake.\n\nVillarreal picked up the radio.\n\n\u201cThe body has been recovered.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Border Patrol agents attribute summer slowdown to Mexican efforts but say it\u2019s unclear how long it could last.", "authors": ["Abigail Hauslohner", "National Reporter Focusing On Immigrant Communities In America", "Abigail Hauslohner Covers Immigrant Communities", "Immigration Policy On The Washington Post'S National Desk.
