It\u2019s seen its game plan for the country wiped out by a single tweet put up by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, that expressed support for the protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nApple now finds itself uncomfortably in the spotlight after pulling an app that tracked the movements of police in China\u2019s \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d through the use of crowdsourced data. It had been used by the pro-democracy protesters.\n\nApple said HKmap.live was in violation of local laws and company guidelines. The tech giant had been the subject of an editorial in China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily accusing it of \u201cprotecting rioters\u201d with a \u201cpoisonous app\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIts move is actually less impactful than it looks: there are web browser versions available for people to use.\n\nThe problem for Apple is the optics. The mealy-mouthed explanation that the app \u201cviolates our guidelines and local laws\u201d fools no one. What you have here is a company birthed in the land of the free that could, with its taking down the app, be accused of being complicit in the suppression of freedom to protect its bottom line.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nIt is far from alone.\n\nSoftware company Activism Blizzard, which is part Chinese owned, recently banned a leading pro-gamer for a year after he voiced a pro-democracy slogan during a post-game interview.\n\nThe backlash was swift, and fierce. A boycott has been threatened and The Daily Beast has reported that a number of employees staged a walkout in protest. \u201cBlizzard makes a lot of money in China but now the company is in this awkward position where we can\u2019t abide by our values,\u201d an employee told the publication.\n\nThen there\u2019s Google. This is where it gets really interesting. For a long time it allowed InfoWars founder Alex Jones to give vent to his hate filled rants and conspiracy theories via YouTube on the grounds of free speech.\n\nJones\u2019 extremism has had real world consequences. He\u2019s being sued for defamation by parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook school massacre after he falsely claimed the event as a put up job. Jones has since claimed he believes the shooting took place, but some have been forced into hiding or have had to move a number of times as a result of the response this provoked.\n\nThen there was his touting of the debunked \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory that linked Democrats and Washington DC restaurants with an alleged human trafficking and child sex-ring. He eventually issued an apology but not before a gunman had turned up at a DC area pizzeria where he fired three shots.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The contrast between the two is quite stark.\n\nChina represents the holy grail for America\u2019s corporate and sporting champions and no wonder. It\u2019s an enormous market that is only going to grow in importance as the years go by and is thus central to the strategies of those like the tech giants which hope to tap into it and keep their investors in the style to which they have become accustomed by so doing.\n\nBut conducting business there presents challenges given the nature of China\u2019s government and its willingness to play hardball with those that displease it in a way that\u2019s really quite rare.\n\nThe NBA has twisted in the wind on this. The tweet was deleted, apologies were made, and then rowed back upon. It still can\u2019t seem to work out quite how to respond in the wake of China suspending cooperation.\n\nSome companies have used the events to draw a distinction between their policies and those of companies like Blizzard.\n\nFortnite\u2019s creator Epic Games, for example, made clear that it will support its players if they choose to make political statements. If you want to speak out get on board the battle bus, I guess.\n\nThe more Hong Kong looks like it\u2019s going to end badly, the more these dilemmas are going to come to the fore, the more unflattering the light cast upon them.\n\nBut should they even be dilemmas? Not to put too fine a point on it but Apple\u2019s Tim Cook was among the signatories to the recent \u201cstatement of corporate purpose\u201d put up by America\u2019s business community.\n\nThis, in theory, moves companies beyond the idea that their sole purpose is to maximise profits for shareholders. It talks at length about \u201cstakeholders\u201d and \u201cethics\u201d.\n\nHow does one square ethics with some of the responses to what\u2019s going on in Hong Kong? Do these companies see the problem? If they don\u2019t then they\u2019re surely part of it. The water they find themselves in is only going to get hotter as the temperature rises in Hong Kong.", "description": "The China crisis facing American business extends far beyond the NBA, which has generated headlines for all the wrong reasons.
