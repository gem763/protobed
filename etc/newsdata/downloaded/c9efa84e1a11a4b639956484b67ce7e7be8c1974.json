So why is it locked up?", "language": "en", "text": "And as the Australian automotive industry declined, data revealed that younger individuals laid off by Mitsubishi did better than those who stayed on with other auto companies in the late 2000s. Such insights help design and target assistance programs.\n\nIn the United States, a more pro-active approach called Opportunity Insights produces high-quality evidence about inequality, upward mobility and public policy. Top researchers given access to government administrative data sets generate insights about poverty and inequality that improve lives.\n\nMaking administrative data similarly accessible in Australia could dramatically and rapidly deepen our understanding of issues and of what and how policies are working.\n\nAnalysis of administrative health data already benefits Australians. There needs to be a similar approach to childcare, education, employment, welfare, taxation and business assistance.\n\nWhy is it that Australia, unlike Denmark and other successful developed economies, makes little administrative data available to researchers? In part, it is because of reasonable concerns about privacy. These concerns can be mitigated through careful procedures, like de-identifying data and vetting research and researchers.\n\nThere is also a more problematic reason for the inaccessibility of administrative data in Australia. Engagement with the data by qualified and impartial researchers will likely reveal that many of Australia\u2019s public policies fail to meet their objectives. Such findings will embarrass governments and bureaucrats. But they would improve outcomes for all Australians by reallocating taxpayer funds to policies that work and reducing government waste.\n\nIs it possible to have the analysis done by experts within the government without engaging the wider research community? Possibly, but there are reasons why this is a problem.\n\nFirst, in-house analysis is expensive. Making administrative data available to researchers increases policy-relevant research at low cost. In Denmark, an explosion of quality research on tax, education, immigration and policy followed the sharing of government administrative data, with little or no financial burden on the Danish government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, academic researchers are subject to more rigorous and accurate standards than government researchers. High-quality analysts employed by governments are often capable of excellent analysis, but the breadth of expertise in academia, the incentives academics face, and the scholarly process of peer review encourage high-quality work.\n\nThird, bureaucratic analysis is not transparent. In the absence of public oversight, politicians and administrators can and will claim that programs are working. Giving researchers access to administrative data provides a check on government.\n\nSir Michael Barber famously established the \u2018Delivery Unit\u2019 for Tony Blair\u2019s UK government in the early 2000s. The unit, which required all facets of government to test the quality of policy implementation against the policy\u2019s stated aims, was extremely successful and replicated elsewhere, including Australia.\n\nBut politicians, bureaucrats and administrators soon learned to game the system. Sir Michael today advocates data outside a government\u2019s control as the best defence of good policy.\n\nAnd, if recent empirical evidence is correct and as much as 80 per cent of government interventions fail to achieve their intended outcomes, such data is the best defence against bad policy.\n\nTransparent, accountable, crowd sourced policy evaluation from the research community will raise awareness of how hard it is to design and implement effective policies.\n\nWe know Australians want better governance \u2013 in the last decade, the trust in political processes has collapsed. Widespread access to the insights of administrative data will improve policy processes, with large and sustained benefits to Australian society.", "description": "Crunching official data could help us find out which policies are working.
