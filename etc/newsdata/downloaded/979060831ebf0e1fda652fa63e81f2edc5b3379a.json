Some of our Crew remained on the island and their care and safety is our highest priority. We are in regular contact with island leadership, who is making sure our Crew is well taken care of in our storm shelter, which is designed for these types of situations and has restrooms, power and is well stocked with food and water. Castaway Cay remains south of the more significant weather and is currently experiencing tropical storm force winds, which based on the current forecast, are expected for the next several hours before gradually diminishing. Our thoughts are with the people in areas of The Bahamas that are being impacted by this storm and we stand ready to contribute to recovery efforts.\n\nHoly s*it. Castaway Cay was \u201cjust south of the eyewall\u201d:\n\nDisney's Castaway Cay cruise resort is just south of the eyewall of #Dorian, surely they've evacuated but the island is probably getting a pounding. pic.twitter.com/i3gwLHFnbZ \u2014 Mike Clay (@Mike_Clay) September 1, 2019\n\nTwitter user Meg Green, wose sister is reportedly is one of the people left on the island, says Disney promised to evacuate everyone:\n\n\u201cSome of our crew remained on the island\u201d because you LEFT THEM. They were stuck and had faith in being evacuated. Families had faith, but you did nothing to get them off. @DisneyCruise pic.twitter.com/k4OVSmRD79 \u2014 Meg Green (@dm_meg) September 2, 2019\n\nMy sister is stuck in the middle of a cat 5 hurricane.
