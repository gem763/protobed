The same did not apply to female offspring, say the international team.\n\nCorresponding author Dr Miriam Melis, of Cagliari University in Monserrato, said exposure to the drug in the womb may fuel risk-taking behaviors in teenage boys.\n\nWhen developing rats were exposed to THC, weed's active ingredient, in the womb, their brains made excess dopamine, which could raise their risks for addiction - but it only held true for males, Cagliari University scientists found\n\nCannabis is the most widely used drug by women at reproductive age - and not just for recreational purposes. Up to one-in-seven take it during pregnancy.\n\nAs legal access grows it has been increasingly used to treat morning sickness and anxiety.\n\nBut doctors or other medical staff seldom advise about the risks faced by mothers-to-be.\n\nThe effect on neurons was similar to those previously identified in offspring exposed in the womb to cocaine or alcohol.\n\n'As physicians caution pregnant women against alcohol and cocaine intake because of their detrimental effects to the fetus, based on our findings, it's our recommendation they also advise them on the consequences of the use of cannabis during pregnancy,' said Dr Melis.\n\nLarge numbers of children are set to be exposed to its ingredients in the coming decades - before they are born.\n\nThis will happen if the potential risks of maternal use continue to be under-estimated and legalization policies move forward.\n\nRats are commonly used in research to model the effect of cannabis in humans.\n\n'The present findings are critically important for unmasking and highlighting extensive neuro-biological maladaptations that increase the vulnerability of at-risk offspring to neuro-psychiatric disorders,' said Dr Melis.\n\nPrevious research has shown babies born to mothers who took cannabis while they were pregnant go on to experience problems with physical activity.\n\nChemicals called cannabinoids can be transferred from the mother to the offspring through the placental blood.\n\nIn the study published in Nature Neuroscience pregnant rats were given daily injections of a quantity of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) equivalent to low doses in humans.\n\nWhen the male offspring were confronted with an unstable bridge during pre-adolescence they were more likely to attempt the crossing than females - or unexposed peers.\n\n'They were more prone to cross the bridge and displayed a markedly impaired evaluation of risk assessment,' said Dr Melis.\n\nIt's a problem seen in many psychiatric diseases. Scans also showed dopamine in the VTA (ventral tegmental area) which is involved in reward and motivation, were hyperactive.\n\nThis is an area of the brain known to be involved in reward and motivation, explained Dr Melis.\n\nShe added: 'Such persistently enhanced excitability of VTA dopamine neurons is a well-established neuro-developmental risk factor conferring vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.\n\n'This might manifest in difficulties in learning and reward processing, and provides an interpretative framework for clinical studies reporting maladaptive behaviours ranging from affective dysregulation to psychosis and addiction vulnerability in the offspring of mothers using cannabis during pregnancy.'\n\nHer team was able to correct the behavioral and neural changes by treating the adolescent rats with pregnenolone.\n\nThis is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration currently undergoing clinical trials for cannabis abuse, schizophrenia, autism and depression.", "description": "A Cagliari University study in rats found that when males were exposed to THC, weed's psychoactive ingredient, their brains made excess dopamine, which is linked to risky behavior and addiction.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19712712-0-image-a-17_1571091470462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
