The White House refused requests for disputed information in those probes, and the battles are now bogged down in the courts.\n\nRepublicans are now pulling a page from that playbook in hopes of smothering the impeachment inquiry arising from Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine before it gains any more steam.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA number of rank-and-file Democrats have warned that a long-drawn-out impeachment investigation carries risks for the party in a high-stakes election cycle when they\u2019re trying to protect dozens of vulnerable incumbents. And Republicans clearly see an advantage to running out the clock.\n\n\u201cIt forces Democrats to be open and deliberate about their intentions, rather than what they\u2019re doing now \u2014 which is sort of a disguised, half-hearted and unauthorized inquiry with no rules, guidelines or many members actually on record,\u201d said one senior GOP aide.\n\nAfter the administration told a top diplomat, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, to not appear for a Tuesday deposition, Capitol Hill Republicans pressed the White House to block all future witnesses to the Ukraine affair unless Democrats release the full transcript of last week\u2019s deposition of Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerThe Hill's Morning Report - Bipartisan uproar over Trump's Syria move Democrats set to grill ambassador embroiled in Ukraine controversy A dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal MORE, Trump\u2019s former envoy to Kiev.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for bringing the ambassador in,\u201d Rep.

The same three House committees \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs \u2014 that summoned Volker and Sondland are scheduled to conduct her deposition.\n\nState Department officials have not said they\u2019ll block Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony, but Republicans in Congress have made clear they see Volker\u2019s closed-door testimony as an exoneration of any presidential wrongdoing, and they\u2019re urging the administration to refuse to send new witnesses unless Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffOvernight Defense: Trump defends Turkey amid fierce criticism | Senators demand briefing on Syria decision | Turkey confirms strikes on Syrian border | White House says it won't cooperate on impeachment inquiry Trump fires back on impeachment Democrats subpoena Sondland for testimony, documents MORE (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, releases the transcript of Volker\u2019s deposition.\n\n\u201cWe would sure like to see the Volker testimony released before we continue the depositions and transcribed interviews,\u201d Rep.

Pelosi resisted impeachment throughout much of 2019, largely because she feared it would hurt such members.\n\nRepublicans appear to hope that by dragging out the process, they can plant seeds of doubts with the public about impeachment \u2014 and make vulnerable Democrats all the more nervous about the path forward.\n\nDemocrats have indicated they want to move forward quickly with an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhile they\u2019re still delivering subpoenas \u2014 including one issued Tuesday seeking Sondland\u2019s testimony \u2014 Democrats have all but abandoned efforts to challenge the administration\u2019s recalcitrance in the courts. Instead, they\u2019re treating that refusal to cooperate as evidence that the White House is obstructing a congressional investigation \u2014 an impeachable offense, in the eyes of many Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress, a co-equal branch of government,\u201d Schiff told reporters in the Capitol Tuesday, shortly after Sondland canceled his appearance.\n\nPelosi, for her part, said Tuesday there\u2019s no deadline for the Democrats\u2019 investigations \u2014 and no guarantees their impeachment inquiry will lead to impeachment articles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having an inquiry; we\u2019ll see where it takes us,\u201d she said during an event in Seattle. \u201cIf it takes us to that place, at that time the determination will be made as to what they are.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are no strangers to high-profile investigations into prominent figures across the aisle.

The whole country, he said, is \u201cbeing held hostage\u201d by liberal activists who have it in for the president.\n\n\u201cSo if we sound like we\u2019re pissed as we stand here, it\u2019s because we are,\u201d Zeldin said in the Capitol on Tuesday, flanked by Meadows, Gaetz and Reps.
