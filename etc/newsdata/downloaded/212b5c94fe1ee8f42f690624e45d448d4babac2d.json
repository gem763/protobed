Earlier this year, the record was broken once again by the $120 million sale of The Manor, a sprawling estate built for the late TV producer Aaron Spelling.\n\n\n\n\u201cChartwell will beat that,\u201d according to Mr. Hyland, referring to the opulent estate that was made famous as the set of the 1960s TV series \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsking $195 million, Chartwell had been Los Angeles\u2019s most expensive home on the market, until this listing. When Chartwell first came on the market in 2018, it had a $245 million price tag.\n\n\n\nThe Bel Air home sits on more than eight acres Simon Berlyn\n\nAnother home that had once been asking as much as $250 million recently found a buyer for around $94 million, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, demonstrating that discounts are often necessary to secure a sale for these nine-figure homes.\n\n\n\nMr. Hyland predicts that the sale of Casa Encantada will be the \u201cultimate record.\u201d\n\n\n\nNestled above the Bel Air Country Club, the property\u2019s history is replete with well-to-do ownership.\n\n\n\nThe trophy home was built in 1938 for Hilda Weber, the widow of a multimillionaire glass manufacturer. Weber commissioned architect James E. Dolena\u2014famed for his work building lavish Los Angeles homes, including Walt Disney\u2019s Carolwood Estate\u2014for the project.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Rare Whiskey Remains World\u2019s Best-Performing Luxury Asset\n\nIn 1950, Weber sold Casa Encantada to hotel magnate Conrad Hilton for $225,000, and following Hilton\u2019s death in 1979, it changed hands once more, selling to billionaire businessman David Murdock for $12.4 million, a U.S. record at the time, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\n\nThe estate was acquired by its current owner, financier Gary Winnick, in 2000 for $94 million, property records show, a figure that was reportedly another nationwide record at the time.\n\n\n\nMr. Winnick, 72\u2014who declined to comment on the listing\u2014and his wife, Karen, brought in architect and designer Peter Marino, who alongside a team of 250 craftsmen, spent more than two years restoring the estate to a \u201cmuseum-quality,\u201d according to a news release.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an entry hall with 18-foot-high ceilings, a pool house with a professional screening room and formal bar, a tennis court, a basketball court, Koi ponds and a guest house, the release said.\n\n\n\nThe house will not be hitting the public market.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going on the MLS; it doesn\u2019t need to be,\u201d Mr. Hyland said. \u201cEveryone who needs to know about it, will know about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Times first reported the listing.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120937?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
