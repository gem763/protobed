Emmanuel Letlotlo worked his way through the ranks of the top-flight club, but his star faded almost as quickly as it rose. After a mere five matches he was booted from the senior team.\n\nNow the 23-year-old striker is clubless\u2013 yet it\u2019s not his future in football that\u2019s the talk of the town. Emmanuel is at the centre of a messy child maintenance battle. Two women, one the mother of twins he\u2019s never made time to meet, are demanding he pay papgeld for the kids he fathered. He\u2019s a deadbeat dad, his baby mamas say. Ntombi Gama says, \u201che has money to party and go clubbing, wear designer clothes, but he can\u2019t maintain\u201d their four-year-old daughter.\n\nNeo Lebogo claims Emmanuel has not laid eyes on their two-year-old twins despite repeated promises to meet the little boy and girl. \u201cI\u2019m tired of protecting his reputation,\u201d she says. \u201cHe needs to own up to his responsibilities.\u201d The fed-up mothers have taken the fallen football star to court, but he says legal action \u201cdoesn\u2019t scare\u201d him.\n\nHe admits he\u2019s struggling to support his children but recently took to social media to announce that his fianc\u00e9e, Arantxa Maarman, is pregnant. \u201cChildren are a blessing, the more the merrier,\u201d he tells DRUM. Emmanuel says Ntombi (21) and Neo (23) are just bitter because he\u2019s found love with his new baby mama. \u201cThose two are crazy, especially Ntombi,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cShe speaks to me like I\u2019m her child. They need to come clean that they\u2019re jealous that I moved on and I\u2019m happy.\u201d The striker says he can\u2019t do anything about being unemployed. When his contract with the Glamour Boys ended, he had no means of supporting his kids.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not trying to make ends meet. I just don\u2019t have a team yet. I\u2019m waiting to start somewhere else very soon. What do they want me to do, go work at Pick n Pay? Never.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s had lots of free time since Amakhosi cut him loose but hasn\u2019t visited his young children because he fears their mothers. \u201cWhat if they poison my food or drug me when I go see the kids? No, I\u2019m not going there. If they want me to see the kids, they must drop them off at my parents\u2019 house.\u201d\n\nBoth women have reached out to Emmanuel\u2019s family for help. \u201cHis grandmother is the one who advised me to take him to court if he\u2019s not stepping up as a father,\u201d Ntombi says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bad-mouth them, but he does as he pleases.\u201d\n\nShe met Emmanuel when she was in Grade 8 at the high school they both attended. \u201cTo think that guy was my first love.\u201d For a while they were happy, but she noticed changes in their relationship when she became pregnant.\n\nStill, Ntombi was shocked when she found out her high school sweetheart had been unfaithful. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the money that changed him. He was unapologetic about his cheating, so I let him be.\u201d\n\nHis serial cheating continued into her pregnancy; she says. \u201cWhen I gave birth, he put money in my mother\u2019s account when it suited him. I would nag him that I need money for his child, and he would ignore my messages.\u201d\n\nNtombi, a makeup and beauty student at The Pyramid Beauty School, relies on her street-hawker mother to help raise her child. She hasn\u2019t received a cent in child support since April. \u201cI depend on my mom\u2019s money to take me to school, pay my bills and take care of his child,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s draining me.\u201d\n\nNtombi ended things with Emmanuel in 2016 when she found out he was dating Neo. \u201cNeo contacted me on Facebook telling me to stay away from her man and I did because I was tired of the cheating. He also confessed to being with her and I let them be. I don\u2019t want a relationship with him,\u201d she says.\n\nShe just wants what\u2019s due to her daughter. Neo understands Ntombi\u2019s battle. It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s hauling Emmanuel to court over child maintenance, having squared off with the football player in August 2017.\n\n\u201cHe told the court he could afford R4 000, but he gives me R2 000 when he feels like it. I haven\u2019t received anything for the past six months,\u201d she says.\n\nNeo, a clerk at a pharmaceutical company, gets up at 4am to get the twins ready for preschool at 7am. \u201cMy dad drops them off at cr\u00e8che and I have to have a nanny ready after cr\u00e8che. Those expenses are covered by me and my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy expenses are about R11 000 a month, I earn a little less than that. My parents have to help me out and that\u2019s not fair on them.\u201d\n\nNeo\u2019s mother works as a receptionist at a pharmaceutical company and her father is retired.\n\n\u201cImagine my father having to spend his retirement money on me instead of enjoying it,\u201d she fumes.\n\nShe met Emmanuel in 2015 on social media after she added him as a friend on Facebook. \u201cWithin an hour he sent me an inbox asking for my number. I wasn\u2019t a groupie, so I was sceptical. I didn\u2019t know if it was him or a fake account.\u201d\n\nThey carried on chatting on social media and she fell for him when they arranged to meet up. \u201cHe was my type of a guy, kind and giving. He spoilt me. He took me to Cubana for our first date and we spent the night together.\u201d\n\nThings were rosy for about six months. \u201cI found out he was cheating with many girls. But he\u2019d apologise and I would try to make it work.\u201d\n\nEight months into their relationship, Neo became pregnant. \u201cHe changed even more when I was pregnant,\u201d she says. \u201cHe would disappear for weeks and not call to check up on me.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave him in January this year because I realised the cheating would never stop. I was getting calls from different girls telling me to stay away from him. So, for the health of my kids, I stayed away.\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t seen Emmanuel since. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle to get him to see the kids, pay maintenance or make an effort to call.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there when his children were born,\u201d Neo continues. \u201cHe\u2019s never seen the twins; they don\u2019t know him or his Kaizer Chiefs money and they\u2019re already two years old.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel tells us his children know he\u2019s their father. \u201cI know when my kids grow up they\u2019ll come and find me without their mothers stalking me on social media.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s blocked both Ntombi and Neo on social media. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way they speak to me and nag me. I want to provide for the kids but I\u2019m not working. What should I do?\u201d But Ntombi is tired of putting up with the once-promising player\u2019s excuses. \u201cHow is any other soccer team supposed to take him seriously when he has such a bad reputation of not supporting his own children?\u201d", "description": "Footballer Emmanuel Letlotlo\u2019s baby mamas say he hasn\u2019t been taking care of his kids - so they\u2019re taking him to court.", "authors": ["Qhama Dayile"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9521/59f4d3084b564e6cbe7a9a5dfa6161ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
