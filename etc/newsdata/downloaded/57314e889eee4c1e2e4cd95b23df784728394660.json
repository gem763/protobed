But Pence declined to directly answer many of the questions he was asked. Most notably, he repeatedly declined to say whether he we even aware of Trump\u2019s interest in getting Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s walk through it.\n\nQ: Were you ever aware of President Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure President Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate the Biden family? PENCE: First of all, let\u2019s be very clear that President Zelensky said there was no pressure. I think his words were, \u2018No one pushed.\u2019 And a clear reading of the transcript shows that there was no quid pro quo in the president\u2019s call with President Zelenksy. Q: Were you ever aware? PENCE: The American people should read the transcript, and they\u2019d do well to do that since the chairman of the intelligence committee manufactured a version of the transcript and read it into the record before the committee.\n\nHere, Pence is quibbling with how the question is framed, suggesting that the idea that Trump applied \u201cpressure\u201d on Zelensky is inaccurate. That may strain credulity \u2014 Zelensky saying he felt no pressure is hardly dispositive, given he\u2019s trying to mind his relationship with Trump, and the rough transcript is highly suggestive of pressure, to say the least \u2014 but at least here you could argue Pence is avoiding the question because he disagrees with the premise.\n\nAD\n\nThat excuse will not hold as the questioning progresses.\n\nSkipping ahead a bit:\n\nQ: Were you ever aware, Mr. Vice President, of the interest in the Bidens, the interest in investigating the Bidens was at least, in part, the reason the aid to Ukraine [was] being held up? Were you ever aware? PENCE: I never discussed the issue of the Bidens with President Zelensky.\n\nThat was not the question \u2014 not even close.\n\nQ: But within the administration, were you ever aware? PENCE: What I can tell you is, all of our discussions internally, between the president and our team, and our contacts and my office with Ukraine, were entirely focused on the broader issues of the lack of European support and corruption.\n\nAgain, almost completely ignoring the question. Pence says the administration was \u201centirely focused\u201d on corruption, which one could read as him saying this wasn\u2019t really about Biden. But Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to push for the those specific investigations were well known as of months before Pence met with Zelensky. If Pence didn\u2019t know this was about Biden, you could certainly argue he was being willfully ignorant.\n\nAD\n\nSo let\u2019s try this again:\n\nQ: But you were aware of the interest in the Bidens being investigated and that being tied to aid to Ukraine being held up? PENCE: That\u2019s your question. Let me be very clear: The issue of aid and our efforts with regard to Ukraine, were from my experience no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people have about corruption that took place, about things that happened in the 2016 election ... or about the issue that former Vice President Biden had his son on the board of a major energy company in Ukraine at a time that Vice President Biden was running the United States\u2019 efforts in Ukraine. I think the American people have a right to know what was going on. And, but all of our discussions, all of my discussions, with the leadership in Ukraine was entirely focused on President Trump\u2019s priority --\n\nIn saying, \u201cThat\u2019s your question,\u201d Pence practically admits he\u2019s not about to directly answer it. Politicians often do this, saying reporters are entitled to ask the questions they want, but that they can then answer it however they want. We also have the right, though, to point out when they are repeatedly avoiding the question.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Pence does get around to offering something of an answer, he says military aid to Ukraine wasn\u2019t tied to corruption issues \u2014 whatever you understand \u201ccorruption\u201d to mean \u2014 and adds \u201cfrom my experience.\u201d The \u201cfrom my experience\u2019 caveat is significant, but even the claim doesn\u2019t really hold water.\n\nTrump himself has suggested, in fact, that the money was held up because of corruption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supporting a country; we want to make sure that country is honest,\u201d Trump said shortly after this story took off. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? \u2026 So it\u2019s very important that, on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgain, skipping ahead a bit:\n\nQ: But the president himself has said he wants a foreign country to investigate his rival. Is that okay with you? PENCE: I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case. Q: He said it. PENCE: And again, I know that\u2019s the way Chairman Schiff characterized it in his manufactured version of the transcript, but the American people should read the transcript and they will see that the president did nothing wrong, there was no pressure, there was no quid pro quo. The president simply raised issues of importance and interest to the American people.\n\nHowever you feel about Schiff\u2019s exaggerated summary of that July 25 phone call (which Schiff admitted was exaggerated before he said it), Trump did ask a foreign country to investigate his potential rival. He told Zelensky that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nBut spinning this is one thing; avoiding talking about what he knew and when is quite another. You could make an argument that Pence had to have known that this was really about the Bidens and about Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories involving the Russia investigation\u2019s origins, because Giuliani and Trump had made that pretty clear. But the fact that he can\u2019t just come out and say that he was or wasn\u2019t aware of Trump\u2019s true interest suggests he knows he\u2019s in a tough spot here.\n\nAnd it\u2019s difficult not to read this as him at least understanding exactly what \u201ccorruption\u201d meant to Trump.\n\nAD", "description": "A reporter pressed Pence hard on what he knew about Trump's Ukraine maneuvers.
