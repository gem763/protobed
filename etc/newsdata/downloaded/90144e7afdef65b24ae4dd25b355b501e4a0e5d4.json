In low-lying Charleston, the water was knee-high in some streets, though by late afternoon, Shannon F. Scaff, the director of emergency management, said that the city of 136,000 had largely avoided major catastrophe.\n\n\u201cWe got hit more than we have in other storms, but anybody familiar with Charleston would probably agree that we got very fortunate yet again,\u201d Mr. Scaff said.\n\n[The storm\u2019s death toll in the Bahamas rose to at least 30. Read the latest. ]\n\nThe hurricane was downgraded to Category 1 early Friday. But farther north, where the hurricane\u2019s bands were just starting to be felt, there was lingering concern over winds that reached 90 miles per hour, as well as a kind of war-weariness for a region still rebuilding from last year\u2019s Hurricane Florence.", "description": "After assaulting the Bahamas and skirting past Florida, the sprawling storm began sweeping north through the Carolinas.", "authors": ["Richard Fausset", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/us/05dorian-carolinas01/05dorian-carolinas01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
