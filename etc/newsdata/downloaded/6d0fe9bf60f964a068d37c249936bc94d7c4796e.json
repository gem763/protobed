In the comments, several people explained this is because alopecia patients are often assumed to be cancer patients.\n\nRead more: Zoella filmed her smear test for a YouTube video to encourage women to attend their cervical screenings\n\nMontross addressed this in another video, where she said she's always getting stared at and asked by strangers whether she has cancer.\n\nIn the hundreds of comments on her TikTok videos, both people with alopecia themselves or those who know someone with it praise Montross for her candid attitude.\n\nOthers are simply there for Montross' humor, and compliment her on how much she suits being bald, and how not having to shave body hair is \"goals\" and pretty enviable.\n\n\"Wait free food?\" one person wrote. \"I think we are getting married.\"\n\nMontross, who started losing her hair at 5 years old according to the Mail, clearly doesn't see having no hair as a downside, and rarely posts on TikTok and her Instagram page in wigs. It looks like she'd rather embrace her natural self, even if that means constantly applying suntan lotion, as she notes in one video.\n\nInsider has reached out to Montross for comment.", "description": "Hayden Montross, who has 147,000 TikTok followers, ran through the advantages of dating a bald girl in a candid, comedic video.", "authors": ["Lindsay Dodgson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6cfd2b21214c7fe55bd5e5-1920-960.jpg"}
