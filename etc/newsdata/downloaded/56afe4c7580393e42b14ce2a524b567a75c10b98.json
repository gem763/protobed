It features a set of wide-opening barn doors\n\nMazda fans can look forward to a new electric car called MX-30 \u2013 with wide-opening barn doors - costing just under \u00a330,000 after a \u00a33,500 green subsidy.\n\nOrder books for a well-stocked First Edition model open in the UK next Spring with first deliveries in February 2021.\n\nIt features a 35.5kW battery and has a range of up to 130 miles \u2013 more than enough for the average commute, says Mazda which is on track to sell 40,000 cars in total in the UK this year, including the ever popular two-seater MX-5 sports car.\n\nMazda UK boss Jeremy Thompson said: \u2019The electric car segment is growing very rapidly. It\u2019s a silent revolution. And 2020 will be the year it really takes off.\u2019\n\nSuzuki Waku Sport\n\nAt the press of a button, the Suzuki Waku Sport extends from a city car to an estate with a big boot\n\nSmall car specialists Suzuki have excelled themselves with this quirky transformer car called the Waku Sport.\n\nAt the push of a special \u2018Waku Waku\u2019 button, the plug-in hybrid City coupe turns itself into an estate as a rear section rises out of the boot to create more storage space.\n\nThe cute car takes its name from a Japanese expression that evokes excitement and great delight. In English it loosely translates to \u2018Surprise, Surprise.\u2019\n\nThe Waku Sport draws inspiration from the 1967 Suzuki Fronte 360 and promises families \u2018fun and excitement across generations'.\n\nSuzuki\u2019s Hanare, meanwhile, is described as an \u2018autonomous mobile room\u2019 on wheels and is inspired by the 1969 Suzuki Carry.\n\nHonda Jazz\n\nThe Honda Jazz is a big favourite among Britons. This is the latest model with a fresher look\n\nHonda\u2019s next generation Jazz supermini \u2013 the firm\u2019s top UK seller \u2013 will be available only as a two-motor petrol-electric electric hybrids.\n\nSales in the UK and Europe of the new fourth generation Jazz \u2013 sold as the Fit in Japan \u2013 begin in the middle of next year.\n\nThe new car will concentrate on comfort with new seats and improved visibility thanks to thinner pillars, says the Japanese car-maker.\n\nHonda said: \u2019The new Jazz will introduce the efficiency benefits and performance of hybrid power to the mass market and accelerate Honda towards achieving its ambition of all its European mainstream models to feature electrified powertrains by 2022.'\n\nIt will be the first model in Honda\u2019s European line-up to wear the new \u2018e:HEV\u2019 powertrain badging, standing for \u2018hybrid electric vehicle\u2019.\n\nA new Crosstar crossover variant features increased ride height, a unique front grille design, water-resistant upholstery and integrated roof rails.\n\nNissan DayZ Highway Star\n\nRay Massey pictured with the Nissan DayZ Highway Star Kei car in Tokyo\n\nHome grown in Japan, and rarely exported, are really cute fuel-efficient small engined vehicles called Kei Cars, meaning lightweight.\n\nAll of the Japanese car-makers produce them including the Nissan DayZ Highway Star (with which I am pictured) and they come in all manner of weird and wonderful designs \u2013 often boxy.\n\nPowered by 660cc motors and loved by youngsters as a first car and drivers of more mature years as a cheap and cheerful runaround, owners pay only half the rate of road tax compared to a conventional car. No wonder they account for around a third of annual car sales in the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nSadly they rarely come to Britain.\n\nBut that may change as Nissan showed off a new electric K-Car called IMk \u2013 featuring the new Nissan styling. But bosses say that with electric drive, it\u2019s much smoother and faster than the sometimes huffing and puffing petrol-driven version.\n\nToyota Yaris\n\nToyota will bring a new Yaris to the UK, with a hybrid version expected to dominate sales\n\nToyota has previewed its 2020 Yaris supermini \u2013 including a hybrid version \u2013 with UK deliveries starting next Autumn.\n\nThe rival to the Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Corsa will come with a hybrid 1.5 litre petrol engine linked to a lithium ion battery pack and a continuously variable - or CVT - transmission.\n\nCustomers can also choose a 1.5-litre non-hybrid petrol engine with a six-speed manual or CVT gearbox, or a frugal 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol.\n\nTokyo also marked the debut of a new all-electric Toyota LQ prototype hatchback, the second generation Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuelled electric car, and an electric Lexus.", "description": "The event is the main stage for Japanese car makers to show off their latest new models - and a few quirky concepts they promise to release at a later date.
