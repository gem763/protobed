The officer gave the driver a ticket for driving without a license but continued to detain the individual until the ICE agent took over custody.\n\nFairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler lamented the incident and said the officer is being disciplined.\n\n\u201cThis is an unfortunate issue where the officer was confused,\u201d the police chief said, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWe have trained on this issue a lot. This is the first time we\u2019ve had a lapse in judgment, and the officer is being punished.\u201d\n\nThe officer has been relieved of all law-enforcement duties pending an internal investigation.\n\n\u201cOur police officer violated our longstanding policy and deprived a person of their freedom, which is unacceptable,\u201d Roessler added in a statement. \u201cOur county is one of the most diverse counties in the nation and no one should have the perception that FCPD is acting as a civil immigration agent for ICE. This matter damages our reputation and the longstanding policy that I have stated many times that our officers shall not act as immigration agents.\u201d\n\nThe police department said ICE informed them that the driver was released after three hours with an ankle monitor.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The Fairfax County Police Department has suspended an officer for detaining and turning the driver in an accident over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday in violation of the department's policy not to assist ICE with civil enforcement.The driver lacked a Virginia driver's license", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N6gN3NeuJ5Nu9VnERB5.NA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/RTSY4J3.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1"}
