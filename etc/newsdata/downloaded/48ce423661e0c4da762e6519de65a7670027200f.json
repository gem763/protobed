This is why some councils charge for this as it's not a universal service.\"\n\n'Value for money'\n\nGardeners served by Harlow Council in Essex face the highest charges at \u00a396 a year followed by Adur and Worthing Councils in West Sussex at \u00a385 and the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire at \u00a378.\n\nCouncillor Danny Purton, the portfolio holder for environment at Harlow Council, said residents were able to book a collection in advance from \"as little as 95p per bag\", or sign up to the year-round wheelie bin service.\n\nHe said: \"Although the wheelie bin service is more expensive, it has proven to be popular.\n\n\"We expect the cost of the service to reduce as more people use the service.\"\n\nAcross the UK\n\nIn Northern Ireland, none of the 11 local authorities charge for the service.\n\nIn Wales, more than half do not ask residents to foot the bill, and in Scotland, more than three-quarters do not charge.\n\nEleven local authorities in the UK do not provide regular collections of garden waste.\n\nMore about this story\n\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.
