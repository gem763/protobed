Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \"It's embarrassing to us as a nation -- all over the world, they're talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison. It's true.\" pic.twitter.com/hHiK5Of9wi \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 28, 2019\n\nTrump also lashed out at Supt. Eddie Johnson of the Chicago Police Department for skipping Trump\u2019s first appearance in the city as president.\n\n\u201cMore than anyone else he should be here, because maybe he could maybe learn something,\u201d Trump said, claiming Johnson puts the needs of illegal immigrants above the needs of the law-abiding residents of Chicago.\n\n\u201cThose are his values, and frankly those values to me are a disgrace,\u201d Trump said, vowing to never to give priority to the needs of illegal immigrants. \u201cI want Eddie Johnson to change his values and to change them fast.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Police Department had no immediate comment on Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to skip Trump\u2019s address angered the city\u2019s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, which said in a Facebook post that \u201csuch a gesture would be an insult to both President Trump and the office of the presidency itself and would be a mark of disgrace upon the city throughout the entire nation, including Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\u201d Lightfoot has also refused to meet with Trump while he is in the city.\n\nFOP Lodge 7, which represents rank-and-file Chicago police officers, announced that it had cast a vote of no confidence in Johnson.\n\nThe vote might please Trump, who has told police officers in his speeches not to treat crime suspects so gently and was cheered at last year\u2019s gathering of the same police chiefs\u2019 organization in Orlando, Fla., when he advocated the use of the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing tactic that has been deemed unconstitutional.\n\nThe president\u2019s visit comes with more than 25,000 members of the Chicago Teachers Union on strike. The strike began Oct. 17.\n\nAt the conference, Trump signed an executive order creating a presidential commission on law enforcement to study issues like substance abuse, homelessness and mental illness, the White House said. The order calls for establishing a framework for better training, recruiting and retaining law enforcement officers.\n\nThe president also announced that the Justice Department will begin a stronger crackdown on violent crime in the United States, targeting gang members and drug traffickers in high-crime areas. \u201cLet\u2019s call it the surge,\u201d Trump said.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, is under internal investigation after he was found sleeping in a city-owned vehicle earlier this month. Lightfoot said the superintendent, who called for the investigation, told her he had \u201ca couple of drinks with dinner\u201d before he fell asleep at a stop sign while driving home. Johnson blamed the episode on a change in his blood-pressure medication.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Trump is scheduled to headline a campaign luncheon that\u2019s set to raise approximately $4 million for a joint fundraising committee benefiting Trump\u2019s re-election effort and the Republican National Committee, according to the GOP.\n\nTrump last visited Chicago in March 2016 as a candidate for president for what was supposed to be a campaign rally on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago. But after fights broke out between supporters and protesters awaiting his arrival at the arena, Trump canceled the event.\n\nTrump said then that he had consulted with Chicago police before making the decision. But the city\u2019s top cop at the time, John Escalante, as interim superintendent, disputed Trump\u2019s characterization.", "description": "Trump ripped Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for not coming to the event and claimed, \u2018all over the world they\u2019re talking about Chicago.
