The complaint refers to those alleged moves as an effort to \u201clock down\u201d information.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cover-up,\u201d Pelosi told reporters during her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill. \u201cWhatever other explanation there might be, an explanation is also that it is a cover-up.\u201d\n\nRelated: Whistleblower alleges Trump White House moved records onto separate network\n\nShe also said that Trump \u201chas been engaged in a cover-up all along,\u201d referring to his maneuvers around Deutsche Bank documents that House Democrats have sought and other matters.\n\nIn addition, Pelosi on Thursday criticized the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who on Thursday testified to lawmakers that a whistleblower \u201cdid the right thing\u201d in filing a complaint that alleges Trump sought foreign interference in the U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cI think what the DNI did was broke the law,\u201d she said, referring to how Maguire went to the White House first and delayed conveying the whistleblower complaint to lawmakers who oversee intelligence agencies.\n\nPelosi also aimed to frame her recent efforts as measured rather than rushed.\n\n\u201cThere are some in our caucus who think, \u2018Let\u2019s just have an impeachment.\u2019 No, we have to have an inquiry to further establish the facts,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cThere is no rush to judgment.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talked tough on Thursday regarding the impeachment inquiry that she launched earlier this week.", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR678_pelosi_ZG_20190919152126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
