WaPo\u2019s posted at 8:04 p.m. and NYT\u2019s at 8:05 p.m.\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cWhistleblower complaint about President Trump involves Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter,\u201d by Ellen Nakashima, Shane Harris, Greg Miller and Carol Leonnig: \u201cA whistleblower complaint about President Trump made by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter, which has set off a struggle between Congress and the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a \u2018promise\u2019 that Trump made, which was so alarming that a U.S. intelligence official who had worked at the White House went to the inspector general of the intelligence community, two former U.S. officials said.\n\n\u201cTwo and a half weeks before the complaint was filed, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and political newcomer who was elected in a landslide in May.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- NYT's story, by Julian Barnes, Nick Fandos, Mike Schmidt and Matthew Rosenberg: \u201cWhile the allegation remains shrouded in mystery, it involves at least one instance of Mr. Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader and includes other actions, according to interviews. At least part of the allegation deals with Ukraine, two people familiar with it said.\u201d\n\nTHEN \u2026 RUDY GIULIANI went on Chris Cuomo\u2019s CNN show Thursday night, and Twitter exploded. Asked whether he asked Ukraine to look into Joe Biden, Giuliani first said he didn\u2019t, then reversed himself within seconds and said: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d More from Kyle Cheney \u2026 The epic video\n\nGIULIANI on Twitter, at 7:54 p.m.: \u201cA President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job. Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn\u2019t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.\u201d\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S BOB COSTA (@costareports): \u201cChecked in w/ Giuliani a few mins before midnight. Said he hasn't spoken w/ Trump since Cuomo. But expects to see him Fri. Said his tweet doesn't confirm anything but \u2018only that if he did do it, it'd be appropriate.\u2019 Declined to discuss timing of last convo w/ POTUS on Ukraine.\u201d\n\nCUOMO to RUDY: \u201cYou who, my whole lifetime, stood up for one single ideal when you were at your best, and that was character counts and leadership.\u201d\n\n-- FLASHBACK \u2026 NYT, OCT. 25, 1994: \u201cGIULIANI, DEFYING HIS PARTY, BACKS CUOMO FOR 4TH TERM; SEES PATAKI AS BAD FOR CITY\u201d (hat tip: Maggie Haberman)\n\nMAYBE IT\u2019S JUST SO SIMPLE \u2026 WAPO EDITORIAL, from Sept. 5: \u201c[W]e\u2019re reliably told that the president has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help with his presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- NYT, AUG. 21, by Ken Vogel in D.C. and Andrew Kramer in Kyiv: \u201cGiuliani Renews Push for Ukraine to Investigate Trump\u2019s Political Opponents\u201d\n\nTHE QUESTION EVERYONE IS ASKING: What do Democrats do here? The intelligence community has balked at providing the whistleblower report, and Rep. ADAM SCHIFF (D-Calif.) has threatened a lawsuit. His threat\n\nTHIS IS POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE. If Trump did in fact say he would release military aid if Ukraine dished dirt on Biden, that would be huge. How do Democrats prove it, though? Robert Mueller issued a several-hundred-page report that he essentially dumped in Congress\u2019 lap, and so far they\u2019ve declined to impeach the president based on its findings. What should make us think these Ukraine revelations will change the political dynamic?\n\nGood Friday morning.\n\nA message from Softbank: America is where the world's innovation happens, and SoftBank is helping that innovation come to life.

And he\u2019s been almost completely silent. Burgess Everett: \u201cThe Senate surrenders legislating on guns to Trump\u201d: Sen. Johnny Isakson: \u201cFirst time ever in history when the president sets the agenda every day when he tweets at 4 in the morning.\u201d\n\n-- DEMOCRATS are having trouble conducting oversight because the White House has succeeded in dictating the terms under which they can do it -- without repercussion. The White House has blocked material witnesses. And the witnesses they can\u2019t block come to Capitol Hill and don\u2019t talk.\n\n-- DEMOCRATS decline to impeach the president because, in part, they\u2019re worried about a sliver of members of Congress who have slivers of their constituencies who might or might not be offended by impeachment proceedings.\n\n-- WHEN REPORTERS ask White House aides for information about policy, they are often hamstrung because a) they either have no idea what the president is thinking, or b) they are waiting for him to make his view public on Twitter.\n\nON GUNS \u2026 NYT\u2019S ANNIE KARNI and MAGGIE HABERMAN in a White House Memo on A19: \u201cBut idling in neutral is not something the president is doing only on guns. In discussions with his staff, Mr. Trump has made clear he wants to accomplish something big, but seems stymied as to what it might be, according to interviews with a half-dozen aides and advisers. In the meantime, he has remained on the sidelines as divisive issues are debated and is treading water even on possible staff changes he wants to make, for fear of how things \u2018play.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON\u2019T PUSH BACK AGAINST TRUMP \u2026 WAPO: \u201cTrump officials considering plan to divert billions of dollars in additional funds for border barrier,\u201d by Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey: \u201cSenior Trump administration officials are considering a plan to again divert billions of dollars in military funding to pay for border barrier construction next year, a way to circumvent congressional opposition to putting more taxpayer money toward the president\u2019s signature project, according to three administration officials.\n\n\u201cThe president has pledged to complete nearly 500 miles of new barrier by the 2020 election \u2014 stirring chants of \u2018Build the Wall!\u2019 at his campaign rallies. But that construction goal will require a total of $18.4 billion in funding through 2020, far more than the administration has publicly disclosed, the administration\u2019s latest internal projections show.\n\n\u201cPlanning documents obtained by The Washington Post show the cost of building 509 miles of barriers averages out to more than $36 million per mile. The documents also show that the government would need to obtain \u2014 either by eminent-domain claims or purchases \u2014 land that lies under nearly 200 miles of proposed barrier.\u201d WaPo\n\nTRADE BLINK \u2026 BLOOMBERG\u2019S JENNY LEONARD (@jendeben): \u201cGil Kaplan, undersecretary for international trade at the Commerce Department, resigned today, sources tell me. He was a key figure in enforcing trade rules for the Trump administration and was involved in negotiations for a trade deal with China.\u201d Tweet\n\nWAPO\u2019S TRACY JAN and JEFF STEIN: \u201cHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson expressed concern about \u2018big, hairy men\u2019 trying to infiltrate women\u2019s homeless shelters during an internal meeting, according to three people present who interpreted the remarks as an attack on transgender women.\n\n\u201cWhile visiting HUD\u2019s San Francisco office this week, Carson also lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, two of the agency staffers said. Carson\u2019s remarks visibly shocked and upset many of the roughly 50 HUD staffers who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting, and prompted at least one woman to walk out in protest, the staffers said.\u201d WaPo\n\nJARED\u2019S BUDDY MBS THE REFORMER \u2026 FT: \u201cSaudi Arabia \u2018bullies\u2019 wealthy families to pump cash into oil IPO,\u201d by David Sheppard in London, Simeon Kerr in Dubai and Anjli Raval in Abu Dhabi: \u201cSaudi Arabia is pressuring wealthy families to buy in to the initial public offering of its state oil company, as part of a plan to achieve the $2tn valuation coveted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\u201cFour of the sources said the aim was to \u2018strong arm\u2019, \u2018coerce\u2019 or \u2018bully\u2019 some of the wealthiest families in the kingdom to become cornerstone investors in what has been billed as the world\u2019s biggest ever IPO.\n\n\u201cMany of the families targeted had members previously imprisoned in Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2017 and 2018, in what the government billed as a crackdown on corruption. Some of the detainees said they were tortured, according to people aware of the matter. Most were later freed after they reached financial settlements with the state.\u201d FT\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Even small changes in the criteria could have far-reaching effects: When the DNC set its thresholds at 65,000 donors or 1 percent in polls earlier this year, 20 candidates made the stage.\n\n\u201cBut merely increasing the polling threshold to 2 percent in four DNC-approved surveys, and doubling the donor threshold, capped the September debate at one night. Even a modest increase for November could spell the end of several campaigns that are just hanging on to the debate stage, and while we know the criteria are likely to keep going up, no one knows exactly how it will affect the 2020 field. And in a nationalized presidential election, the debates have proven to be the most important opportunity for candidates to introduce themselves to large audiences and try to change the direction of their campaigns.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- DANIEL STRAUSS: \u201cPete Buttigieg's presidential campaign has hired a black engagement director to improve the mayor's standing among African American voters in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cAngela M. Angel, a former state legislator in Maryland, will take charge of the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s outreach to black voters. So far, Buttigieg has sought to do so by touting his Douglass Plan, a set of proposals aimed at fighting systemic racism and helping black Americans. But Buttigieg's polling numbers among African Americans have remained low.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND \u2026 IOWA CATTLE CALL, via NATASHA KORECKI: It\u2019s a serious 2020 cattle call this weekend in Iowa, where Polk County Democrats have ordered more than 10,500 steaks for the annual Steak Fry -- one of Iowa\u2019s biggest political events. Polk County Democrats have taken on the tradition started by former Sen. Tom Harkin, and this year they\u2019re about to match a record number of ticket sales with 11,900 as of late Thursday, according to the Polk County Democrats. The biggest ever was 12,000 tickets in 2007, when Barack Obama theatrically paraded into the event alongside a marching band and an army of supporters.\n\nTHIS YEAR, EIGHT CANDIDATES will make a big production of marching into the event with a massive group of supporters around them. Two of the campaigns will be accompanied by ice cream trucks, and there will be three flying drones, including one from C-SPAN, capturing the marches by video. Biden and Buttigieg were neck-and-neck in ticket purchases, but Biden folks, we hear, made sure they won out, topping the field with 1,800. Buttigieg ended up with 1,500 and Kamala Harris with 1,200.\n\nTHE INTERESTING DETOUR is Elizabeth Warren, who arguably has the best-organized campaign in the state, but made the decision to buy 750 tickets and is not doing a march, according to local Democrats.\n\n-- MORE FROM NATASHA: \u201cIowa Dems pitch holding caucuses in factories, group homes\u201d: \u201cIowa Democrats want to create satellite locations for their 2020 presidential caucuses in places as varied as group homes and factories, as they try to make the contest more accessible. A new proposal from the state party, made public Thursday, aims to expand the caucus sites and accommodate those who are unable to show up to their local precincts on Feb. 3, 2020 \u2014 voters like shift workers, people with disabilities, military personnel and students.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, caucus-goers must turn up in person to their local precinct in order to take part in the event, which can often take several hours. Those interested in holding a satellite caucus would have to submit an application to a review committee, which would make a determination.\n\n\u201cThe proposal, which must still go before a Democratic National Committee panel, came after the DNC scrapped Iowa\u2019s earlier plan for telephone-based \u2018virtual caucuses,\u2019 amid security concerns.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- ANDREW YANG VISITS POLITICO: \u201cYang dishes on why Trump won, Asian jokes and how he'll \u2018shock the world,\u2019\u201d by Eugene Daniels \u2026 The video \u2026 (Best part: \u201cWait, are you Zach Montellaro?\u201d)\n\n-- BETO UNPLUGGED: \u201cO\u2019Rourke rips Schumer for doing \u2018absolutely nothing\u2019 on guns,\u201d by David Siders in Aurora, Colo.\n\nSTEPHANIE MURRAY in Boston: \u201cWarren gets caught in Senate primary crossfire\u201d: \u201cWhen Elizabeth Warren needed a glowing introduction to her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, her former law school student, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, was there to provide it. When she needed someone to introduce her to the teeming crowd when she launched her presidential campaign earlier this year, Kennedy once again was the choice.\n\n\u201cYet as Kennedy embarks on the biggest race of his career, a primary challenge to Sen. Ed Markey next year, Warren won\u2019t be returning the favor. In a contest that will force the Massachusetts political class to choose sides, Warren has endorsed Markey.

Any decision may depend on what kind of evidence the U.S. and Saudi investigators are able to provide proving that the cruise missile and drone strike was launched by Iran, as a number of officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have asserted.\u201d AP\n\nDONORS SAY THE DARNEDEST THINGS \u2026 A BIDEN POOL REPORT from Tina Sfondeles of the Chicago Sun-Times: \u201cAt the first of three Chicago fundraisers, Joe Biden stopped by a luncheon at the residence of billionaire real estate and casino magnate Neil Bluhm, also co-hosted by GCM Grosvenor CEO Michael Sacks \u2014 who was not present due to a death in the family \u2014 and real estate developer Elzie Higginbottom. The fundraiser was in a sprawling 65th floor residence full of original art, including a Lichtenstein in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cBiden was introduced by Bluhm, who told his high-profile guests that both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2018don\u2019t represent the Democratic Party\u2019 that he supports.
