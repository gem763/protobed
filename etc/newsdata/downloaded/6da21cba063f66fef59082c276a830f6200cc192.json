The militant Extinction Rebellion\u2014which the online magazine Spiked has described as \u201can upper-middle-class death cult\u201d\u2014has tried to disrupt commuters in Britain in their drive to \u201csave the planet\u201d but has earned more angry contempt than support from harried workers. Though cast by the media as heroic outsiders, greens have historically clustered in elite academic, nonprofit, media, and corporate sectors. The influential Limits to Growth, published in 1972 by the Club of Rome, was backed by major corporate interests, led by Fiat\u2019s Aurelio Peccei. The authors\u2019 long-term vision, based on the notion that the planet was running out of resources at a rapid rate, was to create \u201ca carefully controlled balance\u201d that would restrict growth, particularly in advanced countries.\n\nWhatever its failings, twentieth-century socialism was growth-oriented and in principle devoted to expanding working-class wealth. In contrast, the green version of socialism consciously seeks to depress the average family\u2019s prospects, since prosperity will generate more greenhouse gases. Some zealots, such as the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot, argue in favor of economic recession as a way to reduce carbon emissions, even if it causes people to lose their jobs and homes.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joel Kotkin", "City-Journal.Org Radical-Green-Movement"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
