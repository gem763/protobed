That\u2019s a turnabout from late last week, when the cancellation of farm visits by Chinese officials were taken as a sign talks were not going well, noted Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late Monday told Fox Business Network that U.S.-China trade talks would resume in two weeks in Washington and said that deputy-level negotiations between the two countries had made some progress.\n\nBeijing granted new tariff waivers to Chinese companies to buy soybeans and China bought about 600,000 metric tons Monday, following a similar purchase made earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. Brexit drama took another twist on Tuesday after the country\u2019s top court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was illegal.
