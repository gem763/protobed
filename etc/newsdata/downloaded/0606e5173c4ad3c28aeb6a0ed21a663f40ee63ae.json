We can\u2019t turn back the clock and start over.\n\nThe issue is that however we got here, we still face serious challenges in delivering a competitive and sustainable broadband market in Australia, which is fundamental to Australia\u2019s productivity and future.\n\nThe key concern is that by approaching enterprise customers direct, NBN Co is moving outside its wholesale-only mandate.\n\nFirst, we are lagging behind other countries when it comes to overall broadband experience and affordability, unlike the mobile market which, operating freely, consistently rates as one of the world\u2019s best.\n\nSecond, the high cost of the NBN means industry economics are challenged. An industry that operates on zero margins is simply unsustainable. Unless resellers push retail prices up materially higher, they will not stay in business - and higher retail prices can hardly be good for Australia.\n\nThird, the original mandate for the NBN was that it would be a wholesale provider only and would not discriminate between retail service providers. The industry is not complaining about NBN Co serving the enterprise market. Indeed we are partnering with the NBN to help deliver improved services to some of our enterprise customers. The industry\u2019s key concern is simply that by also approaching enterprise customers direct, NBN Co is moving outside its wholesale-only mandate. In parallel, we and the industry do question whether NBN Co diverting resources to overbuild existing enterprise infrastructure is a productive use of resources, particularly when the consumer rollout is not complete, with a large number of households yet to be connected.\n\nLastly, an unintended consequence of the high cost of the NBN is that it is making alternative technologies more attractive. In highly competitive markets such as the US where there is no NBN, carriers are investing heavily in technologies such as 5G fixed wireless as alternatives to fixed broadband.\n\nThe higher we push wholesale prices in Australia, the more these technologies will proliferate among carriers seeking to avoid the cost of using the NBN. Clearly, moving traffic off the NBN will in turn make NBN\u2019s economics even more challenging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am the first to acknowledge that there are no easy answers to these challenges. A reduction in NBN\u2019s wholesale charges is needed to generate a healthy and competitive market for resellers, as without this it is hard to see how they can survive financially. However, a reduction in its charges will clearly make it very hard for NBN to achieve its financial objectives, which obviously is also not a desirable outcome.\n\nI said in my speech that it is now in all our interests that the NBN succeeds; I also said that we respect and support NBN management, which has a tough task on its hands. I stated that we collectively need to find ways to overcome these challenges and to make Australia\u2019s broadband infrastructure and service experience for consumers as good as possible, at as low a price as possible.\n\nAchieving this requires everyone involved - government, industry and the NBN - to take off their partisan hats for a moment and collectively sit down to try to agree some solutions.", "description": "Coverage remains patchy, its economics are challenged, and rival technologies look attractive.
