The passage of the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) through parliament was automatically paused as a result \u2013 throwing into disarray the government\u2019s stated aim of an orderly Brexit by 31 October.\n\nPlay Video 2:24 'The house has refused to be bounced': MPs react to Johnson's Brexit defeat \u2013 video\n\nThe European council president, Donald Tusk, quickly suggested he would recommend the EU27 accede to the three-month delay that Johnson was previously forced by MPs to request. The prime minister and his aides will have to decide whether to seek an election \u2013 in line with a threat he made earlier in the day, which was ignored \u2013 or to draw up plans for a longer debate. Johnson may be swayed to allow more time for debate because of the larger-than-expected majority of 30 the government won for the deal in principle. But there is still his insistence that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than accept a further delay.

The veteran diplomat said that soon after taking up his posting in Kyiv he became concerned \u201cour relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of US policymaking, and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons\u201d. Democrats are calling Taylor\u2019s testimony the clearest account to date of Trump\u2019s abuse of office in the Ukraine scandal. Taylor flew to Washington to testify in defiance of a gag attempt by the Trump administration.\n\nMidweek catch-up\n\n> The presidents of Russia and Turkey have agreed on a proposed Turkish-administered \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria. It is a blow to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who are being told to pull back 18 miles from their positions on the border before Turkish and Russian soldiers begin joint patrols.\n\n> China is reportedly planning to replace Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam with an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive but wants pro-democracy protests to die down first. Speculation over Lam\u2019s future came as the man whose murder case prompted the extradition bill that set off months of protests was released from prison.\n\n> Mark Zuckerberg will tell Congress today he is willing to delay the launch of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency venture Libra amid growing pushback from legislators and the pullout of major payment companies like Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and Visa.\n\n> After Canada\u2019s federal election, rival party leaders have begun laying out their conditions to support Justin Trudeau as head of a minority government. Vying for a slice of power are the cash-strapped New Democratic party and the nominally separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\n> Deliveroo\u2019s highest paid director, understood to be the co-founder Will Shu, received a near 57% increase in basic pay and \u00a38.3m in share options last year, despite widening losses at the food delivery firm.\n\nHeart pills better at night \u2013 Taking blood pressure medication at bedtime rather than on waking halves the risk of events such as heart attack and stroke, a major study has revealed. Professor Ram\u00f3n Hermida, first author of the study from the University of Vigo in Spain, said the effect was thought to be down to the bodily processes varying over a 24-hour period, meaning the same drug can have vastly different effects at different times. Separately, doctors in the US have launched a clinical trial to see whether exposure to flickering lights and low-frequency sounds can slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Animal tests have shown that exposure to light and sound waves at 40Hz appears to boost the activity of the brain\u2019s immune cells that remove defective proteins. And a US company has revived its previously shelved experimental Alzheimer\u2019s therapy, known as aducanumab, claiming that in high doses it helps slow patients\u2019 decline in cognitive ability and activities.\n\nCabs make electric switch \u2013 London is to get its first fully electric black cabs since 1899. They didn\u2019t take off back then, when most cabs were horse-drawn. Now, the Dynamo, a taxi converted from a Nissan electric van in a Coventry factory, will help drivers in \u201cdoing their bit to improve our filthy air\u201d, says the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats are pushing for a legally binding \u201cduty of care\u201d on environmental and social issues for companies. It would prevent them selling goods from deforested areas and force them to investigate their overseas supply chains for exploitative practices such as modern slavery and the use of child labour.\n\nMissing a culinary trick \u2013 More than 8m pumpkins comprising over 18,000 tonnes of edible pumpkin flesh will go in Britain\u2019s bins this Halloween. The environmental charity Hubbub said: \u201cIt\u2019s all too easy for people to forget that Halloween pumpkins are still food. When they are only used for carving this contributes to the \u00a315bn of food waste in UK homes every year.\u201d Britain\u2019s first commercially brewed beer made from pumpkin flesh that would otherwise go to waste will go on sale at the end of November. Toast Ale, a social enterprise, will brew the Belgian-style pumpkin dubbel.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Fox and Trump \u2013 a parting?\n\nLuke O\u2019Neil on whether things are starting to sour in the powerful relationship between Donald Trump and his favourite TV network.

The mind games are well and truly on in Tokyo, with England coach Eddie Jones claiming his team were spied on as they prepared for the clash with New Zealand. In Champions League football, Raheem Sterling bagged a second-half hat-trick as Manchester City crushed Atalanta 5-0. Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed an equally facile win over Red Star Belgrade, but Barney Ronay writes the opposition was so poor it\u2019s difficult to get too excited with the performance. Back to the Rugby World Cup, and Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards says his side must be ready for a blowtorch of speed from South Africa in their semi-final.\n\nBusiness\n\nAsian stock markets have followed Wall Street lower after major companies reported mixed earnings and Donald Tusk said he would recommend that the EU grant a delay to Brexit. Benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong all declined. The US share retreat was led by a tech sell-off as investors weighed mixed earnings from McDonald\u2019s, Procter & Gamble and other big companies. The pound has been trading around $1.284 and \u20ac1.156 while the FTSE is tracking ever so slightly lower ahead of the open.\n\nThe papers\n\nMost of today\u2019s papers \u2013 whose fronts pages you can see here \u2013 blame parliament for the latest sting in the Brexit tale. \u201cBrexit is in purgatory,\u201d says the Telegraph, with later versions of the story saying the PM has \u201cput Britain on a general election footing\u201d after Tuesday\u2019s setback.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Wednesday 23 October 2019.\n\nThe Guardian says MPs blocked Johnson\u2019s timetable even after he threatened to pull the bill and call for a general election.
