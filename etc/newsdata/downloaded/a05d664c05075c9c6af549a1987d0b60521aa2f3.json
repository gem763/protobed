Not so in The Lighthouse. In fact, the future Batman tugged himself off with such vigor, such frenzied commitment, it charmed his director.\n\n\u201cOn day one we shot Rob masturbating in the shed\u2014it\u2019s the very first thing we shot\u2014and Rob really, really went for it,\u201d the film\u2019s director, Robert Eggers, recalls. \u201cAnd you know, it was inspiring.\u201d\n\nSet in the 19th century and shot in stunning, boxy black-and-white, The Lighthouse tells the tale of two lighthouse keepers, grizzled vet Thomas (Willem Dafoe, in full Ahab mode) and green Ephraim (Pattinson), whose isolation, combined with a plethora of potent booze, drives them to madness.\n\nDefoe, whom Eggers calls \u201cone of his heroes,\u201d reached out to the filmmaker after seeing his Puritan horror movie The Witch, keen to work on a project together\u2014as did Pattinson, whose involvement came with one major caveat: \u201cI\u2019m only interested in things that are weird.\u201d\n\nAnd weird this is.\n\nTheirs is akin to a master-slave relationship, and as Thomas\u2019 treatment of Ephraim worsens, and as more booze spilleth, the young charge\u2019s hallucinatory visions become more and more intense\u2014as do his masturbation fantasies. According to Eggers, the film was meant to include \u201ca very juvenile shot of a lighthouse moving like an erect penis and a match-cut to an actual erect penis\u201d belonging to Pattinson\u2019s character, but the financiers demanded that it be cut for ratings purposes.\n\nYet that pales in comparison to what actually made it into the film. In what may be the most bonkers movie sex sequence of the year (sorry, Midsommar), the lonely laborer imagines that his pocket-sized mermaid carving has come to slithery life (played by Valeriia Karaman), beckoning him on the beach, waves crashing all around her.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the southern tip of Nova Scotia in March or April, it\u2019s gale-force winds, and you\u2019re getting sprayed in the face with a firehose, it\u2019s cold\u2014to put it mildly,\u201d says a chuckling Eggers.\n\nEphraim approaches, and as he does, the mermaid spreads her tail to reveal, well, an elaborate mermaid vagina. The seaman mounts her, and starts pumping away in the sand; all the while, a series of grotesquely beautiful images flash onscreen, from slippery tentacles to the aforementioned mermaid parts in extreme close-up.\n\n\u201cIt was very pre-planned and storyboarded,\u201d says Eggers. \u201cThe design of the mermaid\u2019s genitals\u2014based on shark labias\u2014was all planned out, and what we call the \u2018seafood salad\u2019 shots, or the writhing tentacles and fish, those were tricky to figure out on the day.\u201d\n\nThe mermaid labia was constructed entirely out of silicone, and the mention of it causes Eggers to offer up a rather detailed backstory. \u201cThe mermaid on the Starbucks cup that has two tails is based on an early mermaid design. Medieval and Renaissance mermaids were always split so that these anima figures of male fantasy could perform their role that had been unfairly thrust upon them by their male imaginers,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut no surprise that in the Victorian Era, they closed the mermaids up and made them impenetrable. So that single-tail mermaid silhouette has become the archetypal mermaid look for people today, and also what a mermaid would have looked like in the period of the movie.\u201d\n\nHe pauses. \u201cBut we still had to figure out how mermaids can copulate and create more mermaids. So, we studied shark genitals.\u201d\n\nThe Lighthouse\u2019s trippy mermaid-sex sequence was shot in less than a day\u2014they shot the entire film in 35 days, after all\u2014and a memory of it has been immortalized in Eggers\u2019 iPhone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a behind-the-scenes photo on my phone of Rob and Valeriia in blankets in-between takes smoking their Juuls,\u201d he concedes with a laugh.", "description": "Robert Eggers (\u201cThe Witch\u201d) opens up to Marlow Stern about his brilliant new film \u201cThe Lighthouse,\u201d and that batshit-insane mermaid sequence.
