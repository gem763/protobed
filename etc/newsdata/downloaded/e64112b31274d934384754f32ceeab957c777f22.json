And yet it was true.\n\n\"I was fascinated by the themes of brotherhood, the blurring of fact and fiction, memory and the question of who we are if we lose our memory.\"\n\nAlex Lewis was involved in a motorcycle incident in 1982 at the age of 18 that left him only remembering his name, where he was and his brother, Marcus.\n\nRelying on his twin brother for guidance on everything, with Marcus helping him to understand their own family dynamics in comparison to what the media and culture tell him is normal.\n\n(Image: NETFLIX)\n\nHowever, as time passes, Alex begins to see that the dynamics are not normal: Alex and Marcus live in a shed but are forbidden to enter the main house, their mother is in denial, and their father is a cold figure.\n\nThe truth became much clearer for Alex following the death of their mother when Alex came across a photograph in her belongings of the brothers as young boys, their faces cut off and their bodies naked from the neck down.\n\nIt was then that Marcus confirmed they were abused in their childhoods to him but didn't tell him anymore.\n\nOn his mother's death, Marcus says in the film: \"I felt nothing. I didn't feel any guilt for feeling nothing. I didn't feel sad, I didn't feel relieved, I just felt nothing.\"\n\n(Image: NETFLIX)\n\nMarcus' decision to keep the details from his brother was - from his perspective - a means of protecting his brother from the trauma and also repressing his own.\n\nThe film forced the pair to confront the lies in emotional scenes in the documentary, with Marcus finally being honest with Alex and \"giving his brother what he really needed.\"\n\nWhile Alex revealed how he resented the silence on what happened in the past that came from Marcus, in return, Marcus revealed how they had been abused by their own mother and \"passed around\" amongst her acquaintances.\n\n(Image: NETFLIX)\n\nAfter so much tragedy and hardship, have the pair found the closure they craved?\n\nOn where the brothers are now, Perkins also revealed to TIME that the brothers \"live incredible and emotionally rich lives. They\u2019re amazing fathers and husbands. It\u2019s very inspiring for me to see people who have gone through more than you\u2019d wish on anybody and yet resolutely refuse to be defined as victims. I really hope audiences are left with a feeling of hopefulness.\"\n\nTell Me Who I Am is available now on Netflix.\n\nHave you watched Tell Me Who I Am on Netflix?
