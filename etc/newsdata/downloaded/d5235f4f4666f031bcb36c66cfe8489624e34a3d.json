Ministers have already announced the early May Bank Holiday will be moved from the 4th to the 8th to mark Britain\u2019s victory over the Nazis.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \u2018VE Day is a landmark day in our history.\n\n\u2018Extending licensing hours will pave the way for commemorative events across the UK, so we can pay tribute to the courage and determination of the millions who fought for our freedom or supported the war effort at home.\u2019\n\nMinisters are yet to reveal full plans for \u2018VEDay75\u2019, a series of commemorations which are expected to replicate the massive scale of the D-Day events earlier this year, as well as their power and emotion.\n\nClosing times have previously been extended to mark national occasions such as the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and the monarch\u2019s 90th birthday in 2016.\n\nLast orders were also extended for the 2014 World Cup and the Royal Weddings in 2011 and last year.\n\nThe extension of pub opening hours will be subject to a consultation with police, licensing authorities, veterans organisations and other groups before being finalised. It will also have to be debated in Parliament.\n\nA happy group marches down a street in London to celebrate VE day on May 8 1945\n\nAlthough licensing hours were reformed by the Labour government under Tony Blair in 2003 - allowing pubs and bars to open round the clock - many have stuck with the traditional 11pm closing time.\n\nThe Licensing Act allows the Home Secretary to make an across the board extension to opening hours on occasions of \u2018exceptional international, national or local significance\u2019.\n\nIn June, when ministers said the 2020 early May Bank Holiday would be shifted, calendar and diary manufacturers said the announcement had been made too late.\n\nMillions of items had already been printed with the wrong information.\n\nAndrew Bennett, managing director of Hertfordshire-based printer Allan & Bertram, said at the time: \u2018We\u2019re totally in agreement with changing the date. Just not changing it with 11 months notice, when you\u2019ve had 74 years to prepare for this event.\u2019", "description": "Drinkers will be given longer hours to raise a glass to Britain's war heroes when the country celebrates the 75th anniversary of VE Day on May 8.
