Yep, the 78-year-old broadcaster is such a legal liability that even his own station want to mute him.\n\nREAD MORE Absolute Dickhead Alan Jones Is On His Last Warning 'Coz Even His Boss Is Over His Shit\n\nA \u201cdump jockey\u201d is the term given to a panel operator who monitors and selectively mutes sections that could be offensive. So Alan Jones\u2019 show is just gonna be an hour of silence every day.\n\nThis would be the first time Jones has required a censor in his 30+ years on air.\n\nThe move comes after his recent comments about wanting to \u201cshove a sock\u201d down Prime Minister Ardern\u2019s throat.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that Jones\u2019 stupidity and apparent inability to just shut the fuck up sometimes has cost 2GB a whopping $4 million. It is unclear how he\u2019s managed to keep his job after costing the company that much money, but he\u2019s on his 495th \u201clast straw\u201d so who knows how long he\u2019ll keep the job.\n\nJones\u2019 team allegedly already has the power to trigger a seven second delay to prevent the airing of content that could get the station sued, but the switch wasn\u2019t used during his \u201csock\u201d comments. It is alleged that despite his team knowing how to use the function, they\u2019re all too close to Jones to actually silence him, the Daily Telegraph reports.\n\nAn internal investigation by 2GB was called after Jones\u2019 team failed to pull the switch during his controversial comments.\n\nIf the dump switch is insisted upon by upper management, Jones will be in good company with Kyle Sandilands, who apparently also cannot be trusted not to act like a total buffoon on live radio.\n\nJones still refers to himself as \u201cAustralia\u2019s most popular talkback presenter\u201d and \u201cAustralia\u2019s most influential and respected radio broadcaster\u201d on Twitter. Who needs to be a good person, or a good radio host when you can just have this much self-confidence oozing out of every orifice of your body?", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/20180803001356188765-original-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
