A body called the Magisterium holds a centuries-long dominion over the earthly realm. It spews doctrine; it crushes heresy; it circumscribes knowledge and inhibits discussion. Its priests are everywhere, like secret police. It\u2019s also stealing children.\n\nThis is English dissent, closer to 1984 than The Hobbit. An amped-up, totalitarian version of the Catholic Church is running the show, twisting your mind and smashing your dreams like Metallica\u2019s \u201cMaster of Puppets,\u201d and the stage is set for a good-versus-evil face-off between dogma/censorship and the heroic spirit of free inquiry.\n\nThe latter is represented by the swaggering Lord Asriel (James McAvoy), who bursts into the hushed scholarly precincts of Jordan College, Oxford, with a severed head in a cooler and some photographs that appear to suggest the existence of Dust\u2014a mysterious, elemental substance secreted by the universe in response to human consciousness.\n\nThe Magisterium abhors the idea of Dust; Dust interferes with the top-down distribution of celestial power. \u201cThis kind of heresy is of the highest priority to the Magisterium,\u201d hisses a hollow-eyed cleric to his snaky enforcer. \u201cI shall take it to the cardinal.\u201d \u201cYes, Father,\u201d says the snaky enforcer.\n\nHis Dark Materials is a kind of romance of unbelief. In the North, in the shimmering bands of the aurora borealis, reality becomes transparent; other worlds are glimpsed, worlds beyond the reach of the Magisterium. The North means knowledge, which is the story\u2019s glittering magnetic pole. Young Lyra, the foundling heroine with urchin tendencies, yearns instinctively to go there.\n\nIn Pullman\u2019s fiction, Lyra\u2019s choice is to travel, to investigate, to think freely\u2014or to have her spirit be mangled by the ghastly devices of the Magisterium. In the real world, our world, there is of course another Church: the Church of Francis of Assisi and Dorothy Day, of radical advocacy, of finding Jesus in dispossession, at the edge of society. But this Church, which has an energy quite as emancipated and revolutionary as anything Lyra will find in the North, is not the caricature that Pullman\u2019s romance requires.\n\nThe Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, Pullman\u2019s 2010 counterfactual retelling of the events of the Gospels, is for me a more fiercely imaginative encounter with Christianity, and a fairer fight. Here\u2019s Jesus, and Jesus is okay\u2014more than okay; he\u2019s a rebel and a trickster and an overturner, in love with the people, a proper republican in the Pullman sense of the word: instinctively fraternal and anti-institutional, spreading his rough-and-ready enlightenments across the horizontal axis.\n\nPullman\u2019s Jesus doesn\u2019t do miracles\u2014no magic here\u2014but he does change people. The paralyzed man is \u201cso strengthened and inspired by the atmosphere Jesus had created\u201d that he picks up his bed and walks. Jesus\u2019s words are hugely powerful, rendered by Pullman as if in a first-class idiomatic translation: \u201cThose who look at poverty and hunger without concern, and turn away with a laugh on their lips, will be cursed; they will have plenty to mourn about; they will weep for ever.\u201d", "description": "Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials, now an HBO series, puts anti-Church polemicizing ahead of plot.", "authors": ["James Parker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/09/CULT_Parker_HDM_lead/facebook.jpg?1569421057", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
