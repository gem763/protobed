Because they\u2019re doing it from behind.\n\n\u2018It is having an effect.\u2019\n\nAs the audience cackled, host Jeremy Vine took a while to pick up on Jason\u2019s phrasing and movements.\n\nJason Gardiner on Jeremy Vine (Picture: Channel 5)\n\n\u2018Alright, alright,\u2019 Jeremy said. \u2018I\u2019m so slow.\u2019\n\nAs the next guest prepared to speak, Jeremy interjected: \u2018Don\u2019t say anything more shocking than that.\u2019\n\nOffice for National Statistics data showed teenage pregnancy rates fell from 18.3 to 16.7 conceptions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17, between April 2019 and June last year in England.\n\nThe British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) didn\u2019t pin the decline on an abundance of anal sex, however, but instead on an awareness of contraception and a change in the lifestyles of young people.\n\nA BPAS spokeswoman, said: \u2018Over the last decade we have seen significant declines in levels of binge drinking among young people, and significant increases in the amount of socialising that takes place online rather than in person.\n\n\u2018Young people report spending a lot of time at home with their family rather than being out with their friends. This is also a generation that is acutely aware of the political and economic environment around them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are concerned that they may struggle to achieve the same financial stability as their parents\u2019 generation, and are focusing on their education and careers in order to do so.\u2019\n\nYou can catch Jeremy Vine on Channel 5 weekdays at 9.15am.\n\nMORE: Roxanne Pallett to appear on Jeremy Vine one year after Celebrity Big Brother punchgate\n\nMORE: Jeremy Vine defends Meghan Markle after Wimbledon criticism and \u2018holding baby Archie wrong\u2019", "description": "Jason Gardiner left the Jeremy Vine show slightly stunned with his comments.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jason-gardiner-new-ab9d_1571319625.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
