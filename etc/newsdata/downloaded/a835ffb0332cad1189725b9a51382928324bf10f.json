There\u2019s always been something there if you\u2019re bowling good areas for long enough, we\u2019ll see you get rewards.\n\n\u201c(It was) unfortunate that we weren\u2019t able to put together, you know, at least one more good partnership to get ourselves up a bit nearer the tally. Wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d\n\nFor Smith, the 80 was his lowest score in a series that has yielded 751 runs, more than double the output of England\u2019s Ben Stokes, the second highest run-scorer.\n\nThe uncharacteristic manner of the dismissal, trapped in front by a straight delivery by Chris Woakes, was viewed by British media as a ray of light for England as they push for a face-saving win and a drawn series.\n\nSmith later revealed he was battling a cold and had been loaded up with flu tablets.\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good at the crease, been struggling a bit today actually, got a bit of a flu,\u201d he said.\n\nEngland, who resume at nine for no loss later on Saturday, will not pray for his speedy recovery.", "description": "Such is Steve Smith's dominance during a stellar Ashes campaign, his dismissal for 80 on day two at The Oval was something of a triumph for England's dogged pacemen and a cause for celebration in the British media.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429665557&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D011", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
