The breakdowns led to them taking the lead and we weren\u2019t able to fight back.\u201d\n\nMontreal\u2019s first costly mistake came in the dying seconds of the first period.\n\nAfter Petry scored the opener on a one-timer on the power play at 15:46, Claude Julien\u2019s squad nearly took that 1-0 lead into the first intermission but intense pressure by Tampa Bay led to the equalizer.\n\nThe Canadiens (2-2-2) got caught in their own zone for a shift that lasted a lengthy 1:54. Exhausted and unable to change, the five players failed to clear the puck on multiple occasions before Braydon Coburn beat Carey Price over the shoulder with seven seconds on the clock.\n\n\u201cWe did a great job of hemming them in their zone,\u201d said captain Steven Stamkos, who leads Tampa with four goals. \u201cWe were the beneficiaries of getting on the ice against some tired players. We were able to get some fresh legs and we capitalized.\n\n\u201cAny time you give up a goal at the end of a period is a momentum killer. We were on the right side of that one tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Lightning rode that momentum into the second period, scoring twice in a 57-second span and forcing Montreal to make its second crucial error.\n\nAfter Stamkos made it 2-1 on the power play at 1:04, Ryan McDonagh caught the Canadiens on a slow line change with a stretch pass that led to Tyler Johnson\u2019s 3-1 goal at 2:01. The Lightning scored three times on their first 10 shots on Price, who stopped 19-of-22 shots in defeat.\n\n\u201cOur biggest problem since the beginning of the season is we\u2019re not playing 60 minutes,\u201d said Julien. \u201cWe need to correct that aspect of our game if we want to win more games.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t clear the zone for almost two minutes. That cost us on a goal. On the second one, it was a bad line change that hurt us. It\u2019s self-inflicted. Those are things we just can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nMontreal made no changes to the lineup that downed the defending Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues 6-3 on Saturday night at Bell Centre. The Canadiens came into the matchup with the league\u2019s fourth-best offence, scoring four goals per game.\n\nThe home side came out strong in the third period but Vasilevskiy turned away every offensive wave. Last year\u2019s Vezina Trophy winner made 14 saves in the third alone and improved to 8-1-2 in his career against Montreal.\n\n\u201cHe made some great saves,\u201d said defenceman Victor Hedman of the 25-year-old Vasilevskiy. \u201cHis reaction time, he\u2019s so quick in the net. Vasi is the best goalie in the world and he proved that again today.\u201d\n\nMontreal\u2019s 28th-ranked penalty killing continues to surrender goals - the one conceded to Stamkos was the seventh in six games this season. That goal came moments after Artturi Lehkonen hit the post at the other end.\n\nNOTES: Nikita Kucherov had two assists. \u2026 Jonathan Drouin\u2019s five-game point streak came to an end. \u2026 Montreal finished 1 for 5 with the man advantage. \u2026 The Lightning were 3-1-0 versus the Canadiens last season.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nLightning: At Boston on Thursday night to close out the road trip.\n\nCanadiens: host Minnesota on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two breakdowns by the Montreal Canadiens was all Andrei Vasilevskiy and Tampa Bay needed to secure victory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/lightning_canadiens_hockey_02429_c0-170-4615-2862_s1200x700.jpg?1dd8ac6a38b6098044faaf3bf9021451f84ad502", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
