Maybe, says M&S\n\nSuits you sir? Maybe it doesn\u2019t any more. Sales of formal tailoring have taken a fresh dive as chinos and trainers replace suits and ties in the office.\n\nIn a presentation to City analysts earlier this week, Marks & Spencer, the UK\u2019s biggest menswear retailer, said it was cutting back its formalwear ranges and the space devoted to selling suits, pointing to a market-wide 7% fall in suit sales.\n\nSales of ties are down by nearly 6% while blazers and formal jackets fell by 10% year on year, according to market analysts Kantar.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg may be hiding inside a giant ill-fitting suit, but the typical British man is not only unlikely to have to wear a jacket, tie and tailored trousers to the office but has also eased out of a suit for formal occasions.\n\nGoldman Sachs relaxes dress code for 'more casual environment' Read more\n\nCity banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, once bastions of sharp suits, have relaxed their dress-code to keep pace with rival employers such as tech giants Facebook and Apple, where the founders\u2019 famously casual attire has become the mark of a modern workplace.\n\nAccording to Kantar, more than \u00a3100m has been wiped off annual suit sales since 2015. British men spent \u00a3393m on suits in the year to the end of August and they paid an average of just \u00a3102 for each purchase.\n\nThe downturn has left high street suits specialists struggling. Moss Bros issued three profits warnings last year while Yorkshire-based menswear chain Greenwoods called in administrators earlier this year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Bond is synonymous with smart, natty tailoring, although recent incarnations have him dressed in \u2026 (cue collective gasp) \u2026 a cardigan.

They want to be more fashionable and have the opportunity to update their look which you can do more with casual wear.\u201d\n\nShe says younger men are more interested in fashion and more confident about choosing outfits, so less reliant on the safe uniform of a suit for work or occasions. Retailers such as Asos and other young fashion stores are also helping men put together more interesting formalwear outfits.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jacob Rees-Mogg models a lounging suit in the Commons.

He says men might buy a blazer, some smart shirts and a pair of tailored trousers and then combine them with jeans or knitwear to give a variety of looks suitable for both home and office. \u201cYou no longer need two wardrobes,\u201d Tooke adds.\n\n\u201cPeople say they want to show who they are by the way they dress and the suit potentially doesn\u2019t allow you to do that.\n\n\u201cThere are things it\u2019s still deemed you need to wear a suit for, but those events are becoming fewer and farther between,\u201d says Tooke.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Suits for work are going the same way as the bowler hat. Photograph: Michael Ayre/Alamy\n\nTo get more in tune with those trends, Marks & Spencer\u2019s menswear boss Wes Taylor told analysts this week that the retailer, which sells one in seven suits in the UK, would be cutting back the number of suits and formalwear options on sale by 14% while increasing leisurewear by 12%.\n\nIts a sad moment for the modern lounge suit \u2013 a short jacket and trousers of the same fabric \u2013 which first came to prominence in the 1860s. Popularised by the then Prince of Wales, over the ensuing decades it replaced the then traditional frock coat as the uniform for business wear and respectability.\n\nBy the 1950s and early 60s those in white collar jobs, such as banking, insurance or the legal profession were expected to wear a suit to work and even men who wore overalls or a uniform to work were likely to change into a suit to go out for the evening.\n\nThe suit has been in decline since then, according to Eric Musgrave, author of Sharp Suits, a history of mens\u2019 tailoring. He says that change has been exacerbated by the rise in popularity of the athleisure look.\n\nBut Musgrave says the suit still has a place \u2013 as signified by the all-prevailing presence of suits in politics and when world leaders meet. \u201cThe suit is still a signal you are respectable and powerful. It is the uniform of people who run the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Style leader David Beckham mixes and matches formal tailoring in the new more casual style. Photograph: Ricky Vigil M/GC Images\n\nThanks to wannabe world leaders, and many others who want to look smart, the UK suit market is still worth nearly \u00a3400m a year while sales of smart shirts and trousers are still on the rise.\n\nBrian Brick, chief executive of Moss Bros, says the chain\u2019s suit sales are up this year despite the overall fall in the market, with younger people still splashing out on a special suit for a special occasion. It\u2019s the everyday suit that is in the doldrums.\n\n\u201cThe replacement suit, which somebody is wearing for work, that part of the market is tougher,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are buying for the big moment.\u201d\n\nWhen they do buy for a big day, Brick says they are being more adventurous \u2013 looking for tweed or other interesting fabrics or a light coloured suit for a wedding.\n\n\u201cThe younger generation want something more fashionable and on-trend. We are talking about a new formal \u2013 a suit but worn differently.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nTaylor agrees, saying that M&S isn\u2019t ditching the suit but giving it a good tweak. \u201cMen now wear elements of a suit with more casual items such as rollnecks and trainers, and we need to be the go-to for these casual items that work alongside great blazers and trousers,\u201d he says.\n\nTeo van den Broeke, style and grooming director of menswear mag British GQ, thinks suits are far from dead \u2013 and might even be about to make a comeback, pointing to the menswear catwalks at Balenciaga and Gucci and the fashion choices of young actors such as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and influential older men such as David Beckham.\n\n\u201cThere is something to be said for a man in tailoring. It is much better on a date or a job interview than a track suit. No man over 18 looks good in that at any time.\u201d", "description": "UK\u2019s biggest suit seller is trimming its tailoring range as changing habits keep formal garb on the peg", "authors": ["Sarah Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d992298e0b7d9a43afdc50e0f22194ad97ea2b8e/0_0_7289_4374/master/7289.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61370285a9b26422b48b4f45f9737340", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
