They have widened into a pro-democracy movement and also an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world's most expensive real estate.\n\nThe unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nProtesters believe China has been eroding Hong Kong's freedoms, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nMinors arrested\n\nChina denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of protesters wearing face masks staged a peaceful march in Kowloon, with only a small group trashing shops and mainland China banks.\n\nThe government said petrol bombs were thrown into the entrance of the Kowloon Tong station and a Kowloon government office was set on fire.\n\n191011064812693\n\nRiot police were deployed to the streets but the demonstrators had dispersed without any major confrontation by late on Sunday night.\n\nThe Hong Kong government introduced colonial-era emergency laws last week to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.\n\nPolice have arrested more than 2,300 people since the protests began. Since September, nearly 40 percent of those arrested were under the age of 18 and a tenth were under 15, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe protesters also accuse police of using excessive force, claims they deny. Two protesters have been shot and wounded during the skirmishes over the past four months.", "description": "Rallies erupt in multiple districts with some protesters blocking roads, spraying graffiti on pro-China businesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/b4688e7cf17d413a9b461cb0edc1af9f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
