The Japanese Foreign Ministry refused to accept the complaint multiple times, leading to a delay in the court proceedings. The complaint and related documents are sent via diplomatic channels and must be delivered to the corresponding Japanese court before a civil lawsuit can begin in the Korean court.Due to the Japanese government refusing to accept the complaint for two years, the Seoul court turned to service by publication, posting the documents on the Korean Supreme Court website in March.The Seoul Central District Court announced that the civil suit was to be conducted via service by publication because the Japanese government refused to accept the hard copies of the case documents. It determined in May that the documents had been adequately conveyed to the Japanese government through this method.Finally, last Thursday, the court set Nov. 13 as the date for pleading. It is very unlikely that a representative of the Japanese government will attend, which could lead to a default judgement.Separately, the Seoul Central District Court is handling another case of 12 \u201ccomfort women\u201d victims, bringing the total damages being demanded to some 4.2 billion won.The comfort women issue is somewhat more complicated that other compensation issues related to Japan\u2019s colonial rule of Korea from 1910-45. The wartime sexual slavery issue was only brought to widespread attention since the early 1990s after survivors shared their stories publicly, and the Korean government has claimed that their individual rights to compensation were not covered under the 1965 claims agreement as the issue was not discussed during those negotiations. A ruling could also set a precedent as a lawsuit against a foreign government in a Korean court.While the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property was adopted in 2004 and provides for state immunity, giving a government protection from being sued in courts of other countries, it has yet to be put into force.A ruling could serve as a symbolic case if it recognizes that Japan needs to accept legal responsibility for its wartime crimes.Some analysts warn that the deterioration in bilateral relations between Seoul and Tokyo following the forced labor ruling needs to be taken into consideration.A landmark court decision in the sex slave issue came on Aug. 30, 2011, when Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that the government\u2019s inaction on the comfort women issue was unconstitutional.In December 2015, Seoul and Tokyo signed an agreement that was supposed to resolve the wartime sexual slavery issue \u201cfinally and irreversibly,\u201d which included an apology from Tokyo and a 1 billion yen ($9.2 billion) fund for the victims.The deal was criticized by victims and civic groups from the start, who complained that it failed to recognize Japan\u2019s legal responsibility for its wartime crimes. Since then, the Moon Jae-in administration has called the agreement \u201cflawed\u201d and also scrapped last November the Tokyo-funded Reconciliation and Healing Foundation created through the deal.Jin Chang-soo, head of the Japan Research Center at the Sejong Institute think tank in Seoul, said, \u201cAt the center of historical issues are apology, repentance and reconciliation, and judicial decisions do not determine some victory between Korea and Japan.\u201dHe added that both sides have been negligent in resolving historical issues diplomatically.BY LEE YU-JUNG, SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
