All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching,\" Trump wrote.\n\nPolitico congressional reporter Burgess Everett and NBC reporter Frank Thorp asked several GOP Senators for their reactions on the lynching comparison. Here's what they said:\n\nTrump's tweet was immediately denounced as inaccurate, ahistorical, and extremely racially insensitive.

This was not \"frontier justice\" carried out by a few marginalized vigilantes or extremists,\" the report explained. \"Instead, many African Americans who were never accused of any crime were tortured and murdered in front of picnicking spectators.\"\n\nThe first prominent Republican to back up Trump's remarks was Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said,\" African-Americans were lynched, other people have been lynched throughout history ... that's exactly what's going on in the US House of Representatives right now\".\n\nBut some congressional Republicans have denounced Trump's use of the term. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine wrote that \"lynching\" brings back images of a terrible time in our nation's history, and the President never should have made that comparison.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an occasional critic of Trump, wrote \"The painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and [Trump] should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump calls impeachment inquiry a 'lynching' as cracks emerge in Republican lawmakers' support for him\n\nLindsey Graham, one of Trump's staunchest GOP allies, called the president a 'handful' and suggested he may support impeachment if new evidence comes out\n\nTrump's 'red wall' against impeachment is looking less stable after 2 GOP senators said they were wavering.\n\nNOW WATCH: We asked a law professor about the likelihood of a Trump impeachment", "description": "\"I\u2019m from South Carolina, I understand it very well.
