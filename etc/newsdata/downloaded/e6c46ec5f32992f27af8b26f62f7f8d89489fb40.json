But in the final moments before gametime, as CNN\u2019s panelists discussed their expectations, David Axelrod made a narrower prediction. It would be a problem, he said, for Pete Buttigieg if the South Bend mayor didn\u2019t target Warren, after all the work he\u2019d been doing to preview that attack \u2014 most prominently debuting a new ad on Tuesday \u2014 in recent days.\n\nThe viewers who were watching Buttigieg closely knew exactly what Axelrod was talking about. Three hours later, the rest of the country has now also seen a punchier Buttigieg than ever before, as he makes a risky wager \u2014 a bet on a largely new campaign tack \u2014 that could define the trajectory of his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of the debate in suburban Columbus, Buttigieg clashed with Warren over the details of her Medicare for All support and her plan to pay for it. But he did not reserve his fire exclusively for Warren. He also disagreed vehemently with Tulsi Gabbard over Middle East policy, and ripped into Beto O\u2019Rourke over his position on an assault weapon buyback plan \u2014 perhaps the tensest exchange of the night (\u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or otherwise,\u201d the mayor said).\n\nIt was a break from the more mild-mannered Buttigieg voters had gotten to know over the first four debates, and over his first 10 months in the national eye. This candidate, eager to look like a truth teller and get in the mix as the bigger-name contenders wage ideological war, has sharper elbows than the version who\u2019s quietly been building up his Iowa operation in recent months. It\u2019s all part of a bet he\u2019s making that drawing these kinds of stark contrasts now \u2014 just as more voters tune into the race, and just as Warren surges \u2014 can position him to be an alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters, or that it can at least vault him from the floor of the race\u2019s top tier, alongside Kamala Harris, to somewhere in the vicinity of Bernie Sanders\u2019s third place status.\n\nBut his gambit is far from straightforward.\n\nBy turning a fight with Warren into one of his centerpiece moments in the national eye, Buttigieg is also gambling that undecided voters now actually want to see this kind of disagreement, even after the last three candidates to try and make such striking attacks on stage \u2014 Harris, Cory Booker, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, all on Biden \u2014 saw no long-term polling gain. He\u2019s hoping that it doesn\u2019t tank his support among the slice of progressives that has been willing to give him a look. And it\u2019s based on an expectation that voters who have gotten to like Buttigieg\u2019s brand of low-key moderation and calls for generational change won\u2019t rebel against these kinds of explicit critiques of his rivals.\n\nButtigieg and Democrats around him have been most eager to pick the health-care fight, according to multiple people in his orbit. Though he\u2019d found himself clashing with Warren supporters in the last week for labeling grassroots donations \u201cpocket change\u201d in a recent interview while making a point about general election fundraising strategy, and though he\u2019d engaged in a back-and-forth with O\u2019Rourke \u2014 who trails him in most polling \u2014 over gun policy, he has been trying to put himself more forcefully in the middle of the health-care fight with ads in early-voting Iowa touting his own alternative to Medicare for All. It\u2019s a strategy he\u2019s following more successfully than others who\u2019ve tried a version of it, like Steve Bullock, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, and John Delaney.\n\nThose close to Buttigieg are fond of pointing to a late September Des Moines Register poll demonstrating fear among some Democratic caucus goers that Medicare for All could cost the party in the general election, and on Tuesday Buttigieg released a digital ad criticizing Sanders and Warren by name while touting his own plan. It was the first candidate ad of the cycle directly going after named opponents, and Buttigieg on stage accused Warren of being evasive over her plan\u2019s funding, a reflection, he said, of \u201cwhy people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d\n\nButtigieg isn\u2019t the only candidate whose path ahead relies on Biden faltering. But in order to truly take Biden\u2019s place at some point, he\u2019d need to massively expand his support among both African-American voters and Democrats who aren\u2019t yet fully engaged in the primary \u2014 two groups that have been Biden\u2019s core supporters, but with whom Buttigieg has struggled. He\u2019s now committed himself to a future firmly within that lane, with little wiggle room after he said onstage that Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s health-care proposals would \u201cunnecessarily divide this country\u201d in a post-Trump world. Some of the fury that has long come Biden\u2019s way from progressives fed up with his centrism is now certainly headed Buttigieg\u2019s way.\n\nTo hear his allies tell it, Buttigieg\u2019s new strategy makes sense because voters are now demanding clarity on what divides the candidates, and they\u2019ll appreciate his new assertiveness. That may make the difference between his position in the top five and a place in the top three. It will, at the very least, determine whether the hopeful candidate who\u2019s tried to spur a generational revolution can now credibly convince people to think of him as the moderate hope.", "description": "At the fourth Democratic primary debate held in Ohio, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was more aggressive than he has been throughout the race, as part of his effort to  position himself as the alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters.", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/14/pete_buttigieg.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
