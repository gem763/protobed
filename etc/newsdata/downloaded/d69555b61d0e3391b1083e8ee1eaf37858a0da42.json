The cavalier action served enemies of the U.S. who could use the photo to more fully determine America\u2019s surveillance capabilities, experts warned.\n\nTrump tweeted the aerial photo of the Iranian site to his 64 million followers the day after a failed rocket launch at the spot.\n\n\u201cGood luck determining what happened,\u201d Trump tweeted sarcastically.\n\nThe United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One. pic.twitter.com/z0iDj2L0Y3 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nA Defense Department official said the image appeared to show a photo that was provided during an intelligence briefing earlier Friday, CNBC reported. It was a detailed image that labeled parts of the launch site where the Iranian rocket exploded. John Sipher, a former CIA officer, told CNN that the image is \u201cconsistent with a standard classified product.\u201d\n\nAnkit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists who specializes in analyzing satellite imagery, said the photo Trump tweeted was in far higher definition than what\u2019s available from commercial satellites. The tweet discloses \u201csome pretty amazing capabilities that the public simply wasn\u2019t privy to before this,\u201d Panda told NPR.\n\nRobert Deitz, a former lawyer at the CIA and National Security Agency, told Business Insider that Trump made a \u201cserious mistake\u201d with the tweet.\n\n\u201cIt identifies for the world the methods we have attained\u201d in collecting imagery intelligence, Deitz said. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t use intel for the purposes of taunting. The Russians and the Chinese will be very happy to study this.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s actions may have blown the cover on a \u201cmulti-decade ... campaign to disrupt Iranian missile and nuclear development,\u201d tweeted Alex Stomos, an adjunct professor at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation. \u201cLots of analysts counting pixels in Beijing and Moscow today,\u201d he noted ominously.\n\nThe propensity for saying the quiet part out loud is less amusing when it blows the cover on a multi-decade, multi-president campaign to disrupt Iranian missile and nuclear development with minimal loss of life.\n\n\n\nLots of analysts counting pixels in Beijing and Moscow today. https://t.co/BI4eQ8OAQw \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) August 30, 2019\n\nTrump \u2014 who ironically has falsely accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified information \u2014 defended his right to release the image on Friday. \u201cWe had a photo and I released it, which I have the absolute right to do,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nThe president attacked the former director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, for criticizing his release of the photo, but it was unclear what he was complaining about. It didn\u2019t appear that Clapper had made any public statement about Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nBeing scolded by failed former \u201cIntelligence\u201d officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, don\u2019t have a clue. They really set our Country back,.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2019\n\nIn 2017, Trump shared highly classified information at the White House with visiting Russian officials that threatened to compromise foreign intelligence sources, The Washington Post reported. Israel was the source of the information, according to The New York Times. The Telegraph reported that Israeli officials were furious\ufeff that Trump had leaked it to the Russians.\n\nIntelligence officials had to scramble to contain the damage then. One source told the Post that Trump \u201crevealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.\u201d\n\nTrump also said then that he had an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to share the classified information.", "description": "A photo that president tweeted to 64 million followers could help U.S. adversaries determine details of U.S. surveillance capabilities, experts warned.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6b50103b00007902cabf24.jpeg?cache=m3hb7uijze&ops=1778_1000"}
