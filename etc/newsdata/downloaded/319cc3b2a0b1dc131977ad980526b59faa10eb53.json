I have no room for making bulk purchases before the tax hike or buying vouchers,\" said a 36-year-old single mother in Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, with children attending an elementary school and a junior high school.\n\nA woman in her 40s who is on welfare said that when her elementary-school-age daughter asked for new clothes, she told her they would have to save up by \"eating sprouts for a while.\"\n\nAlthough the Tokyo resident hopes to eventually start working, she said, \"I think the tax hike will make it harder for me to become financially independent.\"\n\nLawyer Tadashi Inomata of Tax Justice, a civic group calling for a fair tax system, was critical of the intent of Japan's consumption tax hikes.\n\n\"Northern European nations have high consumption tax, but as they also provide high levels of social welfare, most people accept the burden,\" he said.\n\n\"Japan has given preferential treatments to the strong by lowering the maximum rate of income tax and corporate tax, and it has raised the consumption tax to make up for the loss, and as such is not acceptable to the people,\" Inomata said.\n\nMajor advertiser Hakuhodo Inc. conducted a survey in March on 2,300 people in their 20s to 60s and found about 70 percent of respondents calling the latest tax hike more burdensome than the previous hike in 2014 from 5 percent.\n\nThe percentage was even higher among women in their 20s to 40s at nearly 80 percent, with many of them citing increased costs for child raising and education.\n\nFollowing the 2014 tax hike, Japan twice postponed the second round of the two-stage consumption tax increase, originally scheduled in October 2015, due to fears it could dampen consumer spending and hurt the overall economy.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japan's consumption tax hike to 10 percent on Tuesday has left low-income households already struggling to make ends meet under the previous 8 percent tax rate worrying about how to cope with the higher cost of living.
