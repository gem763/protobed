General Assembly session in New York, has expressed optimism about a renewal of the U.S.-North Korea talks, which have been stalled since a second summit in February in Vietnam between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended abruptly without a deal.\n\nBut government sources said Tuesday that the Moon administration is also concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus in New York will be on the clash with Iran in the wake of the weekend drone attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\n\u201cWe want President Trump to focus on the North Korea matter,\u201d said one source, who added that South Korean officials convened a behind-the-scenes meeting Tuesday to weigh the possible negative impact that the Middle East developments could have on the situation.\n\nSouth Korean officials say they believe North Korea will seek by the end of the month to resume direct \u201cworking level\u201d nuclear talks with U.S. officials for the first time since the failed Hanoi summit.\n\nAn official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Mr. Kim has given clear signs, despite months of provocations that included several short-range missile tests, is eager for a breakthrough with Washington by the end of the year. Analysts say the deal will require U.S. negotiators to embrace a step-by-step approach rather than an all-or-nothing offer \u2014 total sanctions relief in exchange for total denuclearization upfront \u2014 that Mr. Trump put on the table in Hanoi.\n\nThe recent departure of hawkish National Security Adviser John R. Bolton could open the way for the more modest, phased approach. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his top North Korean envoy, Stephen E. Biegun, were reportedly seeking that approach this year, only to be shut down by Mr. Bolton\u2019s demand for a sweeping deal.\n\nSigns of renewed personal diplomacy include a South Korean newspaper report that a letter sent by Mr. Kim to Mr. Trump in August included an invitation to travel to Pyongyang for a fourth one-on-one summit.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters Monday that he expected to meet with Mr. Kim sometime before the end of the year but dismissed speculation that he would travel to Pyongyang anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI would do it sometime, at some time at a later future.\u201d\n\nBut South Korea\u2019s Mr. Moon has appeared eager this week to seize on the momentum spurred by the North Korean offer.\n\n\u201cChanges are underway even at this moment,\u201d Mr. Moon, long a proponent of detente with Pyongyang, said Monday.\n\nSpeaking at a weekly meeting with his aides in Seoul, the South Korean president said he will \u201cactively endorse and support dialogue between North Korea and the United States\u201d when he meets with Mr. Trump in New York next week.\n\nMr. Biegun sought to jump-start stalled talks with Pyongyang last month during a visit to South Korea. He said U.S. officials had offered to meet with their North Korean counterparts and were awaiting a response.\n\nU.S. officials say Mr. Trump has assigned Mr. Biegun\u2019s team to try to build on the momentum from the president\u2019s surprise meeting in June with Mr. Kim along the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s American affairs chief at the Foreign Ministry told the state-controlled KCNA press agency that talks with the U.S. could resume in a \u201cfew weeks\u201d \u2014 with some conditions.\n\n\u201cThe discussion of denuclearization may be possible when threats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
