Bush \u2014 but in very different ways.\n\nREESE WITHERSPOON AND KRISTEN BELL, SUSAN SARANDON AND MARK RUFFALO AT ODDS OVER ELLEN DEGENERES' PLEA FOR CIVILITY\n\nLast weekend, DeGeneres, 61, took heat on social media for attending a Dallas Cowboys game with Bush, 73. On Tuesday's episode of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" DeGeneres addressed the backlash.\n\n\u201cI have friends who don\u2019t think the same things that I do,\" DeGeneres said. \"When I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people who think the same way you do, I mean be kind to everyone.\"\n\nELLEN DEGENERES STANDS UP TO TWITTER MOB, DEFENDS APPEARING WITH 'FRIEND' GEORGE W. BUSH\n\n\"Thelma & Louise\" star Sarandon tweeted a quote from Out Magazine's response to DeGeneres' statements, highlighting a portion that read: \u201cBut missing the point entirely, DeGeneres framed the issue as simply a matter of her hanging out with someone with different opinions, not a man repeatedly accused of being a war criminal.\u201d\n\nSarandon, 73, wasn't the only celebrity to speak out, however.\n\nActresses Witherspoon, 43, and Bell, 39, voiced their opinions in support of DeGeneres. The two are now being called out for backing the \"Finding Dory\" star.\n\n\"Thank you for this important reminder, Ellen!\" the \"Legally Blonde\" star wrote in response to DeGeneres' comments, in a tweet that she apparently deleted later.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cGood for her, but then bad for her. Why take the tweet down?\u201d Webb said, arguing such an action gives the \"mob\" more power.\n\n\"Now they think \u2018wow if I\u2019m an anonymous egg and I tweet something at you and you don\u2019t like it, you\u2019re going to take it down.'\u201d\n\nSEE MORE FROM DAVID WEBB ON FOX NATION\n\nFox News\u2019 Nate Day contributed to this report.", "description": "David Webb called out Reese Witherspoon on Thursday for caving into pressure by a Twitter mob shouting down her support for daytime talk show host Ellen Degeneres.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Ellen-DeGeneres-split1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
