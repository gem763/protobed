When Ron and I first met we instantly found a common ground (as well as sharing a similar sense of humour), and I was blown away by his obvious enthusiasm to work together.\u201d", "description": "In design terms, it\u2019s not the most obvious pairing:", "authors": ["Jessica Doyle"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/luxury/2019/10/02/OKA-x-Ron-Arad-AKO-ph-Mark-Cocksedge-12-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
