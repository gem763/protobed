The woman on the right can be seen laughing in seeming hysteria at seeing the large reptile\n\nOnly these two women remained in the corridor - albeit at a safe distance - as the snake hung from the ceiling. Local rescue crew were called to capture the snake which was later released into the wild\n\nLecturer Phupa Phuwananon was one of those at the University when the reptile paid a surprise visit.\n\nHe said the snake gave him a fright when he saw it slithering through the wooden roof on September 28.\n\n'There are lots of the reptiles living around our campus, but seeing a snake hanging down from the ceiling was so surprising,' he said.\n\n'I think the reason the snake was up there because of its nest, or some of prey such as rats might have been running around up there and it was trying to catch them.''\n\nStudents and staff stayed well clear of the reptile until a local rescue team arrived.\n\nThe snake was captured safely and released it back to its natural habitat.\n\nThe once busy corridor was rapidly vacated after the large python broke through the ceiling, as the python writhes and flickers its long forked tongue\n\nIt was not made clear what type of python it was, but according to the Thai National Parks website, there are three types of the reptile that are endemic to the Asian nation.\n\nThese are; the reticulated python, the Burmese python and the Brongersma's short-tailed python.\n\nThe reticulated python ( scientific name Python reticulatus) is a species of python that is commonly found in Southeast Asia.\n\nThey are said to be the world's longest snake and among the top three heaviest snake in the world.\n\nLike all pythons the reticulated python is a non-venomous constrictor and is not thought to pose a significant threat to humans.\n\nHowever, there have been a number of cases of people killed by reticulated pythons in the past, said the Thai National Parks in its description of the reptile.\n\nFile photo shows a reticulated python. The non-venomous constrictor is generally not dangerous to humans but there are reported cases of humans killed by the reptile\n\nIt is unclear what type of python this unexpected guest was, however given its size it is likely to be one of the two larger species endemic to Thailand, the reticulated python or the Burmese python\n\nThe second species endemic to Thailand, known as the Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is one of the five largest species of snakes in the world.\n\nThis type of python, commonly found near water, but also in trees, are known to reach up to 18ft in length.\n\nA largely docile species they are powerful reptiles that can bite or even kill its keeper with its sheer constrictive force.\n\nThe third species, a Python brongersmai, commonly known as Brongersma's short-tailed python is the smaller of the three.\n\nThe nonvenomous snake endemic can grow up to 3.2 feet and is most active around dusk and dawn.", "description": "A video taken moments after the 12-ft long python fell through the wooden ceiling of the Thammasat University in Pathum Thani shows the reptile writhing as it hangs into the middle of the once-busy corridor.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19438654-0-image-a-71_1570535360269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
