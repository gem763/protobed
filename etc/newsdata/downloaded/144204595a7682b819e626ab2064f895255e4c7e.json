FIFA allows players to make a one-time switch if they have dual citizenship, so even though Dest had played for the USMNT, he had the option to don the orange for Holland.\n\nOn Monday, he announced his decision to stay with the USMNT on the Ajax team Twitter account.\n\nDest joins a core of young players including Christian Pulisic, Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Josh Sargent, Timothy Weah, Paxton Pomykal and others who the U.S. will hope to build around moving forward.\n\nUSMNT fans were excited. This is the biggest win they've had in a while.\n\nOPINION:Just win, baby!
