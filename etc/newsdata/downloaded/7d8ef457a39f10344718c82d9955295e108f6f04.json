The strongest contenders are Louisiana\u2019s current governor, Democrat John Bel Edwards, and two Republicans: Representative Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association considers the race a top pick-up opportunity for the GOP. \u201cWith the state\u2019s solid red hue combined with President Trump\u2019s 20-point victory in 2016, Governor Edwards will certainly face a competitive race no matter who Republicans decide to nominate,\u201d Jon Thompson, an RGA spokesman, said of the contest last November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Edwards, who is polling well ahead of Abraham and Rispone, manages to secure 50 percent of the vote in Saturday\u2019s contest, he\u2019ll maintain his seat as governor, and Thompson will be proven wrong. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll face whichever of the two Republicans finishes second in a runoff election on November 16. Of the five most recent gubernatorial elections held in Louisiana, three were won outright in the primary. Two (in 2003 and 2015) headed to a runoff, and this one looks likely to follow. Edwards hasn\u2019t achieved more than 50 percent support in a poll of the race since mid August, and the latest surveys show him hovering in the mid 40s, reaching a peak of 48 percent in the most recent poll, from Emerson. Most surveys suggest that, of the two Republicans, Rispone has a slight edge over Abraham, polling in the low to mid 20s while Abraham reaches only the high teens. In polls of potential runoff match-ups, however, Abraham appears to fare better against Edwards than Rispone.\n\nEdwards was elected to his first term in 2015, defeating former U.S. senator David Vitter to succeed Republican governor Bobby Jindal. He\u2019s currently the only Democratic governor in a southern state and the only Democratic politician holding statewide office in Louisiana. Even so, he seems fairly well-liked among Louisianans, with a positive net-approval rating that has held steady throughout his time as governor. Unlike many Democratic governors in red states, he has managed to avoid become deeply unpopular with Republican voters, and he\u2019s consistently maintained strong support among independents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis popularity makes sense given his policy priorities. Under his leadership, Louisiana has gone from having a budget deficit to a budget surplus. He has focused on popular causes such as Medicaid expansion and increasing funding for K\u201312 education. Significantly, and unlike the overwhelming majority of Democratic politicians, he has also shown himself to be socially conservative. A Catholic, he has governed as a supporter of pro-life policies, even going so far as to sign a law that would prohibit abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around six weeks\u2019 gestation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbraham has represented Louisiana\u2019s fifth congressional district, which covers most of the northeastern and central portions of the state, since he was first elected in 2014. The Advocate, Lousiana\u2019s largest daily paper, wrote during his most recent bid for reelection last year that he \u201chas turned in a consistently conservative voting record in Congress\u201d and deemed the fifth district \u201creliably Republican.\u201d That seems to be the case: Abraham won that race by 36 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRispone, meanwhile, is an independently wealthy contractor who has invested more than $11 million of his personal money into his campaign, and has tried to position himself as an outsider alternative to Abraham, suggesting that the congressman has been insufficiently supportive of President Trump.\n\nAs for Trump, he hasn\u2019t said a word about which Republican voters in the state ought to support tomorrow, though he and others in his orbit have certainly encouraged them to vote. He is scheduled to visit the state this evening, for a final rally before tomorrow\u2019s contest, after Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. visited and urged Republicans to back either Abraham or Rispone in separate rallies over the last week. Speaking to a crowd in Kenner, La. last Saturday, Pence attempted to frame the race as a referendum on the president, telling the crowd that voting against Edwards would show Washington that Louisiana voters support Trump in light of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA key issue on which all three candidates disagree is whether the state should hold a constitutional convention to amend the state constitution in 2020. Louisiana is one of only six states not to require a popular vote to call such a convention, instead leaving that responsibility to the legislature. There were some limited efforts last spring in the legislature to call a convention, but they eventually died down, only to pick back up again this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the three gubernatorial candidates, Rispone is the most supportive of the idea; in fact, he\u2019s made it a central component of his proposed policy agenda, insisting that rewriting the constitution is the best way to give the government more money to fund coastal restoration and K\u201312 education, among other goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbraham hasn\u2019t explicitly opposed holding a convention but has said that doing so would risk the possibility of changes that could come back to haunt Republicans. \u201cIf you open up the entire constitution, you put things on the chopping block like education that we believe are important,\u201d he said in a late-September debate.\n\n\u201cA constitutional convention is not, in my view, necessary,\u201d Edwards said in a speech to Louisiana sheriffs in August. \u201cI don\u2019t have a burning desire to do it [and] would not support the effort if it couldn\u2019t be a limited constitutional convention. There\u2019s a difference of opinion among the legal scholars as to whether that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven that calling a convention requires two-thirds\u2019 support in both chambers of the legislature, the effort seems unlikely to succeed at the moment. But as an issue in an off-year race where Edwards\u2019 avoiding a runoff could be determined by just a few percentage points, it could have a big impact. And that, in turn, makes it crucial to Republicans hungry for any good news they can get as the national party heads into a presidential election year amid the turmoil of House Democrats\u2019 effort to impeach Trump. The president may not have picked a dog in this fight, but he and his supporters will surely be watching tomorrow night\u2019s results with interest.", "description": "Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards is facing a challenge from two Republicans, which could have big implications for the national GOP.", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Kevin D.
