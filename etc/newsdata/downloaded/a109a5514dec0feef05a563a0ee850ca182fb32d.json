A section of the Vasil Levski Stadium was closed on Monday after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria\u2019s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June, and the punishment is also due to cover the home game against the Czech Republic next month.\n\nEngland's vile and disturbing night in Sofia will live long in sporting infamy | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWith the anti-racism charity Kick It Out leading calls for Uefa to consider excluding teams from major tournaments to tackle discrimination, it remains to be seen whether the governing body will go further than ordering Bulgaria to play their next home game behind closed doors. That was Montenegro\u2019s punishment after England\u2019s players suffered similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March.\n\nThe Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has called for authorities to show \u201czero tolerance\u201d, and the anti-discrimination group Fare has said it will help Uefa build a \u201clegally safe\u201d case to prosecute Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cWe had observers at the match and they have an official role in the sense that they will have flagged up issues with the delegates and they will also have collected evidence of what we all saw through our TV screens,\u201d said Fare network\u2019s executive director, Piara Powar.\n\nKick It Out\u2019s chief executive, Roisin Wood, said: \u201cI think there has to be a massively thorough investigation. The fines from Uefa we don\u2019t think are enough. There have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter tournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are professional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should professional players get it in theirs?\u201d\n\nTyrone Mings (@OfficialTM_3) Very proud moment for me and my family tonight to make my @England debut. The unfortunate incidents in the game were handled as well as possible & proud of how we handled it \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f pic.twitter.com/ai1Cn2ZJYI\n\nThe Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, has asked the BFU president, Borislav Mihaylov, to resign.\n\n\u201cI urge Borislav Mihaylov to immediately resign as president of the Bulgarian Football Union!\u201d Boyko Borissov posted on Facebook. \u201cIt is unacceptable for Bulgaria, which is one of the most tolerant countries in the world, and people of different ethnicities and religions live in peace, to be associated with racism and xenophobia.\u201d\n\nThat response was welcomed by England\u2019s Raheem Sterling, who was targeted by the home fans along with his teammates Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford. \u201cA good move credits to you M. Borissov,\u201d Sterling wrote on Twitter.\n\nRaheem Sterling (@sterling7) \ud83e\udd1d a good move credits to you M. Borissov https://t.co/28dikRPhTE\n\nHowever, Borissov later added when questioned by reporters: \u201cIt was a bunch of idiots who caused the troubles. Nevertheless, I would ask the visitors from England to not overreact \u2013 we\u2019re not commenting on their fans\u2019 hooligan behaviour in Sofia, are we?\u201d\n\nThe Bulgaria goalkeeper Plamen Iliev said the home fans had \u201cbehaved well\u201d and that Gareth Southgate\u2019s players \u201coverreacted a bit\u201d. He said: \u201cIf I am honest, I believe they [the fans] behaved well today. There wasn\u2019t any abuse [as far as I could hear] and I think they [the England players] overreacted a bit. The public was on a good level \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear any bad language used towards their or our players.\u201d\n\nBulgaria\u2019s manager, Krasimir Balakov, has faced criticism for claiming in post-match interviews that he did not hear any racist chanting. One English football reporter wrote on Twitter: \u201cA few locals tutted when I asked a follow-up question about whether he was surprised the match was halted given he was unaware of any racism.\u201d\n\nSimon Peach (@SimonPeach) I tried to engage the Bulgaria manager about tonight's racism after Krasimir Balakov said he didn't hear anything. A few locals tutted when I asked a follow-up question about whether he was surprised the match was halted given he was unaware of any racism\n\nAnother English journalist at the game reported that Gareth Southgate\u2019s post-match press conference was interrupted by a Bulgarian journalist \u201cconvinced racism at the game was not as bad as we witnessed\u201d.", "description": "Uefa is under increasing pressure to take strong action against the Bulgarian football union after England\u2019s game in Sofia was marred by racism", "authors": ["Ed Aarons", "Simon Murphy", "Dario Brentin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b793ac86b8563ea512c9975d0b36a65ee4ac88ec/0_10_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d75a61040e5b6c904e9166fa725ad240", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
