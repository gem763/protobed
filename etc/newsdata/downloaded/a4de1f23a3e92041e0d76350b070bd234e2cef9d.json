But other tax streams, notably stamp duty and fuel taxes, have been depressed.\n\nGovernment departments look to have been anticipating the Chancellor's September spending review for 2020-21 \u2013 which would raise expenditure across all departments by 4.1p \u2013 by breaching their usual ceilings.\n\nThe OBR reckons that spending will fall back in the current six months of the year as some extra spending \u2013 on public sector pensions and the NHS \u2013 is more subdued. And some tax streams, such as inheritance tax, could strengthen.\n\nEven if as expected the fiscal rules are to be stretched, an immediate big tax cut for middle income workers looks unlikely.\n\nThe case should be made for supply-side tax breaks to speed up infrastructure investment and strengthen R&D, both with productivity pay-offs, to power a post-Brexit economy.\n\nWhich brings us to the Chancellor's other big unsettled decision.\n\nWhen asked who the next governor of the Bank of England will be, Javid's response is to say the process is 'on track' and a decision will be made in the autumn.\n\nTechnically that gives the Government until December 22 to unveil a replacement for Mark Carney, who steps down on January 31, 2020.\n\nThe Chancellor is unenthusiastic about giving Carney a third extension, which may be down to the Johnson/Cummings narrative that the governor somehow allowed himself to be politicised during the EU referendum campaign.\n\nIt would be unfair to the incoming governor, and disruptive if she or he were appointed before a general election and then Labour threatened to replace them and put forward a different candidate.\n\nIf asked, Carney \u2013 who has no immediate job to go to \u2013 would extend for a third time in the national interest (he is now a UK citizen).\n\nIf the current Brexit-election turbulence were to continue, government might have little choice but to bite on the lemon.\n\nSparkly Barclays\n\nJes Staley is having a better couple of days. At the consumer end of the spectrum, Barclays' retreat over cash facilities at post offices is playing well with victims of deeply-flawed decision-making.\n\nAt the investment bank, Staley has come roaring back with a 67 per cent lift in third-quarter profits, delivering a bloody nose to activist investor Edward Bramson \u2013 who wants Barclays out of wholesale trading \u2013 and demonstrating that the British bank is well placed as the last European institution standing in an American-dominated universe.\n\nThat is a role which potentially could become even more valuable over time as corporations seek choices other than Wall Street.", "description": "Sajid Javid is under orders to let it be known that it is not business as usual as the Parliamentary manoeuvring over Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and his search for a general election stretch out.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
