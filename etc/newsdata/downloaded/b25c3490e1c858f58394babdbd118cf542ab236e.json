But No 10 still vows to do everything it can to press ahead - expecting further tangles in the courts, despite widespread scepticism that would have any effect.\n\nAnd above all else, sources in government vow they would be as obstructive as possible to the EU, daring them perhaps to impose a delay on a reluctant and restive administration.\n\nTo their opponents, that might appear petulant and counter productive, but be in no doubt, if there is no deal this month, Boris Johnson's government would not suddenly play nice.\n\nAnd in the likely event that there is an extension, for political reasons No 10 wants to give the impression it was forced into that position.\n\n'Obstructive' strategy\n\nMinisters hoped their proposals might get a fair hearing from the EU. But there is frustration that this just doesn't appear to have happened.\n\nOne senior source told me the talks are \"meant to be a dialogue, not a question and answer session\", suggesting that rather than getting down to business, the EU is simply tying up the UK's negotiators by making query after query after query.\n\nSources say the EU ought to listen \"to the people who won the referendum, not the people who lost\".\n\nAnd there's a warning from this end that they will make a \"historic miscalculation\", if they expect saying no now will lead to calmer times ahead.\n\nBack here, there's also an ongoing discussion over whether a future Conservative manifesto should include the outline of a potential deal with the EU or a straightforward plan to leave immediately without a deal.\n\nI understand there has not been a decision on this yet.", "description": "It is more likely by the hour that there will not be a new Brexit deal at next week's EU summit.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1673C/production/_109146919_borisjohnsonpamedia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
