But while these datasets could be a scientific treasure trove for scientists, they also pose logistical and ethical challenges that need to be addressed.\n\n\u201cThere are huge opportunities. I think that\u2019s the attraction,\u201d says Ida Sim, director of digital health for the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Sim explains that part of the appeal for scientists is that the apps and tech are designed to appeal to the general public. A commercial app or device with an easy, attractive interface is primed for long-term use by far more people than can usually be included in a research study, and people actually use them. \u201cAs opposed to a clunky research wristband, which is ugly, and people won\u2019t wear it,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere are huge opportunities. I think that\u2019s the attraction.\u201d\n\nResearchers are taking advantage of the better design of their corporate counterparts, and in some cases, companies are especially eager to collaborate. This spring, the period tracking app Clue offered funds to researchers hoping to use Clue users\u2019 cycle tracking data to answer scientific questions. The company had previously provided data to researchers who approached it directly, but the grants marked a formalization of their existing program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an evolving conversation,\u201d says Amanda Shea, research collaborations manager at Clue. \u201cOur dataset is big enough now, and we have more of the proper protocols in place can ensure users aren\u2019t at risk through data sharing, that we can more actively participate in research.\u201d\n\nUnlike academic researchers, app companies like Clue are explicitly designed and have the resources to collect and maintain large amounts of data. On the other hand, commercial apps usually aren\u2019t designed for research, which demands predictable, transparently collected, and granular data. Sometimes, that means app-generated information is actually less useful to researchers, says Olivia Walch, a postdoctoral student studying mathematics and circadian rhythms at the University of Michigan.\n\ncommercial apps usually aren\u2019t designed for research\n\nSo in order to make the most of the data, scientists need to accept that what works in their lab might not work with all of that commercial data. For example, if they\u2019re designing their own experiments, automated data collection is often preferable to researchers because they don\u2019t have to rely on people providing their own information, which often results in human error. But when they\u2019re using commercial apps, self-reported information sidesteps some software-driven complications. \u201cWe know the pitfalls of surveys,\u201d Walch says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have error bounds, though, on if a wearable reports a heart rate by a method that hasn\u2019t been validated. It\u2019s just something to be aware of.\u201d\n\nEven though commercial hardware is easier for consumers to use, it presents problems for people sleuthing through the data. An app or device might collect raw information and then filter it through an algorithm that researchers don\u2019t have access to. \u201cResearchers then have to add all these asterisks,\u201d Walch says. \u201cIt\u2019s a black box.\u201d A Fitbit, she says, might provide data on the amount of deep sleep a user got on a particular night but not the method the device used to calculate the deep sleep. Without knowing how the hardware tallies up your sleep pattern, it can be difficult to compare the results of one tracker to another, causing more research headaches.\n\n\u201cOne app measures sleep in one way, another measures sleep in a different way, but both call it sleep duration,\u201d Sim says. While that might not matter for individual companies, a lack of common definitions prevents researchers from maximizing the value of the data. Trade organizations are starting to discuss defining terms, Sim says. A 2017 action plan around mobile health data out of the Duke-Margolis Health Policy Center called for the development of standards for apps that would promote consistent data.\n\nThere are few legal barriers to data from health apps\n\nThere are few legal barriers to data from health apps: if users sign terms of service that include language around research, they\u2019ve fully consented to their data being shared with scientists. \u201cBut ethicists still would say if you start using an app, and in small print, it says you\u2019re consenting to third-party use, is it really meaningful consent?\u201d says Barbara Prainsack, an ethicist and health policy expert at the University of Vienna. Ethically, it\u2019s important to consider if a user had a reasonable expectation that their information would be used in a particular way.\n\nThen there\u2019s privacy, which is a challenge for researchers in a few different ways. The first is simply that, because they are working with a third party, they can\u2019t easily follow up with users. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always the case that you\u2019ll hit a wall. The data you get is what you\u2019re getting,\u201d Walch says.\n\nClue is still working on its data sharing process, but it keeps datasets small by design in order to protect user privacy, Shea says. \u201cEach is designed specifically for a project. We narrow it down so it\u2019s as small as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cOur data is not going to be the most useful for every study. Some things are not possible with the limitations of privacy.\u201d\n\nPrivacy is a critical issue for data collection, Prainsack says. The datasets gathered by digital apps function like biobanks, which store biological samples for use in research. Biobanks collect information without participants knowing at the outset what scientific questions it will be used to answer, but people offer data to biobanks with the primary purpose of donating to research. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it bad, but people sign up for an app because [they] want to track their period, not because they want to contribute to research,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cpeople sign up for an app because [they] want to track their period, not because they want to contribute to research.\u201d\n\nApps should, therefore, provide users with information about the institutions using data for research, the purpose of that research, who benefits from it, and the privacy protections in place, Prainsack says. \u201cWhat might be right for you might not be right for me. I might not want my data to be used for mental health research, or it might be really important to you that data is used to benefit underserved populations,\u201d she says.\n\nParticipating in research could even become a selling point as the market widens, Sim notes. \u201cApps are commodities. If they\u2019re trying to distinguish themselves, they could say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re more scientific.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe technical, ethical, and privacy-related hurdles are all there, but there is also a sense that both groups are making progress \u2014 even as they continue to sort out best practices for sharing data. \u201cThere\u2019s real potential,\u201d Walch says. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly crab-walking our way there.\u201d", "description": "Researchers are eager to tap into the steadily expanding pool of health information collected from users by products like Fitbit, Clue, and the Apple Watch.
