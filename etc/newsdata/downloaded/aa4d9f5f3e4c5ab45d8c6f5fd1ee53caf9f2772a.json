Pandora says over 35 of these modules will roll out in the coming months, and more are planned for the future.\n\nBased upon your previous interactions with Pandora, the \u201cFor You\u201d section could prioritize styles of music, breaking news podcasts, or push new music from artists you frequently listen to as soon as it\u2019s released. Pandora-only content is also included, like SiriusXM talk shows and Pandora Stories. And, Pandora says these recommendations can be tailored down to the time of day, depending on your unique listening history. It takes into consideration what content you\u2019ve engaged with the most, and what you like and dislike based on what you\u2019ve \u201cthumbed-up\u201d or \u201cthumbed-down.\u201d The company says it\u2019s cataloged over 100 billion \u201cthumbs\u201d of listener data that allow it to accurately tailor content.\n\nAlso new is a \u201cPandora Modes\u201d station that was previously exclusive as a web feature. Pandora Modes lets you actively customize the stations you\u2019re listening to and tweak the listening experience. Selecting a mode can switch things up on a station so you only hear songs most liked by other users, songs from a particular artist, or shuffle in more songs by artists that don\u2019t normally pop up.\n\nPandora users will also notice another change \u2014 the navigation bar has been moved to the bottom of the app \u2014 which should make it easier to use.\n\nThe new features are available to all tiers of Pandora users, and will roll out to limited iOS and Android users starting today.", "description": "Pandora has revamped its smartphone app to focus on personalization, leveraging the data from its Music Genome Project to serve up custom-curated music and podcast recommendations.", "authors": ["Dani Deahl", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H-JWR5TAzzCrzdTDE5lIusiwZs8=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9020347/akrales_170802_1743_0194.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
