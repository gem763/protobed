(Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nEver since it got into the smartwatch game, Fossil never fails to show an army of wrist computers everywhere it goes. This year\u2019s IFA is no exception. In addition to showcasing its newly launched Gen 5 smartwatches, Fossil\u2014and its horde of designer brand partners\u2014brought four totally new watches and some familiar friends to Berlin.\n\nI could list all the specs for each individual watch, but that would be a gobbledygook word cloud of basically the same features over and over again. In essence, Fossil\u2019s lineup will feature the Snapdragon Wear 3100 chipset. They also all feature extended battery modes\u2014a neat little cheat around Wear OS watches\u2019 reputation for terrible battery life. Another commonality is they feature speakers. They have Fossil\u2019s new array of preloaded apps\u2014Spotify, Cardiogram (for the ones with heart rate monitoring), etc. One could accuse Fossil of just sticking the same features in as many different design SKUs as possible\u2014and you wouldn\u2019t be too far off.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s a look at all the different flavours of Fossil watches on display at IFA.\n\nRun in your Armani watch. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nLet\u2019s start fancy. Here are the new Emporio Armani Smartwatch 3 watches. They are colourful and fancy and somehow meant for the person who wants an Armani watch but also, an Armani watch while exercising. These will be available in October.\n\nGotta go fast in your neon Puma watch. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nMoving onto the Puma watches, which were also announced at IFA. They are extremely neon but in this blogger\u2019s opinion, not exactly evocative of a mountain cat. These are also meant for that person who is somehow sporty yet stylish. It\u2019ll retail for $US275 ($403) in November.\n\nThese are the Sporty Spice of Michael Kors watches. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nWhat do we have here? Oh. It\u2019s a sporty Michael Kors Access MKGO! It\u2019s\u2014you guessed it\u2014meant for that person who wants to be active, but not look like a bum. One main difference is this watch will let you take Bluetooth calls on your watch via a proprietary app. These will retail for $US295 ($433).\n\nI\u2019m gonna say these are the Posh Spice of Michael Kors watches. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nEven more Michael Kors. This is the new Michael Kors Access Bradshaw 2. It\u2019s exactly like the MKGO except fancier, so this is not the one you\u2019d take to the gym. These start at $US350 ($513).\n\nI have run out of Spice Girl analogies for these Michael Kors watches. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nHAHA, YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE WITH MICHAEL KORS. These are the Michael Kors Access Lexington 2. They are a manlier version of the Bradshaw 2. They also start at $US350 ($513).\n\nIf German engineering was a watch, this is what it\u2019d look like. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nRounding out the new Fossil watches is the Diesel On Axial smartwatch. Their design is based on the brutalist movement in architecture, which you can see in the fact that these watches look brutal. There\u2019s also a 3D animated screen that makes it look like you\u2019re running through a tunnel in Blade Runner 2049. The thing is more steampunk than brutalist, but what do I know.\n\nYou might think we\u2019re done because these are all the new smartwatches announced. But I meant it when I said Fossil brings a million smartwatches to a party, so strap in.\n\nThese fine watch specimens are the Fossil Gen 5 and Fossil Sport. Both feature the 3100 chip and are the newest Fossil watches under the actual Fossil brand.\n\nKate Spade and Skagen sitting in a tree. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nObserve the Kate Spade smartwatches and Skagen watches. Kate Spade watches are known for their scalloped cases. Skagen watches are manly in a minimalistic way. Not in a flashy Lexington 2 way.\n\nYOU get a watch, and YOU get a watch, and YOU get a watch. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nThere were some more watches in many designs and colorways, but I am opting to give you a zoomed-out look at Fossil\u2019s IFA booth. I was told some of the watches were Gen 4 and with the 2100 chips, but they were next to the new ones with the 3100 chips. I did not have enough coffee, and my eyes crossed. Basically, if there was a flat surface, there was a watch on it. Helpful Fossil representatives also passed out flyers asking me if I wanted a chance to get a free Fossil watch. I did not have the heart to tell them as a reviewer, I already have many Fossil watches.\n\nThis is all to say that Fossil has a ton of smartwatches, and if you\u2019re looking for a Wear OS watch with the latest chip for a price that isn\u2019t stupid (I\u2019m looking at you, Montblanc Summit 2)\u2014you\u2019re probably going to end up with one of these Fossil watches.\n\nWe\u2019re live from Berlin at IFA 2019!
