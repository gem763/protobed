According to people familiar with the matter, Trump pressed Zelensky to dig up potentially damaging information against Biden during a July 25 phone call.\n\nIn an exchange with reporters outside the White House before departing for events in Texas and Ohio on Sunday, Trump appeared to suggest he did speak about Biden with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday morning. \u201cAnd Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nLater in Houston, Trump appeared to backtrack, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to mention it, but certainly I\u2019d have the right to\u201d raise Biden\u2019s name with Zelensky. He also said he would \u201clove\u201d to release a transcript, though he added he would have to make a determination about how to do so.\n\nIn his comments, Trump also continued to suggest, with no evidence, that Biden had acted inappropriately.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son,\u201d Trump said after landing in Houston on Sunday. But he continued, \u201cJoe\u2019s got a lot of problems. Joe\u2019s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,\u201d suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by his senior advisers, who repeatedly suggested, without evidence, wrongdoing on Biden\u2019s part and pushed for the highest levels of the federal government to probe the connections between the former vice president and Ukraine.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on multiple Sunday shows, said he hasn\u2019t seen the whistleblower complaint or news reports about it but raised questions about whether the former vice president acted properly.\n\n\u201cI do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or allowed something to take place in Ukraine, which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that,\u201d Pompeo said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Biden played any role in election interference efforts by foreign governments in 2016. Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia did interfere on behalf of Trump, a fact the president continues to deny.\n\nSince the spring, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, has pushed the Ukrainians to pursue two investigations: one into a gas tycoon who had Hunter Biden on his board and another into his allegations that Democrats colluded with Ukraine to release information on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort during the 2016 election.\n\nOn Sunday, Giuliani attacked Joe Biden in deeply personal terms by referencing Hunter Biden\u2019s struggles with addiction.\n\n\u201cThe kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict,\u201d Giuliani said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe episode \u2014 which broke open Wednesday when The Post reported that a showdown between the intelligence community and Capitol Hill involved Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader \u2014 has raised questions about the president\u2019s alleged willingness to cooperate with another country for his political gain just months after the official conclusion of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into potential conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia.\n\nThe continued revelations also have given more ammunition to congressional Democrats itching to pursue impeachment proceedings against Trump, demanding that lawmakers hold the president accountable for his behavior even as their own leadership has remained reluctant.\n\nThe episode threatens to overshadow much of Trump\u2019s agenda at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he arrived Sunday after events in Texas and Ohio. Trump and Zelensky will meet Wednesday, the final day of the president\u2019s activities at the United Nations, in a summit that a senior administration official has said will focus on Zelensky\u2019s anti-corruption efforts there.\n\nGiuliani told The Post on Sunday morning that he has been \u201cworking for months for this moment\u201d and this week will \u201ckeep pushing and pushing\u201d to highlight the Biden family\u2019s finances.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump has given Giuliani\u2019s efforts his blessing, Giuliani said, \u201cI don\u2019t do anything that involves my client without speaking with my client.\u201d\n\nTrump also on Sunday took aim at Biden for saying that he never spoke with his son about his overseas business dealings. \u201cHe said he never spoke to his son,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDoes anybody believe that one?\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that he did not speak to his son Donald Trump Jr. in advance of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting at which Russians offered to provide Trump\u2019s son with dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile campaigning Sunday in Kansas City, Biden deflected questions about whether he had spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine, telling reporters: \u201cFocus on the violation of the Constitution this president is engaged in.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the weekend, Biden decried Trump\u2019s efforts as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d and said the president was doing so because \u201che knows I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nNews of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky came to light after an intelligence official shared with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general that the official had heard Trump make a promise to a foreign leader that wasn\u2019t appropriate.\n\nSubsequent reporting has found that the call was with Ukraine and related to Trump\u2019s desire to get dirt on his possible political opponent. Congress has not been provided a copy of the actual complaint filed by the whistleblower.\n\nThough most Republicans have tried to sidestep the growing controversy, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) urged that more details of the Trump-Zelensky call be made public.\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,\u201d Romney, the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2012, tweeted Sunday. \u201cCritical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nOther senior Republicans played down questions surrounding Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said there is \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden or his family, saying the allegation is \u201cbased on hearsay reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just frankly can\u2019t imagine why people have lost their minds so much over these daily reports of one thing or another that seem to consume everybody\u2019s attention in the news coverage,\u201d Cornyn told reporters ahead of the \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d forum in Houston, in which Trump appeared with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nOn NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeatedly declined to say whether it was appropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and suggested that Trump did not pressure Zelensky.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re speculating that the president pressured. I don\u2019t have any reason to believe that the president pressured . . . in any way,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nIn his \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview, Mnuchin argued that rather than focusing on \u201cconfidential discussions\u201d between two world leaders, \u201cI really think that the real issue here is not what the president said but what indeed did Biden\u2019s son do.\u201d\n\nIn meetings overseas with Ukrainian officials, Giuliani has pushed for reopening an investigation of Burisma Holdings, the gas company that hired Hunter Biden in 2014 to serve as a board member and adviser while his father was U.S. vice president.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, he was paid as much as $50,000 some months for his work.\n\nIn 2016, then-Vice President Biden traveled to Ukraine to push for the country to sack its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. On that trip, Biden said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed. Biden\u2019s push was part of a broader international effort to fight corruption in Ukraine, and Shokin had been accused of ignoring major corruption. Shokin, at one point, led an investigation into Burisma Holdings. However, the case had been dormant before the prosecutor\u2019s firing, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials, and the U.S. ambassador at the time publicly called for the investigation in Burisma to proceed.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called for the Justice Department to play a role in the matter, arguing that it should \u201clook at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,\u201d in a reference to Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.\n\n\u201cWhat relationships, if any, did the Biden world have to the Ukraine? . . . There\u2019s enough smoke here,\u201d Graham said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nseungmin.kim@washpost.com\n\nfelicia.sonmez@washpost.com\n\nPhilip Rucker in Houston, Kim Mueller in Kansas City and Robert Costa in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "The statement comes amid swirling questions about whether President Trump sought to use his influence to seek reelection help from a foreign country.", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
