Tracking down the culprit or culprits has been challenging, she said. Patients have used many kinds of products with a wide array of ingredients, and some may have been mixed with potentially illicit substances, such as marijuana.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMany people have used more than one product,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may have acquired them in retail stores, online or on the street.\u201d\n\nBased on initial data from two states, officials know that most patients reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana. Some reported using THC and nicotine products, and some have reported using only nicotine products. But officials and clinicians have said patients, particularly younger ones, are often reluctant to share information about their use of illicit substances, such as marijuana.\n\nAD\n\nMany sick patients said they bought THC vape products on the black market, and those have come under increased scrutiny. In addition to the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has disclosed that it is conducting a criminal investigation with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Acting FDA commissioner Norman \u201cNed\u201d Sharpless told a House panel Wednesday that officials are not pursuing individual vapers. But if the FDA determines \u201csomeone is manufacturing or distributing illicit, adulterated vaping products that caused illness and death for personal profit,\u201d he said, \u201cwe would consider that to be a criminal act.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOfficials have said they suspect the cause of the lung disease to be some kind of chemical exposure. One substance that is a key focus of investigators is vitamin E oil, known as vitamin E acetate. Experts in the legal marijuana industry have said it has been used to stretch out THC oil that is used to fill vape cartridges. It is colorless and odorless, has similar viscosity to THC oil, and is much cheaper.\n\nVitamin E acetate, which is sold legally, is commonly used as a nutritional supplement and in skin-care products. It\u2019s not harmful when ingested or applied to the skin. But health officials have warned it could be hazardous when inhaled, potentially causing the sorts of symptoms many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nAD\n\nVitamin E acetate has been found in THC products taken from sickened patients and tested by state labs and the FDA\u2019s forensic lab, officials have said. On Wednesday, Sharpless said the FDA has received 300 samples from vaping-related injury patients and tested 150. About 70 percent are THC products, and about half of those contain vitamin E oil, which he said has \u201cno business\u201d being in the lungs.\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC has received complete sex and age data on 373 cases. Nearly three-fourths are male; two-thirds are 18 to 34 years old. About 16 percent of the patients are under 18.\n\nRead more:\n\nPotential culprits in mystery lung injuries: Black-market THC vaping products\n\nContaminant found in marijuana vaping products linked to deadly lung injuries\n\nVaping-related lung injuries surge as FDA discloses criminal probe\n\nAD", "description": "The CDC reported at least 805 cases of vaping-related lung illnesses in 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "authors": ["Lena H.
