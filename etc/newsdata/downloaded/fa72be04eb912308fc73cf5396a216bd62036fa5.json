With interest, that gift has reportedly climbed to $6.4 million.\n\nMr. Meek\u2019s move, while of a smaller scale, follows other high-profile donors who have sought to take back millions in contributions because they argued the universities had used the money for other purposes. It also moves into the spotlight the tensions that can arise between universities and their patrons, experts said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be savvy and anticipate this kind of situation,\u201d said Doug White, author of several books that examine charity giving and in particular big donations to colleges.\n\nIncreasingly, clauses are being added to big gifts that give the school leeway should the donor subsequently disgrace himself, while donors have begun to seek more clearly written agreements to spend the money as intended.\n\nSo far, however, donors remain the more unprotected party, according to Mr. White and some others.\n\n\u201cNot enough has changed over the years, and the schools should be better stewards of the gifts,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Meek, who has since declined to comment on the matter, told a Mississippi outlet Sept. 20 that he still \u201cloves Ole Miss,\u201d and it was his suggestion that the school remove his name from its journalism school this year.\n\nNevertheless, he said he has been treated \u201cvery unfairly\u201d by university administrators and students who allowed him to be \u201croundly labeled as a racist.\u201d\n\nDuring a long debate over underage drinking in Oxford last summer, Mr. Meek posted a picture of two black women Ole Miss students who said they were coming from a football game. Women at Ole Miss, especially sorority members, are famous for dressing in glamorous outfits for home games.\n\nThe students said they felt demeaned by the photos in Mr. Meek\u2019s post.\n\nSpokespeople at Ole Miss did not respond to questions.\n\nIt is unclear who, exactly, has the money, a factor Mr. White said will likely prove crucial in the coming weeks. Mr. Meek made his request in county chancery court.\n\nThe dissatisfaction Mr. Meek has with his alma mater is reminiscent of incidents in which the Bass and Robertson families sought the return of millions from Yale and Princeton universities, respectively, because the schools used the money for purposes other than what the gift intended.\n\nThe Bass family, a rich Texas group whose members have attended Yale for decades, sought the return of $20 million in 1995 it had given for the school to establish a scholarly center devoted to Western civilization.\n\nToday, $20 million is a drop in Yale\u2019s nearly $30 billion endowment, but the school did return the gift in an era in which The Los Angeles Times wrote, \u201ceven the Ivy League is counting pennies.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Princeton University, whose 2019 endowment is estimated at $25.4 billion, settled out of court with the Robertson family in 2009 after the A&P grocery empire heirs sought the return of a $35 million gift intended to put the school\u2019s then-named Woodrow Wilson School for Public Policy and International Affairs on sound financial footing.\n\nBoth sides claimed some sort of victory in that case, in which Princeton agreed to pay legal fees of about $90 million.\n\nLast year, the Pearson Family Members Foundation went to court seeking to recoup $22 million of a $100 million gift made to the University of Chicago made in 2015 because they say the school didn\u2019t use the money for what it was intended.\n\nThe cases have made donors wary, particularly conservative alumni who often find themselves at odds with current campus climates, but few concrete changes seem to have occurred, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things impossible to measure because no one tracks dollars not given,\u201d said Peter Wood, president of the conservative National Association of Scholars. \u201cConsidering the size of some of these endowments, most of the schools now are able to shrug it off anyway, and thus they are, unfortunately, impervious to most forms of public criticism.\u201d\n\nThe National Association of Scholars has seen a steady increase in donations and Mr. Wood believes, but said he has no way of proving, that in some cases the money might otherwise have gone directly to schools.\n\nYet while all nonprofits offer the same tax break \u2014 and in Mr. Meek\u2019s case, he has announced he hopes to give the $6.4 million to the CREATE Foundation, a Mississippi-based charity \u2014 not many carry the prestige that can accompany a well-publicized, major university donation, Mr. Wood said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom what\u2019s going through the minds of these people giving schools enormous gifts, and in the circles in which I travel stopping it is a constant source of chatter,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cBut outside of some disaffected alumni at some places, I\u2019d be hard pressed to cite an opposition to it that\u2019s been especially effective.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
