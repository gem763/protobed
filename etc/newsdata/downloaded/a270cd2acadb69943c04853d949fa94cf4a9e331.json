The Conservative Party\u2019s billions in proposed cuts to government staffing and operations were rejected by a large majority of Canadians.\n\n\n\nWith a Liberal minority government in place, PSAC will fight to ensure Justin Trudeau makes good on his commitments to the public service. In his first mandate he refused to deliver compensation for Phoenix, or a fair contract for 140,000 PSAC members.\n\n\u201cWith the Liberals reduced to a minority, PSAC members are in an even stronger bargaining position as it becomes all the more important for Mr. Trudeau to settle collective agreements and bring stability to the public service,\u201d said PSAC president Chris Aylward. \u201cBut we\u2019re taking nothing for granted \u2013 if a new government won\u2019t come back to the table with a fair offer, we\u2019ll continue to mobilize towards a potential strike.\u201d\n\nIn the last Parliament the Liberal government proposed 5 days of cashable leave as compensation for the first 3 years of Phoenix - an amount that was not only meagre, but also favoured workers with higher salaries at the expense of those who earn less. Trudeau also failed to provide a decent economic increase to thousands of workers who have been at the bargaining table for over a year.\n\n\u201cI hope Justin Trudeau got the message \u2013 when he takes people for granted, there\u2019s a cost. And it will be true again if he continues to ignore the workers who protect our borders, keep our food safe, and provide the support that millions of Canadians depend on.\u201d\n\nRiccardo Filippone\n\nDirector of Communications, Political Action & Campaigns\n\nDirecteur, Communications, action politique et campagnes", "description": "", "authors": ["Public Service Alliance Of Canada", "Alliance De La Fonction Publique Du Canada"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/568044?filename=568044.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
