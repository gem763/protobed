McGowan captioned the photo \"brainstorming.\"\n\nIt's unclear what the actress and journalist were meeting about. Insider reached out to both on Saturday, but did not receive a response.\n\nMcGowan was one of the first actresses to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse in 2017. She appeared on Kelly's now-defunct NBC show to discuss Weinstein and the #MeToo movement in May 2018. Stories of sexual abuse were a focus of Kelly's show before she was fired from the network last year over her controversial blackface comments.\n\nSome have speculated that Kelly appears to be ready to make her comeback. Earlier this month, she appeared on Fox News to discuss NBC's handling of the accusations against Matt Lauer, and called for an independent investigation into the network. It was her first appearance on TV since leaving the network with a $30 million payout.", "description": "Rose McGowan was one of the first actresses to speak out against Harvey Weinstein.
