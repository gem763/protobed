Since then, he said he made further reports which had been \"ignored\".\n\n\"Last week a crack appeared across our kitchen wall. Within three days we watched it stretch up and reach the ceiling. It's still developing,\" he said.\n\nA council spokesman said an initial survey last year \"identified very minor cracking and monitoring arrangements were put in place\". He said the family contacted the council again \"a few weeks ago\" and since then a structural engineer had carried out a survey.\n\n\"The cause of the structural cracking appears to be due to clay sub-soil and large mature trees but we have assured our tenants they are not at risk of any harm.\"\n\nHe said cosmetic repairs would be carried out next week and \"structural and remedial repairs\" will be completed \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nImage copyright Becki Boase Image caption The damage to the walls first appeared last year\n\nMr Boase said this response from the council was \"unbelievable\" and the authority had \"made no efforts\" to monitor the house in the past 12 months.\n\n\"Last year's inspection revealed inch wide cracks at the back and front of our home, cracks in every room, windows that wouldn't close... and a front door that was unlockable. There was nothing minor about it.\"\n\nHe added he had been told the house would require underpinning and most of the back wall rebuilding.", "description": "David Boase says Swindon Council's response to his repeated calls was \"unbelievable\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6374/production/_109206452_cracks2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
