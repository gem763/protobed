Right now, Turkey is stopping at 20 miles from Syria, not because of US troops, but because of US sanctions and the role of the US dollar. We stand to lose all of that because the cryptocurrency is for the crypto patriot.\"\n\nSee also: Mastercard, Visa, eBay, Stripe drop out of Facebook's Libra project\n\nAnd despite the committee hearing being about Facebook's crytocurrency project, questioning commenced with Walters grilling Zuckerberg about Facebook's decision to avoid vetting political advertising, saying the impact of the company's move would be \"a massive voter suppression effort. [Facebook's] claim to promote freedom of speech does not ring true\".\n\nAfter being repeatedly asked about Facebook's fact-checking policy, Zuckerberg then confirmed that the social network does not fact-check political ads itself, but contracts a third party to perform the work.\n\nOne of the fact-checkers contracted by Facebook is the Daily Caller, a company that is \"well-documented with ties to white supremacists\", Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said during the hearing.\n\nOn the child pornography front, Wagner said she was troubled by the amount of abhorrent content that goes through the social media platform, telling the committee that 16.8 million of the 18.4 million child sexual abuse material reported to US authorities were located on Facebook. She also touched on the drawbacks of Zuckerberg's end-to-end encryption proposal.\n\n\"I strongly believe what is illegal offline should be illegal online: 16.8 million of the 18.4 million child sexual abuse material are on Facebook ... these are absolutely shocking numbers,\" she stated.\n\n\"Moreover, it's estimated that 70% of Facebook's valuable reporting to NitBut on missing and child-exploited reporting would be lost if Facebook implements its end-to-end encryption proposal.\"\n\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia at the start of this month joined together to request that Facebook delay its plans to implement end-to-end encryption across its messaging services, citing that encryption would impede government officials from investigating possible crimes.\n\nDemocrat Representative Rashida Tlaib also criticised Zuckerberg about Facebook's content-filtering practices, saying hate-mongering was still widespread across the platform. During the hearing, Tlaib put on record an image of a \"white supremacist\" bearing arms in front of a mosque that was shared on Facebook despite its bans against such content.\n\nZuckerberg again acknowledged that \"[Facebook is] not perfect, we make a lot of mistakes\" before stating that over 100 billion pieces of content are shared daily on the social media platform.\n\n\"Even if we make mistakes on a relatively small percent, that's still a lot of mistakes. And in both directions, things that we take down that shouldn't be taken down and things that we missed that we leave up that we should have gotten to, this is a constant effort to do better,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nFacebook is currently the subject of various federal antitrust investigations, with the Libra project simply being one of many areas of concern for US regulatory authorities.\n\nFacebook has already been fined $5 billion by the FTC for privacy violations and earlier this week, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that 46 other state attorney generals have joined her state-level antitrust investigation into Facebook's conduct. In June, the House Judiciary Committee launched an antitrust investigation of Facebook, Google, and other tech companies. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) in July also launched a sweeping antitrust review into the industry's competitive conditions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the DOJ are also both reportedly investigating Facebook over antitrust concerns.\n\nRegulatory progress for the cryptocurrency project has been slow, and US lawmakers have not budged from their initial opposition against Libra despite it being unveiled back in June.\n\nWhen Libra was announced, Facebook said it planned for the cryptocurrency project to be launched sometime next year.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The US House Committee on Financial Services Chairperson has called for policymakers to consider whether Facebook should be broken up.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/10/28294b1e-581f-4b93-bc3f-31dbe9c95f9e/thumbnail/770x578/79c5cece9da443050fd4c5ead922beeb/zuck-on-capitol-hill-gettyimages-943837266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
