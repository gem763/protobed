Giuliani, who helped fund efforts to investigate one of President Trump\u2019s political rivals, were charged in a separate case with violating campaign finance laws, according to court documents.\n\nThe two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, believed to be important witnesses in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump, were arrested on campaign finance charges. The arrests and charges were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Two other men, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, were also indicted.\n\nMr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman aided Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to gin up investigations in Ukraine into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, among other potentially politically beneficial investigations for Mr. Trump. Mr. Parnas had been scheduled to participate in a deposition with House impeachment investigators on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and Mr. Fruman on Friday. Neither had been expected to show up voluntarily . House Democrats were preparing to issue subpoenas to force them to do so.", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, were also part of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate Democrats.", "authors": ["Eileen Sullivan", "Adam Goldman", "William K.
