Those particular business practices are tough to deal with just because of how late in the season it is and how few cars there are. Based on everything that we\u2019ve been involved with, nothing had ever been talked about.\n\n\u201cWhen I had tough moments at (Richard Childress Racing) and things were bad, we would sit down and we would talk through things and we\u2019d say OK this is what we need to do, this is what I need to do better, this is what I think the team needs to do better. You had real life conversations. Just to drop the hatchet in a surprise meeting with seven days to go is pretty bad business ethics in my opinion.\u201d\n\nRoush Fenway Racing decided to release Stenhouse after Chris Buescher became available.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blindsided by the decision,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to help Ricky though the situation. Spire hasn\u2019t done anything for him all year but it\u2019s their contract that they\u2019re living under.\u201d\n\nSpire Sports + Entertainment issued a statement in response to Harvick\u2019s comment.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cRicky Stenhouse Jr. is not only one of the most talented drivers we have had the opportunity to represent, he is a better person. We were fortunate enough to be with Ricky all the way from his winged sprint car days \u2026 to NASCAR and watched him grow up right in front of our eyes.\n\n\u201cWe went through a lot with Ricky both on and off the track and were always humbled as he approached his life with a Southern matter of factness few have.\n\n\u201cRicky gave us notice that he was terminating our agreement in December 2017. A settlement was reached and he was free to sign with any agency if he so chose to do so. We were puzzled at the comments of Mr. Harvick today as neither RSJ nor Spire had any further obligations to each other. However, Ricky remained a friend to all of us and we continued to cheer him on every weekend. It goes without saying, but he knows we are always here to help in any situation but we respected his decision and his reasons behind it.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked to read this week that Ricky would not be driving for Roush beginning next season. Apparently, his current management team was as well. Finding out this late in the game that you have to find your client a job in a shrinking market can be a little jarring and maybe that was behind the comment. We sympathize with our friends at KHI Management, as well as to our former client who gave his heart and soul to Roush Racing and brought not only wins but championships to that organization.\n\n\u201cIt was not easy watching him struggle in the Cup series while Roush admittedly searched for their footing, yet Ricky continued to give it his all every week. Perhaps it had run its course as we read this week, but we have no doubt that whatever team is fortunate to have Ricky as their driver will reap the benefits of having a driver that stands on the gas every time he is on any type of racetrack and has integrity and values off of it.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019s tried to help Stenhouse, Harvick said Friday:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be a little bit of an assistance in trying to help him forward through a process where he doesn\u2019t have anybody. Ricky has got a great reputation in the garage, well connected. He\u2019s the only driver at Roush Racing that has won races since Carl Edwards left. That\u2019s the unfortunate thing. He\u2019s a Cup winner. He\u2019s a two-time Xfinity Series champion. It\u2019s just a bad timing and it sucks.\u201d\n\nAsked if Roush Fenway Racing should have given Stenhouse more notice that his job was in jeopardy, Harvick said: \u201cI don\u2019t run their business. That\u2019s not the way I would run a business.\u201d", "description": "Kevin Harvick said Ricky Stenhouse Jr. was the victim of a 'really, really, really, really bad contract.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cbgcYGrV7wObdQmAbfkZMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G_xsIMmtg7VG17s7BJ5sfQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/6f1e3da572af755997ab290cff353635", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
