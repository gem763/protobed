They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House,\" Trump announced on Twitter on Thursday morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump's tweet came after the South China Morning Post reported trade discussions would end Thursday, earlier than anticipated.\n\nThe scene: Chinese officials are in Washington for the latest round of high-level trade talks following weeks of lower-level discussions.\n\nThe White House said earlier this week that U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer Robert (Bob) Emmet LighthizerOn The Money: Economy adds 164K jobs in July | Trump signs two-year budget deal, but border showdown looms | US, EU strike deal on beef exports Chinese, US negotiators fine-tuning details of trade agreement: report The Trump economy keeps roaring ahead MORE and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinSenators ask Treasury to probe Brazilian meatpacker with major US footprint On The Money: Judge tosses Trump lawsuit over NY tax return subpoena | US, Japan sign trade deals | Trump faces narrowing window for trade deals | NBA sparks anger with apology to China US, Chinese officials to meet Thursday for trade talks MORE would welcome the Chinese delegation on Thursday to discuss forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, agriculture, enforcement and other issues.\n\nTrump said Thursday evening that the talks had gone well, would continue Friday at the White House and that he was still on track to meet with Liu.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nAppeals court says Deutsche Bank doesn't have Trump's tax returns: Deutsche Bank doesn't have any tax returns belonging to President Trump that pertain to a subpoena from House Democrats, federal appeals court judges in New York said Thursday.\n\nThe appeals court denied a motion from a group of media outlets to disclose the names of individuals whose tax returns Deutsche Bank has in relation to Trump's lawsuit, which was filed in an effort to prevent Democrats from securing his documents.\n\nThe Hill's Naomi Jagoda has more here.\n\nHow we got here:\n\nThe Democratic-led House Intelligence and Financial Services committees issued subpoenas earlier this year to Deutsche Bank for financial records, including tax returns, of Trump, his three oldest children and his businesses.\n\nTrump subsequently filed a lawsuit challenging the subpoenas, and the case is now before the U.S. Appeals Court for the 2nd Circuit.\n\nDeutsche Bank said in a court filing in August that it has tax returns relating to the subpoenas, but the public version of the filing redacted the identities of the taxpayers.\n\nIn its ruling Thursday, the appeals court said the unredacted version of Deutsche Bank's August letter \"reports that the only tax returns it has for individuals or entities named in the subpoenas are not those of the President.\"\n\nSurvey: Two-thirds of economists say manufacturing is in recession: Roughly two-thirds of economists say the U.S. manufacturing sector is in recession, according to a new Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nThe survey found that 65.3 percent of private sector forecasters said manufacturing was in a recession, usually defined by the sector as two consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\nFederal Reserve figures from the summer showed similar contraction at factories, while recent manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) has shown two months of declines.\n\nEconomists surveyed by the Journal also said they see the overall economy slowing as it heads into 2020.

Before becoming a lawmaker, Lowey served as assistant secretary of state for the state of New York.\n\n\"After 31 years in the United States Congress, representing the people of Westchester, Rockland, Queens and the Bronx, I have decided not to seek re-election in 2020,\" she said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to being the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee, Lowey also made history in 2001 when she became the first woman to lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nLowey's accomplishments on Capitol Hill include securing federal funding to rebuild coastal areas hit by Hurricane Sandy, enactment of a bill strengthening the enforcement of drunk driving laws and her work on foreign aid and U.S.-Israel relations.
