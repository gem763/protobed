Lewandowski claimed privilege from the White House counsel and did not disclose private discussions with the president, even though he has never worked for the administration.\n\nThe hearing saw frequent sparring between Democrats and Lewandowski, and between Republicans and Democrats on the committee. Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler called Lewandowski's sometimes combative testimony \"completely unacceptable,\" and said that holding Lewandowski in contempt of Congress is \"certainly under consideration.\"\n\nDemocrats focused their questioning on an incident detailed in the Mueller report on June 19, 2017, when Mr. Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the Mueller probe.\n\nWhen asked by Congressman Steve Cohen about the incident, Lewandowski said, \"The president never asked me to do anything illegal.\" However, he did confirm to Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson that those conversations with Mr. Trump about delivering a message to Sessions did occur.\n\nLewandowski also refused to read passages from the Mueller report on the screens in front of him, telling Congressman Eric Swalwell that he wanted the same \"privilege\" afforded to Mueller, since the special counsel had declined to read directly from the report when he testified.\n\nLewandowski did not refer the request to Sessions, but instead relayed it to Rick Dearborn, a former official. When asked by multiple Democrats why he did not relay the message to Sessions, Lewandowski insisted that it was because he was on vacation. He later said that he wanted to give Sessions the message in a \"relaxed\" setting, but that it slipped his mind.\n\n\"I wanted to get an opportunity to speak with Jeff in a more relaxed atmosphere,\" Lewandowski claimed.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Lewandowski maintained that Mr. Trump had never made any improper requests.\n\nLewandowski also said that he did not lie to Mueller during his interviews with the special counsel \"to the best of my recollection.\"\n\n\"I have not, to the best of my knowledge, lied to the special counsel,\" Lewandowski said.\n\nCiting privilege, Lewandowski later refused to say whether Mr. Trump had offered him a pardon.\n\nWhen asked by Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz why he believed Democrats were pursuing the impeachment inquiry, Lewandowski pulled no punches.\n\n\"I think they hate this president more than they love this country,\" Lewandowski said, to visible surprise from the Democratic members of the panel.\n\nIn another barbed interaction with a Democratic member of the committee, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries asked if Lewandowski was \"a hit man, the bag man, the lookout or all of the above.\"\n\n\"I think I'm a good-looking man,\" Lewandowski responded.\n\nRepublicans on the committee condemned the inquiry, and at one point unsuccessfully moved to adjourn the hearing. Ranking Member Doug Collins also objected to a member of committee staff questioning Lewandowski, referring to the official as a consultant. The messy procedural spat was ultimately tabled, and was indicative of the strained relationship between Republicans and Democrats on the panel. Lewandowski ultimately answered questions from Democratic counsel Barry Berke.\n\nThe tone for Lewandowski's defiant testimony was set in his opening statement, when he noted that he has \"already testified before Congress on three separate occasions\" and called the committee's impeachment inquiry \"unfair.\"\n\n\"To the best of my recollection, I don't recall ever having any conversations with foreign entities \u2014 let alone any who were offering help to manipulate the outcome of the election. As I have said publicly many times, anyone who attempted to illegally impact the outcome of the election should spend the rest of their life in jail,\" Lewandowski said of his time as President Trump's campaign manager.\n\nIn a tweet, Mr. Trump praised Lewandowski's opening statement.\n\n\"Such a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\" Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nLewandowski, who is considering running for Senate in New Hampshire, introduced and promoted a website supporting a potential campaign on Twitter during the hearing.\n\nThe day before Lewandowski's testimony, the White House counsel wrote in a letter that Lewandowski's \"conversations with the President and with senior advisers to the President are protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting Executive Branch confidentiality interest.\"\n\n\"Mr. Lewandowski will testify before Congress regarding matters already made public in the Mueller report. Any information about his communications with the President or with senior advisers to the President not already disclosed in the Mueller report, however, remains confidential,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves said in a statement.\n\nThe White House also directed former officials Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn to defy subpoenas from the committee to appear at the committee's first formal hearing on impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nThe Justice Department wrote in two letters to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone that Porter and Dearborn were \"absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony\" because of their status as former top advisers to the president.\n\nNadler said in a statement Monday that blocking Porter and Dearborn's testimony, and limiting Lewandowski's, was a \"shocking and dangerous assertion of executive privilege and absolute immunity.\"\n\n\"The President would have us believe that he can willfully engage in criminal activity and prevent witnesses from testifying before Congress \u2014 even if they did not actually work for him or his administration,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"If he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment, he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders.\"\n\nThe committee did not glean any new information from Lewandowski's testimony. Mueller testified about his report before the committee in July, and declined to offer further information about his investigation, or say definitively that Mr. Trump obstructed justice by attempting to block the special counsel probe.\n\nLewandowski, a staunch supporter of the president who is mulling a run for the Senate, said in a tweet Tuesday morning that he was \"excited\" to talk about the report.\n\n\"Excited about the opportunity to remind the American people today there was no collusion no obstruction. There were lots of angry Democrats who tried to take down a duly elected President,\" Lewandowski wrote.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee voted Thursday in favor of a new resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry and further intensifying its investigation into Mr. Trump.\n\nWhile mostly technical, the committee's vote also moved to install new procedures for its inquiry, allowing committee chairman Jerry Nadler to designate which committee and subcommittee hearings are related to the probe, give the committee counsel extra time to question witnesses and receive evidence in closed executive session.\n\nRebecca Kaplan and Emily Tillett contributed to this report", "description": "The White House ordered Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn to ignore subpoenas to appear before the House Judiciary Committee", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/445597fd-5181-445c-b7bb-2dc0456960b3/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4ebe7308e2230789d4be3b60bdba8893/lewandowski-ap-19260635957019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
