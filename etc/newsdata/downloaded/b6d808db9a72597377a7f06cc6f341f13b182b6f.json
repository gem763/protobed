She was shocked at the condition of the local public schools, where eighth-graders were performing three grade levels below their peers across the nation in mathematics, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported, \u201cOn average, for each additional year that students stay in DCPS, the less likely they are to succeed, not because they are unable to succeed, but because the system does not prepare them to succeed.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a culture of drugs, crime, and violence was pervasive in D.C.\u2019s low-income neighborhoods in the 1990s. Washington\u2019s rate of violent crime was twice the national average, and nearly two-thirds of the District\u2019s teachers said violent student behavior interfered with teaching, noted The Washington Post in 1996.\n\nIn these dismal circumstances, Ford realized her youngest son, William, already was struggling in the traditional public school and falling in with the wrong crowd. She knew he could not succeed unless he went to a school that was a better fit for him.\n\nFortunately, a neighbor provided a private school scholarship for William.\n\n\u201cWilliam was able to attend a school that I chose, that was in his best interest,\u201d Ford said. \u201c \u2026 In a couple of months I saw this child [go from] being a child who hated to go to school, [who] was failing everything, to this kid [who] was just totally engaged in learning. And when I asked him why, he said that for the first time in his educational experience, he felt like people really cared about whether he learned or not.\u201d\n\nBecause of what happened to her son, Ford wanted to help other children have similar opportunities. She became a leading proponent of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, a private school tuition scholarship for D.C. children that provides up to $13,000 per year for tuition for students from low-income families.\n\nThe program enables students to escape D.C.\u2019s dangerous schools where, even today, many children regularly skip school because they fear bullies, and 1 in 10 students report violent threats or injuries while on school property.\n\nThe scholarship recipients graduated from high school and college at higher rates, and most importantly, families were freed from the district school monopoly.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t set out to fight for school choice or speak up for other children,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI started out as an everyday mother, wanting the absolute best in opportunities for my kids. I quickly found that drive was reflected in the hearts and minds of other parents who also felt trapped in an educational system that was failing their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Virginia\u201d is a proper tribute to a woman who selflessly dedicated her life to helping the nation\u2019s capital\u2019s most vulnerable children.\n\nAlthough she has returned to Little Rock, the movie telling Ford\u2019s story will reach her biggest audience yet\u2014the American people.\n\nD.C. locals can view an exclusive \u201cMiss Virginia\u201d pre-screening on Oct. 7, at 6 p.m. in Sidney Harman Hall.", "description": "When Virginia Walden Ford crossed the threshold of her new high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, as one of the second wave of black students to integrate the school, little did she know these were her first steps in a lifetime journey to champion educational opportunity for all children.\u00a0\n\nFord would go on to help nearly 11,000 children attend their school of choice in Washington, D.C., and her story would be featured in the forthcoming movie \u201cMiss Virginia.\u201d", "authors": ["Jude Schwalbach", "Research Assistant", "Center For Education Policy", "Jude Is A Research Assistant In Education Policy At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-99612568.jpg?itok=8ziLAf41"}
