The first part of her speech, in which she dramatically rebuked listeners for ruining her childhood is getting a lot of attention on social media but in the latter half, she suggested the Green New Deal wasn\u2019t quite good enough.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\u201d Thunberg said. She continued, \u201cYet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words\u2026We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.\u201d She went on to say that she\u2019s tempted to think adults are \u201cevil\u201d because it\u2019s the only explanation for why they haven\u2019t done something more drastic despite knowing they should. Of course, all of these lines get applause at the UN.\n\nBut at least as newsworthy as Thunberg\u2019s emotional statement was her assessment of how long we have to address the problem. \u201cThe popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in ten years only gives us a 50 percent chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.\u201d She added, \u201cA fifty percent risk is simply not acceptable to us, we who have to live with the consequences.\u201d\n\nThunberg didn\u2019t mention the Green New Deal, which calls for decarbonizing the economy in 10 years, but it seems clear she doesn\u2019t think even that is sufficient. In fact, she says we only have 8 1/2 years to do the impossible. \u201cTo have a 67 percent chance of staying below a 1.5 Celcius global temperature rise, the best odds given by the IPCC, the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on January 1, 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons\u2026With today\u2019s emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than 8 1/2 years.\u201d\n\nBack in January, AOC said, \u201cMillenials and Gen Z and all these folks that came after us are looking up and we\u2019re like \u2018The world is going to end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?\u2019\u201d She later claimed her reference to having 12 years to save the world was \u201cdry humor\u201d saying, \u201cyou\u2019d have to have the social intelligence of a sea sponge to think it\u2019s literal.\u201d But clearly, for Greta Thunberg, it is literal.\n\nAOC was right to back away from her \u201cworld is going to end\u201d statement because it\u2019s not supported by the IPCC. The worst-case scenario looked at by the IPCC did involve a 12-year window but it did not suggest the world would end if that deadline wasn\u2019t met. From Reason:\n\nAccording the report: \u201cUnder the no-policy baseline scenario, temperature rises by 3.66\u00b0C by 2100, resulting in a global gross domestic product (GDP) loss of 2.6%,\u201d as opposed to 0.3 percent under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and 0.5 percent under the 2\u00b0C scenario. In the baseline 3.66\u00b0C projection, the estimate of future GDP losses ranged from a low of 0.5 percent to a high of 8.2 percent. In other words, if humanity does nothing whatsoever to abate greenhouse gas emissions, the worst-case scenario is that global GDP in 2100 would be 8.2 percent lower than it would otherwise be.\n\nGranted an 8.2 percent decline in GDP by 2100 would be bad news, but eradicating fossil fuels in the next 8 1/2 years would also do significant damage to the world\u2019s economy. Greta Thunberg and her adult handlers don\u2019t seem concerned about that. They are making AOC sound like a moderate by comparison.", "description": "\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Greta-Thunberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
