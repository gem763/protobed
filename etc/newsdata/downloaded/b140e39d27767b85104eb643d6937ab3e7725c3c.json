The suspect, identified by German media as 27-year-old German Stephan Balliet, filmed the assault and posted the video online.\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said, in a chilling reminder of the mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand last March which was also online in real-time.\n\nPolice subsequently captured the Halle suspect after a gun battle that left him injured.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel joined a solidarity vigil at Berlin\u2019s main synagogue on Wednesday, and firmly condemned the anti-Semitic rampage.\n\nBut Jewish leaders said that words were not enough, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joining calls for German authorities to \u201cact resolutely against the phenomenon of anti-Semitism\u201d.\n\nThe head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany ripped into the authorities for failing to provide adequate security on such a key day.\n\n\u201cIt is scandalous that the synagogue in Halle is not protected by police on a holiday like Yom Kippur,\u201d said Josef Schuster.\n\n\u201cThis negligence has now been bitterly repaid.\u201d\n\nRonald Lauder, who heads the World Jewish Congress, also stressed: \u201cWe need action not words\u201d as he called for round the clock security for Jewish sites.\n\n\u201cWe also need immediately to launch a unified front against neo-Nazi and other extremist groups, which threaten our well-being.\n\n\u201cThe fact that, 75 years after the Holocaust, such groups are gaining influence in Germany speaks volumes.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018We made it out\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn a copy of a 35-minute video obtained by AFP the gunman filmed himself launching into a diatribe against women and Jews, before carrying out the attack.\n\nThe video\u2019s authenticity has been confirmed by the SITE monitoring group but not by police.\n\nThe gunman also published an anti-Semitic \u201cmanifesto\u201d online more than a week ago, according to SITE director Rita Katz, who said the document showed pictures of the weapons and ammunition he used.\n\nIn the video, he was seen trying to force open the synagogue door before shooting dead a female passer-by. He then tried unsuccessfully to blast open the gate of the Jewish cemetery with explosives.\n\nThe man was later seen shooting at a patron of a kebab shop about 600 metres (yards) away from the synagogue.\n\nJewish community leader Max Privorotzki, who was in the Halle synagogue, told the Stuttgarter Zeitung of the harrowing minutes as the site came under assault.\n\n\u201cWe saw through the camera of our synagogue that a heavily armed perpetrator wearing a steel helmet and rifle was trying to shoot open our door.\u201d\n\nBetween 70 and 80 people were in the synagogue then, Privorotzki said.\n\n\u201cWe barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cin between, we carried on with our service.\u201d\n\nAmong those in the synagogue were 10 Americans, as well as several Israelis, who had turned up in Halle especially to join the small local population in celebrating Yom Kippur.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it out with our lives, in health and amazing spirits,\u201d wrote Rebecca Blady, a Jewish American community leader, who was in the synagogue.\n\nThe owner of the kebab shop, Rifat Tekin, meanwhile described the gunman as \u201ccalm like a professional\u201d.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has done this many times. Like me making a kebab, he\u2019s doing this \u2014 like a professional.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Like a professional\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnti-terrorist prosecutors confirmed that they were taking over the probe given \u201cthe particular importance of the case\u201d which involved \u201cviolent acts that affect the domestic security of the Federal Republic of Germany\u201d.\n\nWednesday\u2019s shootings came three months after the shocking assassination-style murder of local pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke in the western city of Kassel, allegedly by a known neo-Nazi.\n\nLuebcke\u2019s killing has deeply shaken Germany, raising questions about whether it has failed to take seriously a rising threat from right-wing extremists.\n\nInvestigators have been probing the extent of suspect Stephan Ernst\u2019s neo-Nazi ties and whether he had links to the far-right militant cell National Socialist Underground (NSU).\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer last month warned of the rising danger of the militant far right, calling it \u201cas big a threat as radical Islamism\u201d.", "description": "Halle (Saale) (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 Jewish leaders demanded action from Germany Thursday to protect the community and face down resurgent right-wing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/2b0e81_people-leave-candles-flowers-vigil-marktplatz-in-halle-eastern-germany-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
