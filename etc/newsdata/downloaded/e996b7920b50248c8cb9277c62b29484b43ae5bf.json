Well, mostly\u2014it\u2019ll still exist, but only as a shell of its former self, as Yahoo is turning the various groups that were once active on the platform into glorified email lists. So, what do you do now?\n\nCome the great Yahoo Groups reckoning, all public groups will become private. Users will still be able to search and join private groups, and admins will retain management rights, but all communication will only be possible via email. And, soon enough, all uploaded data will be wiped from Yahoo\u2019s servers.\n\nYou still have a few days to access and export your groups\u2019 data, though. We\u2019ll show you how to do this, and we\u2019ll also highlight some alternative platforms you may want to consider moving your group to, now that Yahoo\u2019s platform is going, going, gone.\n\nExport your Yahoo Groups data before December 14\n\nStarting October 28, 2019, Yahoo is disabling all uploading- and communication-related features in Yahoo groups, including:\n\nConversations\n\nCalendar tools\n\nDatabase\n\nEmail updates\n\nPolls\n\nMessage Digest and History\n\nThe ability to upload file attachments, folders, photos, and HTML links\n\nEven after these features are disabled, you\u2019ll still be able to access and export your data for a few more weeks, specifically until December 14 2019. After that date, all previously uploaded content will be deleted and lost forever.\n\nTo save your data, head to Yahoo\u2019s official support page and download their export tools. The page also includes step-by-step instructions for saving your personal content for individual users, as well as extracting an entire group\u2019s data (for admins).\n\nAlternatively, some platforms also include tools that can automatically port over your Yahoo Data.\n\nTry these alternatives to Yahoo Groups\n\nThere are plenty of great alternatives for groups in search of a new home. Some of them are better than Yahoo Groups ever was, but one, in particular, stands out from the rest.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nGroups.io is not only a great landing spot for the Yahoo Groups diaspora, replete with tools that will painlessly import your Yahoo Groups data and message history. It\u2019s one of the best message board platforms out there, period.\n\nThe process for creating your own forum is easy, though the service is generous with its features and customisation options if you want to spend a bit more time tailoring things. It also integrates with Facebook, RSS Feeds, Github, Trello, and more, which is helpful if your group is collaborating on a project.\n\nMost importantly, everything you need to quickly set up a new group is available to you immediately. Well, almost everything\u2014you\u2019ll have to pay for some of the more advanced tools and add-on features, but the free package should be more than enough for most users. Honestly, we every Yahoo Group should migrate to Groups.io, but we have an in-depth explainer if you need more convincing.\n\nThe Rest\n\nIf you aren\u2019t into Groups.io and still need more suggestions, these other popular services might do the trick:", "description": "It\u2019s finally happening: Yahoo Groups is shutting down.
