The previous statute extended the exclusion zone to areas outside the farm, where workers and others might come into close proximity to the process and equipment used to spread pesticides.\n\nThe new proposal would also no longer mandate family members living on farms to leave during pesticide application times. Instead they can choose whether to voluntarily leave or stay on any homes or in any structures on the farm land.\n\nEPA head Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: EPA chief touts benefits of deregulation for environment | Trump officials weaken fish protections Interior chief once lobbied against | USDA watchdog to probe handling of climate reports EPA chief espouses benefits of agency's environmental deregulation EPA moves to implement Trump order on scaling back industry guidance MORE called the rule changes more \u201ceffective and easier to implement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn listening to input from stakeholders, our proposal will make targeted updates, maintaining safety requirements to protect the health of those in farm country, while providing greater flexibility for farmers,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCritics argue the rule significantly shrinks worker and family protections established under the EPA\u2019s Worker Protection Standard (WPS), by allowing more chances of contact with often harmful and cancer-linked chemicals and pesticides.\n\n\u201cThe EPA continues to betray farmworkers and the recommendations agreed to by stakeholders, including industry government and farmworkers, in meetings held over two decades by weakening the measures urgently needed to protect farm workers and their loved ones,\u201d said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health program director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n\u201cFarm workers and their families continue to be poisoned by pesticides, and if anything, the WPS must be strengthened, not weakened.\u201d\n\nBurd argued the new changes would largely benefit farm owners at the expense of farm hands who work in close proximity to the chemicals.\n\n\u201cOver and over, the concerns of farm owners are represented, echoing that they appreciate not being bound by burdensome rules. But they don\u2019t have any farm worker voices stating how these rules will affect them,\u201d she said of EPA\u2019s press release on the rule.\n\nIris Figueroa, attorney at Farmworker Justice, said the rule would expressly shrink large chunks of the measures established in the exclusion zone rule, which went into effect in January 2017.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that it threatens to increase exposure to toxic pesticide drift, reverting back to the pre-AEZ era where EPA and others recognized that off-target drift was a significant public health problem and that simply requiring no contact was not sufficient,\u201d Figueroa said.\n\nThe Trump administration has weathered several instances of criticism related to pesticide regulations. In July, the EPA expanded the use of pesticide considered \"very highly toxic\" to bees. That same month the agency announced it would not halt Chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked with brain damage from being sprayed on crops. Starting next year, the state of California will ban the chemical entirely.", "description": "A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule proposal would shrink enforcement responsibilities for farmers by narrowing the areas they must restrict human contact during pesticide applications, a move the agenc", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/migrant_farm_workers2_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
