A week early?!\" wrote another.\n\nPenguin Random House would not confirm how many copies were sent, but The Guardian put the figure at 800.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Penguin Random House said: \"In the US a very small number of copies of Margaret Atwood's The Testaments were distributed early due to a retailer error which has now been rectified.\n\n\"We appreciate that readers have been waiting patiently, in some cases for more than 30 years, for the much-anticipated sequel to the bestselling The Handmaid's Tale. In order to ensure our readers around the world receive their copies on the same day, our global publication date remains Tuesday 10 September.\"\n\nThe Testaments is the most eagerly-awaited title of the year, and comes 34 years after Atwood's original. It has already been shortlisted for The Booker Prize.\n\nThe error angered other retailers, who said they would be punished if they made the same mistake, and suspected Amazon would not face the same consequences.\n\nThe American Booksellers Association expressed its \"strong disappointment regarding this flagrant violation of the agreed protocol in releasing this book to the public\".\n\nLexi Beach, owner of New York's Astoria Bookshop, said she had to sign an embargo agreement promising that copies of the book would be \"stored in a monitored and locked, secured area and not placed on the selling floor prior to the on-sale date\".\n\nThe strict security measures included sending review copies to critics with a fake title and cover, according to the Washington Post's Ron Charles.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Margaret Atwood speaking in 2016 about The Handmaid's Tale and the state of US politics\n\nThe reviews are in - 'A success', 'a giddy thrillride' and 'less devastating'\n\nThe Testaments is \"an entirely different novel in form and tone\" compared with its predecessor, Ron Charles wrote.\n\nAunt Lydia, one of the handmaids' matriarchal mentors, is one of three narrators in the new book - \"a brilliant strategic move that turns the world of Gilead inside out\", the Washington Post critic said.\n\nHe added: \"The Testaments is not nearly the devastating satire of political and theological misogyny that The Handmaid's Tale is. In this new novel, Atwood is far more focused on creating a brisk thriller than she is on exploring the perversity of systemic repression.\"\n\nThe Guardian's Alex Clark said The Testaments was \"a success that more than justifies her Booker Prize shortlisting\", and \"a rallying cry for activism\", with brutality that is \"still shocking\".\n\nIt \"takes us to a subtly altered Gilead and in many ways a more hopeful one\", she wrote.\n\nImage copyright Channel 4 Image caption The TV version of The Handmaid's Tale will return for a fourth series\n\nAccording to a review by The Telegraph's Serena Davies, which contains spoilers, the new book \"has the dramatic thrust and power to shock to scorch the memory\".\n\nIt is \"a blockbuster of propulsive, almost breathless narrative, stacked with twists and turns worthy of a Gothic novel\", she wrote.\n\nIn The New York Times's review, which also contains major spoilers, Michiko Kakutani wrote: \"Atwood's sheer assurance as a storyteller makes for a fast, immersive narrative that's as propulsive as it is melodramatic.\"\n\nThe author's powers \"are on full display\", according to The Los Angeles Times' Susan Straight, while USA Today's Barbara VanDenburgh declared that The Testaments was \"worthy of the literary classic it continues\".\n\nThe book picks up 15 years after the end of the original, and the other two narrators are a young woman raised in a powerful Gilead family and the other from a 16-year-old Canadian girl.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Handmaid's Tale TV stars include Elisabeth Moss (left) and Samira Wiley\n\nDespite the darkness of the original, Slate and Vox both agreed that the follow-up was \"fun to read\".\n\n\"It's a romp. But that giddiness is also what makes The Testaments feel slighter than The Handmaid's Tale,\" wrote Vox's Constance Grady.\n\nIt has \"a corker of a plot\", according to Slate's Laura Miller, who noted that Atwood had been influenced by the TV series, which has gone beyond the plot of the original book. \"Its tone hews closer to the series than to the novel that precedes it,\" she wrote.\n\nThe Hulu TV series, starring Elisabeth Moss, which airs on Channel 4 in the UK, has been renewed for a fourth season.\n\nHulu will also adapt The Testaments for the small screen, according to Time Magazine, but it's not yet clear whether Atwood's new story will be folded into the existing show or developed as a separate drama.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
