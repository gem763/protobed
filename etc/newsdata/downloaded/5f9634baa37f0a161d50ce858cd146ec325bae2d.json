Ashley Giles, the director of cricket who appointed him, praised an \u201coutstanding\u201d home-grown coach whose strong relationships can link up the national team with the domestic game and make them \u201cthe most respected\u201d in the world.\n\nEngland experience a boon for Chris Silverwood but it\u2019s a big step up | Vic Marks Read more\n\nSilverwood, who said he hopes his elevation inspires other English coaches, sets out towards this lofty goal with a tour to New Zealand that departs at the end of the month. A deliberately raw squad play five Twenty20 games \u2013 the start of the road to the World Cup in Australia next year \u2013 before Joe Root\u2019s Test side, now fourth in the rankings, face a two-match series and then four in South Africa after Christmas.\n\nWith the white-ball set-up so well grooved after the summer\u2019s 50-over World Cup win and Eoin Morgan\u2019s recommitment to the captaincy, Giles restated that the needle must now be nudged back towards Test cricket. Silverwood, witness to the 2-2 Ashes draw from close quarters, views this as a return to some basic long-form principles.\n\nHe said: \u201cJob number one is helping Joe Root, supporting him, making sure the Test team start moving forward so when we go to Australia in two years\u2019 time we can make a real impact out there.\n\nAustralia retain the Ashes after England fail to save fourth Test at Old Trafford Read more\n\n\u201c\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ll look at is building a batting group that can bat long periods of time, stack up and put pressure on the opposition. It sounds old\u2011fashioned but we\u2019ve got to recognise that. We need the right people in the right places in the order.\n\n\u201cAnd then we want to create a bowling attack that is absolutely relentless. We saw an example this summer: the Aussies were fit, strong and made our lives really difficult.\u201d\n\nRoot is nearly three years into his Test captaincy and while fortunes have ebbed and flowed, there has been a sense that, at times, he has tried too hard to emulate the one-day team\u2019s buccaneering approach.\n\nSilverwood is confident his fellow Yorkshireman is on board with dialing it down a touch, something signposted by the call-up for Dom Sibley \u2013 Warwickshire\u2019s opener faced 1,009 more balls than the next most obdurate batsman in Division One this year \u2013 and Root\u2019s own return to No 4.\n\n\u201cJoe and I had a good long conversation,\u201d Silverwood said. \u201cI want to make sure that from the get-go Joe and I are aligned. So what I\u2019m talking to you about now are Joe\u2019s thoughts as well.\u201d\n\nWith this shift in outlook came an acceptance from Silverwood that Test results may not follow immediately. Players must have time to adapt \u2013 \u201csome cogs will turn faster than others. I saw that at Essex\u201d \u2013 and a fear of failure must not creep in. \u201cThey can come in and they can spread their wings and they can fly,\u201d he said.\n\nSilverwood therefore represents a continuation of the relaxed environment under his predecessor Trevor Bayliss. But less than a week into the job he has already had one off-field incident to address, after photographs taken at the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association awards dinner last week emerged showing Ben Stokes with his left hand on the face of his wife, Clare, amid an alleged altercation.\n\nClare Stokes has since said that this is how the couple show affection towards each other, rather than something more sinister, while Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, stated his satisfaction that, following conversations with the pair and others present, the context was \u201cinnocent\u201d.\n\nSilverwood, who has similarly spoken to the all-rounder since, said: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, all the questions have been asked. And it\u2019s done. I wasn\u2019t there. [But] I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve been told. It\u2019s a lesson for everybody. You know, they are high profile [cricketers]. You\u2019ve got to be careful because innocent things can be taken out of context.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Silverwood stressed the midnight curfew for England\u2019s cricketers \u2013 implemented during the aftermath of the Bristol incident in 2017 \u2013 will remain in place. But bar this, and while acknowledging he must take a step back from being the ever\u2011amenable bowling coach, he wants to empower his charges.\n\n\u201cPeople are the centre of my coaching philosophy and seeing them do well, with their dreams and what they\u2019re trying to do, makes me smile,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I do it. I want to create self-thinking, self-sufficient cricketers that will be successful and if we can do that, you know what, it\u2019ll make me smile.\u201d", "description": "Chris Silverwood, the new England coach, said he wants his team \u2018to bat long periods of time\u2019", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fffc1a5697d62d4b98e4b6a89fe0036c5af1c3d/0_171_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab7c79cd033e79725cc07ab23e00ed6e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
