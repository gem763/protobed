And I saw Eight years worth of it, so I know what I'm talking about.\n\n'Accountability and Responsibility don't mean s*** to these people.'\n\nThe 48-year-old actor went on to claim that he experienced discrimination during his time working with Huffman on set of the drama.\n\nChavira continued: 'I saw Eight years worth of it working on Housewives.\n\n'I've seen a lifetime of it being a halfbreed, and I've struggled w the intricacies of it on a daily basis w all the cultural bias I've received on both ends. But whatever. Slap on the wrist. Sorry, but this s***.'\n\nFelicity Huffman's former Desperate Housewives castmate Ricardo Chavira has slammed her 14-day sentence as 'white privilege'. The actors are pictured together here on the show\n\nFelicity Huffman (pictured last month leaving court with husband William H. Macy) was sentenced to 14-days in prison after pleading guilty in the college admissions cheating scandal\n\nOne follower questioned him on why he had to bring race into the argument in a now-deleted post and the actor was not afraid to respond.\n\nHe wrote: 'But it's not about race. Tired of stupid people and their stupid arguments. If you haven\u2019t lived it, you really have no say. Stay in your lane.'\n\nChavira - who starred with the actress on all eight seasons of Desperate Housewives - took to Twitter to blast the 56-year-old actress for her 'slap on the wrist' sentencing\n\nHis fellow co-star Longoria had written Huffman a letter of support for her 161-page sentencing memorandum.\n\nLongoria shared that Huffman supported her when she was bullied at work in her early days of fame.\n\n'I \u2026 know these things may sound like first class problems or small insignificant moments. But to a young, naive, Mexican girl who felt like I didn\u2019t belong, those gestures meant the world to me,' Longoria wrote.\n\nThe Eva Longoria Foundation philanthropist continued explaining that she has seen Huffman do good for young people.\n\n'The most special part about this is that my charities were always for children of the Latino community \u2026 There were so many times Felicity was the only white woman in the room helping me improve the lives of these brown faces and families. I will never forget that.'\n\nTh actor did not pull any punches when he responded to his former co-star's sentencing\n\nHuffman and Chavira pictured top left with their fellow castmates Eva Longoria, Brenda Strong and Nicollette Sheridan at the 11th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2005\n\nHuffman was embroiled in the Operation Varsity Blues college admissions cheating scandal where she paid admissions consultant Rick Singer $15,000 to forge daughter Sophia's SAT answers after she took the test.\n\nTHE DRAMA OFF SCREEN AT DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES Eva Longoria has already credited Huffman for helping her 'survive' bullying on the set of the show. She wrote: 'I dreaded the days I had to work with that person [I was being bullied by] because it was pure torture. Eva, who stopped short of naming the bully, added: 'Until one day, Felicity told the bully \"enough\" and it all stopped.' Series creator Marc Cherry said in another note to support Huffman that 'we had a problematic cast member on my show'. He wrote: 'She was a big star with some big behavioral problems \u2026 Everyone tried their darnedest to get along with this woman over the course of the show. It was impossible. And things went from bad to worse.' He wrote that the hostility reached a tipping point during season seven when 'this woman decided she would no longer speak to her fellow cast members' between scenes, and Felicity still 'insisted' on greeting the castmember with kind words. And Nicollette Sheridan sued Cherry in 2012 for 'wrongful termination' after she was accused of being a 'negative presence on set for years' before her character, Eddie Britt, was killed off. After an on-set spat between Sheridan and Hatcher, Cherry recalled that Nicollette told him that Teri was 'the meanest woman in the world.' He also testified that Sheridan would 'make insulting comments' during table reads and showed up on set not knowing her lines.\n\nThe actress pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud in the scheme and was sentenced to 14 days behind bars and $30,000 in fines. She shares the daughter with actor husband William H. Macy.\n\nThe Desperate Housewives star is set to report to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California on October 25 where she will spend two weeks.\n\nShe was additionally sentenced to a year of supervised release, 250 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine for mail fraud and honest services wire fraud.\n\nThe College Board \u2014 which administers the exam \u2014 determined that there was no evidence the teen knew her mother had an SAT exam proctor correct her wrong answers.\n\nHuffman and Macy also have a 17-year-old daughter, Georgia.\n\nFollowing the scandal, it was reported that Sophia's relationship with her parents 'exploded' and the family have been in therapy since Huffman's arrest.\n\nBut Sophia and her father appeared to put on a united front as they strolled hand in hand in Vancouver on one of the teenager's off-days.\n\nHuffman likely couldn't travel out of the country due to her sentencing and upcoming jail time.\n\nIn a statement released after her sentencing, Huffman said she has 'learned a lot about her flaws' following the scandal.\n\nShe said in a statement: 'I accept the court's decision today without reservation. I have always been prepared to accept whatever punishment Judge Talwani imposed. I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\n\n'I would like to apologize again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions.
