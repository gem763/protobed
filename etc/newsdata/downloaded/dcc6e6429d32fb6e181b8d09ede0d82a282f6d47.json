He also thanked Makhura.\n\n\"It has been a great pleasure to serve the people of Gauteng and I have no doubt that the 6th administration will take the Province forward by remaining focused on the task at hand of growing an inclusive and transformed economy that creates jobs for the unemployed,\" his statement reads.\n\nThe ANC NEC decided that in provinces with male premiers, 60% of the executive had to be female.\n\nMakhura, however, had 50/50 representation. This resulted in the party leadership in the province, also headed by Makhura, holding countless meetings with numerous leagues and structures in a bid to retain the status quo.\n\nNews24 earlier reported that ANC insiders had suggested Ramokgopa could be deployed to national government where there is a vacancy in the department of minerals and energy, following the death of deputy minister Bavelile Hlongwa. Ironically, this move could see Ramokgopa once again caught up in a debate about gender parity, this time at a national level.", "description": "Gauteng Economic Development, Agriculture and Environment MEC Kgosientso Ramokgopa has resigned from Premier David Makhura's cabinet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9176/0ae964cca52849cd8c1ca6bf4ea2b296.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
