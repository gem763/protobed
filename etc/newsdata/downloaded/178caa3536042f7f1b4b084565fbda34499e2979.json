When he holds a fundraiser at one of his properties, not only do donors contribute to his campaign, his business collects funds from his campaign for space rental and catering, some of which ultimately ends up in his pocket.\n\nBut 48 Republican members of Congress also spent campaign money at Trump businesses through their campaign and affiliated committees, according to the center. Some of the top spenders for the 2020 cycle included campaigns for former Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin ($21,000), who resigned last month, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s brother, Indiana Rep. Greg Pence ($14,000), Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio ($12,000) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California ($8,000).\n\nSpending will continue to grow as the election nears. Senate Republicans are hosting a two-day \u201cSave the Senate\u201d retreat at Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel early next month, according to The Intercept. Room rates during that time will be nearly triple the average, according to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThe top preferred businesses by spenders were Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, followed by his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, according to the center. Trump\u2019s Doral golf resort in Miami was in fifth place for the amount of incoming campaign expenditures. Trump had planned to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of world leaders at the Doral until he backed down amid controversy over steering the business to his own property.\n\nProPublica reported in April 2018 that campaigns and public expenditures at Trump businesses had already reached $16.1 million. It examined not only campaign spending reports to the FEC but also state government spending and federal agency expenditure records. It created an interactive spending graphic through May 2018.\n\nWhenever Trump says he's not taking a government salary, remember this:\n\nGovernment officials have visited Trump properties 1,502 times.\n\nTrump has been president for 1,011 days.\n\nThat's nearly 1.5 visits each day Trump has been in office. https://t.co/6tVDHb9DeB \u2014 Citizens for Ethics (@CREWcrew) October 28, 2019\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTrump\u2019s Elaborate Scheme To Get Around His Emoluments Problem Proves He Has One\n\nCaving To Pressure, Trump Cans Plans To Hold G-7 At Trump Doral\n\nMulvaney: Trump Still Considers Himself To Be In Hospitality Business\n\nTrump Continues To Defend Doral Choice Even After Giving In\n\nRep.
