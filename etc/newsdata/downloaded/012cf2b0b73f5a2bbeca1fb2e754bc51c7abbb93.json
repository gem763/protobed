Or alternatively you might choose to allow a few extra days after the tour to relax or to undertake some further exploration. The choice is completely yours and we can usually arrange anything from simply additional accommodation and transfers to full tailor-made itineraries. Here is just a small sample of what you could do:-\n\nArmenia \u2013 head across the border to Armenia and we would be happy to tailormake any itinerary for you in this fascinating country.\n\nSvaneti \u2013 if you enjoy mountain walking, you could visit the north-west of Georgia to experience one of the most stunning parts of the Caucasus region. Allow 7-10 days.\n\nAzerbaijan \u2013 take a trip east to see Georgia\u2019s very different neighbour. The Silk Road crossroads town of Sheki and the bizarre capital of Baku are just some of the highlights that await. Allow 4-6 days.\n\nPlease contact the office for more details and to discuss your individual requirements.", "description": "Georgia\u2019s beauty is legendary and takes many forms.
