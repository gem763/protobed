Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Barratt Developments can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nView our latest analysis for Barratt Developments\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Barratt Developments paid out a comfortable 40% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 78% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.\n\nIt's positive to see that Barratt Developments's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nLSE:BDEV Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Barratt Developments's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. It paid out more than three-quarters of its earnings in the last year, even though earnings per share are growing rapidly. Higher earnings generally bode well for growing dividends, although with seemingly strong growth prospects we'd wonder why management are not reinvesting more in the business.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Barratt Developments has delivered an average of 63% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past six years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs Barratt Developments worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Barratt Developments paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Barratt Developments, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Barratt Developments PLC (LON:BDEV) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 2 days time.
