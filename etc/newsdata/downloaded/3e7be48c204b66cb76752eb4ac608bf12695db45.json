But after applying for asylum they are in hiding in Uganda, fearful that authorities from home are looking for them.\n\n\u201cThe only way for you to survive is by getting out (of Eritrea) and we all know this,\u201d Mewal told The Associated Press in a telephone interview this week. \u201cI had to take this opportunity because if I didn\u2019t take this one who knows how long it would have taken me.\u201d\n\nEritrea\u2019s government under President Isaias Afwerki is one of the most tightly controlled regimes in the world, ranked with North Korea and Syria by Freedom House. Opposition parties in the East African nation are prohibited, and human rights monitors say an independent judiciary is nonexistent. Eritrea\u2019s system of indefinite national service and forced military conscription are meant to control the population, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nQuestions sent to Eritrea\u2019s soccer association and government brought no immediate response.\n\nThe four young Eritreans described their life as part-time soccer players and part-time military conscripts, where they were required to build roads, guard buildings and follow the army\u2019s whims. Though they had special status as soccer players they were still arrested for basic activities like walking in the street in a group.\n\n\u201cIf you are more than two people hanging out there is always suspicion that you are organizing something,\u201d said one player, Hermon Fessehaye Yohannes. Everyone is required to have \u201cpermission papers\u201d from the government that allows them to travel in the streets, the players said.\n\nHermon recalled being stopped one night while walking from his work to his home, a distance of roughly 100 meters. His permission papers were at home and a policeman stopped him and refused to listen to his pleas.\n\n\u201cHe started beating us up with a stick,\u201d Hermon said, asserting that he was then briefly taken to jail. \u201cThis is our daily normal life, this is how we live.\u201d\n\nIt was impossible to independently confirm the incident.\n\nEritrean athletes, especially soccer players, have been known to defect while traveling abroad. In 2012, 17 soccer players defected while in Uganda. Some players reportedly have been forced to pay a bond worth nearly $7,000 to ensure their return.\n\nThe newly defected players said their interest in soccer was sparked by the professional team Manchester United. While playing in the streets of the capital, Asmara, they heard that the team was the best in the world.\n\n\u201cThey were our first inspiration,\u201d Mewal said.\n\nThe players said their love of soccer transformed into a way to support their families and eventually escape the country.\n\n\u201cI knew since I was a child the only way to get out of Eritrea was to be a footballer,\u201d said Simon Asmelash Mekonen.\n\nThe players said their escape plan began when they landed in Uganda. \u201cThe previous days whenever we tried there were a lot of people guarding over us, watching us, it was just impossible,\u201d Mewal said.\n\nBut after defeating Zanzibar and scoring five goals, the team was in a celebratory mood. The players asked permission to go for a walk, then called the only person they knew in Uganda and defected.\n\nBut now they fear that Eritrean authorities are searching for them as they wait for word on their asylum claims with the Ugandan government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen to us next,\u201d Hanibal Girmay Tekle said. \u201cWe cannot go outside.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer representing them, Kimberley Motley, said in a letter to the United Nations requesting support that \u201cmy clients believe that they will be repatriated back to Eritrea by the authorities and therefore respectfully request to be resettled to another country.\u201d The letter describes how the players were forced into military service at the age of 17.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency in Uganda, Duniya Aslam Khan, said Uganda\u2019s government is responsible for granting asylum and that she could not share information regarding the players\u2019 claims.\n\nA spokesman for the office of Uganda\u2019s prime minister, Julius Mucunguzi, said he wasn\u2019t aware of the asylum claim but said the Eritreans might not have included the detail that they are soccer players.\n\n\u201cOur doors are open to anyone from anywhere who is seeking safety and security and is fleeing from danger,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doors of Uganda are open to get the safety they need.\u201d\n\nMewal said he just wants to go \u201csomewhere safe.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Soccer gave Mewal Tesfai Yosief hope in an Orwellian nation, a job in a country of forced military conscription and, possibly, freedom at last.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Justin Lynch"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
