Speaking to reporters in Iowa later, Biden said he would seek to \"build on the squeaky clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House.\"\n\n\"No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in meetings as if they're a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country. Period,\" Biden said.\n\nIn a blistering speech in New Hampshire Wednesday, Biden joined his rivals in calling for the president's impeachment, saying Trump \"believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal, political needs.\"\n\nAt a union forum Sunday Biden went further, saying that while he may have been the last Democratic hopeful to call for his impeachment, \"I'm the only reason there is impeachment going on.\n\n\"This is the most corrupt administration in modern American history,\" he said.", "description": "It comes as he has faces criticism from Democratic rivals for his dependence on traditional high-dollar fundraising events.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4230178/1000x563_nbc-190920-joe-biden-ew-154p_09485f14821c855acdfb7412f668c919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
