What could they possibly have to argue about, and why are they arguing about it so publicly? I would very much like to be removed from this narrative, except the curiosity has taken up so much space in my brain! I\u2019m watching Hustlers, sobbing over Antonio Banderas \u2014 and yet, there in the back of my mind is the reminder that I absolutely must know what is going on between James Cameron and this diver, what they\u2019re arguing about, and why.\n\nYou might\u2019ve missed it. Listen, there\u2019s a lot going on, and I get it. Succession is getting even better. The Emmys are Sunday. But this random feud between James Cameron and a diver \u2014 ahem, sorry, superrich adventurer \u2014 is unmissable. It has drama! Science! Emails! I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve taken enough time for it. We live in a society where two incredibly rich men are fussing over their mutual hobby in the pages of the New York Times. Once upon a time, James Cameron said he literally only cared about Avatar: \u201cI\u2019m in the Avatar business. Period. That\u2019s it.\u201d But he\u2019s in another business now, too: sending a rich guy emails disputing a very rich achievement. Sometimes there is a beef so delicious \u2014 a little too absurd, a little too banal \u2014 to ignore. It\u2019s not as good as the great unseasoned rap beef of last year, but it\u2019s close: Let me welcome you to the rabbit hole that is James Cameron versus Victor L. Vescovo.\n\nHunter. Let\u2019s start with the players: Who is James Cameron?\n\nFirst of all: Lol. You know exactly who James Cameron is, you clown! He\u2019s a very famous director, the big personality behind Titanic and Avatar, and eventually those Avatar sequels he\u2019s been talking about for almost a decade.\n\nRight, right. And Victor L. Vescovo? I hate to say it, I hope I don\u2019t sound ridiculous. I don\u2019t know who this man is!\n\nVictor L. Vescovo is a very, very rich guy. Kind of like a Renaissance man who looks like Donald Sutherland. Vescovo, who is from Dallas, is the co-founder and managing partner of private-equity company Insight Equity Holdings, according to The Guardian. (You can find his LinkedIn here.) When he\u2019s not making a lot of money \u2014 and I mean, like, Succession money \u2014 Vescovo is an explorer and adventurer. He\u2019s only the 12th American to reach both North and South Poles and climb the seven summits.\n\nSo what is he exploring this time?\n\nVescovo\u2019s current goal is to dive to the deepest point of each of Earth\u2019s five oceans.\n\nBut why?\n\nI really don\u2019t know why anyone does anything, to be honest. I\u2019m just on a life journey that takes me from one BLT to the next.\n\nSo what\u2019s the drama here? Why are Vescovo and James Cameron fussing?\n\nWell! In April, Vescovo said that he\u2019d piloted a submersible into the ocean\u2019s deepest area, the Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean. According to a statement from Vescovo\u2019s team, his expedition reached a \u201cmaximum depth of 10,928 meters / 35,853 feet deep, 16 meters.\u201d Vescovo said his dive was 52 feet deeper than any previous manned dive.\n\nLast month, according to the New York Times, Vescovo said that he\u2019d completed \u201cthe world\u2019s first manned expedition to the deepest point in each of the five oceans,\u201d which includes the Challenger Deep. This whole thing will be a Discovery Channel miniseries.\n\nWhat does James Cameron have to do with that?\n\nKnown ocean stan James Cameron has also ventured down to the Challenger Deep, and holds the previous record for the deepest solo dive ever. On his own 2012 expedition, Cameron even tweeted from it:\n\nJust arrived at the ocean's deepest pt. Hitting bottom never felt so good. Can't wait to share what I'm seeing w/ you @DeepChallenge \u2014 James Cameron (@JimCameron) March 25, 2012\n\nThe whole thing became a documentary for National Geographic.\n\nTell me what this known shade queen, James Cameron, said about Vescovo\u2019s dive.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s done is quite remarkable,\u201d James Cameron told the Times. \u201cWhere I take exception is his saying he went deeper.\u201d He implied that Vescovo misrepresented the depth of his own dive, and of the Challenger Deep: \u201cYou can\u2019t go deeper. [The Challenger Deep is] flat and featureless,\u201d he said. \u201cSo his gauge may read differently from mine, but he can\u2019t say he\u2019s gone deeper.\u201d\n\nBut wait, why would James Cameron talk about this at all? Isn\u2019t he in blueface on Pandora, working on Avatar?\n\nExcuse me, please don\u2019t silence him. Instead, enjoy this truly enviable paragraph, from the Times:\n\nThe interview was done at Mr. Cameron\u2019s request and marks the first time he has publicly criticized Mr. Vescovo\u2019s claim. He did so from Wellington, New Zealand, where he was filming an \u2018Avatar\u2019 sequel. The initial email inquiry from an assistant read, \u2018Request to Speak.\u2019\n\nLmao.\n\nI know, right?\n\nBut is James Cameron technically correct? Is it possible to go deeper?\n\nHe\u2019s probably right \u2014 James Cameron happens to know more about the ocean than I do, and also other smart ocean people seem to agree with him. According to the Times, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod agrees with the director. The leader of Woods Hole\u2019s robot team told the Times that it doesn\u2019t seem probable that Vescovo found a deeper part of Challenger Deep.\n\nMeanwhile: Vescovo said the depth of his dive has been revised to be 13 feet shallower, but he\u2019s still claiming that his dive was deeper.\n\nWhat\u2019s the extent of the beef? Have they exchanged words in person?\n\nJames Cameron sent Vescovo an email to address his misgivings about the record. Vescovo told the Times that he planned to respond \u201cin the next day or two.\u201d\n\nFjkaldfjkdla; jfdlafja\n\nI know, right!!! \u201cPerhaps we will never know,\u201d Vescovo said in a follow-up email to the Times. \u201cAll I can do is stand behind the actual data.\u201d\n\nOh my God, I\u2019m loving this.\n\nDid you ever expect to learn so much about the ocean today?\n\nWho\u2019s side are you on?\n\nBetween a man making 19 more Avatar movies and a man not making 19 more Avatar movies, I must choose the dark-sided, chaotic neutral of James Cameron. It is morally incumbent that my allyship lie with any person who employed Billy Zane in the \u201990s.\n\nUpdate, 1:56 p.m.: Some days you don\u2019t get a call from a very rich adventurer to discuss the ocean, but some days you do get a call from a very rich adventurer to discuss the ocean! Today is one of those days: Victor Vescovo, our new favorite diver, Renaissance man, and Donald Sutherland look-alike, emailed Vulture to say that he read our coverage of the James Cameron ocean dispute, and was happy to phone and discuss it all in more detail.\n\nVescovo, delightfully jovial over the phone, first gave some background on the dive in question. \u201c[James Cameron\u2019s] argument isn\u2019t that he dove deeper, he\u2019s saying there\u2019s no way I could dive deeper. It\u2019s pretty flat, but it\u2019s a three- to four-square-mile area,\u201d Vescovo said of the Challenger Deep. \u201cWe went a little bit deeper. We published what the instrument said. We dove that area three or four times, and our sensors said we went to this depth.\u201d Vescovo added that his sensors were calibrated by an outside agency, and he\u2019s offered to submit his readings to a third-party scientific panel for review.\n\nA third-act twist in this story: Cameron and Vescovo have corresponded before! \u201cHe can be remarkably engaging and helpful,\u201d Vescovo told Vulture over the phone. Ahead of his own Challenger Deep dive, he and Cameron exchanged emails about the ocean and diving, and Vescovo said that he has a lot of respect for the Titanic director. \u201cI love the Terminator movies,\u201d he said. \u201cI love Avatar. I watched Titanic on the Titanic!\u201d Let it be known that Vulture has formally revised our allegiance: Until I get a call from James Cameron, we are team Vescovo, baby!", "description": "This random feud between James Cameron and a diver \u2014 ahem, sorry, superrich adventurer Victor L.
