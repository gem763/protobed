Just before the meeting, Trump had tweeted that it was \u201cFake News,\u201d designed to \u201ccreate the look of turmoil in the White House, of which there is none.\u201d\n\nBolton denied the charge, but the Afghanistan issue turned out to be a tipping point.\n\n[John Bolton puts his singular stamp on Trump\u2019s National Security Council]\n\nAmong accumulated grievances that had been building for months, the president was annoyed that Bolton would regularly call on members of Congress to try to get them to push Bolton-preferred policies on Trump, according to a senior official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Many on Bolton\u2019s handpicked staff were seen as unnecessarily confrontational with other parts of the national security bureaucracy.\n\nTrump had been inundated with complaints, officials said. Pence and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were awaiting Trump\u2019s arrival Monday afternoon in Fayetteville, found Bolton increasingly abrasive and self-promoting.\n\nPompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had told Trump that his national security adviser was not helping him, officials said. Bolton had even refused, in recent weeks, to go on television and defend the president\u2019s policies on Afghanistan and Russia.\n\nBolton, the president felt, wasn\u2019t loyal. He wasn\u2019t on the team.\n\nAfter Trump made his views known, Bolton offered to resign. Trump, Bolton later insisted, said they would discuss it the next day. It was the last time he saw the president.\n\n\n\nThen-national security adviser John Bolton answers journalists\u2019 questions in Minsk, Belarus, on Aug. 29, 2019. (Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe had the meeting then thought about it for a few hours, especially since the president wasn\u2019t exactly begging him to stay on and he had had enough,\u201d said a person familiar with Bolton\u2019s thinking.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Bolton handed a two-sentence letter to an aide for delivery to Trump, and left the building. \u201cI hereby resign, effective immediately...\u201d There was nothing about spending more time with his family, no praise or well-wishes for the president.\n\nBut just before noon, Trump stole his thunder, announcing in a terse tweet that he had fired his third national security adviser in a row. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the administration,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was probably coming,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, who called it \u201cas much a personality conflict as anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president had gotten into a situation where he didn\u2019t like reading about some stuff in the paper,\u201d Graham said, and \u201cit got to be a breakdown of trust\u201d that had \u201cpretty well shut down\u201d the policy process among national security agencies.\n\n[Collapse of the Afghanistan peace talks spotlights internal Trump administration divisions]\n\nAt the White House, those outside the inner sanctum were stunned when Trump\u2019s tweet appeared. At the Pentagon, there were cheers. When Pompeo appeared at an unrelated news briefing shortly after Trump\u2019s tweet, he rebuffed frantic questions about Bolton, saying he wouldn\u2019t talk about the administration\u2019s \u201cinner workings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed, that\u2019s to be sure,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cBut that\u2019s true for lots of people with whom I interact.\u201d\n\nThen Pompeo smiled. That smile, one official close to Pompeo said, \u201cspoke for itself.\u201d\n\nA known hawk\n\nIn the wake of Bolton\u2019s departure, a number of senior administration officials and Republicans close to the White House \u2014 all of whom spoke only on the condition of anonymity about internal White House business \u2014 offered up long lists of those who would not mourn him. They included first lady Melania Trump, Pence, Mulvaney, Pompeo, Mnuchin, countless Defense Department officials and numerous international leaders.\n\nBut at the time of Bolton\u2019s appointment, after Trump fired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster in April of last year, abrasiveness appeared to be what the president was looking for \u2014 a more in-your-face figure to replace McMaster\u2019s military-like organization and policies.\n\nTrump could hardly have been unaware of what he was getting with Bolton. A take-no-prisoners official in the administration of George W. Bush, where he strongly supported the 2003 Iraq invasion and used a seat as United Nations ambassador to push a hard line foreign policy, Bolton had spent the wilderness Obama years as a conservative think tanker and Fox News pundit. He advocated regime change in Iran, a preemptive strike against North Korea, and the severing of U.S. ties to international agreements and organizations he viewed as weak and accommodating.\n\nHis appointment, coinciding with that of Pompeo\u2019s \u2014 one of the most virulent Iran hawks in Congress before the newly elected Trump had named him to head the CIA \u2014 to replace the out-of-\n\nfavor Rex Tillerson as secretary of state gave a new muscularity to administration foreign policy. By the end of the year, the turnover was complete with the resignation of former defense secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n[Emerging from his silence, Mattis faces criticism for trying to take the \u2018middle road\u2019 on Trump]\n\nEven as he began grumbling privately about Bolton in recent months, and surveying other advisers and friends about possible replacements, Trump publicly praised his pugnacious qualities.\n\n\u201cHe has strong views on things, but that\u2019s okay. I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing,\u201d Trump said during an Oval Office news conference in May. \u201cI\u2019m the one that tempers him. That\u2019s okay. I have different sides. I have John Bolton and other people that are a little more dovish than him. I like John.\u201d\n\nDivisions over policy\n\nWithin a week after Bolton came aboard, Trump authorized a missile strike against Syria. A month later, he withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement. Both were seen as signals of Bolton\u2019s arrival.\n\nBut Bolton also lost a lot of battles over a year and a half in office \u2014 among them, Trump\u2019s outreach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un; his abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria and accommodate Turkish concerns over America\u2019s Kurdish Syrian allies; his friendly relationship with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin; the president\u2019s professed willingness to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani; and the Pompeo-led negotiations with the Taliban that began in October.\n\nWhether Bolton was responsible for the leaks \u2014 he has insisted he was not \u2014 word of his views always managed to be publicly revealed, even as Trump and others grew suspicious and started to work around him, most visibly on North Korea.\n\nTrump came to view Bolton as a potential spoiler for a landmark nuclear deal with the isolated country and repeatedly excluded him from important meetings. During Trump\u2019s second summit with Kim in Hanoi, Trump ordered that Bolton not be included in a dinner meeting with senior U.S. and North Korean officials.\n\nWhen Trump made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone in June, Bolton left early for Mongolia out of concern that his presence could hurt U.S. diplomatic initiatives, U.S. officials said.\n\nU.S. officials said Bolton never believed Kim would surrender his nuclear arsenal and hoped the talks would collapse so that the United States could return to a maximum pressure campaign. He advocated persistently against an interim deal in Hanoi that would exchange some sanctions relief for partial denuclearization. When Trump walked away from that agreement, Bolton aides touted it as an achievement by the national security adviser.\n\nWorsening relations between the United States and Iran also created tensions between Trump and Bolton. In June, after Trump decided against ordering a military attack on Iran after it downed an unmanned U.S. drone, Bolton was \u201cdevastated,\u201d said one U.S. official familiar with the matter.\n\nBolton\u2019s consistent advocating for harder economic sanctions against Iran rankled U.S. allies and went beyond the desires of Pompeo. State Department officials grew frustrated when leaks about sanctions policy deliberations appeared in neoconservative outlets such as the Washington Free Beacon. The distrust between Pompeo and Bolton\u2019s team led the top diplomat to instruct his aides against consulting with Bolton\u2019s team on Iran, in particular Rich Goldberg, the National Security Council\u2019s director for countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction, said officials familiar with the matter.\n\nAfghanistan as catalyst\n\nOn Tuesday, when word that Trump had fired Bolton exploded across Washington, Bolton told colleagues and confidants that he had never discussed Pence\u2019s comments on anything, ever, with anyone outside the president\u2019s policy circle. Bolton allies viewed the charge as a way to \u201cknife John on the way out,\u201d one person close to him said, calling it \u201cflatly untrue.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s own frustrations with Trump had simmered in recent weeks as he became vexed by what he saw as the president\u2019s policy indecision. The two men got along well on a personal level \u2014 although their relationship was somewhat distant \u2014 but Bolton began to tell friends that he had deep philosophical disagreements with Trump on the world and policy and they weren\u2019t fixable.\n\nAlthough he saw his exit as the culmination of problems rather than something out of the blue, Afghanistan was the catalyst.\n\nNever happy with the decision to negotiate with the Taliban over a peace deal to end the war, Bolton was particularly disturbed that Pompeo had been given the lead role.\n\nUnder Pompeo, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad had changed the parameters of U.S. policy on the issue. Several administrations had refused to talk to the militants, insisting that they should negotiate an end to the war only with the Afghan government. But Trump\u2019s insistence that he wanted to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, and a conclusion that there would be no military victory by either side there, had led Pompeo and Khalilzad to believe that the United States should negotiate its own exit directly with the Taliban, even while using that leverage to force eventual inter-Afghan talks.\n\nBy summer, it was clear that a deal was in the making, and late last month, Khalilzad came to Washington to report that agreement had been reached to withdraw about 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops, in exchange for a Taliban agreement to sever ties with al -Qaeda and ensure that no terrorist attack on the United States would ever again be launched from Afghanistan. Talks with the Afghan government, and a cease-fire, would come later.\n\nBolton thought it was a bad deal, as did many others. But Trump was more than intrigued at the idea of fulfilling his campaign pledge of troop withdrawals, and proposed finalizing the deal himself at a Camp David meeting he would host for Afghan government and Taliban leaders.\n\nBut as that plan came under criticism across the board, the president began to look for a way out, eventually seizing on the killing of a U.S. service member Thursday in a Taliban attack. Prodded by Bolton and others opposed to the negotiations, he decided to cancel the deal altogether, tweeting out his position on Saturday evening.\n\nWhen news stories Sunday and Monday depicted Bolton as victorious, his demise became just a matter of time.\n\nRobert Costa, Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker, Missy Ryan, Dan Lamothe and Souad Mekhennet contributed to this report.", "description": "Bolton said he resigned.
