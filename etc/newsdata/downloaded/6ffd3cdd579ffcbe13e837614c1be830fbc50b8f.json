The administration released the aid earlier this month, and lawmakers have called for an investigation into who directed that delay and whether it was related to pressure on Ukraine from the president and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nUkrainian officials earlier this month expressed concern to U.S. senators that the aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting pressure to investigate Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cThey worried the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness at the time to investigate the Bidens,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), who earlier this month met in Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Murphy\u2019s remarks.\n\nSunday, Mr. Trump confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that he discussed Mr. Biden with Mr. Zelensky in a July phone conversation. Messrs. Trump and Giuliani have pressed for an inquiry into Mr. Biden\u2019s anticorruption efforts in the country while he was vice president and while his son Hunter Biden had business interests there. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general at the time said earlier this year he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son. On Saturday, Joe Biden said he had never discussed with his son any overseas business dealings and accused Mr. Trump of abusing his office.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday again tried to revive the accusations of impropriety against the Bidens in Ukraine. The president also said he wasn\u2019t concerned that his conversation with Mr. Zelensky could fuel calls for impeachment. White House officials, meanwhile, said they are reviewing whether to release a transcript of the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats are now raising questions about whether the president successfully enlisted others in the Trump administration to carry out the pressure campaign. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine told Mr. Murphy earlier this month that it wasn\u2019t involved in demanding the Ukrainian president mount an investigation, a statement that Mr. Murphy took as a sign that diplomats had refused to get involved because they believed such conduct was improper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now concerned that I didn\u2019t get the full story,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThe fact that [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo is now refusing to say whether the State Department was involved may suggest that there was some work being done by others in the administration beyond the president himself.\u201d\n\nA State Department spokesman said Monday that at the request of Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations put Mr. Yermak in touch with Mr. Giuliani. The spokesman said Mr. Giuliani was acting \u201cin a personal capacity as a lawyer for President Trump\u201d and didn\u2019t speak on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\nThe examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart is likely to escalate this week as Congress continues to probe a whistleblower complaint concerning Mr. Trump, an aspect of which involves the Ukraine call, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) urging him to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d to stop Mr. Trump from withholding the complaint from Congress and to request that the White House to release a transcript of the call with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint was submitted last month to the inspector general of the intelligence community, who deemed it a significant matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d Federal whistleblowing law generally dictates that such a complaint should be sent to the congressional intelligence committees, but Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, has refused to do so.\n\nMr. Maguire is to appear this week before both the Senate and House intelligence committees, where he will be asked about his decision not to share the complaint.\n\n\u2014Rebecca Elliott, Siobhan Hughes and Courtney McBride contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump suggested a link between his administration\u2019s review of military aid to Ukraine and his efforts to persuade the Ukrainian president to pursue damaging material on rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109865/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
