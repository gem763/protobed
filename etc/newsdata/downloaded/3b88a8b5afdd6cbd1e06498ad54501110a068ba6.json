Detectives were forced to admit their error and rushed to the house, only to find he had vanished.\n\nNow, in response to a formal complaint from a former Cabinet Minister about their \u2018inept\u2019 handling of the case, police have repeated their astonishing mistake.\n\nGwent Police first declared two years ago that Andrew Newton was \u2018deceased\u2019 following an investigation into the plot to kill Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe\u2019s ex-lover, Norman Scott\n\nMr Scott, 79, said: \u2018How can I have any confidence that this investigation has been taken seriously? It\u2019s as though justice is some kind of game\u2019\n\nAfter a six-month probe, Gwent\u2019s Professional Standards Department rejected the complaint, saying in a letter: \u2018Many key individuals are now deceased, including Andrew Newton.\u2019\n\nBut laughing off the claim, Newton\u2019s former girlfriend Patsy Frankham insisted yesterday: \u2018He is alive and well.\u2019 And last night, Mr Scott, 79, said: \u2018How can I have any confidence that this investigation has been taken seriously? It\u2019s as though justice is some kind of game.\u2019\n\nGwent Police yesterday apologised for the \u2018inaccuracy\u2019.\n\nThe error was made in a letter to Lord Hain, who had demanded answers about the role of Dennis Meighan in the Thorpe affair on behalf of Mr Scott. Five years ago, Meighan, now 72, admitted to the MoS that he was offered \u00a313,500 by Newton and a \u2018representative\u2019 of Thorpe in 1975 to silence Mr Scott.\n\nThorpe and three others were acquitted at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to murder\n\nMeighan agreed but later changed his mind and went on to confess to police. But he claims his role was covered up to protect Thorpe.\n\nNewton was convicted of shooting Mr Scott\u2019s dog Rinka in 1976. Mr Scott said Newton also turned the gun on him but it jammed.\n\nThorpe and three others were acquitted at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to murder and Mr Scott believes that had Meighan\u2019s involvement not been expunged, the outcome may have been different.\n\nMr Scott said: \u2018I feel like I\u2019m banging my head against a wall. People think I am lying about something but I am not. Next week it will be 44 years since Newton tried to murder me and still there is no justice.\u2019", "description": "Gwent Police first declared two years ago that Andrew Newton was 'deceased' following an investigation into the plot to kill Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe's ex-lover, Norman Scott.", "authors": ["Ian Gallagher", "Nick Constable For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19635550-0-image-a-2_1570913033045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
