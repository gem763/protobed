Doug Collins demands hearings on Justice IG's probe of FISA abuses", "language": "en", "text": "The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Republican on Friday demanded hearings on a now-completed investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general concerning alleged surveillance abuses by the department and the FBI.\n\nRep. Doug Collins said the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, notified Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday that his report is complete. Mr. Collins\u2019 comments came in a letter to committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, calling for hearings on Mr. Horowitz\u2019s findings.\n\nNow that Mr. Barr has a copy of the report, the department will review and comment on it, Mr. Collins said. Then the report heads to the Judiciary Committee and will be made public.\n\nMr. Collins said it is imperative that the Judiciary Committee calls Mr. Horowitz and FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the Judiciary Committee be the first House committee to query the Inspector General about his findings and Director Wray about steps he is taking to ensure any abuses do not reoccur,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe inspector general team examined the October 2016 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application and renewals authorizing the surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nThe applications relied heavily on an unverified, anti-Trump dossier compiled by former ex-British spy Christopher Steele.\n\nRepublicans have alleged the dossier, which was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, intentionally left out Mr. Steele\u2019s anti-Trump bias.\n\nDemocrats and the FBI have countered that they acted appropriately and disclosed their concerns about Mr. Steele.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, has already pledged to hold hearings on the FISA warrants once Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report is publicly available.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
