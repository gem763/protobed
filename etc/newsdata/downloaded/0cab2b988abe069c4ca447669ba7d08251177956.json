It is the best phone in that price range, and it\u2019s actually competitive with more expensive phones in one very important way: the Pixel 3A has a great camera.\n\nFor the past few years, buying a new smartphone meant following a nigh-unbreakable rule: if you wanted a good camera, you needed to spend at least 600 bucks. That, or you needed to find an older iPhone or take a shot on something used or refurbished. On the flip side, less expensive Android phones have become remarkably good recently, but they still followed the rule because their cameras are almost universally mediocre.\n\nThe $399 Pixel 3A ($479 for the larger 3A XL) doesn\u2019t follow that rule. While it has many of the same compromises you usually make when you buy a cheap phone, the photos it takes are nearly indistinguishable from what comes out of a Pixel 3. Depending on where and when you buy it, the Pixel 3 can cost $200 or $300 more.\n\nIn 15 years of reviewing phones, I am not sure if I\u2019ve ever been able to write the following sentence: a $400 phone has a camera that\u2019s among the best you can get on any smartphone.\n\nThe rest of the Pixel 3A may not blow you away, but it ain\u2019t bad, either.\n\nAt first glance, the Pixel 3A phones look nearly identical to the most expensive Pixel 3 phones. The 3A models are just a little bit taller, which might be due to the extra space needed to accommodate \u2014 get this \u2014 a real 3.5mm headphone jack on the top. The bottom speakers are down-firing instead of front-facing, but otherwise, the aesthetics are extremely similar to the Pixel 3.\n\nThey have the same matte / glossy back with a fingerprint sensor circle in the middle of them. The screen sizes are very close \u2014 though the 3A XL doesn\u2019t have the unsightly notch of the 3 XL \u2014 and the 3A phones even use OLED panels under the glass. These phones don\u2019t look or feel cheap at all even though they have plastic bodies instead of metal. (Like everyone else, Google calls them \u201cpolycarbonate.\u201d) The 3A and 3A XL come in black, white, or a new color called \u201cpurple-ish\u201d (which looks like pale lavender to me).\n\nThe Pixel 3A (as well as the Pixel 3, now) is going to be sold by more carriers in the US. Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, and Google Fi will all carry it and, more importantly, support it with financing options and in-store troubleshooting. That\u2019s an odd thing to mention in a phone review, but it matters. Many Pixel owners have had a hard time getting repairs or replacements without having physical stores to go to.\n\nInternationally, carrier support will be about the same as what Google has now, but unfortunately, the prices in the UK are \u00a3399 and \u00a3469, respectively, which my colleague Vlad Savov rightly called a \u201crough conversion rate.\u201d\n\nPixel phones run Google\u2019s version of Android, which is generally simpler and easier to understand than the variants you get from Samsung, LG, or Huawei. It\u2019s more aggressive at pushing some Google services than those other phones, but the trade-off is you are guaranteed to get the latest Android updates as soon as they are available for three years from the time the phone is released.\n\nThe Pixel 3A takes photos that are nearly indistinguishable from what you get out of a Pixel 3, which, until very recently, was the undisputed best camera on a phone. It is among the best smartphone cameras on the market today. It\u2019s better than the camera on the iPhone XR, and it\u2019s in the same league as (if not better than) the cameras on the Galaxy S10 and the iPhone XS.\n\nThe 12.2-megapixel sensor and f/1.8 lens on the back are the same as the Pixel 3, as is the single 8-megapixel selfie cam on the front. The only hardware difference is that the Pixel 3A lacks Google\u2019s custom Pixel Visual Core processor, so it has to do its image processing on the main CPU and GPU.\n\nThat change may lead to some different image processing choices, but if so, they\u2019re super hard for me to spot. The main difference is that images take longer to save. The camera takes about two seconds to fully launch from the lock screen, but after that, it has an instant shutter. It also supports all the same camera features as the Pixel 3: Night Sight, dancing AR cartoons, Top Shot, and the new Time lapse feature coming to all Pixel phones.\n\nJudging the best smartphone cameras on the market today takes you quickly into the quibble zone. You end up zooming all the way in to the pixels on a professional monitor and talking about ISOs and crunch and subtle differences in contrast. You argue about which of the portrait mode models for cutting around your head to blur the background is the least bad (because none of them are great).\n\nWe did a bit of that, comparing the Pixel 3A to the Pixel 3. A lot of the differences we saw could be explained away simply by how difficult it is to take two identical photos with different devices in the real world. Forced to decide, I\u2019d say the Pixel 3 photos seem very slightly better in contrast and detail in some cases. But the reality is this: without Adobe Lightroom, a calibrated monitor, and a photography expert talking you through the differences, you probably won\u2019t notice them.\n\nThere are other cameras that have bested the Pixel 3 in some ways. Notably, the Huawei P30 Pro has a better zoom and mystifyingly good low-light shots. As for video, I couldn\u2019t really discern that much of a difference between the Pixel 3 and the 3A. But that\u2019s not entirely good news, as the Pixel 3 can\u2019t quite stand up to iPhones and Galaxy phones for video quality.\n\nBut \u2014 and I really do hate to keep harping on this \u2014 all of those phones cost about twice as much as the Pixel 3A. I cannot stress enough how remarkable it is to have a camera this good on a phone at this price.\n\nGrid View With Night Sight on\n\nNight Sight off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortrait mode can struggle with tougher shots, but does okay\n\nSelfie camera portrait mode \u2014 better on humans than cats\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one important photo difference between the Pixel 3A and the Pixel 3: free backups to Google Photos. On the Pixel 3, you get free unlimited backups of the original resolution photos you\u2019ve taken with the phone. The Pixel 3A is limited to free \u201chigh quality\u201d backups, and it makes you pay for more storage if you upload too many original quality photos, just like any other phone. I suppose that\u2019s one way to help get to that $399 price, but I think it\u2019s a cheap move.\n\nBy now you\u2019re probably thinking: fine-looking phone, great price, good software, great camera\u2026 what\u2019s the catch? Well, there are a few big ones and lots of little ones. Every smartphone \u2014 especially every inexpensive smartphone \u2014 has trade-offs. Google had to pick some battles to win and some to lose to hit this price point. If you aren\u2019t spending north of $700 to buy a phone, you\u2019re going to have to give a few things up.\n\nPixel 3A / 3A XL specs Display: 5.6 inches, 2220 x 1080 (3A); 6 inches, 2160 x 1080 (3A XL)\n\nDragontrail Glass\n\nSize and Weight: 6.0 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches, 147g (3A); 6.3 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches, 167g (3A XL)\n\nBattery: 3,000mAh (3A); 3,700mAh (3A XL)\n\nMemory: 4GB LPDDR4x RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 670: 2.0GHz + 1.7GHz, Adreno 615 Graphics\n\nRear camera: 12.2-megapixel with optical + electronic image stabilization; f/1.8 aperture\n\nFront camera: 8-megapixel with f/2.0 aperture, 84-degree field of view\n\nThe most important catch is speed. The Pixel 3A is not fast. You will absolutely notice it when you\u2019re opening an app for the first time in a while because it will take a second or so longer to load than it would on more expensive phones. When you take a photo that requires some kind of more intense processing \u2014 like HDR or portrait \u2014 that will take longer, too. Webpages tend to load in instead of snapping instantly into place. You\u2019ll notice it, especially if you\u2019re coming from a relatively recent high-end phone.\n\nAnd then you won\u2019t \u2014 or at least I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m a longtime Pixel user, and within minutes of using the phone, I wasn\u2019t put off by the lag. It didn\u2019t occur to me that I was using a phone with a slower processor because I just never perceived a lag. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being some kind of apologist here, either. I\u2019ve shown this phone to several of my colleagues and asked if it felt slow, and the universal response has been \u201cI guess, maybe? But it seems totally fine to me.\u201d\n\nThe Pixel 3A uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 processor, which is a new-ish midrange processor that\u2019s a bit of an overachiever. It\u2019s not as fast as a Snapdragon 845 (Pixel 3) or 855 (Galaxy S10 and lots of other 2019 phones). It\u2019s nowhere near as fast as the processor in the iPhone XR or XS.\n\nStill, once an app is up and running, it\u2019s just as good as it would be on a Pixel 3. Heck, I even managed to stay alive for several half-hour PUBG mobile games without adjusting away from the default high graphics settings.\n\nOne note of caution: the Pixel 3 has earned a reputation in the Android community for inexplicable slowdowns. Some of those problems have been improved with software updates, but not all. Over time, lots of phones have a tendency to slow down. If you have a phone that already starts slower than a flagship out of the gate, it could be a risk that it won\u2019t have the staying power of a more expensive phone.\n\nThe second catch is the screen. A great screen has become a must-have for a phone to be considered \u201cpremium,\u201d and it\u2019s a big part of what you\u2019re paying for. The best screens on the market go edge to edge with wraparound sides. They have incredibly high resolutions, near-perfect color reproduction, and get blindingly bright. Some even have high refresh rates, which make them feel like you\u2019re moving a physical object instead of coaxing pixels into disappearing and reappearing as you scroll.\n\nThe Pixel 3A doesn\u2019t go in for any of that, but it is, nevertheless, a better screen than you would normally get on a phone at this price range. It\u2019s OLED, for one thing, which means that you get perfectly black blacks and an always-on display to show you the time and notifications. The front panel may be surrounded by a plastic rail, but it is real hardened glass. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s Dragontrail glass instead of Corning Gorilla Glass. Unfortunately, I have no idea yet if that means it\u2019s more crack or scratch prone.\n\nI noticed a bit of variation in screen temperatures across the Pixel 3A, 3A XL, and the regular Pixel 3 modes. The 5.6-inch Pixel 3A, in particular, was a little warmer than it probably should have been. If you\u2019re familiar with the history of Pixel phones, I\u2019ll put it this way: both 3A models have more color-accurate screens than the Pixel 2 XL.\n\nOn a $1,000-plus phone, you should absolutely nitpick the screen. It should be a pristine expanse of bright, completely invisible pixels. I don\u2019t think a $400 phone needs to be held to the same standard, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should accept crap. This isn\u2019t a crap screen. It\u2019s good, and I had no problems with it.\n\nThe last big catch is a combination of overall build quality things. Premium phones are usually made of metal; this one is made of polycarbonate. It doesn\u2019t have glass that melts around the edge of the frame. There are big bezels above and below the screen (but no notch). You won\u2019t get a second camera on the front or the back. The fingerprint sensor is on the back instead of sitting under the screen, and you absolutely won\u2019t get a face unlock feature here.\n\nI didn\u2019t really miss any of those things. No, the Pixel 3A doesn\u2019t feel like a \u201cpremium\u201d phone, but it is, nevertheless, well-designed. It\u2019s simple and comfortable. The only real adornment is the classic Pixel\u2019s two-toned finish on the back: the top of it is glossy; the majority is matte. It still supports the squeeze-to-launch Google Assistant feature. You can pick from three colors with twee names: \u201cjust black,\u201d \u201csimply white,\u201d and \u201cthe new purple-ish.\u201d\n\nThere is one build quality trade-off that I wish Google hadn\u2019t made: the Pixel 3A isn\u2019t water resistant. Everything else about this phone \u2014 including the price \u2014 makes you feel like it can be a knock-around device that you don\u2019t have to worry about. But you will have to worry about it getting doused with liquid.\n\nThere are a lot of little things you\u2019ll miss out on with the Pixel 3A. Some of them might matter to you, but I strongly suspect most will not:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have front-facing stereo speakers. The bottom speaker fires downward. But it still gets plenty loud and sounds all right.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t support wireless charging. This one\u2019s a bummer, but it\u2019s not surprising.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have the fastest possible networking. If you are on a Wi-Fi network that could push through more than 600 Mbps, you won\u2019t be able to achieve that. (You are almost surely not near such a network.)\n\nThe only storage option is 64GB, and there\u2019s no SD card support to expand it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t support Daydream VR.\n\nIt can\u2019t do wide angle selfies like the Pixel 3 can.\n\nI\u2019m annoyed enough by the fact that you don\u2019t get Google Photos original resolution backup for free to mention it again.\n\nAdd up all of those catches, from the speed to the screen to the build quality to the above list. Are those things worth $300 or more? For a lot of people, the answer is clearly yes. Especially in an age when people are upgrading their phones less frequently and amortizing the cost of them over two or three years, I can definitely see the case for buying the nicest thing you can possibly afford and hanging on to it for as long as possible.\n\nBut I really think that, for a lot of people, the answer is no. That\u2019s because that list of catches doesn\u2019t include the stuff that usually makes a cheap phone suck. The Pixel 3A has an excellent battery life, for example. Both the small one and the big one lasted all day for me, with screen-on time well north of four hours, which is better than what I get on a Pixel 3.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t filled with the kind of bloatware that manufacturers usually lade cheap phones with in a desperate bid to offset the cost and increase the profit margin. It\u2019s just a clean, Googleified version of Android. That does mean that it\u2019s a little more Google in places like the home screen, the camera, and Assistant, but that\u2019s a damn sight better than what sub-$500 phones usually get.\n\nThe biggest catch you don\u2019t have to deal with is the one I\u2019ve already droned on about: cheap phones have always had bad cameras. The Pixel 3A has an excellent camera.\n\nAlso, it has a headphone jack.\n\nAm I recommending this phone? Yes. If you want a phone between 300 and 500 bucks, you won\u2019t find a better option.\n\nIn a head-to-head comparison with all of the phones you\u2019re probably familiar with, from the iPhone X lineup to the Pixel 3 to the Galaxy S10, the Pixel 3A will lose. I don\u2019t know if the cost savings and the expanded carrier support will be enough to make this phone popular.\n\nBut I do know this: I have been waiting for Google to make this exact phone for something like five years. Google used to make phones that were ridiculously good for the price. 2013\u2019s $349 Nexus 5 is still the pinnacle of an inexpensive, excellent phone. Since then, prices across the industry have gone up, up, and up again. So I am glad Google is getting back to those roots. This is the kind of phone Google should be making: something really good and really affordable.", "description": "If you want to buy a new smartphone that costs between $300 and $500, you should buy a Pixel 3A or Pixel 3A XL.
