While they showed that 88 per cent of claims were approved, the data excluded withdrawn claims \u2013 a key problem, given the level of withdrawn claims is an issue that ASIC feels deserves closer inspection as it may suggest consumers are abandoning faulty claims processes.\n\nThe lobby group argues withdrawn claim numbers are falling too, but can\u2019t quantify this as it doesn\u2019t have the data. Nonetheless, the FSC argues that even if you assume withdrawn claims have been steady, there has still been an appreciable increase in overall payment rates.\n\nASIC\u2019s response? Things might be getting better, but there\u2019s still a heck of a lot of work to do.", "description": "Insurers and superannuation trustees need to work hard to ensure total and permanent disability cover is actually delivering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.9116%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/000362f8c86074bc4ecafc3eafa480deb6f3d937", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
