The bus hit a tree and 23 people were injured, the paper said.\n\nMvurume got out to help the accident victims but was hit by a truck.\n\nThe Herald said: \"It is suspected that the driver of the truck.. panicked after seeing hordes of people by the roadside.\"\n\nZimbabweans complain that the heavy presence of police at fine-seeking roadblocks has done little to bring down the high incidence of traffic accidents in the country.\n\nEarlier this month 15 people were killed near Bulawayo in a horrific accident blamed on a pothole. It's estimated that five people die in road crashes in Zimbabwe daily.", "description": "An off-duty doctor who stopped to help victims of a serious road accident in Zimbabwe was hit by a lorry and both his legs were broken, a press report says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4239/42582d4460f54eb6a4032c7a1cc22fbd.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-29"}
