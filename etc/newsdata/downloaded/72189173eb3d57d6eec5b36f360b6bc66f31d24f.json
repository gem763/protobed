They were created by British aristocrats who had time and money to splash out on mock castles, towers and monuments.\n\nTheir golden age was the 18th century when they flourished on great estates such as Stourhead in Wiltshire, or Stowe in Buckinghamshire.\n\nHilltop towers, obelisks, arches as well as outright ruins started studding the landscape, and the Gothic Revival, which became a national obsession during the 19th century, saw increasingly romanticised and macabre examples take hold, from ornate towers to eerie grottoes.\n\nThere followed a lull in folly making, excepting such notable schemes as Portmeirion in Wales, as made famous by TV show The Prisoner. Then began a renaissance.\n\nIn 1991, John Van Hage designed a show garden for the Chelsea Flower Show called Forgotten Pavilion. It featured a triple-arched gothic folly and won Best in Show.\n\nThe folly was provided by Redwood Stone, which has gone on to become a byword for folly design-and-build in the UK.\n\nRedwood Stone was invited to exhibit in its own right at Chelsea and Hampton Court Flower Shows, and the company won a 2019 Tradestand Award at Hampton Court for a design that not only combines fluted Ionic columns, Roman arches and cloister windows but also artfully screens a hot tub.\n\nOn the market: With eccentric touches Leicestershire: This five-bedroom house is in the village of Cold Overton. The kitchen has an Aga and outside there is a folly which mimics a ruined building.Struttandparker.com, \u00a31million West Sussex: The Priest\u2019s House is a Grade II-listed Jacobean cottage in the South Downs National Park. It has three bedrooms and views of Racton Monument folly. Jackson-stops.co.uk,\u00a3795,000 Lincolnshire: In Pinchbeck, Labyrinth Cottage has three bedrooms. In the garden, there\u2019s a 50ft spiritual labyrinth based on the one in Chartres Cathedral. Fineandcountry.com, \u00a3400,000\n\nOwner Tim Redwood believes this is part of a trend: \u2018We\u2019re seeing increasing demand for marrying the quirky aesthetics traditionally associated with follies, and more functional, modern requirements, be they hiding unsightly features or protecting clients from prying eyes.\u2019\n\nWhat does it mean to acquire such a folly? David Constable has been through the experience of creating one from scratch.\n\nHe lives in East Sussex, near Brightling, an area rich in follies thanks to the patronage of a local 18th century squire named John \u2018Mad Jack\u2019 Fuller.\n\n\u2018I needed a place to put compost when I cut the grass,\u2019 he says. \u2018Our lawn is big and I wanted a spot in the middle. I thought, a folly could screen the compost compartments.\u2019\n\nConstable used Redwood Stone. The idea evolved into a romantic ruin fashioned from salvaged brick and stone with gothic window arches that frame views of a pinetum from one side and, from the other, the Constables\u2019 house. There are various issues to be aware of. One is planning regulation.\n\nConstable says: \u2018I don\u2019t live in a conservation area or face listed building regulations, and I don\u2019t have problems with neighbours, but make sure to check whether you need planning permission.\u2019\n\nYou will need enough space to set your \u2018eye catcher\u2019 off to best effect. \u2018It can become quite personal,\u2019 says Constable. \u2018It\u2019s important not to rush things.\u2019\n\nAs always, get good advice, and set a budget. The Constables\u2019 folly cost \u00a322,000, but the stonework for a simple design may amount to just a tenth of that. Would Constable do it all over again?\n\n\u2018I already am,\u2019 he says. \u2018A horse-and-cart driver regularly slows at a viewpoint in the adjoining lane and points my folly out to his passengers, referring to it as \u201cthe old village abbey\u201d.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s encouraged me to create a second one, a brick-and-stone buttressed wall in a different part of our garden, as if we unearthed more of \u201cthe old abbey\u201d.\u2019\n\nAnother approach might be to acquire a property like Simon Scott\u2019s old house that has a folly, or you could even buy a house that is a folly and has been made habitable.\n\n\u2018About half of the properties we sell are listed and the quirkier ones always excite interest,\u2019 says Peter Hughes, a partner with estate agents RH & RW Clutton at Petworth in West Sussex.", "description": "The appeal of follies is nothing new.
