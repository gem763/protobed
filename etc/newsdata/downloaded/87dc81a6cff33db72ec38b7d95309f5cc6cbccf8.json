Joao Moreira, Zac Purton and Karis Teetan as dominant as ever", "language": "en", "text": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing. Have something to say? Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost.\n\nTreble up for the Magic Man at Sha Tin \u2013 @HongKong_Racing\n\nAs Joao Moreira, Zac Purton and Karis Teetan continued on their merry way at Sha Tin on Sunday with seven of the 10 winners between them, the remaining 16 jockeys riding at the meeting had to make do with the scraps. It is a familiar feeling for them.\n\nThat triumvirate has collected 41 of the 77 races (53.25 per cent) in 2019-20 with the other 19 riders on the roster (who have ridden this season) sharing the rest, but no one else has more than four winners.\n\nThere is a serious imbalance, despite everyone \u2013 almost to a man \u2013 noting how much more competitive the riding ranks are this term.\n\nLast season, the Moreira, Purton and Teetan trio accounted for 342 victories of the 820 on offer (41.7 per cent), with 32 of their rivals accounting for the other 478 winners.\n\nThat number is slightly skewed because Moreira missed the first three months of the season when he was in Japan, while when he returned he didn\u2019t have as many options as normal because of the restrictions he faced as John Size\u2019s stable rider. It should be a little higher.\n\nNow, we are only eight meetings into the new season (not even 10 per cent), so it is a small sample size and can change quickly, but the early trend is there for all to see \u2013 they\u2019re dominating again.\n\nMost of that is down to the nature of Hong Kong \u2013 owners and trainers like winners and when you\u2019re operating at the level of Purton and Moreira in particular, you call the shots and get first right of refusal on a lot of the key chances in any given race. There aren\u2019t that many.\n\nMoreira, Purton and Teetan are all riding at or near the top of their games and their names and reputations carry serious gravitas with owners. They are the only three riders with full books for the Happy Valley meeting on Wednesday night.\n\nIt makes life incredibly difficult for everyone else, who can be bumped from a ride with a phone call or text, despite doing nothing wrong.\n\nThat is the unfortunate reality of life in Hong Kong \u2013 there are only two meetings a week and it\u2019s hard to ride winners if you\u2019re not getting many real chances.\n\nTake Lyle Hewitson, for example \u2013 of his 30 rides, only one has started at a single-figure price.\n\nThe 21-year-old is a seriously good jockey \u2013 you don\u2019t win back-to-back premierships in South Africa at his age if you\u2019re not \u2013 but things haven\u2019t gone his way yet. He\u2019s working really hard and hopefully it will turn for him.\n\nBlake Shinn is one of the most accomplished and highly rated jockeys to come to Hong Kong in recent years, but he is another who just can\u2019t build any momentum. He is riding well without luck \u2013 13 of his 42 rides have finished second or third.\n\nMatthew Poon Ming-fai is a great example of making the best of what he is offered. He is the most profitable jockey at Sha Tin \u2013 if you had HK$10 on every one of his 42 rides, you would have made HK$1,606.\n\nTwo of his three winners have come at $176 and $21, but the other (Quadruple Double) was $4.50. It\u2019s the only time he\u2019s ridden a favourite or second favourite this whole season and he won. It suggests he deserves more opportunities.\n\nAlberto Sanna is another interesting case.\n\nHis three winners have all come for Douglas Whyte. As have 15 of his 42 rides. The two have created a strong partnership and while the Italian loves riding for the South African, he knows it is not enough in the long run.\n\n\u201cI hope to get more support from other trainers because you can\u2019t just have one trainer. I need to have more support apart from Douglas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery day my alarm goes off at 3.30am. I\u2019m not scared of working hard. I\u2019m proving I\u2019m a good jockey because I\u2019ve changed everything. I\u2019ve changed my style, I\u2019ve changed my diet and the results are coming.\u201d\n\nSanna hopes by getting the best out of long-priced horses \u2013 think his second aboard Sichuan Dar on National Day (at $108) or his fourth on Southern Legend (at $48) at the same meeting \u2013 that will help him obtain more opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the minor things like finishing fourth or fifth with big-odds horses, they are good things and people can see it \u2013 they know I always try my best,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that has to be the attitude for those jockeys at Sha Tin wanting to improve their position. Keep working hard, stay positive, make the most of your opportunities and hopefully receive a little luck on the way.\n\nThat\u2019s easier said than done when you go a month without a winner and you\u2019ve done all the hard work only to be dropped from a horse when it is ready to win. There is no doubt it can be frustrating, but it can all change in one meeting and the rewards are worth it.\n\nMost of the 23 jockeys on the roster are exceptionally talented and capable of riding 30-plus winners in a season.\n\nThe ranks boast more depth than they have in years \u2013 and it\u2019s only going to go to another level when Silvestre de Sousa and Alexis Badel arrive for their winter stints \u2013 so in theory they are more competitive, but the results do not bear that out at this early stage.", "description": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing.
