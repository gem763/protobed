If drivers accept the fare, then riders will be charged a small fee (Stock image)\n\nIf the driver accepts, riders pay what Uber is calling a 'small surcharge' for bringing along their animal friend which could be up to $5 according to a company spokesperson.\n\n'We conducted extensive pricing analysis and determined a small surcharge between $3-$5 would be ideal for this pilot,' an Uber representative told MailOnline.\n\n'The surcharge is a flat fee, on top of a standard trip fare per in each city Uber Pet is piloting.'\n\nDrivers will reportedly take a cut of the surcharge\n\nUber Pet will likely help set the mind's of those traveling with pets at ease since prior to the test there was no official way of notifying drivers that one intended to bring their pets.\n\nThat lack of communication can create scenarios where drivers are taken by surprise after arriving to pick up passengers and could lead to them potentially declining service upon arrival.\n\nUber will start rolling out the test on October 16 in several cities across the US including Austin, Denver, Nashville, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Tampa Bay, where they will be able to select pet options through their app.\n\nThe ride-hailing giant has undergone several key changes throughout he past several months amid concerns about its fundamental business model.\n\nLate last month, the company announced that it will merge all of its services into one app, including Uber Eats, its primary ride-hailing service, and other alternative transportation options like scooters and bikes.\n\nThe goal is reportedly to make the app an 'operating system for everyday life' according to Uber's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.", "description": "Uber Pet will likely help set the mind's of those traveling with pets at ease since prior to the test there was no official way of notifying drivers that one intended to bring their pets.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/16220988-0-image-a-4_1570637213753.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
