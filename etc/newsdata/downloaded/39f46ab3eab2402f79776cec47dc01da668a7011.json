Schiff, California Democrat, said those documents are \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Luskin said federal law and State Department regulations block his client from producing the materials.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland does not control the disposition of the documents,\u201d he said. \u201cBy federal law and regulation, the State Department has sole authority to produce such documents and Ambassador Sondland hopes the materials will be shared with committees in advance of this Thursday testimony.\u201d\n\nHis testimony is part of the House impeachment inquiry that was launched after President Trump\u2019s phone call with his counterpart in Ukraine in July. In a rough transcript released by the White House, Mr. Trump is shown asking the Ukrainian president to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter\u2019s dealings with an energy company there.\n\nMr. Sondland was quoted in some texts that were exchanged regarding the Ukraine investigation.\n\nThe ambassador was scheduled to testify Tuesday in the House impeachment inquiry, but he did not show up under direction from the White House.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
