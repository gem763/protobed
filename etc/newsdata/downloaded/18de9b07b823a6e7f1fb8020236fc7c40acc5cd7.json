He had been fatally stabbed inside Chicago\u2019s nightclub in Stourbridge, in the West Midlands.\n\nHe was 24 with his whole life ahead of him. As a close family friend, and now a spokesperson for the Justice For Ryan campaign, I cannot even begin to describe the immense pain, torture and suffering that his death caused to those of us that loved him \u2013 he was one of the kindest, loving, happiest of people you could ever wish to meet.\n\nUnfortunately victims such as our Ryan, who were killed in a so-called \u2018little towns\u2019 like Stourbridge, very rarely get a mention in the discussion around knife crime.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to believe that knife crime is unique to London. The truth is knife crime is affecting all of us \u2013 of all genders, races, religions and crucially, it is happening all across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnife crime has surged to the highest levels ever recorded. In the West Midlands, it reached a record high in 2018 with 3,210 offences involving knives recorded by the police. Knife crime in our region has more than doubled since 2012.\n\nA recent survey of 29 police forces in England and Wales has revealed that over 1,000 children took weapons to school last year \u2013 the youngest child was just four years old. Along with knives, police confiscated machetes, knuckle dusters and swords.\n\nKnife crime is not just exclusive within high crime or areas of poverty, either \u2013 it impacts people from affluent regions as well. Ryan was raised in a relatively low crime area and, supported by his parents, he had successfully built his own window cleaning business and was planning on buying his first home with his girlfriend.\n\nI regularly speak with other families that have lost loved ones to knife crime and none of us ever thought this would be something that would happen to us. However, given the current climate, more parents are genuinely worried about their children when they go out with friends.\n\nThere are empty bedrooms in the homes of grieving families up and down our country, as well as survivors enduring PTSD, finding themselves struggling to cope with day to day activities.\n\nI regularly speak with other families that have lost loved ones to knife crime and none of us ever thought this would be something that would happen to us.\n\nWhile there is no clear and simple solution to the issue of knife crime, I am confident we can attribute the increase to several key areas including the direct cut in police numbers we have seen on our streets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe closing down of youth centres throughout our communities and the lack of non-fee paying clubs available to our youths has also had an impact.\n\nYears ago we had around half a dozen youth clubs within a couple of miles of our area, but austerity has seen them off. The ones that are still open operating are only accessible if parents have enough money to send their children along.\n\nI believe the judicial system also has a key role to play in deterring people from becoming involved in knife crime, and subsequently punishing those who do.\n\nOn the 6 February 2018 at Birmingham Crown Court, this country\u2019s justice system let the man who admitted stabbing Ryan in front of a jury to walk free from court, without any punishment for his actions. It was a gross miscarriage of justice that we simply cannot understand.\n\nHis defence was that it was accidental and he did not intend to cause harm \u2013 but how can it ever be acceptable to use a knife inside a nightclub against an unarmed person?\n\nPolicing, surveillance and sentencing remain pivotal in combating the knife crime epidemic, but with what many of us see currently as soft punishments, the justice system needs to help tackle the problem by handing down stricter sentences and treating knife crime more seriously.\n\nKnife crime has no boundaries and is a plague across our whole society, not just London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with other of Ryan\u2019s friends and family, I am now campaigning to raise awareness and educate people against knife crime, as well as to demand the right for victim\u2019s families to challenge perverse jury acquittal verdicts. Not only for Ryan, but to protect any future victims and their families enduring the distress we continue to go through.\n\nWhen the British public and media come together for a cause, it forces our ministers and politicians to act. We cannot wait for another fatal stabbing to happen before action is taken.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that knife crime is reported on fairly and equally across the whole of the UK, so that the suffering of victims is accurately portrayed and a clear picture of what is really happening within our communities can emerge.\n\nMORE: We know how to solve knife crime, and it\u2019s not with a fried chicken box\n\nMORE: Putting police in schools could stop knife crime, but only if they\u2019re not the enemy\n\nMORE: More women and girls are carrying knives, police say", "description": "A campaigner for Justice For Ryan tells Metro.co.uk that Ryan Passey's death is an example of how knife crime is happening outside London.", "authors": ["Jason Connon", "Campaign Manager For Justice For Ryan"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image4-8cd5_1571218727.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
