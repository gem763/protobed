'I\u2019ve worked really hard to be the woman my children need me to be.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board voted to recommend Tondalao Hall's 30-year prison sentence be commuted to time served. She appeared via video on Tuesday and cried\n\nThis Aug. 9, 2019 photo (left) shows Hall who was sentenced in 2006 to 30 years in prison for failing to report the abuse of her children by her boyfriend Richard Braxton Jr (right) who pleaded guilty only served two years after getting out on parole\n\nHall's ex-boyfriend, Robert Braxton Jr., pleaded guilty to abusing the children and was released on probation after a couple of years in jail from 2006.\n\nTheir 20-month-old son had been found with a broken femur and cracked ribs, and their three-month old daughter had similar injuries. At the time in 2004 Hall was 19 and both she and her partner were arrested.\n\nThe inequity of the case has outraged women's rights groups and brought further attention to Oklahoma's high rate of incarceration, particularly of women, as 151 out of every 100,000 are imprisoned.\n\n'The facts unavailable to the court at that time were the abuse that she suffered from Mr. Braxton. Mr. Braxton abused Ms. Hall physically, sexually, emotionally,' Megan Lambert, Hall\u2019s attorney with the ACLU, told the board.\n\nNews 4 reports that Lambert added after the decision: 'This case is critically important because it is an example of the injustice done within the Oklahoma criminal justice system, specifically against women. And it's a good example of why Oklahoma has a higher rate of female incarceration than anywhere else in the world, and that is because we impose harsh sentences upon women for the crimes of their male romantic partners.'\n\nThe board voted after DA David Prater wrote to the parole board acknowledging that Hall had written a letter in 2009 apologizing for her inconsistent testimony in 2006 and now Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt will now consider the recommendation.\n\nShe was arrested in 2004 when she was 19 and sentenced in 2006. Her request for the sentence to be commuted had been denied in 2015 and 2018 after the 30-year sentencing\n\nThe Pardon and Parole Board has new members appointed by Stitt, a businessman-turned-governor who has made reforming the state's criminal justice system a priority for his administration.\n\n'Once the governor's office receives the packet from the Pardon and Parole Board, the legal team will begin reviewing recommendations with the governor,' said Stitt spokeswoman Baylee Lakey.\n\n'I wish Ms. Hall the best,' Prater said in a statement Tuesday. 'She now has the opportunity to have a relationship with her children outside of prison.\n\n'I'm hopeful that Ms. Hall will use this opportunity to educate women in abusive relationships to seek help before their children are abused by their violent partner.'\n\n'As a parent, our first priority is to protect our children. The most effective way to do that is to not expose our children to violence in the first place.'\n\nHe added family justice center, Palomar, is ready to assist anyone who needs their services.", "description": "Oklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board recommended Tondalao Hall's 30-year prison sentence be commuted to time served Tuesday, after the 2004 incident that she was sentenced for 2006.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19511796-0-image-a-19_1570655402501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
