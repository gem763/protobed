I\u2019m absolutely against it,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nAt the national government level, the view is more sanguine.\n\n\u201cWe want to study how to minimise the damage (from a potential discharge) to the region\u2019s reputation and Fukushima products,\u201d an Industry Ministry official said.\n\nThe government is sensitive to fears that people inside Japan and further afield will view any discharge as sending radioactive waste into the sea.\n\nNo decisions are likely in the near-term, with the country sensitive to the international spotlight that will fall on Japan as it hosts the Olympic Games next year.\n\nEnvironmentalists are also resolutely opposed to any discharge into the sea, and Greenpeace argues that TEPCO cannot trusted to properly decontaminate the water.\n\nThe solution, said Greenpeace senior nuclear specialist Shaun Burnie, \u201cultimately can only be long-term storage and processing.\u201d", "description": "Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 In the grounds of the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant sits a million-tonne headache", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/7d8c7c_staff-measure-radiation-levels-storage-tanks-radiation-contaminated-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
