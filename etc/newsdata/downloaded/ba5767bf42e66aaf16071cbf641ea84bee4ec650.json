MPs would then be given a vote on these reports, to approve or reject the government\u2019s plan.\n\nMinisters also pointed out that the government announced an employment reform bill in the Queen\u2019s speech that would increase standards, and insisted they had no intention of reducing standards.\n\nHowever, Labour\u2019s employment rights spokesperson, Laura Pidcock, insisted those pledges were not worth the paper they were written on \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn claimed Johnson was \u201cfiring the starting gun on a race to the bottom\u201d.\n\nJohnson has also repeatedly stressed his insistence that while environmental standards will no longer be guaranteed by EU law, the UK will set higher standards, including in an environment bill, announced in this week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech.\n\nWhat else might be up for grabs in future trade deals?\n\nAccording to Johnson in the debate on Saturday, not the NHS \u2013 which Labour fears could be opened up to exploitation by US corporations as part of a trade agreement with Donald Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nWhen he flew to the G7 summit in Biarritz in August, the PM outlined a long list of trade barriers he said faced British business hoping to export to the US market \u2013 but declined to say what he could offer to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d government in return.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly insisted NHS contracts will not be part of any future trade deal and put hospital funding at the heart of his bid for re-election. However, Labour has accused him of being willing to put it up for sale.\n\nWhat economic assessment has the government done of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal?\n\nExtraordinarily, it hasn\u2019t done any.\n\nChallenged by the Lib Dem Luciana Berger about why the government had failed to publish forecasts, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no level of analysis that is probably going to change her vote and her mind. Indeed, as a former Treasury minister one of the things I\u2019m always aware of, is indeed it\u2019s difficult to model a deal that was only made on Thursday.\u201d\n\nHe added that it would be difficult to model changes to policy by the new European commission, and to the global economic backdrop.\n\nThe independent thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has published analysis comparing Johnson\u2019s agreement with Theresa May\u2019s deal, which came closer to achieving frictionless trade with the EU, in exchange for promising alignment with EU regulations in key areas.\n\nIt found that Johnson\u2019s deal would be likely to reduce GDP per capita \u2013 a measure of living standards \u2013 by between 2.3% and 7% over the next decade, compared with remaining in the EU. That compares with an estimate of 1.9% to 5.5% under May\u2019s deal.\n\nIt also suggested the deal would entail a hit to the public finances of \u00a316bn to \u00a349bn.", "description": "The PM\u2019s Brexit plan loosens the economic ties to the EU, so what would be the impact?", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bab0c8dc6f3267e8f80afe36f657575c51837843/0_433_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e33a59be8528da1ba2039dc56db35d4", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
