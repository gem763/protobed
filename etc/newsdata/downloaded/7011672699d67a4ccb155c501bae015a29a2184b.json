Google Maps/Business Insider\n\nThe explosion appeared so severe that local authorities sent 13 fire engines to respond to the emergency, the state-run RT news channel reported. The fire was put out shortly after.\n\nThe room had been undergoing repair work, Vector said, and wasn't in use at the time of the explosion.\n\nA construction worker was taken to a nearby hospital with third-degree burns, RFE/RL reported. He was taken to intensive care, Tass reported, citing the hospital.\n\nOfficials have opened a criminal investigation into lab authorities over the explosion, the Sib.fm news site reported.\n\nThere was no biohazardous material in the room when the gas explosion took place, Vector said, as did Koltsovo's mayor according to RFE/RL. Other viruses \u2014 like smallpox and Ebola \u2014 are stored elsewhere in the building.\n\nAll the glass in Vector's building was broken, RFE/RL and Tass both reported. The building structure, however, was unharmed, Vector said.\n\nThe explosion poses no biological or any other threat to the surrounding population, Tass cited Koltsovo Mayor Nikolai Krasnikov as saying.\n\nVector is one of the only two places in the world authorized to store live specimens of the smallpox virus \u2014 the other is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.\n\nVector, founded in 1974, is one of the virus and bioresearch labs in Russia. It was previously used for Soviet bio-weapons research, RFE/RL reported. It's now used to develop vaccines against infectious diseases including swine flu, HIV, and Ebola, Tass said.\n\nA Russian scientist died after accidentally sticking herself with a needle containing the Ebola virus in 2004, The New York Times reported at the time.", "description": "A gas cylinder at a major Russian research lab known as \"Vector\" exploded in a sanitary inspection room and caused a fire on Monday.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ma"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80adfc2e22af3b9c51c9a8-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
