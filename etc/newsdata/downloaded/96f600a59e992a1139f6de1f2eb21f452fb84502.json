Here's a secret I need to share", "language": "en", "text": "Turn on the teleivison or open a paper and the financial news can be unsettling. \u201cA recession is coming!\u201d says one expert. \"No recession,\" argues another. \"Save more, spend less, just in case!\" cautions a third. And with all the conflicting reports, our joy level sinks lower and lower. But does financial security equal personal joy? Does our economic status serve as an accurate barometer of our happiness level?\n\nIn a classic study psychologists determined that recent winners of the Illinois State Lottery were no happier than recent accident victims who were consequently disabled. The two groups were asked to \u201crate the amount of pleasure they got from everyday activities: small but enjoyable things like chatting with a friend, watching TV, eating breakfast, laughing at a joke, or receiving a compliment. When the researchers analyzed their results, they found that the recent accident victims reported gaining more happiness from these everyday pleasures than the lottery winners.\u201d\n\nEven the thrill of winning the lottery wears off.\n\nMATT LEBLANC SAYS HE ONLY HAD $11 IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT BEFORE LANDING 'FRIENDS' GIG: 'I'M VERY FRUGAL'\n\nMore money makes truly poor people happier insofar as it relieves pressure from everyday life \u2014 getting enough to eat, having a place to live, affording medical care. But once people reach the middle-class income level, even big financial gains don\u2019t yield much, if any, increase in happiness.\n\nAmericans who earn more than $10 million annually report a happiness level only slightly higher than the blue-collar workers they employ. As one Harvard professor said, \u201cWe think money will bring lots of happiness for a long time, and actually it brings a little happiness for a short time.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen happy peasants and miserable millionaires, right?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere is another option. It requires no credit card, monthly mortgage, or stroke of fortune. It demands no airline tickets or hotel reservations. It stipulates no Ph.D., M.D., or blue-blood pedigree. Age, ethnicity, and gender are not factors. Balmy climates, blue skies, and Botox are not mandated. No resources for psychoanalysis, plastic surgery, or hormone therapy? No problem. You don\u2019t have to change jobs, change cities, change looks, or change neighborhoods.\n\nBut you might need to change doors.\n\nThe motto on the front door says \u201cHappiness happens when you get.\u201d The sign on the lesser-used back door counters \u201cHappiness happens when you give.\u201d\n\nDoing good does good for the doer.\n\nResearch bears this out.\n\nWhen volunteers were put in a functional MRI scanner and were told they would be giving some of their money to charity, the areas of their brains associated with pleasure \u2014 like food and sex \u2014 lit up like Christmas trees. Giving to help others triggers dopamine. (New fund-raising slogan perhaps?)\n\nYou \u2014 yes, you \u2014 can help people to sleep better, laugh more, hum instead of grumble, walk instead of stumble. You can lighten the load and brighten the day of other human beings.\n\nIn another study, a team of social psychologists distilled happiness factors into eight common denominators. Two of the first three involve helping others. Happy, contented people \u201cdevote a great amount of time to their family and friends, nurturing and enjoying those relationships.\u201d And \u201cthey are often the first to offer a helping hand to co-workers and passers-by.\u201d\n\nSeeking joy? Do good for someone else.\n\nA tender example of this truth came my way just today. I met with a husband and daughter to plan the funeral of the wife and mother. Patty was the picture of unselfishness. We tried to imagine how many kids she had hugged, diapers she had changed, children she had taught, and hearts she had encouraged. To see her smile was to see springtime thaw the winter ice.\n\nThree months ago a brain condition had left her unable to speak, partially paralyzed, and living in a rehabilitation center. Her spirits sank so low she did not want to eat and had trouble sleeping. One evening her daughter had an idea. She placed her mother in a wheelchair and rolled her from room to room, looking for people who needed encouragement. It didn\u2019t take long.\n\nThough unable to speak, Patty could touch and pray. So she did both. She patted other patients and then placed her hand on their hearts and bowed her head. For the better part of the evening, she touched and prayed her way through the rehab center. That night her appetite returned, and she slept peacefully.\n\nThe words of Jesus are spot-on: \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive\u201d (Acts 22:35). Because when you do, it has a boomerang effect. Happiness happens when we give it away.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is such great news. You can\u2019t control your genetics. You aren\u2019t in charge of the weather, the traffic, or the occupant of the White House. But you can always increase the number of smiles on our planet. You can lower the anger level in your city.\n\nYou \u2014 yes, you \u2014 can help people to sleep better, laugh more, hum instead of grumble, walk instead of stumble.
