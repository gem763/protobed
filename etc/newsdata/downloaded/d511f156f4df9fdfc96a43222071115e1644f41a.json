I know what you\u2019re probably thinking. Anyone who\u2019s been following American politics at all for the last three years knows that Democrats calling for someone in the Trump administration to resign basically means it\u2019s another day ending in a Y. But this dust-up has at least a bit of a twist to it.\n\nDuring a HUD staff meeting in San Francisco, Carson was addressing the staff and dropped a comment regarding transgender individuals. He included the phrase \u201cbig hairy men\u201d entering women\u2019s shelters or using women\u2019s bathrooms. This set the usual number of heads of hair on fire, leading to more accusations and calls for his resignation. The Secretary isn\u2019t stepping down, however. He instead sent out a message clarifying his comments. (Politico)\n\n\u201cDuring a recent meeting with local staff in San Francisco, I made reference to the fact that I had heard from many women\u2019s groups about the difficulty they were having with women\u2019s shelters because sometimes men would claim to be women,\u201d Carson wrote. \u201cThis made many of the women feel unsafe, and one of the groups described a situation to me in which \u2018big hairy men\u2019 would come in and have to be accepted into the women\u2019s shelter even though it made the women in the facility very uncomfortable,\u201d he added. \u201cMy point was that we have to permit policies that take into consideration the rights of everybody, including those women,\u201d Carson wrote.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to bring this story up today is that Carson raised two points that are frequently missing from debates over transgender issues. And he did so in a simple way that people on both sides of this debate should calm down and listen to.\n\nFirst, there are plenty of places in society, including places of work and publicly accessible spaces, where I\u2019m sure the vast majority of women (and men for that matter) have no problem running into a man \u201cidentifying\u201d as a woman or vice versa. I know it doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s a free country. Call yourself whatever you like and dress how you like. But as Carson points out, that doesn\u2019t apply everywhere. Women, in particular, can find themselves in vulnerable situations. It could be anything as simple as using a public restroom or as tragic as finding themselves in a battered women\u2019s shelter.\n\nIt\u2019s at times such as those \u2013 particularly in a shelter \u2013 where vulnerable women don\u2019t want to be exposed to a \u201cwoman with a penis.\u201d This is particularly true when it comes to sleeping quarters, showers, changing rooms and restrooms. That is not the time or place for a political debate or a lengthy effort to convince them they need to adapt to this \u201cnew reality.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s other point came up later in his remarks and he risked invoking the dreaded phrase \u201ccommon sense.\u201d He wrote, \u201cOur society is in danger when we pick one issue (such as gender identity) and say it does not matter how it impacts others because this one issue should override every other common-sense consideration, We must always be vigilant not to override the common sense of our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nThe fact is that we are being asked, or in some cases told by government authorities, that there is no more room for common sense in this discussion. We can, and should, be ready to acknowledge the rights of everyone equally, and that applies to the transgender community as well. And yet, as with everything else in our society, one person\u2019s right to speak or think as they wish does not extend to mandating that everyone think and speak the same way. This too is simply common sense.\n\nEveryone makes certain concessions in their speech and actions to ensure that the entire society can continue to function. One very small minority demanding that everyone else think, act and speak in an irrational fashion to accommodate their wishes isn\u2019t democracy. It\u2019s tyranny. Carson has a grip on this and yet he\u2019s once again being pilloried for saying what should be common sense.", "description": "\"It's just common sense.\"", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BenCarson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
