Prosecutors say she thought her husband was having an affair with a 15-year-old girl.\n\nHe claims that his wife left their young family late at night of her own accord.\n\nJust a fortnight before her disappearance, Mr Griggs told a friend 'he wished her dead', Canterbury Crown Court heard on Monday.\n\nThe keen sailor visited Peter Marks - a welder in Deal, Kent, where the couple lived - for work on his boat and shop.\n\nThe court heard Mr Marks noticed that Mr Griggs 'did not seem his normal self'.\n\n'He responded saying that he was having a lot of trouble at home,' Duncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, explained.\n\n'It was with his wife, related to money.'\n\nMr Marks told the court: 'He was very agitated, very loud and obviously swore a lot in relation to his wife.'\n\nThe jury heard he called his pregnant wife a 'c***'. Mr Marks continued: 'He said that she was going to take half of his business. And his belongings and everything he owned.'\n\nDebbie Griggs went missing from her home in Deal, Kent on the evening of May 5 in 1999\n\nMr Marks told the court: 'There were expletives. He said he wished her dead. He was very serious in my opinion. Very angry and serious.'\n\nThe court heard Mr Griggs returned to see the welder a week later, and went on another expletive-filled rant about this wife.\n\nNic Lobbenberg QC, defending, responded: 'People use I am going to kill you as a turn of phrase.\n\n'He was very angry, and at that time he was very angry with his wife. It was no secret.'\n\nThe heartbroken family of Mrs Griggs told the court of the last time they saw her 20 years ago.\n\nThey recalled a devoted mother, who spent most of her time looking after her young children.\n\nHer father, Brian Cameron, said he last saw his daughter on May 5 1999 - the day of her disappearance.\n\n'It was at 3.15pm, outside our house with her children,' he told the court.\n\nThe jury was told Mrs Griggs' son Jake was meant to be going to a party.\n\nAsked whether his daughter would just disappear, Mr Cameron responded: 'Definitely not, it's not like her. She would be round to see me every week.'\n\nMrs Griggs' mother Patricia Cameron died earlier this year, days before Mr Griggs was charged with her daughter's murder.\n\nA statement given by Mrs Cameron to police on May 20 1999 was read out in court.\n\nShe said the last time she saw her daughter was in the afternoon on the day she disappeared.\n\nMrs Griggs was with her young sons Jeremy, then six, Jake, three, and Luke, aged 18 months.\n\nShe said: 'The last time I saw Debbie was on May 5. She came around to my house after picking Jeremy up from school. Jake and Luke were with her.\n\n'She was happy, she did not say anything that caught my attention.'\n\nMrs Cameron told the court her daughter was laughing as she drove away - the last time she saw her alive.\n\nThe jury was told Mr Griggs called his mother-in-law on May 6 to say his wife 'had gone missing'.\n\nMrs Cameron suggested coming over but Mr Griggs told her not to bother, the court heard.\n\nIn her statement, she explained she decided to go to their house anyway at 7pm.\n\n'I saw Andy with a shocked look on his face,' she said.\n\nThe court heard Mrs Cameron then saw the 15-year-old girl Mrs Griggs had thought her husband was having an affair with.\n\nMrs Cameron explained: 'I said: Get rid of her. She shouldn't be here.'\n\n'If Debbie comes back and if she sees her all hell will break loose.'\n\nShe added: 'Her disappearance is completely out of character. She's not disappeared. She's a loving mother who cared about her children.'\n\nMr Griggs, of Ringwood Road, St Leonards, Dorset, denies murder.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Andrew Griggs, 57, is accused of murdering his wife Debbie Griggs, then aged 34, and dumping her body 20 years ago.
