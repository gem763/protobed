The three main U.S. stock indexes closed with losses following Friday\u2019s hefty gains. The focus is back on trade, as talks between the U.S. and China resume later this week. Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve meeting and Brexit deadline coming at the end of the month. At the same time, market continues to pay little attention to the ongoing impeachment drama in Washington D.C. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nHere Come Trade Talks\n\nStocks closed in the red on Monday as trade comes back into investors\u2019 focus, following a volatile market last week shaken by a series of weak economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 95.70 points, or 0.4%, to close at 26,478.02. The S&P 500 lost 13.22 points, or 0.45%, to finish at 2938.79, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 26.18 points, or 0.33%, to close at 7956.29.\n\nInvestors are getting nervous about the high-level trade talks between the U.S. and China that are set to kick off this Thursday. There have been numerous headlines\u2014many times conflicting\u2014that speculate whether an interim deal is likely or not.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies have been entangled in trade-related disputes for more than a year, imposing heavy tariffs on billions of worth of products from each other. The tension between the two countries, however, is way beyond trade imbalance itself, but involves many other issues such as China\u2019s intellectual property theft, industrial reform, and subsidies to state-owned firms.\n\nTurkey\u2019s falling currency and stocks are also in focus today. In a major shift in U.S. military policy in Syria, President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. troops will pull back from the Syria-Turkey border, a move that will essentially allow Turkish military operations to confront the American-allied Kurdish forces near the border. The Kurdish fighters had partnered with the U.S. in fighting Islamic State in the region, but are considered a terrorist insurgency by the Turkish government.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets. \u201cThey have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars.\u201d On the news, the Borsa Istanbul 100 Index fell 0.45%, while the iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (ticker: TUR) slumped 4.14% on Monday. Turkey\u2019s lira has dropped 2.5% against the U.S. dollar.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s lower-than-expected Institute for Supply Management data and a tepid jobs report, more signs are indicating investor worries about a slowing economy. According to a National Association for Business Economics survey of 54 economists conducted between Sept. 9-16, 80% of the respondents said that they see the economy to further slow this year, up from 60% back in June.\n\nThe group expects real gross domestic product to expand at an average rate of 2.3% this year and slow to 1.8% in 2020. That\u2019s weaker than their last forecast in June. Trade policy, unsurprisingly, was cited as the main headwind through 2020. Business investment will likely soften as policy uncertainties erodes business confidence. Still, the chance of a recession by the middle of 2020 is only at 24%, according to the survey, but will rise to 69% by mid-2021.\n\nThe weak data have raised investors\u2019 hopes that the Federal Reserve might come to the rescue at its October meeting with an easier monetary policy and lower interest rates. According to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, the fed-fund-futures market is now pricing in a 73% chance for a 25-percentage-points rate cut by the end of the month.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "The three main U.S. stock indexes closed with losses following Friday\u2019s hefty gains.
