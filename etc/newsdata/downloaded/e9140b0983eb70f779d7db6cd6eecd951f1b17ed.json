His back burned, his body covered in bandages, Yamin screamed from his hospital bed.\n\nThe boy had just lost 19 members of his extended family in a bombing.\n\nBursts of shrapnel were trapped in his body and nurses spread ointment on his raw skin as he lay in the burns unit of Al-Shifa Hospital preparing for plastic surgery.\n\nIt was during yet another war between Gaza militants \u2014 led by Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules the enclave, and Islamic Jihad \u2014 and the Israeli military.\n\nJust after midnight on the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Fitr, an Israeli plane dropped a bomb on a building where Yamin\u2019s family had gathered in the centre of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli military maintained it housed a Hamas command centre with militants inside.\n\nIn an instant, 19 people were killed, including six children. Yamin, just three at the time, and his sister Geina, only several months old, survived. But they are orphans.\n\nFive years later, AFP found Yamin.\n\nThe door at a home in central Gaza opened, and behind it appeared a boy with sparkling eyes and brown hair.\n\nHis new parents appear. Yamin, with a mischievous smile, runs, plays, laughs and dances in the courtyard of the house with sand-coloured walls.\n\nYamin\u2019s uncle, Adnan, has become his father and his aunt, Yasmine Abu Jabbar, who was his mother\u2019s best friend, became his new mum.\n\n\u201cAll the neighbours witnessed it. Yamin cried night after night,\u201d said Yasmine, her brown eyes peering from behind her niqab.\n\n\u201cFor a year, Yamin asked me \u2018where is my mother? How to get to her?\u2019 The concept of death is already difficult to understand for an adult. Imagine for a three-year-old boy.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not alone\u2019 \u2013\n\nYasmine teaches at a primary school in Al-Nuseirat, where children dressed in worn jerseys kick up dust at sunset playing football.\n\nShe said she tried everything possible to help Yamin find some form of normality.\n\n\u201cThe first step was to tell him, \u2018Yamin, look around you. You are not alone. Many children have lost their parents and their families, but you still have a family. We are your family.\u2019\u201d\n\nYamin now lives surrounded by his new parents and his five brothers and sisters. He attends the primary school where his adopted mother teaches.\n\nHe likes Galaxy chocolate, Lionel Messi and PUBG, a combat video game rivalling Fortnite. He also likes school. But not too much.\n\nHis back is scarred, his skin still burns sometimes, and his left forearm remains deformed, which has occasionally led to mockery.\n\n\u201cWhen he began pre-school, the children made fun of him,\u201d Yasmine said.\n\n\u201cOne day he came to the house crying \u2018I don\u2019t want to wear t-shirts anymore.\u2019 I ran to the pre-school and I asked the children: \u2018Which one of you has super powers?\u2019\n\n\u201cNo one said a word. Then I said: \u2018Yamin has them. He has an iron arm. He can fight a rocket with his bare hands.\u2019 After that, Yamin began to believe that he was a superhero like Iron Man.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Climb all walls\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe 2014 war left 2,251 dead on the Palestinian side, the majority civilians, and 74 on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers.\n\nFive years later, broken asphalt and residential towers have been replaced in Gaza, but the story is not over for survivors.\n\nIn his glossy offices overlooking the Mediterranean, Raji Sourani and his army of lawyers keep records of around 1,000 Palestinians killed.\n\nSourani, founder of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights who has demanded Israel open a war crimes investigation, said Yamin and his relatives had the right to know what happened.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason whatsoever to legitimise any harm for this family, either bombing them, killing them, or injuring them,\u201d he said.\n\nBut \u201cuntil this moment, we didn\u2019t receive a single answer in the last five years.\u201d\n\nContacted by AFP, Israel\u2019s army said a preliminary inquiry had been carried out, but \u201cthere was no reasonable suspicion of committing a criminal offence\u201d.\n\nThe strike targeted a Hamas \u201cactive command and control centre\u201d, and those killed included \u201cat least four military operatives belonging to terror organisations,\u201d it said.\n\nIt said militants there were \u201cinvolved in military activities that endangered\u201d Israeli soldiers.\n\n\u201cIt was assessed that civilians were likely to be present in the building, but that the extent of the collateral damage expected to result from the attack would not be excessive in relation to the significant military advantage that was anticipated,\u201d the army said.\n\nIn the family home in Al-Zawaida, Yasmine wiped away tears when remembering.\n\n\u201cYou sink back into a nightmare, but at the same time I\u2019m proud of myself when I look at Yamin,\u201d she said.\n\nThe little \u201cIron Man\u201d of Gaza now says he actually prefers another superhero: Rajul al-Ankabut, or Spiderman in Arabic.\n\n\u201cBecause with his superpowers, he can climb all walls.\u201d", "description": "Al-Zawaida (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) \u2013 It was the summer of 2014, when a deluge of steel fell on Gaza.
