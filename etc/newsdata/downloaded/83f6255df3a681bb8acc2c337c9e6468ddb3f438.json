And even if disaster is avoided, the EU27 are wondering if another postponement will serve any useful purpose.\n\nThe unprecedented U.K. Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson illegally shut down parliament injected further confusion into what was already a bewildering and highly unpredictable situation.\n\nAnd it confirmed the sense among many in Brussels that the political situation in the U.K. has only grown more dysfunctional since Johnson took over as prime minister. His combative rhetoric in recent days \u2014 repeating talk of \"surrender\" and dismissing an MP's account of death threats she'd received as \"humbug\" \u2014 and the backlash against it has only added to the sense of uncontrolled chaos in London.\n\nBarclay continued with the upbeat tone that Johnson and his ministers have stuck to since negotiations restarted.\n\nSpeaking to a meeting of EU27 ambassadors on Thursday, Michel Barnier, the EU Brexit negotiator, confirmed the obvious. \u201cThe situation is still very volatile in the U.K.,\u201d Barnier said, according to a diplomat who was in the room.\n\nBarnier stressed that in New York, Johnson met several EU leaders including Council President Donald Tusk. But while meetings with London are continuing at technical level, Barnier said there was no real progress.\n\n\u201cWe were awaiting realistic proposals from the U.K. a month ago and that is still the case,\u201d he said, according to the diplomat.\n\nThe Frenchman also described the speech by U.K. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay in Madrid last week as \u201caggressive\u201d even as he urged member states to remain calm.\n\nIn the Spanish capital Barclay had challenged the EU not to assume the U.K. would return to the negotiating table \"from a position of weakness\u201d in the event of a no-deal on October 31 and he insisted that the Northern Ireland border problem could be solved during a post-Brexit transition period \u2014 a position the EU27 have long rejected.\n\nAfter his meeting with Barnier in Brussels on Friday, Barclay continued with the upbeat tone that Johnson and his ministers have stuck to since negotiations restarted.\n\n\u201cWe are now approaching the moment of truth in these negotiations,\" he said after the Brussels meeting, \"We are committed to securing a deal. The prime minister has made clear he wants a deal but that has to be without the backstop. Parliament has rejected the backstop three times, I have been very clear with Michel Barnier and Task Force 50 in the negotiations, the backstop has to go. But with good will on both sides a deal can be done.\u201d\n\nBut with just a few weeks left before the October 17 European Council summit, the chances of a deal appear to be diminishing fast.\n\nAt the start of his tenure this summer Johnson, despite his antagonistic rhetoric, was seen in Brussels as someone they could do business with. They felt he could negotiate and then sell a deal because of his great skills as a communicator and because he was regarded as an opportunistic Brexit supporter rather than an ideological Euroskeptic.\n\nBut in a just a few months he has managed to burn whatever positive expectations existed \u2014 as he lost parliamentary votes; exiled members of his own party; and suspended parliament only to be slapped down by the U.K.'s highest court.\n\nSome EU27 diplomats now brand Johnson \u201ca serial liar\u201d especially after the scene where, in front of a camera, he told an angry father of a sick child complaining about poor conditions in the health service that there was no media around.\n\n\u201cBoris is lying all the time, I don't think there's anyone around left who trusts him,\u201d said one diplomat. At the end of her tenure, Johnson's predecessor Theresa May was seen as ineffective and incapable to deliver, but she was still respected for her efforts.\n\n\"No one thought of her as a clown,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nThe question now is not if Brussels trusts the British prime minister but if the British political system itself is still functional enough to deliver a solution in time for the October European Council, diplomats said.\n\nMost believe it is not.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling was regarded as turning point, showing that \u201cthe political system has run itself into the ground,\u201d said a second EU27 diplomat. \u201cThe system is clearly under stress,\u201d said a third diplomat.\n\nSome speculate about a delay until March; others talk about an even longer period.\n\nAny hopes that something might change after the Tory Party conference, which starts on Sunday, or that there is time for a deal at the European Council are evaporating.\n\n\u201cJohnson will make a fiasco at the European Council,\u201d said the first diplomat, predicting an ultimately futile attempt to negotiate a last-minute agreement. \u201cA deal at the European Council seems off the table,\u201d the third diplomat said.\n\nIn London, the government is adamant that Brexit day cannot shift beyond Halloween. \"No extension. It would achieve nothing,\" said a senior U.K. government official. \"History shows that the EU will only negotiate seriously when up against a hard deadline. More can kicking and delay just means more dither.\"\n\nNonetheless, the discussion in Brussels has now turned to the question of who in London might ask for the extension. That request now seems inevitable following the Benn Act \u2014 the legislation rushed through by the parliament earlier this month. Johnson has insisted he will not ask for a delay, raising the possibility that he steps down and a replacement caretaker PM makes the request.\n\nWhile fears of a no-deal remain real on the EU side, it is now seen as less likely \u2014 particularly if a U.K. general election goes from being seemingly inevitable to an actual reality. \u201cIf there will be elections, there will be an extension\u201d a senior diplomat said.\n\nBut there are too many uncertainties at the moment to predict what length of extension might be granted. Some speculate about a delay until March; others talk about an even longer period.\n\n\u201cI'm afraid the transition period could end up being a longer extension,\u201d said another diplomat referring to the time, after the approval of the Withdrawal Agreement, that was envisaged to last until December 2020.\n\nFor exasperated EU officials, that is a deeply unappealing prospect.\n\nEmilio Casalicchio contributed reporting.", "description": "EU diplomats now see little chance of a Brexit deal by the end of October.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "David M.
