The basis for their concern is growing increasingly obvious. Like army squads trapped behind enemy lines, Trump\u2019s soldiers are operating on their own, improvising tactics without centralized coordination.\n\nI have surveyed the heroic efforts of the finest minds the conservative movement has to offer to mount defenses of their leader. The campaign is not going well.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page seizes on Trump\u2019s inability to fully carry off his extortion scheme as reason to let him off. \u201cMany people in the Administration opposed the Giuliani effort, including some in senior positions at the White House,\u201d it argues. \u201cThis matters because it may turn out that while Mr. Trump wanted a quid-pro-quo policy ultimatum toward Ukraine, he was too inept to execute it. Impeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the government, and most Presidents at some point or another in office.\u201d\n\nSome Republican officials have echoed this defense. \u201cName me one thing that Ukraine did to release the money. Nothing,\u201d said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, \u201cTo have a quid pro quo, you have to exchange, both sides, for another thing.\u201d Representative John Ratcliffe says, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d\n\nThis is the defense originally made famous by Sideshow Bob: \u201cAttempted murder,\u201d now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for \u201cattempted chemistry\u201d?\n\nThere are two problems here. First, Trump used not one but two points of diplomatic leverage: He withheld both military aid and a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which the latter hoped would serve as a signal of support to Russia. The meeting still has not taken place.\n\nIt is true that, after Trump\u2019s extortion scheme was exposed, despite his attempt to cover it up, he had to release the aid. But contrary to Sideshow Bob, attempting to commit a crime \u2014 whether murder, bribery, or other things \u2014 is still very much a crime.\n\nHugh Hewitt in the Washington Post elaborates on a point he brought up on Twitter: Presidents make deals with other countries all the time, so why are we complaining about this deal:\n\nQuid pro quos have always been a feature of U.S. foreign policy \u2014 from the long-ago Louisiana Purchase to more recently President Barack Obama\u2019s sending the Iranian regime $1.7 billion in cash, which was central to the controversial U.S.-Iran nuclear \u201cdeal.\u201d Quid pro quos are sometimes excellent and obvious, sometimes controversial, sometimes illegal.\n\nThe rather obvious difference is that this deal, unlike the other ones, was made not in an attempt to promote the national interest, but specifically to help Trump\u2019s political agenda. Later in the same column, Hewitt stumbles across this crucial distinction between normal diplomatic deals and corrupt ones. \u201cThere is an ocean of innuendo about Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose conduct on TV is often intemperate,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut there are no credible allegations of wrongdoing against the man who made private inquiries in Ukraine on the president\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nNo credible allegation of wrongdoing? The allegation is that he made private inquiries in Ukraine on the president\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s right there in the sentence you just wrote, Hugh! If Trump was pursuing a legitimate foreign-policy goal, it would have been handled by the foreign-policy bureaucracy, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer representing his interests. There\u2019s a reason diplomacy is supposed to be conducted by foreign-policy officials who are vetted and paid by the U.S. government, not by Russian gangsters.\n\nBen Shapiro suggests that Trump can \u201cargue plausibly that Burisma was part-and-parcel of his general anti-corruption concern.\u201d The problem here is that Trump does not have a \u201cgeneral anti-corruption concern.\u201d Quite the opposite. His long-standing view about corruption is that it\u2019s simply how business gets done. He has called for eliminating the federal law prohibiting American businesspeople from bribing foreign officials, sought to cut funding for anti-corruption programs oversees, collected payments from interested foreign and domestic parties, refused to disclose his financial interests, and allied himself with the most corrupt figures in Ukraine. To the extent he has any colorable claim of opposing corruption, it would be in the fact that Joe Biden\u2019s son traded on his father\u2019s name, except Trump\u2019s kids are doing the same thing right now.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of \u201ccorruption\u201d is not \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of anything. It is in its entirety a pretext to discredit his domestic rivals.\n\nTrump famously declared he wouldn\u2019t lose any support if he shot somebody on Fifth Avenue. The crucial dynamic here is that if he did try this, while conservatives might initially experience some dismay, they would quickly recover and produce the same counterarguments. The Journal would be pointing out that the person he shot is in critical but stable condition and might well survive, thereby clearing Trump of murder. Hewitt would be noting that Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, U.S. Grant in the Civil War, and Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan Hill are all examples of other presidents who have shot people. Shapiro would suggest Trump was perhaps just pursuing his long-standing interest in fighting urban crime.\n\nWith such innovative minds at work on his behalf, why does Trump even need a war room?", "description": "Republicans have been complaining loudly over the lack of a \u201cwar room\u201d in the White House to coordinate impeachment message.
