Very happy to hear about the plastic Ravana initiative on 8th October where CMA would showcase the process they are using to manage single-use plastic waste,\u201d Shankar Mishra, Secretary of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs said.\n\nAccording to Aparna Dutt Sharma, Secretary-General, CMA, since the cement kilns generate such high amounts of heat, any kind of waste materials including plastic can be safely disposed of without generating any hydrocarbon emissions.\n\n\"The plastic waste works as a fuel in the kiln and also helps in reducing the use of fossil fuels. Thus we are able to keep the environment clean and reduce dependence on traditional fuels,\" she said.\n\nAccording to her several cement manufacturing units across the country have already begun using plastic waste in their kilns.\n\nBCCL\n\n\"52 cement manufacturing plants across the country have already begun using plastic waste in their kilns. The plastic waste is collected by the municipalities and is made available to the cement manufacturers,\" she said.\n\nShe, however, admitted that the process comes at a cost and not all the cement manufacturers are in a position to make the changes immediately.\n\n\"There are around 250 integrated cement manufacturing units in India. But only 52 of them are able to dispose of plastic waste. There are mechanisms that are required to be integrated into the system for this process to take place, and that comes at a cost,\" she said.\n\nThe MoHUA and CMA collectively conducted this initiative of plastic waste Ravana effigy across five cities in India, including Delhi, Noida, Lucknow, Raipur, and Ahmedabad on Tuesday.", "description": "Whenever the topic of plastic wast come up of discussion on the persistent question that arises is on how to dispose of it without causing further environmental damages.
