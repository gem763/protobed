Miss Lawrence went missing on March 18, 2009 while on her way home from the University of York\n\nThe 55-year-old has been linked to the disappearances of a number of women, including that of Claudia, who was 35 when she went missing.\n\nMrs Lawrence, who is from Malton, said: 'There are so many other people and crimes that Halliwell has been linked to.\n\n'It's impossible for the force to carry out a proper review with such a small amount of money.'\n\nHalliwell is currently serving life in jail for killing Sian O'Callaghan, 22, and 20-year-old Becky Godden.\n\nThe former cab driver has been linked to the disappearance of 12 other women.\n\nClaudia was last seen on CCTV on her way home from work at the University of York on March 18, 2009.\n\nPolice have spent around \u00a31,000,000 investigating her disappearance.\n\nClaudia Lawrence, pictured, has not been seen since March 18, 2009. Convicted double murderer Christopher Halliwell, right, is the prime suspect in her disappearance\n\nMrs Lawrence's concerns about the police's budget allocated to Halliwell have been echoed by Becky's mother Karen Edwards.\n\nShe said: 'It's an insult to the memory of those who are still waiting for loved ones to come home.\n\n'You will never, ever, ever get closure but if the police response was adequate then at least some loved ones could put them to rest.\n\n'To put \u00a340,000 into the investigation is despicable.\n\n'It just makes me sick.'\n\nThe cold-case review, codenamed Operation Major, aims to further investigate Halliwell.\n\nDetective Superintendent Jeremy Carter, of Wiltshire Police, said the \u00a340,000 figure did not give a true reflection of the cost of the investigation.\n\nHe said: 'The figure of \u00a340,000 does not cover any of the salaries of those working on this case but relates purely to specialist work such as forensic digs and searches, and specific expert advice.\n\n'Officers working on this case carry out a vast amount of work as part of their daily duties which would not be captured in this figure.'", "description": "Joan Lawrence, mother of missing chef Claudia has blasted police over the \u00a340,000 budget allocated to her daughter's case.
