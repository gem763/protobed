Russian state-controlled Alrosa declined to comment.\n\nBurkser had run the Mir diamond mine in Yakutia, which flooded in August 2017, killing eight miners. He was detained on Monday on suspicion of violating safety rules.\n\nAlrosa is the world\u2019s largest producer of rough diamonds in carat terms. Together with Anglo American\u2019s De Beers unit, it produces about half of the world\u2019s rough diamonds.\n\nThe underground mine, which produced 8% of Alrosa\u2019s output, flooded when water poured into the shaft from an open-cast mine above it.\n\nInvestigators believe there had been signs that water was coming into the mine a month prior to the accident, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nThey suspect that Burkser and Alexander Mann, Mir\u2019s former acting chief engineer who was also detained on Monday, were aware of the situation but did not suspend operations or ensure employees were not endangered, Interfax said.", "description": "The former head of a Siberian diamond mine owned by Alrosa where eight men were killed in a flood two years ago was found dead in a pre-trial detention centre on Tuesday, a day after he was arrested, Russian investigating authorities said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
