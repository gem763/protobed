Sebastian Vettel finished fifth. That order determines the grid if it remains too dangerous for the cars to run in qualifying on Sunday morning.There were some fears on Friday night that the destruction caused by the typhoon might prevent the race from being staged at all.\n\nThousands of sandbags arrived at the track in a bid to prevent the 3.6-mile course from flooding. The paddock was effectively packed away with high winds set to batter the area. Residents have been instructed to stay inside.\n\nHamilton said he intended to spend his day off in Tokyo, 250 miles to the north east of Suzuka, but soon abandoned the idea. Japan\u2019s transport system is set to be on lock down from Saturday morning with 1,600 domestic planes grounded and train services cancelled.\n\nThe sport\u2019s governing body, and F1 owners\u2019 Liberty Media, revealed the track will be closed on Saturday after delaying their decision by 24 hours. The final call was taken by circuit authorities on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cThe FIA and Formula One support this decision in the interests of safety for the spectators, competitors and everyone at the Suzuka Circuit,\u201d said both F1 and the sporting federation in a joint statement.\n\nAs Hamilton marches towards a fifth championship in six quite remarkable seasons, intrigue along the paddock at Ferrari, the sport\u2019s most successful team, has provided a fascinating sub-plot to the Briton\u2019s dominance.\n\nLast time out in Russia, Vettel ignored at least three orders from the Ferrari pit wall to allow Leclerc by. Vettel started the year as the team\u2019s number one, but the emergence of Leclerc, 21, has left the Scuderia with a quandary; promote Leclerc, and desert their \u00a336million-a-year quadruple world champion, or rip up their rule book and allow both drivers the freedom to race.\n\n\u201cIt is an interesting dynamic because Seb was number one, and now he clearly isn\u2019t,\u201d said Hamilton.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to ramp Charles up. Is that good for a team? I don\u2019t think so, but that is the philosophy they have had forever.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the following years we will see whether it works. It hasn\u2019t worked for a long time over there, and it doesn\u2019t look as though it will work moving forwards. That\u2019s not a bad thing for us.\u201d\n\nVettel, 32, faces being out-qualified by Leclerc for the 10th time in a row. He is 21 points behind his inexperienced team-mate in the championship, too, with just five races left.\n\nDr Helmut Marko, the Red Bull motorsport advisor who reared Vettel, claimed his protege is now finished at Ferrari following the team orders debacle in Sochi.\n\n\u201cI hope he is wrong,\u201d said Vettel, affording a wry smile. \u201cThere are still a lot of things I want to achieve here.\n\n\u201cI am not happy if I am slower, whether that is in practice, qualifying, or in the race. There are certain aspects I have struggled with the car this year, and that hasn\u2019t allowed me to extract my best and what I know I have in me.\n\n\u201cCharles is doing a very good job. In terms of raw speed, he is very quick and a real reference. It is normal that you try and beat your team-mate. You want to be faster than all of the other guys.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Formula One bosses are hopeful the Japanese Grand Prix will go ahead as scheduled despite shutting down Suzuka on Saturday ahead of the predicted devastation caused by Super Typhoon Hagibis.
