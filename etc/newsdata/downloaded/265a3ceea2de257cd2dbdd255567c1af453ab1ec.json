[Photo/China Daily]\n\nAs predicted, among all the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it was the large-scale military parade in Beijing on Tuesday that grabbed the world's attention. To some, it would appear to be the only thing that Beijing did to celebrate that momentous historical event. They simply watched it through their own ideological prisms and saw it as proof of the rising military might and geopolitical ambition of a country different from their own.\n\nThis was evident in the reports of Western media, which, ignoring the context, felt no qualms about using the occasion to hype up a \"China threat\" focusing on new weapons such as a \"nuclear-capable missile designed to evade US defenses\".\n\nYet viewed objectively, the grand ceremony in Tian'anmen Square actually provided the world with an opportunity to appreciate an entirely different picture and to hear a completely different message, as the country reflected on its past and looked forward to the future.\n\nAs President Xi Jinping said in his speech at the event, the founding of the PRC 70 years ago completely changed China's fate. The Chinese people stood up to put an end to their poverty and weakness.\n\nThe painful memories of the nation's humiliations at the hands of foreign powers and domestic turmoil over more than 100 years prior to the founding of the New China continues to fire the resolve of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups that such ignominy should never happen again. This purpose has not only spurred the hard work, vision and courage of the Chinese people throughout the 70-year history of the New China, but, more importantly, will continue to shape its future.", "description": "As predicted, among all the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it was the large-scale military parade in Beijing on Tuesday that grabbed the world's attention.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/02/5d945739a310cf3e979f9ac3.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
