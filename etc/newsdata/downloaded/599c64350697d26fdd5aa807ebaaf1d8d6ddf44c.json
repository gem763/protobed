He had his demons'\n\nRobert De Niro on his father's journals: 'It was sad for me to read. He had his demons'\n\nRobert De Niro has given the authors of a book about his artist father access to intimate journals written by the painter, even though he can\u2019t face reading them himself.\n\nThe journals reveal what the Oscar-winning actor describes as his father\u2019s \u201cdemons\u201d, including De Niro Sr\u2019s struggle to make enough money and to find artistic recognition, as well as his anxieties over his mental health and his homosexuality, which broke up his marriage to a fellow artist when their son was a toddler.\n\nRobert De Niro Sr died in 1993, leaving behind four notebooks filled with his inner thoughts, written over 10 years from 1963. A prominent figure in the New York art world of the 1940s and 50s, he painted landscapes, still-lifes and portraits, using a mix of abstract and expressionist styles in the boldest colours. He found inspiration in Matisse, among other artists.\n\nTalking about the journals, his son told the Observer: \u201cI\u2019m anxious to read them. I\u2019ll read them when it feels right \u2026 but at the moment that\u2019s how I\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d\n\nHe has instead made them available to art historians working on a book, titled Robert De Niro, Sr: Paintings, Drawings and Writings: 1942-1993, which will be published by Rizzoli next month.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Portrait of Mrs. Z, 1959, and Last Painting, 1985-93, by Robert De Niro Sr. Photograph: \u00a9 The Estate of Robert De Niro, Sr. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\n\nHaving read only excerpts which had been singled out for the publication, De Niro said: \u201cIt was sad for me to read. He had his demons \u2026 I was sorry.\u201d\n\nIn one passage, his father wrote of praying \u201cuntil I am cured of my mental and emotional sickness\u201d, adding: \u201cIf God doesn\u2019t want me to be homosexual (about which I have so much guilt), he will find a woman whom I will love and who will love me. But I really don\u2019t want my homosexuality to be cured.\u201d\n\nElsewhere he said: \u201cI am full of fear ... of the discomfort caused by my own thoughts, feelings, sensations and impulses.\u201d He even questioned the validity of keeping a journal: \u201cThere is so much I have left out of this journal \u2026 My laments, wailings, self-pity and complaining are much greater than I have [indicated] here.\u201d\n\nSuch passages are all the more difficult for his son to read as De Niro Sr did not discuss his anxieties with him, or at least only in \u201cvague ways\u201d.\n\nAlthough his father\u2019s works were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among other galleries, De Niro Sr lived \u201ca classic artist\u2019s life in a studio that was a mess\u201d, his son recalls.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert De Niro Sr at work in his studio in New York, circa 1980. Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz/Images Press/Getty Images\n\nBorn in Syracuse, New York, into an Irish-Italian household, De Niro Sr was a child prodigy. In 1933, aged 11, he started taking classes at the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, which even gave him his own room in which to work. Later, his admirers included the art patron Peggy Guggenheim. His debut solo exhibition, when he was 23, inspired leading critic Clement Greenberg to write: \u201cGuggenheim has discovered another important young abstract painter.\u201d\n\nIn the book, former museum curator Charles Stuckey describes De Niro Sr as among the most respected artists in the New York of the 1940s and 1950s: \u201cBut like many of his equally ambitious contemporaries \u2026 De Niro has too often been omitted from accounts of the so-called New York School.\u201d The book notes that the artist experienced financial and professional hardships throughout his life.\n\nHis son has been described as the greatest movie actor of his generation. His latest film, The Irishman, marks his ninth feature film with Martin Scorsese. The pair worked on Taxi Driver, for which De Niro was nominated for an Oscar, and Raging Bull, for which he won the award.\n\nDe Niro said of his father: \u201cWhen I started doing well in acting, I helped him.\u201d Asked whether his father\u2019s struggle was all the more difficult against his own success, he said: \u201cHe was very proud of me. At the same time, part of him might have been saying, \u2018I wish I had some success too\u2019. He always used to say to me \u2018great artists are recognised many, many years after they\u2019re gone\u2019.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Still Life, circa 1946, and Anna Christie Entering the Bar, 1976, by Robert De Niro Sr. Photograph: \u00a9 The Estate of Robert De Niro, Sr. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\n\nGrowing up, De Niro did not realise his father\u2019s torment over his homosexuality: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of that \u2026 My mother told me once later, when I was a young adult, sort of inferred. I sort of understood.\u201d\n\nFather and son shared a pride in each other\u2019s work, never feeling the need to express it in words: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we sat down and he told me, \u2018I like this movie\u2019 \u2026 But I know he was proud.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert De Niro Sr. Paintings, Drawings and Writings: 1942-1993, will be published in October.\n\nIn the journals, De Niro Sr refers to his son, writing that he was \u201cgetting all sorts of movie and stage offers\u201d, and adding: \u201cMy little baby-doll has grown up.\u201d\n\nIn another passage, he wrote of his son: \u201cHe is tanned from a sunlamp \u2013 for his new movie part \u2013 and looks much better than when he returned from Italy two weeks ago. I wanted to run my fingers through his hair and to kiss him, but I hardly think that he would have appreciated it.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, De Niro made an HBO documentary on his father. The journals were cited, but only a tiny percentage has been published.", "description": "Robert De Niro Sr left notebooks that revealed struggles with his sexuality and mental health.
