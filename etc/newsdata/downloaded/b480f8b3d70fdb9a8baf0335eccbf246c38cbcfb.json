It was a large payment, $185 million in principal alone, but the company, a real-estate firm called IRSA, had plenty of cash to cover it.When it turned over the money to the firm processing the payment, though, things got complicated. Under the new currency rules imposed by the government to try to staunch dollar outflows and stabilize the peso, the cash couldn\u2019t be sent to creditors\u2019 overseas accounts. As the payment was coming due Sept. 9, the firm, Clearstream, began releasing a series of statements confirming the money was, at least temporarily, frozen.All of which has added another layer of confusion and worry to markets in a country already paralyzed by a financial crisis that has the government on the cusp of default for the third time in the past 20 years. Among the most pressing questions traders and investors were grappling with Friday was whether this blocked payment was a technical glitch that the government would resolve soon or a more permanent feature of the controls that would imperil payments by other companies and the government itself in coming weeks.\n\nFor the time being, most observers seemed willing to wait the situation out, expecting that Argentine officials will quickly tweak the rules so as to avoid corporate bond defaults.\n\n\u201cArgentina doesn\u2019t want an accidental default\u201d and will fix the problem, said Siobhan Morden, the head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York.\n\nAn IRSA spokesman declined to comment.\n\nRead More on Argentina\u2019s History of Defaults\n\nAt this stage, it appears this snag in the payment chain will affect dollar bonds governed by local laws rather than foreign-law bonds where payments are made directly abroad. Companies, provinces and the federal government often sell both types of notes -- those that are subject to New York law and those under domestic regulations.\n\nA central bank official, who asked not to be identified, said the capital controls announced this month do indeed limit these sorts of local transactions. Non-resident holders of local-law bonds need to be paid locally, and rules limiting overseas dollar transfers to $1,000 a month apply to them, the person said.\n\nAmos Poncini, who holds the IRSA bond as a fund manager at CBH Compagnie Bancaire Helvetique SA in Geneva, said he feels burned by the delayed payout and said it reflects poorly on Argentina as a whole.\n\n\u201cInvestors will fly away from there,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nIRSA depositary receipts dropped 4.8% to $5.60 in New York trading Friday, while its $71 million of notes due in July 2020 were little changed at about 86.8 cents on the dollar. Securities from oil producer YPF due in 2021 fell 2.1 cents to 82.7 cents on the dollar, while the government\u2019s century bonds due in 2117 fell 1.8 cents to 41.7 cents on the dollar.\n\nOf course the bond payment hiccup is only the latest in the list of recent disasters for Argentine investors. Assets have tumbled since an Aug. 11 primary vote showed the opposition was likely to unseat the business-friendly President Mauricio Macri in October elections. The peso has weakened almost 20% since the ballot, prices for the century bond fell by almost half and the Merval stock index lost 46% in dollar terms.\n\nCapital controls are blunt instruments and frequently need to be revised as authorities discover surprise implications and loopholes, according to Dirk Willer, an analyst at Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). Officials want to preserve the country\u2019s foreign reserves, but likely want companies to be able to repay debts, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is likely an unintended consequence of the controls and will likely be revised,\u201d Willer wrote in a note to clients.\n\n(Adds fund manager\u2019s comment in ninth paragraph)", "description": "A $185 Million Bond Payment Is Late and Stuck in Argentina", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5452a6a7624e2ea827874b44a4433cb3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
