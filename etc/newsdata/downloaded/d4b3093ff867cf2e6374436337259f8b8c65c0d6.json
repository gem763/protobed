They circled them and picked one [of the victims] off to the side and said: \u2018Give me your phone or I will stab you \u2014 put in your Apple Pay password\u2019,\u201d Klemens continued.\n\n\u201cOut of our group three were white and three were black and they said to the black guys: \u2018You\u2019re good,\u2019 and just attacked the white guys.\u201d\n\n\u2018White People Are Devils, I Hate You\u2019 \u2013 Man Launches Racist Tirade Against London Underground Commuters\n\nhttps://t.co/kkyXhGyoA4 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2017\n\nHowever, the victim did not know the password, as it was mother\u2019s account, and after getting it wrong several times was warned: \u201cIf you get this wrong again you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he had the athleticism to make a dash for freedom, escaping the potentially murderous group. The other two white members of the group had their phones taken from them.\n\nThe victims were young, aged 17 to 22, and the one who had to run for his life is now too frightened to return to the academy.\n\n\u201cThe kid who ran off said he\u2019s scared to come now \u2014 they threatened to stab him,\u201d explained Klemens.\n\nThe coach suggested that the forces of law and order have a weak to non-existent presence in Finsbury Park, located in a multicultural area best known for its links to radical Islam.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been running that sports academy for 13 years and I\u2019ve never seen police,\u201d he said.\n\nCuriously, the Islington Gazette provided no description of the suspects, despite the attack\u2019s racially-charged overtones.\n\nUK: Whites Scared, White-Owned Businesses Stoned in a Racially Divided Bradford \u2018Heading for Disaster\u2019 https://t.co/Rd1O6L29HD \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 24, 2017\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "A 16-strong knife gang targetted a group of young athletes in London's Finsbury Park, targetting the white people in it exclusively.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/finsbury-park-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
