More than 70 years since it opened, this family business is still crafting instruments that last a lifetime\n\nIn a dusty, crowded corner of south Kolkata, India, is a quaint 73-year-old musical instrument shop that easily goes unnoticed. Nobody chances upon Hemen & Co \u2013 you have to know it\u2019s there. A no-frills, dilapidated facade conceals its worth: the shop has produced sitars, sarods, violins, guitars and more for musicians including George Harrison, Yehudi Menuhin and Jethro Tull\u2019s Ian Anderson, plus Indian stars such as Ravi and Anoushka Shankar.\n\nSitars in Hemen & Co are wrapped in plastic and hung from the ceiling with wires. Paint peels off the walls. At 180 sq ft, the shop is tiny; being right on the main road, dust is inevitable. Outside the shop, buses screech to a halt as the traffic lights turn red. The smell of fresh chai lingers as rabindra sangeet chimes from a speaker somewhere in the distance. A second branch down the road is only slightly larger.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Banshi Lal Pramanik has worked at Hemen & Co since 1985.

While each instrument has a one-year guarantee, they should last a lifetime. The wood for the sitar is brought especially from Assam, while the goatskin of the sarod comes from Kali temples that practice the sacrifice of baby goats. In most temples, sacrificing is prohibited, making it difficult to procure and consequently expensive \u2013 it takes a whole month to create a single sarod or a harmonium.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at this job as a business,\u201d says Ratan. \u201cWe are professionals, but not businessmen. Money is important but the quality of instruments is more important. We want our business to remain niche to maintain that quality. Staying low-key has worked for us so far and there\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t in the future. Our father has instilled in us his passion for music, which is unlikely to ever die.\u201d\n\nRatan and Tapan started helping their father, Hemendra Chandra Sen, as boys, and took over the business after his death in 2010. Hemendra had started the business more than half a century earlier. He had been playing the sitar since he was 10, and at 17 moved to Kolkata from Comilla, Bangladesh. He trained under sitar player Baba Allauddin Khan; when Hemedra\u2019s sitar strings broke, he taught himself to repair the instrument. Impressed by his skill, Khan gave him a chance to service all his instruments and those of his group, Maihar Band. A year before India gained independence from British rule in 1947, Hemendra, then 20, started his business, creating and repairing the sitar, sarod, tanpura, tabla, harmonium, flute, violin, and esraj.\n\nRavi Shankar became a loyal customer in the mid-60s. When his sitar strings broke, Hemendra repaired the instrument but didn\u2019t charge him. Shankar sent a portable tape recorder as thanks. \u201cHis relationship with my father wasn\u2019t just transactional,\u201d says Ratan. \u201cThey were also very good friends.\u201d Hemendra taught Ratan how to make Shankar\u2019s specific kharaj pancham sitar.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest George Harrison carrying his Hemen & Co sitar off the plane at Heathrow airport, June 1968.

George Harrison bought a sitar from Ratan and his father in 1968 \u2013 Ratan didn\u2019t get Harrison\u2019s autograph because the transaction was so rushed, an opportunity he regrets missing.) Two years later, Harrison asked Ratan to send him two acoustic guitars. Ratan sent them via Ravi Shankar\u2019s secretary; Harrison, a disciple of Shankar, lived with him at the time. Ratan didn\u2019t take any money from Harrison \u2013 in return, Harrison also sent him a huge German-made tape recorder as thanks.\n\nIan Anderson of Jethro Tull, whom Ratan describes as Lord Krishna for his ability to stand on one leg for hours and play the flute, had met Ratan in 2008 when he came to perform in Kolkata. Anderson played a metal flute, but Ratan gifted him one made of bamboo: Anderson has since bought over 100 flutes from him. Ratan wishes his father was alive to tell these stories. \u201cPeople lovingly called him He-Man. And he truly was.\u201d\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nStar power can only carry you so far: Hemen & Co has endured thanks to the loyalty of its clientele. \u201cMy father wasn\u2019t just friendly with celebrities,\u201d says Ratan. \u201cHe was well loved and respected by everyone including the chai wala and neighbouring shop owners who had known him for decades.\u201d\n\nThe shop has several third-generation customers, including 46-year-old Sougata Ganguly, a sarod player. He\u2019s been a regular since he was a boy of seven \u2013 his tabla-playing father and grandfather bought all their instruments from Hemen. Now, Ganguly sends his students here. \u201cTheir structure, their finish,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like Hemen.\u201d", "description": "George Harrison and Ravi Shankar were loyal customers.
