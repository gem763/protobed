But the ease and regularity with which Kim and his top aides have hopscotched the globe over the past 18 months have scrambled international consensus on how to deal with a pariah state once known as the \u201cHermit Kingdom.\u201d\n\nKim, who had not traveled beyond North Korea\u2019s borders since taking power in late 2011, signaled a turn to international engagement by dispatching his sister and other top aides to the Winter Olympics in Seoul in February 2018. Since then, the 35-year-old ruler has orchestrated a dramatic global coming-out party punctuated by seven trips abroad to meet with five foreign leaders, including three meetings with Trump.\n\nThe speed with which Kim has established himself as a figure of international aplomb has frustrated Bolton, the ousted national security adviser, and other hawks who contend that Trump moved too quickly to reward a brutal dictator with personal attention and normalize him on the world stage, without securing enforceable commitments to denuclearize.\n\nLast month, Kim reportedly invited Trump to visit Pyongyang, and although Trump told reporters that such a trip is premature, there is talk of another bilateral summit by year\u2019s end. South Korean officials are said to be weighing an offer to Kim to participate in a gathering in November of Southeast Asian leaders in Busan, South Korea.\n\nAt a Washington think tank on Monday, Bolton declared that Kim would never willingly relinquish his arsenal and suggested that the United States consider strategies to force regime change or conduct a first-strike military attack. \u201cThese are questions that need to focus our attention,\u201d Bolton said, \u201cnot can we get another summit with Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s allies discounted Bolton as a warmonger and countered that the president was right to reject decades of fruitless U.S. policy to isolate and punish the Kim regime. They cited reduced bilateral tensions as evidence that the president\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox approach is paying dividends, even though North Korea has unsettled its neighbors with short-range missile tests since the summer.\n\n\u201cI cannot understand for the life of me that the establishment in D.C. thinks it doesn\u2019t make sense to talk to a nation\u2019s leader in order to do diplomacy,\u201d said Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served as senior director for strategy in Trump\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cThe diplomacy is in addition to [economic] sanctions. To the extent that it ratchets down tensions and creates the ability for continuous dialogue, who knows if that can lead over time to a softening of attitudes.\u201d\n\nOutside experts said there is little doubt that Kim has succeeded in his goal of gaining a measure of global legitimacy that had once been unimaginable \u2014 a valuable domestic propaganda tool for a young leader determined to consolidate power and ensure his future standing.\n\nIn addition to Trump, Kim has met abroad with China\u2019s Xi Jinping, South Korea\u2019s Moon Jae-in, Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin, Singapore\u2019s Lee Hsien Loong and Vietnam\u2019s Nguyen Phu Trong \u2014 trips attended by the kind of red-carpet pageantry, local crowds and international news media attention reserved for global dignitaries.\n\nImages of Kim being feted by his hosts have been disseminated by North Korean state media even as reports of the breakdown in nuclear negotiations have placed blame on the United States.\n\n\u201cHe can tell his people that he met with the world\u2019s most powerful leaders and take that propaganda and use it to justify his policies,\u201d said Jean H. Lee, a former Associated Press reporter who served as bureau chief in Pyongyang from 2008 to 2013. \u201cThat makes it very hard to challenge him or raise any criticism and allows him to maintain very tough policies on his people.\u201d\n\nDespite Kim\u2019s pledges to shift focus from North Korea\u2019s weapons development to economic growth, the nation continues to face food shortages amid tough international sanctions, and Kim operates some of the harshest forced-labor camps in the world.\n\nBut since his sister, Kim Yo-Jong, led North Korea\u2019s delegation to the Opening Ceremonies of the Winter Games in Seoul last year, the family\u2019s trips have been met with breathless coverage that often glosses over the regime\u2019s brutality.\n\nFor all the viral social media focus on oddities that reflected Kim\u2019s security paranoia \u2014 such as the body guards who jogged next to Kim\u2019s limousine at a summit with Moon in April 2018 or the green, armored train that ferried him on a leisurely 60-hour trip to the second summit with Trump in Hanoi in February \u2014 there are juxtaposing scenes that revealed a young leader who has carefully crafted the messaging behind his charm offensive.\n\nKim conducted a late-evening tour of Singapore\u2019s glittering skyline in June 2018, including stops at the 55-story Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Jubilee Bridge. He answered shouted questions from U.S. journalists in Hanoi in February and engaged a Russian state television reporter upon arriving at the Vladivostok train station in April. And he grasped hands with Trump to welcome him across the 38th parallel into North Korean territory during their hastily arranged meeting at the Korean demilitarized zone in June.\n\n\u201cTrump meeting and shaking hands made it possible for everyone else to as well,\u201d said Katie Stallard-Blanchette, a Wilson Center fellow who worked as a television correspondent in East Asia.\n\nWhite House aides have emphasized that Trump has not lifted punishing economic sanctions even as he has engaged in diplomacy with Kim. To Stallard-Blanchette, Kim\u2019s success in reestablishing diplomatic norms has been accompanied by something perhaps more alarming \u2014 a normalization of missile tests.\n\nKim has maintained a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing for nearly two years, but the regime\u2019s short-range projectile launches since the summer included a new type of submarine-based ballistic missile that landed in waters off Japan this week. Trump has not commented on that test, even as it drew objections from Tokyo and Seoul.\n\n\u201cIf we went back 18 months and they tested a submarine missile on the eve of talks with the U.S., the next thing is the talks would be canceled,\u201d Stallard-Blanchette said. \u201cNow there\u2019s really no response [from the United States]. That gives Kim a very positive sense of where the line is. . . . He\u2019s marching forward all the time to redefine what\u2019s normal. That\u2019s what\u2019s dangerous.\u201d", "description": "The young North Korean ruler has made seven trips abroad to visit five world leaders, gaining legitimacy since shifting to diplomatic outreach 18 months ago.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DJTiobLuQ4QhOMON_drzUxWR_Kw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VGNTCSXGEII6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
