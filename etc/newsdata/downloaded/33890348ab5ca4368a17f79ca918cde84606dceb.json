Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nThat\u2019s far from the only reason the deal has faced criticism from unions, some MPs, the founding family; who\u2019ve variously voiced fears about the impact on jobs, the UK\u2019s industrial base, its national security.\n\nIt is on the latter grounds that business secretary Andrea Leadsom has called in the bid, which will now go through to a first-stage assessment by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nAdvent sought to address the criticism by making all the usual promises about investing in the company and the UK.\n\nBut as a union source put it to me: \u201cLook at the history of private equity firms in this country. They\u2019ve left a trail of devastation in their wake.\u201d\n\nThis has led to such promises being viewed with some scepticism by the public too. Its disquiet over foreign takeovers has been building for years now.\n\nThe government has responded by taking a marginally more assertive approach with respect to them.\n\nThe Enterprise Act was amended last year to make it easier to intervene, and there was a certain synchronicity with the Cobham referral coming just a day after a CMA report on another controversial private equity takeover \u2013 of Inmarsat, Britain\u2019s biggest satellite company \u2013 was submitted to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that there has yet to be a phase-two investigation on \u201cpublic interest\u201d grounds since the 2002 act came into force, despite the 16 interventions that have occurred since then. For the record, nine were on the grounds of national security, six focused on media plurality and one looked at financial stability.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how it goes down with the Americans if Cobham becomes the first, but having stoked the fires of nationalism, it would be a bad look for a Conservative Party funded by hedge-fund mangers and casino capitalists to be seen to be facilitating the sell-off of prime British assets on the cheap.\n\nMs Leadsom could find herself on the horns of a painful dilemma.\n\nWhere there\u2019s sufficient will to halt a deal there\u2019s usually a way, as the French made clear when they declared Danone\u2019s yoghurt to be a strategic national asset and used that to send Pepsi packing.\n\nBut the UK\u2019s approach has historically been very different, and its rules pertaining to takeovers and the public interest are rather weak. Consumers sometimes get a look in on competition grounds. The CMA used those to block Sainsbury\u2019s controversial attempt to merge with Asda. But they don\u2019t really allow for consideration of the impact of deals on workers, or on the nation\u2019s industrial base, for example.\n\nPerhaps they should. There is a strong body of opinion that holds that Britain should remain \u201copen for business\u201d and leave questions raised by takeovers and mergers to shareholders unless there are real and obvious competition issues.\n\nBut the big institutional ones that hold the power have proved time and again that they struggle to act in their own interests at the best of times and nearly always put a quick buck over long-term value creation.\n\nAdvent\u2019s tilt at Cobham, facilitated by the weakness of the pound, and the company\u2019s relatively recent emergence from a sea of troubles, strengthens the case for change even if history suggests it will win out in the end. But perhaps Leadsom could yet mimic that stopped clock and surprise twice.", "description": "The government\u2019s decision to call in the proposed takeover of defence contractor Cobham is something that scarcely seemed\u00a0possible for this administration: it\u2019s made the right decision.\u00a0 I suppose\u00a0even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day.
