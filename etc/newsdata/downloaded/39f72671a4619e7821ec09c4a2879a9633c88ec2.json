It excludes any potential to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and requires the U.K. to meet its EU obligations in full during the extension.\n\nEU diplomats are due to meet at 10 a.m. in Brussels to discuss the proposal. It\u2019s possible that, just as on Friday, not all countries will agree. French President Emmanuel Macron blocked the EU\u2019s attempt to delay Brexit for three months, insisting instead on a one-month delay to Nov. 30.\n\nThe bloc has said it wants to resolve the issue of an extension without calling an emergency summit, and said Friday a final decision would be announced by Tuesday.\n\nThe meeting of envoys will take place hours before British politicians vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s bid for an early general election on Dec. 12. The U.K. prime minister looks likely to fall short of the necessary two-thirds majority in the House of Commons, with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterating on Sunday that he won\u2019t back the plan unless the threat of a no-deal Brexit is completely off the table.\n\nJohnson has made the ratification of his Brexit deal with Brussels contingent on MPs backing an early election, with the legislation needed to put the withdrawal agreement into U.K. law paused until they do so.\n\n(Updates with new potential Brexit dates in second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Stuart Biggs in London at sbiggs3@bloomberg.net;Nikos Chrysoloras in Brussels at nchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Tony Czuczka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0The European Union is proposing to extend the deadline for Brexit by three months to Jan. 31, according to a draft declaration seen by Bloomberg that will be discussed by envoys in Brussels on Monday.Under the", "authors": ["Stuart Biggs", "Nikos Chrysoloras", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QPqVCxNbNB0YIxxBY__HGA--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f638c22e6d85f6f414ae43c8837f3968", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
