Its Senate race may help determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress and the winner of its 15 electoral votes will likely control the White House.\n\nDespite Donald Trump Donald John TrumpFlorida GOP lawmaker says he's 'thinking' about impeachment Democrats introduce 'THUG Act' to block funding for G-7 at Trump resort Kurdish group PKK pens open letter rebuking Trump's comparison to ISIS MORE being a deeply flawed president and candidate and being in the midst of a House inquiry likely to produce articles of impeachment, recent polls suggest that he is holding his own in terms of winning North Carolina in 2020. While these results show that Trump\u2019s base will likely support him in 2020, they point to real problems for Democrats hoping to flip North Carolina\u2019s electoral votes in their attempt to win back the presidency.\n\nThe October Meredith Poll asked state voters their preferences in matchups involving Trump and the five leading Democratic challengers for the party\u2019s nomination: former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump knocks Romney as 'Democrat secret asset' in new video Giuliani asked State Dept. to grant visa for ex-Ukraine official at center of Biden allegations: report Perry won't comply with subpoena in impeachment inquiry MORE, Sens.

The poll results had Trump with slight leads over Biden and Warren, but larger leads over Sanders, Harris and Buttegieg. In each of these matchups, Trump\u2019s support was steady at around 38 percent \u2014 just under his job approval rating in the state.\n\nThe Democratic candidates ranged from just over 34 percent for Biden to approximately 27 percent for Buttigieg. This range was significantly below Trump\u2019s job disapproval rating of almost 54 percent. Although some of the Democratic candidates are not well known to North Carolina voters, almost one-in-five respondents expressed an interest in \u201csomeone else\u201d when given the matchups.\n\nAn even more surprising finding was that we asked registered voters to choose between Trump and a \u201cperson randomly chosen from the phonebook\u201d and this generic opponent had the slimmest deficit against Trump \u2014 42.7 percent to 40.1 percent.\n\nThe warning signs have always been there for Democrats hoping to take back the White House, despite polls, like the Meredith Poll, showing strong enthusiasm among Democratic voters heading into the 2020 election cycle. These warning signs revolve around their candidates.\n\nTo many within the Democratic base, Biden represents more nostalgia than a future of progressive policies. He is perceived as a nice guy who may not be able to go mano-a-mano with Trump.\n\nSome remain skeptical of Warren, who has risen in the polls in recent months. For all but the most progressive Democratic voters, she may be too liberal. And many consider her to be more of a policy wonk than a leader.\n\nSanders has a committed group of supporters, but he may have missed his best chance in 2016 by losing the nomination to Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonState cites 38 people for violations in Clinton email review Trump campaign to hold rallies in Mississippi, Kentucky Biden struggles to reverse fall MORE.\n\nHarris and Buttegieg may have bright futures in Democratic politics, but both may have peaked in terms of their support from broad swaths of voters. Harris needs to define who she is and what she stands for, while Buttegieg may need more experience than being mayor of a mid-sized city can provide.\n\nThe old adage is that Democratic voters want to fall in love with their candidates, while Republican voters fall in line with theirs.

In 2016, many Democrats did not warmly embrace Hillary Clinton and their lack of enthusiasm cost her the White House.\n\nRepublicans used to support presidential candidates, like Richard Nixon or George H.W. Bush that did not excite them, because these candidates had paid their dues. In the case of Bush, the Republican\u2019s lack of enthusiasm turned to apathy and he lost his reelection bid. In the age of Trump, however, Republican voters have a cult-like support for the president that does not waver based on what he says or does. This creates an electoral floor for Trump that poses challenges for whomever the Democrats choose.\n\nDemocratic voters, however, appear to be still searching for that candidate they can follow all the way through until November 2020.\n\nDavid B.
