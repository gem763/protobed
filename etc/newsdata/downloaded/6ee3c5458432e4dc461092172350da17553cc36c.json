It widely trended in the middle of a range defined by $8,342 and $8,150, showing no ultimate breakout intentions. That showed traders are waiting on the sidelines for big whales to determine the next interim bias. In a broader timeframe, bitcoin remained in a downside correction, still haunted by the possibility of further slides.\n\nAn $11,000 Bitcoin\n\nAnalysts offered technical explanations for the recent downswing, noting that bitcoin is merely moving in response to psychological levels. Amsterdam-based stock trader, known by the alias \u2018Crypto Micha\u00ebl,\u2019 for instance, said that bitcoin could test the $8,300-8,400 range for the next pullback. At the same time, the cryptocurrency could locate decent support in the field defined by $7,800 and $7,900.\n\n\u201c[I] would probably stick around for a while here,\u201d added Micha\u00ebl. \u201cIf breakout upwards, then [it would be] an accumulation phase and then I won\u2019t be surprised we\u2019ll run back to $11,000.\u201d\n\nAnthony Pompliano, meanwhile, offered some fundamental catalysts that could match up to Micha\u00ebl\u2019s technical expectations.

The Trump administration announced yesterday that it would restrict American companies from exporting goods to 28 Chinese firms. That left analysts confused about a game-changing outcome on the ongoing trade war, which has already sent global markets astray.\n\nChannel 3000 said that the Dow Jones Index and the broader market are set to open trade in a negative area, citing futures data.\n\n\u201cFutures for the Dow are down 0.7%, implying a nearly 200-point drop at the open. S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite futures are also down 0.7%,\u201d the agency noted.\n\nThe downside in US equity markets, meanwhile, is creating opportunities for safe-haven assets. Gold, for instance, surged by 0.81 percent on Tuesday against the gloomy intraday outlook, rising as high as $1,508.748 at one point.\n\nA section of cryptocurrency analysts see bitcoin to behave as a hedging asset should the US-China trade deal goes kaput.
