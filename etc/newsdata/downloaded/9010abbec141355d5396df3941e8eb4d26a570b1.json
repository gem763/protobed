The New York case is different in nature as it essentially revolves around investor fraud. From 2010, Exxon told the public it had assigned a price to carbon to account for how government regulation would affect its business. However, it privately used a much lower figure, allowing it to make carbon-heavy investments such as in the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, that would appear much less profitable otherwise.\n\nThe lawsuit, now led by New York attorney general Leticia James, alleges Exxon ran a \u201clongstanding fraudulent scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cExxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation and had factored those risks into its business operations,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\n\u201cAs a result of Exxon\u2019s fraud, the company was exposed to far greater risk from climate change regulations than investors were led to believe.\u201d\n\nExxon has said the allegations are false and it expects to be exonerated in court. James declined the opportunity to comment further, although her office wrote to the court in August to complain that Exxon was trying to discourage potential witnesses by swamping them with demands for documents.\n\n\u201cI do think this is an extremely important case in that it focuses on the climate risks posed to Exxon through its own accounting processes,\u201d said Michael Burger, a climate law expert at Columbia University. \u201cThe lawsuit is seeking to ensure this company and others are on notice that climate change matters materially for business purposes, as it should.\u201d\n\nExxon is one of just 20 fossil fuel companies responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era, Guardian-commissioned data has found. The Texas-based company has contributed nearly 42 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965.", "description": "New York lawsuit alleges company was \u2018exposed to far greater risk from climate change than investors were led to believe\u2019", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e95bb2a766960fd5d52c32e5d0fb9354ff9d546/0_110_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=095208a4cfd4b3b42744a6edc0ec6660", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
