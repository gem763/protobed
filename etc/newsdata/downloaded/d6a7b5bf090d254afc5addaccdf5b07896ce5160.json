(Alan Dep/AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The place that helped make the Internet the center of our lives may have to live offline, at least temporarily.\n\nNearly a million Northern Californians are enduring or preparing for unprecedented blackouts \u2014 and top U.S. mobile providers are scrambling to maintain service. AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile said the shutdowns could interrupt service and make it difficult or impossible to make calls, send texts or access the Internet.\n\nOnly Verizon expressed unwavering confidence about its service in the face of the blackouts.\n\nOne of the largest utilities in the nation, Pacific Gas & Electric, began shutting off power Wednesday ahead of dry, windy conditions that increase the risk of dangerous wildfires. The blackout affected about 500,000 customers early Wednesday, with additional blackouts expected to impact about 300,000 others on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n[California power outage: What happens when the lights go out]\n\nPG&E told customers that power could be out for as long as five days, depending on weather and how long it takes to get power systems back up and running. Some people had lost cellular coverage as of Wednesday evening, according to AT&T spokesman Jim Greer. T-Mobile also reported some outages.\n\nAll the companies are encouraging customers to fully charge their devices before a scheduled outage, consider purchasing a charging device that doesn\u2019t need to be plugged in, prepare an emergency kit and keep in touch with officials for updates.\n\nBackup equipment will be key to whether the connected Bay Area can get online during the blackout.\n\nAT&T\u2019s Greer said the company is working as quickly as possible to deploy recovery and generators in areas where customers may be affected. He added, though, that network is performing well despite the outages. AT&T is offering unlimited talk, text and data to its customers in 758 California Zip codes between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13.\n\nAT&T was informed of the power shutdowns in over 38 counties less than 36 hours in advance, and the information changed in the hours ahead of the blackouts according to a person close to the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n[California cuts power to more than 500,000 as high winds raise wildfire threat]\n\nIn a blog post on its website, Sprint said that the blackouts could impact cellular towers in the affected area. Some of the sites have generators, and the company says it is deploying backup power to the ones that don\u2019t as quickly as possible.\n\nT-Mobile stated in a post that the company has permanent generators in \u201ckey cell sites\u201d and backup battery power elsewhere. Temporary generators can also be deployed if necessary.\n\n\u201cWe understand that service disruptions are an inconvenience to our customers and we appreciate their patience during this event,\u201d T-Mobile said in a statement.\n\nVerizon spokeswoman Jeannine Brew Braggs said the company can serve customers \u201cindefinitely\u201d until commercial power is restored. She attributed that to the generators and backup batteries on-site at the majority of its cell towers and other locations. Brew Braggs said the company can refuel the generators to keep them running.\n\n[PG&E power lines to blame for California\u2019s deadliest wildfire ever, officials say]\n\nOfficials determined earlier this year that PG&E equipment was responsible for the deadliest wildfire in California history, which killed 85 people, destroyed the town of Paradise and nearby areas and burned 150,000 acres.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January in anticipation of $50 billion in liabilities stemming from the disaster.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that a barricade was set up in front of PG&E\u2019s headquarters in the city in to protect employees from frustrated customers.\n\nPG&E did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Mobile companies are scrambling to maintain service for the 800,000 Californians who may experience power outages this week.", "authors": ["Marie C.
