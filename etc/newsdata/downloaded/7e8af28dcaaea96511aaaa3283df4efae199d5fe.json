It was the game distilled: a lot of hectic energy, very little calculation \u2013 even some outright stupidity.\n\nThat was partly what put Arsenal in that situation. While they were so impressively effervescent going forward, as is going to happen with a team that features Nicolas Pepe, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alex Lacazette, they were damagingly effervescent at the back\u2026 as is going to happen with a team that features David Luiz, Xhaka and their most combative midfielder \u2013 Lucas Torreira \u2013 out wide.\n\nSpurs at that point didn\u2019t even have to be that good \u2013 and certainly weren\u2019t at the back themselves. They apparently just had to get the ball forward. Christian Eriksen\u2019s opening goal came from the most functional and direct approach possible, from Hugo Lloris\u2019s punt to Erik Lamela\u2019s run through. With Arsenal seemingly just vacating space, the Dane was left to tap it in. The ball just had to be in the box for the second goal, as Xhaka lunged so wildly, and Harry Kane predictably finished so well.\n\nThe problem with such a basic tactical approach for Spurs, though, was that it was dependent on Arsenal staying so chaotic. It was no coincidence that there was a complete change in the game with the one piece of proper calculation \u2013 even if it was to rectify an error. Emery removed Torreira, and reshaped his midfield, with the precocious Guendouzi then reshaping the entire match. He was suddenly dominant, winning everything, running everything.\n\nArsenal admittedly benefitted from the big psychological boost of that Lacazette goal before half-time \u2013 itself of course coming from yet another stupid moment, this time from Danny Rose \u2013 but it did feel that the momentum had already changed.\n\nIt was only going one way throughout the second half, and the equalising goal was appropriately one that almost seemed to be just going with the wind. Aubameyang only had to guide in Guendouzi\u2019s superbly flighted pass.\n\nThere were spells after that where the ball was just flying around Lloris\u2019 box, no one knowing where it would end up, just as the occasional Spurs break meant no one really know how the game would end up.\n\nWhich mend such chaos ended up finishing with a contradictory order: both teams claiming a point, both claiming some sense of progress from it.\n\nLike so much else in this match, though, they might have to think about that a bit more deeply.", "description": "An entertainingly stupid derby, and one logical result to bring it right back around like Arsenal: a 2-2 draw.
