Getty Images\n\nInitial expectations suggested that Sunday\u2019s race was under threat from extreme weather, but the forecast now predicts Hagibis to make landfall on Saturday, meaning the afternoon\u2019s qualifying session is now at risk.\n\nThis is not the first time that Suzuka has been in the hands of a typhoon. In 2004 and 2010, qualifying had to be postponed until Sunday morning before the race, with the FIA considering a similar move unless forecasts change in the next 48 hours.\n\nThe FIA is in talks with the race organisers, the Japanese Automobile Federation, and Liberty Media in order to restructure the weekend timetable if necessary.\n\nHeavy rain and high winds are expected across the weekend, with satellite images revealing Hagibis to be larger in size than Japan itself, with stormy conditions stretching for thousands of kilometres.\n\nIn 2014, the Japanese Grand Prix was hit by heavy rain that caused the crash involving Jules Bianchi, who suffered injuries that he would pass away from nine months later. F1 was criticised at the time for allowing the race to take place in such bad conditions.", "description": "The Japanese Grand Prix weekend is facing serious disruption, with Saturday\u2019s qualifying session the most likely to be under threat from Super Typhoon Hagibis.
