In September, he said that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit any further.\n\nHowever, the Remainer-dominated House of Commons forced through a bill that compelled the prime minister to ask for an extension if an exit agreement had not been passed in the lower house by October 19th to stop a clean-break Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson sent the letter requesting the extension ten days ago, and the European Council granted on Monday a three-month \u201cflextension\u201d to Article 50. The prime minister wrote to Council President Donald Tusk on Monday to formally accept the delay, officially marking that the UK will not be leaving the EU as pledged on October 31st.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury admitted that its hoard of 10,000 coins bearing the date would be shredded and \u201crecycled\u201d, according to Sky News. The Royal Mint is absorbing the cost at no expense to the taxpayer, the Treasury confirmed.\n\nA coin marking the March 29th date was also designed but had not been minted by the time the first delay to Brexit was announced.\n\n\u201cWe will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the European Union, and this will enter circulation after we have left,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said.\n\nMay promised 108 times the UK would leave the EU on March 29th https://t.co/dUmhLJaPNC \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2019\n\nThe government has also wound down its no-deal preparations, with reports outlining that hundreds of civil servants stood down on Monday night and returned to their regular duties. The Mirror reports that Operation Yellowhammer, government contingency planning for a clean-break on October 31st, was halted after London and Brussels agreed to the January 31st, 2020, extension.\n\nOn Monday, Downing Street also confirmed that it paused its \u00a3100 million advertising campaign which sought to prepare Britons and businesses to \u2018Get Ready for Brexit\u2019 on October 31st.\n\nSources told The Mirror that despite the scaling back, no-deal preparations had not been entirely shelved.\n\nOn Sunday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticised Mr Johnson and the Tories for failing to deliver on their promise.\n\n\u201c[Mr Johnson] said we are leaving on the 31st of October, \u2018come what may\u2019, \u2018do or die\u2019, I\u2019d rather be \u2018dead in a ditch\u2019 than extend beyond the 31st of October.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019ll do my best\u2019 to get us out on the 31st of October, he didn\u2019t say, \u2018I will try\u2019, he didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019ll do my damnedest\u2019. He said, \u2018we will be leaving\u2019 on that date.\n\n\u201cAt some point, this week, do you think the prime minister will apologise for misleading the nation? I don\u2019t think he will.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of commemorative Brexit 50p coins will be melted down after the EU granted another extension to Article 50.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Parliament-vs-the-People-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
