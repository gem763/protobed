(Julio Aguilar/Getty Images)\n\nBetween Tommy Pham\u2019s plate appearances in the fifth and 10th innings, the Orioles held Pham\u2019s Tampa Bay Rays without a hit. But Pham made both of those at-bats count.\n\nPham\u2019s walk-off single in the 10th off Dillon Tate sent the Orioles to a 5-4 loss, their third straight defeat. Before Tate walked Joey Wendle with one out, Orioles pitchers had combined to retire 14 of 15 batters since Pham\u2019s two-run double in the fifth, with Tanner Scott hitting Pham with a pitch in the eighth being the only blemish.\n\nWendle advanced to second on a grounder to the right side of the Orioles\u2019 shifted infield that might\u2019ve been a double play ball with different positioning. He scored when Pham\u2019s 105.6-mph drive went past diving third baseman Rio Ruiz and left fielder DJ Stewart\u2019s on-line throw arrived too late.\n\n\u201cPham hit that ball hard, so that\u2019s a really tough play,\u201d Orioles Manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cAnd because of the shift, we\u2019re not in great position for the double play there. It\u2019s just hit soft enough where we can\u2019t do anything with it. You just can\u2019t walk guys in extra-inning games. That was little bit of an unfortunate inning.\u201d\n\nPham\u2019s single followed two up-and-in pitches from Tate, which Pham said prompted the Orioles\u2019 dugout to start \u201ccheering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more frustrated with their dugout hollering after the pitches that were thrown,\u201d Pham said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Orioles (45-92) did little offensively after a four-run rally in the sixth. Before Hanser Alberto\u2019s 12-pitch infield single in the 10th, the Rays retired 11 straight Orioles.", "description": "Tommy Pham\u2019s walk-off single deals Baltimore its third straight defeat.", "authors": ["Baltimore Sun", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EsMW-Rjn5oCyimHMHdEyOBTuLCs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FHT3JMGN3II6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
