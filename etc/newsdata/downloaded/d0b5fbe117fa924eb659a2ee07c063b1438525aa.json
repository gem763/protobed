Nothing about these events supplies any confidence that his advisers can effectively direct him, or that the kind of advice available to him (see Rudy Giuliani, shadow secretary of state) won\u2019t keep on getting worse. Nothing about the relative calm of years one through three guarantees that the test isn\u2019t lurking in year four.\n\nOr in year five or six or seven, should Trump be re-elected. Which points us to the central issue for Republican-leaning voters and Republican senators alike. Both groups have grown used to Trump, in part because human beings grow used to all things, but in part because the most alarmist predictions, mine included, did not accurately describe his first two years in office.\n\nBut those voters and legislators have to ask themselves, at the polls in 2020 or sooner in a Senate trial, what seems more likely to predict Trump\u2019s governance going forward: The relatively restrained pattern of the McMaster-Mattis-Kelly period, or the unchecked impulses that just gave us death and betrayal and humiliation for no reason, none at all, save that our president is unfit for his job.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Trump-Turkey-Syria.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
