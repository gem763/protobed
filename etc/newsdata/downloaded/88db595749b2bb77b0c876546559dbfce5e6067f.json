JSW has appealed to a higher court against that court order.\n\nA source close to the development told Reuters on Saturday that JSW Steel was prepared to go to the highest court in the country to secure that immunity.\n\n\u201cAnything which happened in past should not come to haunt the new company management later and hence it has sought immunity from future litigations,\u201d said the source, requesting anonymity.\n\nSaturday\u2019s order means Bhushan Steel\u2019s assets could be at risk and may hinder the sale to JSW Steel.\n\nBhushan Power runs a 3.5 million tonne steel plant in eastern India\u2019s Odisha state, as well as a 500 megawatt power plant for internal use.\n\n($1 = 70.9130 Indian rupees)", "description": "India's financial fraud agency said on Saturday assets worth 40.25 billion rupees ($567.60 million) of Bhushan Power & Steel Limited were connected with a money-laundering probe, a move that could scupper the debt-ridden firm's sale to JSW Steel Ltd.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
