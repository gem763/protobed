This was promptly challenged by other Reddit users and debunked: the shipments of said bathwater hadn\u2019t even been sent out yet. As the news of the non-scandal broke around The Verge offices, reporters began pelting the science desk with questions, including; \u201cwait, you can test bathwater for DNA?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you can,\u201d says forensic biologist Helen Page. Page is a senior lecturer at Teesside University in the UK, and has actually studied how to recover very specific samples of DNA from a bath.\n\nWait, you can test bathwater for DNA?\n\nIt\u2019s serious work. Recovering DNA from a shower or bath can be useful during the investigation of a sexual assault, especially if a victim doesn\u2019t want to undergo a full forensic exam, or showered after the assault. Page has studied how semen can be recovered from specially-designed mesh objects made to fit in shower drains, and \u201cbath scrunchies\u201d (also known as sponges, loofahs, or poufs). She found that you can recover DNA from mesh, from scrunchies, and also by simply wiping around the walls, base, and drain of a tub.\n\nPage has shown it\u2019s possible to recover DNA from semen in bathwater, but semen is very different from other cells. \u201cThe structure of a sperm is quite resistant, as it were, to degradation in the same way that other cells would be,\u201d Page says. In the case of Delphine, the most likely source of DNA would be skin that might get sloughed off in the tub. Page\u2019s research was also done under controlled conditions in the lab. In the case of the \u201cGamerGirl Bathwater,\u201d without seeing the manufacturing process, there\u2019s really no way to know how much of Delphine\u2019s DNA made it into the water at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how many cells would have been shed in the process of washing,\u201d Page says. She points out that if Delphine washed lightly, fewer skin cells would come off than if she washed more thoroughly. \u201cI very much doubt there\u2019s going to be a huge quantity of DNA in a small vial of the bathwater,\u201d Page says.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how long DNA would last in bathwater, either. The biggest threats to DNA\u2019s integrity are heat, humidity, and bacteria, which tubs have in abundance. Soap and other cleaning products might also play a role in breaking down DNA, but there\u2019s not enough scientific research available to know for sure.\n\n\u201cI very much doubt there\u2019s going to be a huge quantity of DNA in a small vial.\u201d\n\nEven if there is enough DNA in the water to test, and you had the right lab equipment, and it hasn\u2019t degraded, all an analysis could tell a person is whether or not the DNA is human, not which human was bathing in it. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to tell it was her DNA unless you had her DNA profile to compare against.\u201d Page says.\n\nOf course, all of this only answers the question of whether people could \u2014 not whether they should \u2014 test a small jar of $30 bathwater for DNA in the first place. Why it\u2019s being sold, however, is crystal clear: as Patricia Hernandez points out at Polygon, Delphine is known for performance-art-worthy stunts.\n\nWhile Page emphasizes that she wouldn\u2019t spend her money on bathwater, she does understand why people might want to authenticate their purchase. \u201cIf I was paying that much money for some water that had been bathed in by Person X,\u201d Page says, \u201cthen I\u2019d want the bathwater to have been bathed in by Person X.\u201d", "description": "A Reddit post made a major splash on the internet this week when it claimed that the infamous, $30 \"GamerGirl bathwater\" being sold by social media star Belle Delphine contained no human DNA \u2014 and therefore might not be her bathwater at all.", "authors": ["Mary Beth Griggs", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0D4Z5Y-TL8X2LFsSJ0u6Troc_u4=/0x144:2000x1191/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6197239/jbareham_160313_0980_0001.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
