The map displays hundreds of blips indicating towns and cities where police have engaged in partnerships with Ring, the Amazon-owned home security firm that sells smart home doorbells with video surveillance cameras.\n\nThe Washington Post piece is the first official number from Ring about who is partnering with them for the surveillance network. Previous reporting put the number of participating agencies at just over 225, and a previous map of the police departments only had access to publicly available data.\n\nRecent investigations into Ring have found that law enforcement agencies across the US have partnered with Amazon to gain access to an online portal showing a map of Ring video doorbells in their neighborhood. The portal allows police to figure out which cameras in a certain area may have captured surveillance footage, for which authorities need to request permission from homeowners to access.\n\nSome police departments have also offered local residents discounts on Ring cameras, and encouraged them to download the crime-reporting app Neighbors, in exchange for getting free Ring cameras from Amazon. For recipients of free Ring cameras, they are reportedly required to give police access to their doorbell security footage.\n\nRing has said that users have a choice when police request their footage, and that it doesn't support programs where recipients ae required to shared surveillance footage in exchange for a free device.\n\nRoam your mouse over the interactive map below to see which police departments have partnerships with Ring:", "description": "Amazon's Ring has partnerships with hundreds of local police departments, giving them access to locations of Ring doorbells in nearby neighborhoods.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d66864f2e22af023d3aacb8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
