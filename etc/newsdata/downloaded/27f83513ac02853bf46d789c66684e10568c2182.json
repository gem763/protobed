Those who fail to make the payments may be kidnapped or killed. One distributor's daughter was assassinated at the door of his business, El Pa\u00eds reported.\n\nIn addition, avocado theft is rampant. At least four truckloads of the fruit are stolen every day in the state, according to the Guardian.\n\nCompetition for these criminal profits has fed into the wave of violence currently engulfing Michoac\u00e1n. In August 2019, 19 people were massacred in Uruapan, the center of Michoac\u00e1n's avocado industry. Their bodies were displayed in three locations around the town.\n\nAuthorities linked the atrocity to a territorial war between the CJNG and the Viagras, the armed wing of the Nueva Familia Michoacana, for control of the town's criminal economies.\n\nInSight Crime analysis\n\nA woman prepares a bag of avocados in Mexico City, August 9, 2016. AP Photo/Nick Wagner\n\nThe extortion of Michoac\u00e1n's avocado growers is not new, but is now resurging as the industry's profitability has boomed as criminal economies in the state have withered.\n\nMichoac\u00e1n and neighboring Guerrero have long been prized by criminal groups as the center of Mexico's heroin production. However, the rise of synthetic opioids has caused the price of opium to plummet to under a third of its 2017 value, leaving drug cartels scrambling for alternative income streams.\n\nThe value of Mexico's avocado industry has quadrupled over the last decade due to the fruit's growing popularity in the United States and Europe. The country's avocado exports to the US market alone rose by 16% between 2018 and 2019.\n\nSeveral of the state's criminal players are experienced at shaking down the avocado industry.\n\nThe CJNG has reportedly used the tactic to fund their expansion since the 1990s, while the Familia Michoacana entered the business around 2009. They and their splinter groups were thus well-placed to supplement declining opium profits by tightening the screws on local avocado growers.\n\nThe resurgence of this criminal economy also reflects the weakening of Michoac\u00e1n's self-defense groups.\n\nThese emerged in 2014 partly in response to such extortion practices and achieved a temporary respite for producers in some regions. In subsequent years, however, many of these groups have themselves been infiltrated by criminals, leaving local businesses vulnerable once again.", "description": "Avocado is an increasingly lucrative resource for criminal groups, and they have a history of shaking down producers in Mexico's Michoacan state.", "authors": ["Cat Rainsford", "Insight Crime"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a285b4d3dbef4db018ba808?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
