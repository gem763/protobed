Boone Pickens has died. Here are the lessons he used to guide his career.", "language": "en", "text": "T. Boone Pickens, \"The Oracle of Oil,\" died at age 91 on Wednesday.\n\nPickens founded the oil and gas company that he'd later rename Mesa Petroleum in 1956, and became a shareholder rights activist in the 1980s as the founding leader of the United Shareholders Association. Then, in 1996 at the age of 68, Pickens sold Mesa and started a hedge fund called BP Capital Management. His role as an investor led to his becoming a billionaire in his 70s, and he spent much of his latter years in philanthropy, giving away nearly $2 billion, including half a billion to his alma mater, Oklahoma State University.\n\nThrough it all, he followed a code of ethics that were often accompanied by aphorisms his colleagues coined \"Booneisms.\" We've collected some of the lessons he passed on most frequently.\n\nFollowing a plan is necessary for success.\n\nIn 2017, Pickens wrote an open letter to graduating college seniors, in which he passed on the best lesson his father ever gave him.\n\nAt Pickens' induction ceremony to the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, his dad told him, \"A fool with a plan can beat a genius without one.\" His parents felt that he was not taking his studies or future career seriously, and said they were afraid he was being \"a fool with no plan.\" Pickens took the advice to heart and made a plan to graduate with a geology degree, which was his entry into the oil and gas business.\n\nBut don't overplan.\n\nPickens believed that the most important quality in a leader is the willingness to make decisions. \"Don't fall victim to what I call the ready-aim-aim-aim-aim syndrome,\" he'd often say. \"You must be willing to fire.\"\n\nRead more: T. Boone Pickens, the 'Oracle of Oil,' Republican donor, and billionaire philanthropist, dies at 91\n\nAnd don't get tripped up by distractions.\n\nOne of Pickens' Booneisms was,\"When you are hunting elephants, don't get distracted chasing rabbits.\"\n\nWork ethic determines success.\n\nIn 2015, Pickens told reporter Julia La Roche, when she worked for Business Insider, that that was no secret to success. \"It's very simple\u2014good work ethic. If you want to be a lawyer, geologist, or a nurse, work ethic comes first. Everything else falls into place.\"\n\nManagement is nothing without leadership.\n\nPickens wrote in his 2000 book, \"The Luckiest Guy in the World,\" that, \"A management style is an amalgamation of the best of other people you have known and respected, and eventually you develop your own style.\" He noted, however, that he personally didn't focus on crafting that style so much as he did the way he led his team. \"I never consciously manage anybody. I try to lead people,\" he wrote.\n\nThe root of all problems is poor communication.\n\n\"I've always believed you can trace every problem to a lack of communication or lack of clarity in communication,\" Pickens wrote in a LinkedIn post in 2017. He considered a knack for clarity to be his \"core asset.\"\n\nIt's never too late to start over.\n\nAs mentioned, Pickens began a new chapter in his life when he was 68 years old. He's said that he was motivated at the time by an imagined headline, \"The Old Man Makes a Comeback.\" The new level of success he enjoyed later in life taught him that age wasn't as important as it typically was made to be, and that applied to people just starting out, as well.\n\nLet optimism drive you.\n\nBoone contemplated his own mortality in a 2017 blog post, after suffering a fall while recovering from a series of strokes. He wrote that during his contemplation of life, he refused to be morbid.\n\n\"Truth is, when you're in the oil business like I've been all my life, you drill your fair share of dry holes, but you never lose your optimism,\" he wrote. \"There's a story I tell about the geologist who fell off a 10-story building. When he blew past the fifth floor he thought to himself, 'So far so good.'\"", "description": "T.
