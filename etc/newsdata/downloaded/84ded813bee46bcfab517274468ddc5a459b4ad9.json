If you watched this year\u2019s Emmy ceremony, you certainly know now.\n\nIt\u2019s to be expected, of course, that the network showcasing the awards will find opportunities to plug their own content. But the shilling for Fox\u2019s bizarre-o competition show \u2014 in which celebrities of varying stature and relevance sing pop songs while hidden behind ridiculously elaborate costumes and masks \u2014 was next-level.\n\nBefore the ceremony began, the disguised contestants for the upcoming second season were trotted out on the purple carpet. During the show, they popped up onstage, as a logo in the corner of the screen and in multiple commercials. Perhaps worst of all was a too-long and very unfunny bit between the \u201cMasked Singer\u201d host Nick Cannon and one of the judges, Ken Jeong.
