They instantly hit it off; conversation came easily between them and she was even a fan of his favorite hardcore punk band from Buffalo, New York, their shared hometown.\n\nShe was seemingly a perfect match \u2015 but there was one catch: She had no social media presence whatsoever.\n\n\u201cHer not having social media kind of sketched me out at first because of how easy it is to catfish people nowadays \u2015 and who doesn\u2019t have Twitter?\u201d the 22-year-old told HuffPost. \u201cInitially I thought, \u2018I wonder if this is an actual person.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the age of oversharing, Logiudice had basically fallen for a human tabula rasa \u2015 or at least she seemed that way online. Without even an old Facebook account to search for, he was left with a lot of unanswered questions about Bianca: Was he chatting with a lady serial killer? A perfectly nice person who simply didn\u2019t want to publicize every last detail of her personal life on the internet?\n\nLuckily for Logiudice, his Tinder match wasn\u2019t a murderer, just a woman indifferent to social media. The couple is still together today.\n\n\u201cWe texted and became friends for a couple months before we actually met in person, even though we only lived a couple miles from each other,\u201d he said. \u201cSince we talked for a while I was able to get a sense of what she liked without needing a social media presence.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the couple got to know each other the old-fashioned way. But as Logiudice\u2019s initial hesitance suggests, there is something a little unsettling about someone without a digital footprint. How are you going to know what they really look like if you can\u2019t see tagged photos? What if they\u2019re a flat-earther and you have to find out about it in person, over $18 cocktails, because they had nowhere to rant about it online?\n\nAlternately, falling for someone without social media could eventually be a huge win: You\u2019re not going to catch them \u201cliking\u201d underwear models on Instagram! They won\u2019t spend the whole date Instagramming or tweeting! Sounds like a dream, right?\n\nOf course, I pose these questions as someone who will hear a friend say, \u201cI can\u2019t find him on social media\u201d and take it as an invitation to conduct a deep-dive investigation. (His mother\u2019s name is Carol, he\u2019s an \u201centrepreneur\u201d at a vape company and \u2015 I\u2019m sorry \u2015 he was posting memes about \u201clibtards\u201d as recently as 2013.)\n\nNothing brings out your inner FBI agent like falling in love. And that impulse to do pre-date reconnaissance is completely natural, said Tess Brigham, a psychotherapist in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWhen we lack a certain amount of information about something, our brains want to make sense of it by filling in the blanks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone who tends to be anxious, your brain will fill in the blanks with stories and images of \u2018worse-case scenarios.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is nothing on social media, it\u2019s easy to start to wonder, \u2018Who is this person?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n[first date]\n\nok dont let them know i stalked them online\n\nthem: my aunt--\n\nme: theresa or sharon \u2014 lourdes (@gossipgriII) November 9, 2015\n\nWe know social media is performative, that a carefully curated Instagram grid rarely matches up to a person\u2019s real life. Even so, we still crave some digital approximation of a person before meeting them IRL.\n\n\u201cYou might intellectually know how we appear on social media isn\u2019t \u2018real life\u2019 but it still allows us a glimpse into a person\u2019s life,\u201d Brigham said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to at least see this potential partner with his or her dog at the park or out with friends or going to a concert.\u201d\n\nEspecially for women, \u201cit helps us see this person in situations and activities that feel familiar and safe and thus reduce our anxiety,\u201d she said.\n\nFor some singles, no social media presence is an actual deal breaker. Sarah Hendrica Bickerton, a Ph.D. student researching New Zealand political participation online, conducts so much of her life online, she can\u2019t imagine falling in love with a digital minimalist.\n\n\u201cSocial media is such a big part of who I am and how I interact with so many people,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cTo not have that as an intersection with a partner would mean they\u2019re separate from a considerable chunk of my life, which seems wrong.\u201d\n\nBickerton said she\u2019d cave for the right woman, but joked that she\u2019d still have conditions: \u201cI would look sideways if someone was just all about Facebook, mind you. Because Facebook.\u201d\n\nMia Young, a 21-year-old graphic design student in Fort Worth, Texas, met her social media-less boyfriend Beto during their freshman year of high school. Given how much of the high school experience is carried out online, Beto\u2019s indifference to Instagram and other apps made Young feel conflicted.\n\n\u201cEveryone I knew was all about social media,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the only way we all knew what was going on in high school land. But I think Beto saw how it affected others: it was like having two personas of who you are and who you want to portray yourself as online, to gain validation from your classmates.\u201d\n\nMaskot via Getty Images When your S.O. doesn't have social media, you're responsible for showing them the latest memes.\n\nFive years later, Beto\u2019s lack of social media doesn\u2019t faze her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need him to show me off because he shows me in so many other ways that are more meaningful than any half-assed Instagram post,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need him to have a social media account if he has no interest in it, besides making me \u2018happy\u2019 by telling his two followers how much he loves me. It feels so robotic.\u201d\n\nYoung and her boyfriend may be onto something: A 2018 study suggested that posting frequently about your relationship may be a mask for relationship insecurity.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only advantage of dating sans social media. Emily Portelli met her boyfriend, Nick, last summer. She said not being able to look him up online actually made getting to know him more interesting since there were no posts for her to read and make assumptions about.\n\n\u201cAnything I wanted to know I simply asked and got the response I wanted,\u201d said Portelli, who works at a record label in Toronto. \u201cThere was no opportunity for me to lurk around and find things to make assumptions about. It allowed us to be really open about who we are and what we wanted out of a relationship, what bothered us and any hardships we faced.\u201d\n\nEven better, Portelli said, Nick is truly present in their relationship. When he\u2019s at dinner with her, he\u2019s at dinner with her, not hunched over a small screen, scrolling. (Of course there\u2019s a term for that: phubbing.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated people in the past who spent all our time together on their phone. I didn\u2019t feel paid attention to or that they were present in our relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Nick, I never feel like that. We\u2019re never on our phones when we\u2019re together unless it\u2019s to check the time or answer a call.\u201d\n\nIndeed, once you get past the initial hurdle of knowing the bare minimum about your date, falling for someone without social media is actually great: Imagine how wonderful it would be to date someone who\u2019s blissfully ignorant of Instagram micro-influencers like Caroline Calloway or Jim Carrey\u2019s weekly works of \u201cart.\u201d\n\nI speak from experience: I once dated a guy who had no social media besides a Twitter account he kept to promote his company\u2019s work. His phone rarely made an appearance on our dates. (Of course, as a result, I had to explain to him what an incel was and how Stacys, Chads and soy boys figured into their world view. Regrettably, I also had to explain how Stormy Daniels had said Donald Trump\u2019s penis resembles Toad From \u201cMario Kart.\u201d I felt like the keeper of so much knowledge! Incredibly bad knowledge, but knowledge nonetheless.)\n\nSo, yes, you spend a lot of time updating your partner on online gossip (and have to send memes via text) but, ultimately, the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nAs Brigham explained, not having a social media presence means you get to know a person in real life, in real time, and get to experience things in the moment together.\n\n\u201cIt means the two of you can simply watch a sunset and relish in that moment, knowing this was a moment just between the two of you and not the two of you and all of your followers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the huge benefit to it: You can really be in the moment as a couple.\u201d", "description": "Is it a pro or con when your date or partner doesn't have Instagram or any other social media?", "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f75da210000c307343978.jpeg?cache=zlvB3J4alX&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
