And this browser tech is coming soon to Google\u2019s Chrome, too. If you have no idea what any of that means, here\u2019s what you need to know about the technology and the future of your browsing.\n\nWhen you type in \u201cgizmodo.com.au\u201d (or any other URL) into the address bar of your browser, something called the Domain Name System (DNS) translates the human-friendly URL into a computer-friendly string of numbers (an IP address), that\u2019s used to locate a website and display it in your browser.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit like a directory of mailing addresses, but instead of interpreting a set of coordinates to get to a house, it\u2019s interpreting a web address to get to a particular server on the internet.\n\nMost of us are typically assigned a DNS provider by whichever company is selling us internet access, but you can change your DNS service if you want, perhaps because you don\u2019t want your internet service provider (ISP) potentially snooping on the URLs you\u2019ve visiting or potentially selling your browsing history to advertisers.\n\nImage: Mozilla\n\nSwitching up DNS providers has other benefits, too: You can often get some speed and reliability improvements along the way, for example. If you live in a part of the world where the government blocks access to certain parts of the web, then a different DNS service is one way you might get around it.\n\nThis mapping (from URL to IP address) is typically unencrypted, which means it\u2019s fairly easy for someone with the tools and know-how to spy on which sites you\u2019re visiting.\n\nIn the worst-case scenarios, the data can be manipulated so that certain URLs don\u2019t point to the sites that they should be and instead direct you to malicious sites \u2014 and you\u2019re none the wiser. Mozilla has a fantastic and detailed explainer on how this all works here.\n\nThat means DNS remains a weak link in terms of online security, in that this URL-to-IP process is easy to spy on and intercept.\n\nThe idea behind DoH is to tighten it up, to build on top of the encrypted data coming from the actual sites. What DoH does is encrypt those communications by sending the DNS requests as encrypted HTTPS data: Suddenly your ISP and DNS providers don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, and the software running on your device doesn\u2019t either.\n\nDoH has been available as an option in Firefox for more than a year but is about to become the default. Google is heading this way too, with Chrome scheduled to adopt DoH in its upcoming release of Chrome v78. In Chrome\u2019s case, however, the encryption will only be turned on for the more tech-savvy users who\u2019ve already changed their DNS settings.\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\n\u201cAfter many experiments, we\u2019ve demonstrated that we have a reliable service whose performance is good, that we can detect and mitigate key deployment problems, and that most of our users will benefit from the greater protections of encrypted DNS traffic,\u201d explains Mozilla\u2019s Selena Deckelmann.\n\n\u201cWe feel confident that enabling DoH by default is the right next step. When DoH is enabled, users will be notified and given the opportunity to opt out.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the downside? As in the debate around encrypted instant messaging, secure communications for the average user means secure communications for criminals too. Concerns have been raised \u2014 in the UK, for example \u2014 that DoH makes it too easy for illegal and unsavoury material to get distributed, and for parental controls and whitelist filters to get bypassed.\n\nMany parental control services, and ISP-run services for blocking adult or illegal material, work by monitoring IP addresses at the DNS level \u2014 certain destinations just aren\u2019t available to users subjected to the controls. With DoH enable, no one else knows what destinations you\u2019re trying to get to, so the filters suddenly become ineffective.\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\nEverything considered though, the advantages of DoH for most users far outweigh the disadvantages: Mozilla says Firefox will disable DoH if parental controls are detected on the system, and it\u2019s promised not to make the setting the default in the UK for now due to concerns over unmonitored access to child abuse sites.\n\nFor Mozilla, the case is clear \u2014 in the tests it\u2019s been running with DoH to this point, it found 4.3 per cent of users have some kind of parental control or safe search DNS option set up, and 9.2 per cent of users have special kinds of enterprise DNS settings in place (for access to private company web hubs, for example).\n\nThat means for the majority of users, the transition to DoH should be safe and seamless, and when it\u2019s going to interfere with some other kind of DNS management, it can be switched off if needed. Mozilla is using the Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 DNS service to help power DoH, in part because of Cloudflare\u2019s tight rules about security and privacy, but more DNS providers might be added over time.\n\nThe roll out of DoH-as-default for Firefox users is starting now, but will only involve a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of users to begin with, before it comes to everyone. In the meantime, Mozilla will be monitoring for any issues and getting feedback from users.\n\nIf the DoH default hasn\u2019t been pushed out to you yet, you can enable it manually.", "description": "Firefox has announced it\u2019s making encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) the default way of connecting to sites on the web.
