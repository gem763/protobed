As a guest at last night\u2019s Al Smith Dinner in New York City, a traditionally irreverent affair, Mattis joked about Donald Trump\u2019s reported comment on Wednesday that Mattis was the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d Mattis, who had been very circumspect about offering any public criticism of his former boss before yesterday, took aim at Trump\u2019s controversial Vietnam War deferment in response. \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield,\u201d the former Defense Secretary noted, \u201cand Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d\n\nGame on?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve earned my spurs on the battlefield\u2026and Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d Former Defense Secretary James Mattis makes light of Pres. Trump calling him \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d speaking at the Al Smith dinner in NY https://t.co/Y5G8Pls7ya pic.twitter.com/vK5yRmwkr9 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 18, 2019\n\nOuch. Democrats had raised Trump\u2019s deferment issue to paint him as a privileged elite in the 2016 election cycle to little effect, but that barb coming from someone of Mattis\u2019 reputation carries a bite. Mattis largely refrained from any criticism of the administration or its policies, but he had a few other personal remarks about Trump to make at the dinner, although the rest of it seemed more in line with the traditional Al Smith Dinner irreverence:\n\n\u201cSo I would just tell you, I\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,\u201d Mattis said at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d \u201cAnd, you do have to admit, between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories,\u201d he added. \u2026 Mattis went on to joke that \u201cthe only person on the military that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t think is overrated\u201d is \u201cColonel Sanders,\u201d the founder of the Kentucky Fried Chicken fast food restaurant chain.\n\nOne has to wonder whether the White House got the message last night. Picking a fight with Mattis, especially with cheap-shot comments about his legendary career from enlisted Marine to Commandant of the Corps, will not go unanswered. In fact, one has to wonder how Trump thought they might go unanswered with someone of Mattis\u2019 mien.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Trump\u2019s political opponents were all laughing or cheering at Mattis\u2019 counterpunch. As Twitchy noted last night in the wake of Mattis\u2019 remarks, some wondered why Mattis took so long to criticize Trump and why he didn\u2019t go farther. CNN\u2019s Susan Hennessey put it the most bluntly:\n\nI know he's speaking at a dinner meant for jokes, but this is just an absurd and undignified way for Mattis to make his first public critiques of the president. After indefensible silence, this will surely undercut the gravity of any future words he might have on the subject. https://t.co/BvV8iw8WYM \u2014 Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cUndercut the gravity\u201d? Oh, please. The moment Mattis wants to offer a serious, substantive, and direct criticism of Trump and his policies, CNN and every other outlet will be there with bated breath, custom graphics, theme music, and chyrons scrolling LEGENDARY GENERAL LOWERS THE BOOM ON TRUMP. In those circumstances, the media will treat Mattis as the reincarnation of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and perhaps Moses at Mount Sinai all in one. Mattis\u2019 gravity has never been in question. The media\u2019s gravity, on the other hand \u2026\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t Mattis spoken out in such a fashion? He has an old-fashioned sense of honor, for one thing, and also likely doesn\u2019t want to be used as a political punching bag by anyone \u2014 not Trump, not Trump\u2019s allies, and not Trump\u2019s opponents either. Mattis has served his country his whole life and now likely feels he\u2019s earned a little time out of the arena. He can fight his own battles, but Mattis has made it clear that he\u2019s not interested in fighting anyone else\u2019s for them. And woe betide the person who tries to make him do so on any terms but his own.", "description": "Truce over?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mattis-al-smith.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
