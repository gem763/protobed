(Getty Images)\n\nLurie, who has owned the Eagles for 25 years, said he didn\u2019t set out to make a point in hiring women. But in seeking a range of opinions and viewpoints to make the franchise as strong as possible, he found he was welcoming more women into the front office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not strategic,\u201d Lurie said. But seeking diversity of thought \u201cseems to result in lots of women winning these hiring decisions. It\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\nThe quintet of women are: Catherine Carlson, senior vice president of revenue and strategy; Jen Kavanagh, senior vice president of media and marketing; Aileen Dagrosa, senior vice president and general counsel; Ryan Hammond, the executive director of the Eagles\u2019 Autism Challenge, the franchise\u2019s foundation; and Tina D\u2019Orazio, Lurie\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nPhiladelphia is an outlier\n\nAmong NFL teams and the league itself, Philadelphia is certainly an outlier: according to the latest report from the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, only 35 percent of jobs within the NFL league office are held by women; 29 percent of senior executive positions are held by women.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the team level, only 28 percent of all franchise employees are women, and that number drops to 18 percent when we\u2019re talking about vice president-level positions or higher.\n\nTwenty-three of the 32 teams in the NFL reported employing more than female vice president last year.\n\nIf Lurie did do anything different, it\u2019s this: he looked for candidates from outside of sports. Kavanagh had never worked in sports before being hired in early 2018. She was an executive at NBC Universal and ran her own media advisory firm.\n\nThen one day she got a call out of the blue, asking if she\u2019d be interested in a position with the Eagles. She thought that as someone coming to the team with \u201centertainment DNA\u201d she\u2019s have to learn football, but she quickly learned that football is entertainment.\n\nBetter decisions = better results\n\nThose who have been with the team for years point to one example of how the change in who\u2019s at the table has led to better decisions.\n\nIn 2013, a small, all-male group gathered to decide on a new head coach and settled on Chip Kelly. Kelly lasted less than three seasons.\n\nIn 2016, a larger circle of decision-makers, now including several women, gathered to decide on a new head coach.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit different of a process this time around,\u201d D\u2019Orazio said.\n\n\u201cWe like to make decisions based on information,\u201d said Don Smolenski, the Eagles\u2019 president. \u201cThe more information that we have, and the more information you can get from different sources, you can make better decisions.\u201d\n\nThe group settled on Doug Pederson. Two years later, Pederson had led the Eagles to the first Super Bowl win in franchise history.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Looking for executives outside of sports has helped Lurie build a strong group of decision-makers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wYtLSvE0ew0qhL4cSiJLWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wql9Cmne0TKTWy3s8rH3bQ--~B/aD0yMjUwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/6cb14b10-dfd4-11e9-afcf-5d4b8c589ea8", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
