We\u2019re looking for some creativity and goals,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\nA move for Juventus forward Paulo Dybala collapsed in the final week of the transfer window last month and there were tentative enquiries about his club team-mate, Mario Mandzukic. Although Solskjaer was unwilling to compromise on targets, the departure of Lukaku in a \u00a374m move to Inter and Sanchez on loan to the Italian club has left United light upfront.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe situation has been compounded by injuries to Rashford and Martial and placed added onus on 17-year-old Mason Greenwood, who has two goals in three senior starts. Rashford is not certain to play again before the international break due to a groin injury. Martial is being given every chance to prove his fitness for Arsenal after five weeks out with a thigh problem.\n\n\u201cIf the right one [had been available], if it was there, we would have [signed a forward],\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cIt was time for Rom to go. He knows that. He didn\u2019t want to be here. What is the point in having players that don\u2019t want to be here?\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s no point getting players in that you\u2019re not 100 per cent sure about. When you get players in, you need the right ones that are going to stay here for a longer period and that\u2019s the long-term thinking we have to show. I cannot think, \u2018I need a player because this is my reputation\u2019. No, it\u2019s the club.\n\n\u201cThere were strikers [available], but they weren\u2019t the ones we wanted. We couldn\u2019t get the one we wanted.\u201d\n\nUnited are currently 11th in the Premier League and only Crystal Palace among the ten teams ahead of them have scored fewer goals than Solskjaer\u2019s side. Rashford and Daniel James are the top scorers with three goals apiece. Solskjaer admitted his team need more cutting edge.\n\n\u201cWe need to score more goals, definitely, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve said here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on improving relationships, the patterns [of play], the understanding and we\u2019ve started in one end [of the pitch] with the foundation. We\u2019ve done great defensively but we\u2019re not happy with the return going forward.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s troubles this season have also been exacerbated by an injury to Paul Pogba, whom Solskjaer is hoping will be fit to face Arsenal after the France midfielder suffered a recurrence of an ankle injury against Rochdale on Wednesday.\n\nThe over reliance on Pogba for goals and creativity from midfield has become a pressing problem. None of United\u2019s midfielders have scored this season and Solskjaer acknowledged he needed more from them, and greater impact from set pieces.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind scoring a few goals on set-plays and from midfield, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the forwards are always going to give us goals so, of course, yeah, we both expect and hope they\u2019re going to come.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer said Manchester City and Liverpool were beyond reach for now but believes United should be competing for one of the two top-four berths behind the title chasers. \u201cI think we should be in and around the places behind there,\u201d he said. \u201cChelsea are going through a similar period of rebuilding, Arsenal, Tottenham. You\u2019ve got Leicester, there are loads of teams there wanting those positions and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be, in and around.\u201d\n\nEd Woodward, the United executive vice chairman, pledged his full support for Solskjaer when announcing record revenues for 2018/19 of \u00a3627.1 million and stressed the club were in the midst of a long-term rebuilding project. And Solskjaer said he had no doubts about his ability to take United forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doubting myself, no,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I doubt myself then I think the rest of the world would as well. We have loads of discussions so we believe in what we\u2019re doing.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has admitted his next priority in the transfer market will be to sign a striker and creative force as the Manchester United manager bids to bolster his goal shy attack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CPZllt4XM_5RfdlQVenPVA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eQ3APetaOUdqIdrR47wu3w--~B/aD0xNDM4O3c9MjMwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/44dc7ed1b6445d82d30730af4788239b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
