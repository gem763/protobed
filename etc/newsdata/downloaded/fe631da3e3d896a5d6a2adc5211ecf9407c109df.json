The new focus, according to Bang, is offering customized services by analyzing vast amounts of collected data.Bang is a first-generation pioneer of Korea\u2019s IT industry who started Netmarble with 100 million ($86,000) won of capital and eight employees when he was 32 years old.The start-up grew to become a global gaming service provider with annual sales of 2 trillion won and 68 million monthly active users.Bang was able to innovate whenever the company faced a crisis.The JoongAng Ilbo met with Bang on Oct. 23 at Netmarble\u2019s headquarters in Guro District, western Seoul. He shared his thoughts on the recent acquisition and changing trends in the IT industry.\u201cThe past two decades were all about rolling out landline and wireless internet network infrastructure, and the big question was how we could use that infrastructure to our convenience,\u201d Bang said. \u201cBut the next two decades will be about how we use data flooding from the infrastructure with the help of AI.\u201dAccording to Bang, who himself has been a longtime user of Coway\u2019s air and water purifiers, the decision to acquire the home appliance rental company is an attempt to use big data in a smart way.\u201cAs the world shifts to smart IT from convenient IT, the possibility for using game technology is endless,\u201d Bang said. \u201cGaming companies, which have been analyzing tons of data from tens of millions of users and developing technology required for the analysis, have actually developed technology needed for smart IT where data and AI are crucial.\u201dMuch like Google and Amazon creating various business models by tapping technology for different uses, the combination of Coway\u2019s subscription-based business model and Netmarble\u2019s gaming technology will create intangible synergies, according to Bang.Netmarble has been working to bolster AI technology by establishing an AI-dedicated center in 2014. Some one hundred developers are working on upgrading technology used in games.\u201cGame technology, which provides optimized services to each user by analyzing their playing time, preferred content and transaction patterns, can take the reins of the rapidly-expanding smart home market,\u201d said Bang. \u201cTechnology leads the business.\u201dBang had actually sold his company to CJ Group in 2006 due to worsening health. He, however, was asked to take charge of the company again in 2011.While he was away for five years, Netmarble developed 19 games and introduced 11 to the market, but every single one of them failed to gain traction.All of his family and close acquaintances were opposed to his comeback. But Bang decided to get back in the game. The plan was transitioning Netmarble into a \u201cmobile gaming company\u201d from a PC game developer.\u201cMy return might be against my reasonable, realistic and logical judgment, but business opportunity hinges on whether you can overcome that judgment and bring innovation,\u201d said Bang.\u201cThe chances were slim, but I was confident that I could facilitate innovation with a new growth engine, which is mobile,\u201d said Bang.Bang wasn\u2019t always the game changer. He had to face his own failures when he was younger to learn how to overcome difficulties.After dropping out of high school, he founded his own company in 1998 at the age of 30 after 10 years as an average office worker. His company provided a service similar to Netflix called CinePark, an online movie streaming service where users could watch a movie for 500 won.The following year, Bang started a business similar to SkyLife called Sky Cinema, a satellite internet broadcasting service. However, the business collapsed in one year due to financial difficulties.\u201cI spent 10 years as an office worker to learn how business works. The previous two failures were \u2018good failures\u2019 where I didn\u2019t lose the trust of my investors and my colleagues. The trust was kept intact because I risked everything for the success of the business, not for my success, and because I told everything to my investors and colleagues with honesty,\u201d said Bang.For those who want to start a new business, Bang emphasizes preparation. Though starting a new business has become more common than before, with more institutions providing support and with overflowing amounts of capital, it\u2019s the \u201cdesire\u201d that decides success or failure.In his 2015 New Year address, Bang said, \u201cMy age stopped at 39.\u201d When asked about whether he still places 39 candles on his birthday cake, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf I do not stay awake and remind myself in this way, I might rationalize everything with just being old,\u201d said Bang.\u201cMy interest these days is reminding myself of elements that can only be found in young people: passion, a flexible attitude toward change and a positive mind set.\u201dBY SOHN HAE-YONG AND HEO JEONG-WON [kim.byungwook@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/30200648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
