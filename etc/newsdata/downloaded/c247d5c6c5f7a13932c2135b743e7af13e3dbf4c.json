(AP) - Vincent Trocheck scored the deciding goal in the shootout to give the Florida Panthers a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Saturday night.\n\nDenis Malgin and Brett Connolly scored in regulation for Florida, which has won two of three. The Panthers have gone to overtime in four of their eight games this season.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Sam Montembeault made 25 saves and denied all three Nashville shooters in the shootout.\n\nRoman Josi and Kyle Turris scored the goals for Nashville, which has lost three of four. Ryan Ellis had two assists for the Predators, who played their first overtime game of the season.\n\nMalgin scored the game\u2019s first goal at 13:33 of the second period.\n\nWith the Panthers on a power play, Trocheck sent a cross-ice pass from above the right faceoff circle to Malgin in the lower part of the left circle. From there, he lifted a wrist shot high to the glove side of Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne.\n\nRinne made 28 saves in the game and allowed just the one goal in the shootout.\n\nConnolly made it 2-0 with 50 seconds remaining in the second. Skating around the Nashville zone with the puck, Connolly sent a wrist shot through traffic toward the Nashville net from the middle of the blue line and beat Rinne low to the glove side.\n\nConnolly has four goals in his current three-game goal scoring streak.\n\nJosi ended Montembeault\u2019s shutout bid at 9:07 of the third on a one-timer from above the left faceoff circle off a pass from Ellis.\n\nTurris evened the game at 2 at 13:30 of the third with a wrist shot just underneath the cross bar on a Nashville power play.\n\nRinne picked up a secondary assist on Turris\u2019 goal.\n\nNotes: Turris\u2019 power-play goal ended Florida\u2019s stretch of not allowing a power-play goal in their last four games. . Nashville LW Filip Forsberg missed his second consecutive game due to a lower-body injury. . Predators C Ryan Johansen and RW Craig Smith both played in their 600th career NHL games. . Nashville C Yakov Trenin made his NHL debut.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nPanthers: Host Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday.\n\nPredators: Host Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vincent Trocheck scored the deciding goal in the shootout to give the Florida Panthers a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Diamond"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/panthers_predators_hockey_29412_c0-127-3055-1909_s1200x700.jpg?16c5b08745457900daa3c2fc4903b7643eca4e10", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
