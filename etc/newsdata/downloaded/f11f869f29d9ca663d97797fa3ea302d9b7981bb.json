I\u2019d guessed deep Brooklyn, but they\u2019re actually on the other side of the city in the Bronx.\n\nInstagram showed that some fans had started making pilgrimages to the spot, far beyond the reach of a tourist\u2019s typical range on a visit to the city, just north of Yankee Stadium. We reported on it last week, and over the weekend the number of visitors continued to rise.\n\nTravel and tourism has an economic impact of upwards of $100bn (\u00a3780m) on New York state \u2013 so that could only be a good thing, right?\n\nNot quite. On Tuesday, local news site Gothamist reported on residents\u2019 increasing concern over the tourist influx.\n\n\u201cWe hope it ends soon because we don\u2019t need this,\u201d one said. \u201cWe feel disrespected.\u201d\n\nLocals say photo hunters are hopping out of Ubers, or coming down from the platforms of 167 Street subway station for their picture opportunity before disappearing without spending a penny.\n\nAs of a couple days ago, posters were pasted to walls warning people not to treat the neighbourhood as a photo opportunity, and even Bronx local Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 better known to many as AOC \u2013 weighed in this week, reportedly telling TMZ that the stairs, which locals know have been there \u201cforever\u201d, are not the safest place to hang out anyway, before declaring: \u201cKeep your Instagram posts out of Boogie Down! This is for us!!!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that perfectly encapsulates the problematic real-world effects when a spotlight is suddenly shone on an area. Sure, people have been posing next to the Leaning Tower of Pisa ever since it, well, started leaning, for example. But now there is an entire class of Instagram-worthy locations where people flock to, to get the photo and then move on. They probably won\u2019t stop for a sandwich, a coffee or a beer round 167 Street in the Bronx, and they\u2019re probably staying in hotels in the centre of Manhattan. Their presence has very little tangible benefit for those who live and work in the area.\n\nThe citizens of Paris, Rome, and indeed Manhattan will put up with selfie sticks and tour buses; tourism is partly what makes these places what they are. But if you trek to streets which have been unfairly overlooked by both tourists and politicians for decades for a five-minute venture, don\u2019t be surprised if you get a frosty reception.\n\nYours,\n\nDave Maclean\n\nUS features editor", "description": "There\u2019s a scene towards the end of Joker where Arthur Fleck dances down some steps in full killer-clown regalia to a Gary Glitter soundtrack.
