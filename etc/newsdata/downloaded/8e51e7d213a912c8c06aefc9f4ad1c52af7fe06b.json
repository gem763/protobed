It alleges a Sept. 30, 2018, story about the farm has caused \u201cinjury to his good name and professional reputation.\u201d\n\nNunes has gone after other media outlets in court, filing similar lawsuits earlier this year against Twitter and newspaper publisher The McClatchy Co.\n\nNunes in the latest lawsuit repeatedly refers to the Esquire story by Lizza, entitled \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019s Family Farm Is Hiding a Politically Explosive Secret\u201d as a \u201chit piece.\u201d\n\nLizza, now the chief Washington correspondent for Politico, wrote the story after traveling in August 2018 to Sibley, Iowa, a small farming community 170 miles northwest of Des Moines.\n\nThe story focused on Nunes\u2019 parents, brother and other family members who have lived and operated a family dairy farm there for more than a decade even though Nunes continued to tout his deep roots around his family\u2019s Tulare, California, dairy farms.\n\nLizza claims Nunes and his family kept their move from California to Iowa a secret.\n\nThe story also delves into the sensitive issue of immigrants living illegally in Iowa and working at the state\u2019s dairy farms.\n\nNunes seeks $75 million in compensation for defamation and $2.5 million in punitive damages. He also accuses Lizza and Hearst of conspiracy by promoting and republishing the story millions of times online, via social media and in print.\n\nHis lawyer did not immediately respond to a message. Lizza declined to comment and spokeswomen for Hearst did not immediately respond to email messages.\n\nNunes sued The McClatchy Co. and others in Virginia in April for $150 million claiming a 2018 story in The Fresno Bee was \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d In March he sued Twitter and several users for more than $250 million accusing them of defamation and negligence. The defendants in that lawsuit include two anonymous parody accounts, \u201cDevin Nunes\u2018 Mom\u201d and \u201cDevin Nunes\u2018 Cow.\u201d The suit filed in Virginia accuses Twitter of \u201cknowingly hosting and monetizing content that is clearly abusive, hateful and defamatory.\u201d\n\nNunes\u2018 suit also accuses Twitter of censoring \u201cviewpoints with which it disagrees\u201d and \u201cshadow-banning conservatives.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A California congressman has filed yet another lawsuit against a major media organization, claiming he was defamed in a magazine story about his family\u2019s Iowa dairy farm.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Pitt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/trump_impeachment_whistleblower_25472_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e"}
