Yet its more modest approach still has teeth, some experts contend.\n\nUnder Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 plans, most or all student loan debt would be cancelled, and public colleges become tuition-free. Biden\u2019s $750 billion proposal effectively cuts repayments in half, incentivizes free community college, and hikes the maximum Pell Grant amount.\n\nThose incremental proposals provide \u201ca clear contrast between the student aid proposals issued by Biden, and by Warren [and] Sanders,\u201d according to Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Savingforcollege.com.\n\n\u201cBiden's proposals are more traditional and more narrowly targeted,\u201d Kantrowitz told told Yahoo Finance. \u201cProbably the Warren [and] Sanders proposals pushed Biden to adopt a more aggressive set of proposals than he otherwise would have.\u201d\n\nThe student loan problem has become one of the hottest policy topics in the 2020 race for the White House, with economists warning the mound of debt is a ticking economic time-bomb. It has far reaching implications\u2014 including serving as a drag on home ownership and upward mobility.\n\nOutstanding student debt stands at $1.48 trillion, according to the New York Federal Reserve. The average balance per borrower was $33,500 this year. And those loans are increasingly going bad: In the second quarter of this year, 35% of the the outstanding balance of loans in the severely derogatory category were defaulted student loans. That surge represented a \u201cstunning\u201d increase, Fed researchers noted.\n\nDespite being under pressure from more left-leaning Democrats, some noted that Biden \u201cstopped well short of \u2014 and made no concerted effort to \u2014 match the more progressive education proposals of Warren and Sanders,\u201d said Andrew Pentis, student loan expert at Student Loan Hero\n\n\u201cThat doesn't mean his more targeted approach wouldn't affect real change, however,\u201d Pentis told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u2018Small steps\u2019\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, former U.S Vice President Joe Biden speaks a conference on October 2, 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The rest of the borrowers will only need to pay 5% of their discretionary income instead of 10%. The income counted will be less taxes and \u201cessential spending like housing and food.\u201d\n\nModify the tax code so that debt forgiven after 20 or 25 years of repayment via income-based plans will not be taxed.\n\nFix the \u201cbroken\u201d public service loan forgiveness program which has a dismal 99% rejection rate.\n\nMake for-profits \u201cprove their value\u201d to the Department of Education before they become eligible for federal aid.\n\n\u201cThese are small steps in the right direction, but our supporters will continue to call on every candidate to fight for the boldest solutions that end today\u2019s student debt crisis and makes college affordable for every American in the future,\u201d Cody Hounanian, a spokesperson for advocacy organization Student Debt Crisis, told Yahoo Finance in a statement.\n\n(Source: NY Fed) More\n\nWhile Biden didn\u2019t pitch mass student loan forgiveness, his point on income-based repayment plans could still leave taxpayers footing the bill, some experts noted.\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s proposed plan, a borrower would pay less on repayments and interest, even if they earn $10,000 a month or $100,000. And because of those reduced payments across the board, \u201cnot only would it double the cost to the government for borrowers \u2026 It would also make the income-driven repayment plan the default choice,\u201d Kantrowitz said.\n\nOn top of that, while the reduced percentage \u201ccould lessen the strain of student loan debt on American households\u2026 it could also entice many borrowers to prolong their repayment,\u201d added Pentis.\n\n\u2014\n\nAarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
