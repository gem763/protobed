(AP) - Quarterback K.J. Costello will be back on the field for Stanford on Saturday but the Cardinal will be missing another offensive standout.\n\nCoach David Shaw announced Costello\u2019s return on Tuesday at the same time that he said tackle Walker Little will be undergoing season-ending surgery on his left knee. \u201cWe hope to get him full go for next season,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nCostello and Little, who was on the preseason Outland Trophy watch list, were injured in the Cardinal\u2019s Aug. 31 season-opening win over Northwestern and missed Saturday\u2019s loss at No. 24 Southern California. The Cardinal play at No. 17 Central Florida on Saturday.\n\nCostello threw for 152 yards on 16 of 20 passing in the first half of the Northwestern game. He was injured near the end of the second quarter on a play in which a Northwestern player was called for a late hit and that Shaw thought was targeting.\n\nCostello has thrown for 5,265 yards and 44 touchdowns in 25 career games with the Cardinal. The senior has led Stanford to the Sun Bowl and Alamo Bowl the previous two seasons.\n\n\u201cCostello will get you fired up,\u201d said tight end Colby Parkinson. \u201cHe\u2019s an established leader and player. It\u2019s nice to get a captain back to play.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Quarterback K.J.
