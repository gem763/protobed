There is optimism that the latest technologies can - and should - play a critical role in our quest for a more sustainable world.\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and the Internet of Things are just a few of the tools already at our disposal.\"\n\nThe study also found the nation's biggest concerns when it comes to the environment is plastics ending up in the ocean.\n\nEight in 10 people polled said they are worried about eating microplastics in their food.\n\nMore than three quarters are attempting to limit the amount of single-use plastic they buy.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTo help address this issue, IBM has joined a partnership to build an unmanned, fully-autonomous ship that will cross the Atlantic in September 2020, the fourth centenary of the original Mayflower voyage.\n\nLed by marine research not-for-profit ProMare, and with research spearheaded by the University of Plymouth, seawater will be analysed to advance understanding of the origin, distribution and potential impact of microplastics in the ocean.\n\nAndy Stanford-Clark added: \"IBM helped put man on the moon and we're now excited by the challenge of using advanced technologies to cross and research our deepest oceans.\n\n\"By providing the brains for the Mayflower Autonomous Ship, we are pushing the boundaries of science and autonomous technologies to address critical environmental issues.\"", "description": "A quarter of people believe artificial intelligence is helping to create a greener future", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585304.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Customer-paying-cashless-with-smartphone-in-a-cafe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
