A phone call that Macron tried to set up between the two leaders as an alternative to the meeting did not take place because Rouhani declined to participate.\n\nThe document was the result of days of shuttle diplomacy by Macron on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, with the aim of defusing tension between Tehran and Washington. That tension has been rising since Trump pulled out of the 2015 deal under which Iran accepted controls on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nAccording to the document, Tehran would agree that \"Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon\" and will \u201cfully comply with its nuclear obligations and commitments and will accept a negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear activities.\u201d It would also \u201crefrain from any aggression and will seek genuine peace and respect in the region through negotiations\u201d \u2014 language that mirrors remarks made by Trump before the General Assembly last week.\n\nAlso as part of the plan, the United States would agree to \u201clift all the sanctions re-imposed since 2017\u201d and \u201cIran will have full ability to export its oil and freely use its revenues,\u201d according to the text.\n\nThe document was the result of days of shuttle diplomacy by Macron on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nAlthough Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program is not specifically mentioned in the text, French officials said the language on Tehran's regional role was understood by all sides to mean it would be part of negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt was clear to all that the negotiation over regional issues would necessarily include their ballistic program,\u201d said a French official familiar with the talks.\n\nSome elements of the recent diplomatic efforts have been reported in recent days by the New Yorker and New York Times but the text of the document put forward by Macron has not been previously reported.\n\nThe document was designed to allow all sides to claim victory. Trump would be able to say he had reached his long-standing goal of expanding the Iran nuclear deal to cover Tehran's regional and ballistic activities. Iran\u2019s leaders could claim they had resisted the U.S. policy of maximum pressure and achieved full sanctions relief. And Macron would be able to portray himself as a peacemaker who had averted a new war in the Middle East and restored France as an essential global powerbroker.\n\nBut the breakthrough was thwarted after Rouhani insisted that Trump give an indication before any meeting that U.S. sanctions would be lifted, the French official said. That stance reflected Rouhani's difficulties at home, where elements of the Iranian regime are strongly opposed to any deal with the U.S., and a wariness about trusting Trump after he pulled out of the nuclear deal.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared ahead of the U.N. gathering that Tehran should not talk to the U.S. before Washington returns to the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nTrump agreed to the document in a meeting with Macron on Tuesday afternoon last week at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel, according to French officials. Macron then presented Rouhani with the same document, at the Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza Hotel.\n\n\u201cHe agreed on the principles of the document and he thanked the president because there is the explicit mention of the sanctions [but] he wanted Trump to say before entering the meeting that he was lifting the sanctions,\u201d said the French official.\n\nIn an attempt to capitalize on agreement by both sides on the document, and on Rouhani\u2019s presence in New York, Macron and his team suggested a secure phone call with Trump at 9 p.m. that Tuesday evening. The Iranians agreed to allow technicians to set up the equipment required for such a call, but didn\u2019t agree to the call itself, according to the French official.\n\n\u201cWe set up the gear with the approval of the Iranians, evidently, because it was happening at their quarters,\u201d the French official said. \u201cThe technicians arrived, the Iranians let them set up, they assisted them, there was no problem.\u201d\n\nMacron returned to Rouhani\u2019s quarters later in the evening but the Iranian president was not willing to take part in the call.\n\nThe French president then \u201cspoke to Trump on the secure line in question and told him what happened and thanked him for his openness and his willingness to negotiate on the basis we built and told him what the Iranians were saying which is that they need more time to be able to accept the principle of a meeting.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this report. Iranian officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Iranians agreed to allow technicians to set up the equipment required for the call, but didn\u2019t agree to the call itself.\n\nIran\u2019s insistence on the U.S. taking a first step, instead of both parties simultaneously taking steps toward each other, has consistently been a major hurdle in attempts to broker a resumption of negotiations.\n\nOn his way to the U.N. General Assembly, Macron alluded to the difficulties of dealing with two leaders who operate very differently.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is able to change things \u2014 if he is convinced \u2014 very quickly and he is not administration-driven, he decides alone and quickly,\u201d Macron told reporters aboard his plane. \u201cPresident Rouhani is someone who needs to line up a whole system before negotiating, it\u2019s almost the opposite.\u201d\n\nDespite ultimately failing to broker a phone call or a meeting in New York, French officials said they would press on with their diplomatic efforts.\n\n\u201cThe alternative is a major conflict in the Gulf,\u201d the French official said.", "description": "Document seen by POLITICO was basis for meeting and negotiations.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1040062338-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
