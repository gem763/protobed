Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) answers questions at the U.S. Capitol on July 9.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) will not run for governor of West Virginia, a spokesperson announced Tuesday.\n\nManchin previously held the governorship from 2005 to 2010.\n\nIn a written statement, Manchin said he can better wield his influence from the Senate than from the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cThe Senate, as envisioned by our Founders, is the greatest deliberative body in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, when it is at its best, Senators can transform the lives of people across America for the better.\u201d\n\nHe said continuing in his role as senator will allow him to position West Virginia for success \u201cfor the rest of the century.\u201d\n\nThe senator, a known centrist who has earned the ire of progressive Democrats by siding with Republicans in confirming conservative Cabinet officials and Supreme Court justices during the Trump administration, had recently suggested he might be interested in returning to his role as governor.\n\n\u201cI have people back home that want me to come back and run for governor,\u201d Manchin told The Hill in June.\n\nHe added that he has not been happy since arriving in the Senate in 2010, and said he wants to \u201cmake sure whatever time I have left in public service is productive.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the gubernatorial race, West Virginia is scheduled to hold an election in 2020 for the seat of the state\u2019s Republican senator, Shelley Moore Capito.\n\nThis is a developing story.
