Domestic dollar volume increased to $494 billion from $442 billion during the third quarter of 2018, almost a 12% increase.\n\nThe strong volume growth comes despite weak U.S. consumer data in September. U.S. retail sales missed economists' projections and dropped 0.3% in September, the first decline in seven months. Consumer confidence data also missed expectations for September, coming in at 125.1 as compared with the 133 estimated.\n\nMastercard's business in Europe also came in strong during the third quarter, with gross dollar volume for the region of $507 billion, up 16% from the year earlier period.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Mastercard's global gross dollar volume rose 13% from the year-earlier period to $1.60 trillion.\n\nNet revenue increased 15% from the year-earlier period not only due to an increase in gross dollar volume, but also an increase in switched transactions and cross-border volumes.\n\n\"We have recently expanded several key customer relationships, announced our Mastercard Track suite of B2B solutions and launched the faster, more secure click-to-pay online checkout experience,\" CEO Ajay Banga said in a statement about the earnings beat.\n\nIn the year-earlier period, Mastercard reported third-quarter adjusted net income of $1.90 billion, or $1.78 per adjusted share, and net revenue of $3.9 billion.\n\nAccording to FactSet, 30 analysts have a buy or overweight rating on shares of Mastercard as of Tuesday morning.
