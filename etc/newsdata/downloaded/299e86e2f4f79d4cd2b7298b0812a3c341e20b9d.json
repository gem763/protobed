Joe Biden and John Kerry's sons have made $ Billions with ventures involving China and legislation pushed by their fathers and the democrats. Bill Clinton was told by Hillary's campaign to knock off the multi $Million speaking tour among the muslim countries, who had already contributed $25 Million to the Clinton Foundation, (which spends more on office supplies then charity), as if investigated it would be bad. Pelosi and the democrats refused action as Obama bypassed the senate and sent money directly to Iran, and bought a staging drop off for the terrorists realized from Gitmo on their way back to combat. Pelosi herself has become a multi $ Millionaire by taking advantage of congressional rules which permit them to profit from insider trading, because they get to oversee themselves. And what about that multi $ Million fund to bride interns and others sexually abused by congress members, to keep it all quit? Money and weapons to enemies. More concern with non citizens then citizens and veterans. Beginning with Pelosi, congress should be running for their lives, instead of destroying ours.", "description": "Michelle Williams arrived at the 2019 Emmy Awards", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/txVWvfdXMLu_Q3i1s.OwUQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/meredith_videos_131/97b1ad4075043c7da3920508e6e7683f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
