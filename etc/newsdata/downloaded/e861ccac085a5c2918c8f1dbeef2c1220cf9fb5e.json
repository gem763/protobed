He also serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Top White House aide Mick Mulvaney said Sunday he has \u201cabsolutely not\u201d been asked to resign over his public admission", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/473d36_white-house-acting-chief-staff-mick-mulvaney-white-house-press-briefing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
