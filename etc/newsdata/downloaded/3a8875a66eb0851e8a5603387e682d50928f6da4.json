At the end of the day we know that we\u2019ll have to win our next two games.\n\n\u201cWe knew the rules going into it. If it means we have to score four tries and deny Japan a bonus point then that will be an even bigger challenge for us to take on.\u201d\n\nThe impact bonus points can have at the World Cup was clear in Ireland\u2019s defeat to Japan.\n\nJoe Schmidt\u2019s side trailed the hosts by seven as time expired but instead of pushing for the try that would earn them a face-saving draw, replacement flyhalf Joey Carbery booted the ball out of play, sparking wild celebrations up and down Japan.\n\nWhile it was initially unclear whether Carbery, who had been deep in his own dead-ball area, had deliberately kicked for touch, the New Zealand-born playmaker said securing the bonus point was a key factor in his decision.\n\n\u201cI knew we were still in with a losing bonus point and I didn\u2019t see too many other options on so I just put it out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Ireland might have been able to go the length of the field and score the seven points to tie the game they may also have coughed up the ball and given Japan the chance to put more points on the board, denying them a bonus point.\n\nForwards coach Simon Easterby said they might look back on Carbery\u2019s kick and realise it was \u201ca great decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe clock was ticking. We back the players whatever they decide and I think that point could well serve us well down the line,\u201d he said.", "description": "Bonus points helped Scotland deprive Japan of a quarter-final place at the Rugby World Cup in 2015 and Gregor Townsend's side may again need their help to deny the 'Brave Blossoms' a spot in the knockout stages this time around.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435816932&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902AU", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
