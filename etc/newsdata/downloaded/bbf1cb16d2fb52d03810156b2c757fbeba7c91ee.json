In 2016, he was inspired to change his lifestyle after a trip to the doctor left him frightened. This is the story of his weight-loss journey, as told to Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe Turning Point\n\nI don\u2019t remember a time where weight wasn\u2019t an issue for me. I remember in second grade someone made a comment about my weight that spurred me to go on a diet where I ate nothing but apples for several days.\n\nI went to the doctor in Dec. 2015 with strep. They gave me a printout of my body stats, and after seeing the weight and BMI [body mass index] on that, I was scared. Like really, really frightened. I was classified as morbidly obese. The word \u2018morbid\u2019 shook me to the core.\n\nIn early 2016, a friend of mine was also looking to lose weight. We started with the Whole30 diet that January \u2014 you know, the typical New Year\u2019s resolution sort of thing. I actually started to see results, and just kept at it.\n\nEric Hunnicutt struggled with weight for years, but decided to make healthy lifestyle changes after a doctor told him that he was \"morbidly obese.\" (Photo: Eric Hunnicutt) More\n\nThe Changes\n\nIt started with Whole30. That diet is pretty restrictive and a lot of those restrictions seemed arbitrary and unnecessary (quinoa, sprouted grains, etc.). I stepped back and analyzed what Whole30 was really doing \u2013 essentially just reducing the number of calories I was consuming through eliminating specific categories of food. I work in IT \u2013 I\u2019m a pretty number/data-driven guy \u2013 and after doing a lot of research, I decided all I really needed to do was burn more calories than what I was consuming. Doing that allowed me to continue to eat all categories of foods. I started tracking my food in MyFitnessPal and incorporated daily cardio into my routine.\n\nAs far as exercising, I honestly just started trying to move as much as possible, initially \u2014 parking farther away from the building, taking the stairs, walking around the block twice a day at work, etc.\n\nI saw an advertisement for a Zumba class being held at work and decided I\u2019d give it a try. It was really challenging at first. I was pretty nervous, initially \u2014 I was the only male in the class, and a 6\u20194\u2019\u2019, 300-pounds-plus person doesn\u2019t exactly blend into the background. Everyone in that class was so kind and welcoming. Those Zumba sessions really got my heart rate up and they were fun.\n\nAt the same time, I joined a gym and started using their cardio equipment for half an hour a day \u2014 the Arc Trainer or elliptical at first, as my knees couldn\u2019t take the high impact from running. I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but I moved to the treadmill at some point and started using the Couch to 5K app to try running. After completing that program, I still run almost every day. I try to get the distance of a 5K in \u2013 a little over 3 miles. I prefer to run outdoors but sometimes Mother Nature just doesn\u2019t cooperate and I will use the treadmill.\n\nI felt phenomenal. I realized I had more energy, despite working out more. I was sleeping better. I started to notice not only the number on the scale going down but many non-scale victories (favorite clothes being too big, not needing a seatbelt extender on an airplane, going up a flight of stairs without being winded, etc.). Those little things I noticed, feedback from others, and being able to recognize that I felt better were what kept me going.\n\nHunnicutt, pictured after and before his weight-loss journey, started by following the Whole30 diet, before switching to counting calories and doing cardio at the gym.
