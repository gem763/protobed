But some Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, took the issue of population control to new levels.\n\nA member of the audience, Martha Readyoff, who was identified as a teacher, told Sanders the planet has experienced a doubling of human population growth in the last 50 years and this is unsustainable.\n\n\u201cI realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians but it\u2019s crucial to face,\u201d she said. \u201cEmpowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?\u201d\n\n\"The answer's yes,'\" Bernie answered. \"Women in the United States of Americas, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions.\"\n\n\"And the Mexico City agreement \u2014 which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control \u2014 to me is totally absurd,\" he continued. \"So, I think, especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, it's something I very strongly support.\"\n\nThe response shook Twitter users.\n\nDemocrat Voter: There are too many humans on earth.\n\n\n\nBernie: I agree. We need to fund abortions to poor, third world countries.\n\n\n\nThis is absolutely horrifying. pic.twitter.com/B2SBT053mz \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 5, 2019\n\nOh my goodness! Oh my goodness!!!\n\n\n\nAn American presidential candidate speaks about how important it is for America to fund the abortion in poor third world countries.\n\n\n\nI repeat, @BernieSanders wants America to fund the killing of Africa\u2019s unborn babies!pic.twitter.com/7CBHS2nG09 \u2014 Obianuju Ekeocha (@obianuju) September 5, 2019\n\nLet\u2019s just state for the record: talking about needing \u201cpopulation control\u201d through ABORTION for the sake of CLIMATE is talking about EUGENICS. The fact that @BernieSanders is willing to entertain this vile idea is not only disgusting, it should be disqualifying. \u2014 S.E.
