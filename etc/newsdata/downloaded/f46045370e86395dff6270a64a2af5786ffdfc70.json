Rhythm Pacheco, a student from Utah, wrote a note to her teacher, after she noticed a Math problem and took a stand against it.\n\nRhythm\u2019s mother noticed the handwritten note when she was checking her daughter\u2019s homework. She took a picture of the note and posted it on her social media after which thousands of people praised the little girl.\n\nThe question which she refused to do was to draw a comparison of weights between three Class 4 students - Isabel, Irene and Sue. It asks how much heavier is Isabel than the lightest student. \u2018The table to the right shows the weight of three Grade 4 students. How much heavier is Isabel than the lightest student,\u2019 read the question.\n\nRhythm got offended by the question and decided not to attempt the question writing \u2018What!!! This is offensive. Sorry I won\u2019t right, this its rood (sic)\u2019 . After which she left a note for her teacher writing, \u2018Dear Mrs. Shaw, I don\u2019t want to be rude, but I don\u2019t think that math problem was very nice because that\u2019s judging people\u2019s weight. Also, the reason I did not do the sentence is cause I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s nice. - Love Rhythm\u2019.\n\nDon't Miss 7.6 K SHARES 108.3 K SHARES 16.7 K SHARES 11.9 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES\n\nThe little girl\u2019s concern was that \"it could be damaging to young girls and judging people\u2019s weight is not nice\". Rhythm\u2019s mother told Today that her husband and she is extremely proud of the response, adding that the teacher also handled the situation nicely.\n\n\u201cRhythm\u2019s teacher was so responsive and handled the situation with such care. She told her she understands how she would be upset about this and that she didn\u2019t have to write out the answer,\" said Naomi.\n\nPeople need to understand that it is not funny or okay to comment on somebody\u2019s body weight. As Rhythm said that it could be damaging to young girls, because school is the foundation on which the rest of their lives are built. If kids learn these things in school at such a young age, then nobody should expect them to grow up as a smart and non-judgmental individuals.", "description": "A girl who in fourth standard is earning praises online after she spotted an \u2018offensive\u2019 math problem and refused to solve it.
