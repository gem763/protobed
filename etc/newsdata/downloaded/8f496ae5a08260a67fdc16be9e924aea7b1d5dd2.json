Germany is teetering on the brink of recession as its exporters suffer from Brexit uncertainty and the fallout from the trade dispute between the United States and China.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson clinched a withdrawal deal with the EU on Thursday, although its fate hangs on what is expected to be a tight vote in the British parliament on Saturday.\n\nThe overwhelming reaction among German business groups to the agreement was one of relief as if it goes through it avoids a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"We regret Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. (But) the way ahead that has now been found minimises the damage to all parties,\" said BDA employers' association managing director Steffen Kampeter.\n\n\"The new Brexit deal is better than a hard exit,\" said Joachim Lang, head of the BDI industry association.\n\nHolger Bingmann, president of the BGA export association, added: \"We are very relieved ... if after three years, a no-deal can now be avoided, then it was worth the wait.\"\n\nBrexit has already had a tangible impact on German business with Britain.
