Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News. \u201cNobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser.\u201d\n\nBut Graham\u2019s demand is at odds with laws protecting whistleblowers from retaliation. Over the weekend, more than 90 former national security officials, veterans of both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Trump\u2019s, released an open letter calling on the government and media to preserve the first whistleblower\u2019s anonymity.\n\n\u201cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,\u201d their letter reads. \u201cWhatever one\u2019s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity. Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.\u201d\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nThe Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 protects federal employees who report a possible violation of law, fraud, waste, abuse or unnecessary government expenditures against retaliation from superiors, including demotion or termination. The protections initially did not include the intelligence community, because of concerns over classified information. In 1998, Congress extended those protections to intelligence workers through the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. That gave officers the option of passing items of \u201curgent concern\u201d to the office of the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general (ICIG), who after a review has the option of asking the director of national intelligence to pass them to Congress.\n\n\u201cNo action constituting a reprisal, or threat of reprisal, for making such complaint or disclosing such information to the Inspector General may be taken by any employee in a position to take such actions, unless the complaint was made or the information was disclosed with the knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity,\u201d according to the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Act.\n\nIn 2012, President Obama issued Policy Directive 19, which attempted to provide additional protections for whistleblowers in the intelligence community. (Despite issuing the directive, the Obama administration was harsh on whistleblower prosecutions.) That directive was codified into law in 2014, but there are still concerns it\u2019s not strong enough.\n\nWhy are intelligence personnel different?\n\nIf non-intelligence civil servants feel they\u2019ve faced unfair retaliation for whistleblowing, they have the ability to sue the government for damages. Intelligence personnel do not have that option, owing to concerns about classified materials being surfaced in court.\n\nWas the first whistleblower\u2019s complaint deemed credible?\n\nAccording to a Sept. 30 statement from the ICIG, yes: \u201cThe ICIG reviewed the information provided as well as other information gathered and determined that the complaint was both urgent and that it appeared credible.\u201d\n\nLongtime Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa concurred with that assessment in a statement last week.\n\n\u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump has threatened the whistleblower who reported him.
