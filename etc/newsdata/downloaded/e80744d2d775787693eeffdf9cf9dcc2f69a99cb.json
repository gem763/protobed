But he quickly came to another realization: he couldn\u2019t afford to globe-trot.\n\nSo he tried a clever \u2014 and increasingly popular \u2014 way to book a vacation when you\u2019re on a budget. Hutchins signed up for a rewards credit card that offered airline miles and was able to snag a free flight to London. That first card opened his eyes to a new way of traveling frugally, and often, almost completely for free. He was hooked. Fast forward about a decade, and Hutchins is a credit card points guru who\u2019s managed to rack up more than 10 million miles (10,111,397 to be exact).\n\nIt took the 35-year-old a long time to amass that many points, but he says anyone can get started with a little bit of discipline and motivation (he\u2019s even convinced his wife to get onboard and become a rewards fanatic, too). The self-described \u201ccredit cards nerd\u201d has a day job as a senior director of product at Wealthfront, an online banking service, but being a points expert is like another full-time job for him. Here, Hutchins shares his best tips for earning rewards points and maximizing their value in the process.\n\nLook At Where You Spend Money\n\nBe aware that not all points programs or cards are created equal. The best value you can squeeze out of points programs is almost always for travel, Hutchins explains, not for things like groceries or gift cards.\n\n\u201cWhere points get the most value is if you want to travel internationally, you want to fly business class, you want to stay at really expensive, nice resorts,\u201d Hutchins tells MONEY. \u201cI tend to find the most value and the most excitement out of going to crazy places that are really far away and booking flights in business class. I would never pay for that myself.\u201d\n\nThat said, if you are someone who spends a lot on groceries and rarely gets on a plane, you won\u2019t reap any real rewards from a great travel card, so a cash back card is probably a better option for you.\n\n\u201cThe best way to get started thinking about maximizing points is to look at where you spend money,\u201d he says. For example, if you spend a lot of money food shopping every week, there are certain credit cards that offer cash back or double rewards points for groceries or gas rather than dining out or travel. There\u2019s always a card out there that will maximize your points whatever your spending habits may be, you just have to figure out what cards match your lifestyle the best, Hutchins says.\n\nUnlocking the best redemption value often takes practice, Hutchins says. The ability to book first class trips to exotic locales for next to nothing is a skill that advanced points fanatics have down to a science. Don\u2019t expect to go on a major trip for free right away. It takes a legitimate time commitment to become a points expert. But for Hutchins, it\u2019s worth spending hours reading the fine print and scanning online forums for points enthusiasts, who eagerly share all of their how-to tips and latest deals with each other.\n\nStart With One Card\n\nDon\u2019t spread yourself too thin in the beginning, Hutchins says. Pick one card and join one of the online communities dedicated to the points game to learn how other people have worked the system. You can begin to branch out into additional cards as you become more knowledgable about the different ways you can take advantage of points programs.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to start racking up points in really simple ways. Offer to pay for group dinners with friends and ask them to Venmo you or pay you back in cash, Hutchins says. Paying for group outings whenever he could is how he got started himself. Use your personal card for any work expenses instead of a corporate card if you can. If you travel often for professional reasons, you\u2019ll start seeing your points balance rise in no time.\n\nStay Organized\n\nIt can be hard to manage 10 different due dates for 10 different credit card bills, on top of remembering which card gets the most points for which spending categories. Some people use spreadsheets and smartphone reminders to stay on top of their cards. Hutchins says he likes Mint, a free personal finance management app that organizes all of his transactions for him. Whatever method you choose, being diligent about cash flow management is key to staying in control of your finances in the points world.\n\nLast but not least, the golden rule is to never, ever rack up debt. You\u2019re cancelling out any free flights or perks you may have accrued if you carry a balance and pay interest every month.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t pay off your credit cards, the amount of interest you\u2019re going to pay on those purchases is never worth the points,\u201d Hutchins says. \u201cStep one before you even get started is, have I figured out my cash flow situation?\u201d", "description": "Prepare to spend a lot of time to really master the points game.", "authors": ["Alix Langone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.GQNHJewvf9121A8UYlcHw--~B/aD0xOTIxO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/4baa55521aa8f8ef552a7a8caebfd4a3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
