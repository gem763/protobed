It took me two years to learn to walk again. My hands didn\u2019t have much strength so I was given a guitar to help me regain movement in them. I started making little simple harmonies, then simple songs. I learned to play and became a singer: a bad singer! Now? I\u2019m not so bad. It became my passion, and I became the biggest selling artist ever in Spain.\n\nBegin the Beguine is a Cole Porter standard, one of the most beautiful songs from the 1940s and 50s. I\u2019d heard it on the radio many times and one day suggested covering it. My producer did an incredible new arrangement and I changed the lyrics completely. I think the song was originally about a dance, but I wrote about a lost love, someone you want to go back to. Everything in life is about personal experiences \u2013 your feelings, your brain and your chromosomes. So as an artist you express that. I\u2019m Spanish, but these things are universal. The song was a hit with women. I adore, learn from and respect women. I like to flirt. What can I say?\n\nBegin the Beguine was my first hit in the UK. Piccadilly Radio in Manchester played it, then the other stations followed. It went to No 1 in the UK and changed my life completely. It felt like a miracle. When I was a child and singing in the house, my father had once said to me: \u201cDo you want to be like Frank Sinatra?\u201d So after Begin the Beguine was an international smash and Sinatra invited me to sing at his all-star party, I thought about my father. None of this would have happened if that radio programmer hadn\u2019t picked the song for Piccadilly. I\u2019m a great believer in good luck.\n\nRam\u00f3n Arcusa, producer\n\nI met Julio when my songwriting partner Manuel de la Calva and I wrote the song that won the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 La, La, La by Massiel. The day before the ceremony in London, this guy came up to me and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you two things: you are going to win Eurovision and you are going to hear about me.\u201d That was Julio Iglesias.\n\nYears later, I\u2019d started producing artists when Julio\u2019s manager came up to me at a festival in Chile and suggested we meet. I told him I wasn\u2019t interested. But then a few months later, when I wrote a song called Sono un Pirata, Sono un Signore (\u201cI am a pirate, I am a good man\u201d), I wanted Julio to sing it. It was the start of a long working relationship, and we sold millions of records.\n\nWe kept having to add treble. I later found out the studio speakers had just arrived and were full of packaging paper\n\nBegin the Beguine was on a list of potential songs for the fourth album we did together. We recorded in Madrid \u2013 the rhythm section first, then the brass, the violins, guitars and so on. I changed a couple of the lyrics. We used the rhythm from the Johnny Mathis disco version but made a very different arrangement.\n\nI remember the session because we kept having to add more treble to the recording. It just didn\u2019t sound right. I later found out that the big studio speakers had just arrived \u2013 and they were still full of all the paper and packaging they\u2019d been shipped in, so that\u2019s why we kept having to add all that treble.\n\nYou have a feeling in the studio when something comes right, and we definitely had that with Begin the Beguine. Julio\u2019s voice floats over the music, like Sinatra\u2019s or Nat King Cole\u2019s. It was very unusual for a song sung in Spanish to be a British hit. I suppose everyone knows the word \u201cbegin\u201d. My wife\u2019s mother \u2013 who is English \u2013 says: \u201cI don\u2019t understand a word of what Julio is singing, but I believe him.\u201d\n\nHe is a perfectionist in the studio. Every word has to be just right, so he\u2019ll do take after take after take. I\u2019ve spent more time with Julio than most of his girlfriends.\n\n\u2022 Julio Iglesias plays the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 28 October.", "description": "\u2018It was a hit with women.
