It's the start of a year-long period in which Japan finds itself at the center of the sporting world's gaze, with the rugby event a precursor to the 2020 Olympics.\n\n\"I think the world can learn so much from Japan,\" Michael Leitch, captain of the country's rugby team, told CNN Sport earlier this year. \"They're so respectful in everything they do.\"\n\nThe past four years have seen Japan procure rugby pedigree, in no small part thanks to an astonishing victory over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup , widely considered the biggest shock the sport has ever seen.\n\nNowadays, the Brave Blossoms regularly go toe-to-toe with rugby's familiar force, despite Japanese internationals having not yet been granted fully professional status.\n\nSo how did the sport find a foothold in Japan? And what can we expect from a World Cup in Asia?\n\nJapan's rugby boom\n\nLook at a map of established rugby-playing nations, and Japan stands on its own as the sport's main Asian outpost. Rugby's origins in the Far East date back to English influence in the late 19th century, and the sport began to grow through the 1900s thanks to universities and, later, big industries.\n\nToday, the Top League -- Japan's semiprofessional rugby league that supplies most of its international players -- is comprised of corporate teams, specifically from iron, steel, auto-making, and manufacturing industries which employ the players.\n\n\"If you're a factory worker and doing eight-hour shifts, how do you then keep occupied in these compounds and how do you get physical exercise after working in quite arduous factory settings?\" explains Helen Macnaughton, chair of the Japan Research Center at SOAS University of London.\n\n\"When you think about where Japanese ideas on employment and teamworking have grown from, those core values of commitment and loyalty and inclusivity have been quite strong in corporate history in Japan ... rugby's growth definitely springs from that.\n\n\"Players are recruited now, of course, for their sporting prowess, but because it's semi-professional, they might still have a role in the company. It might just be a few hours a day, but then most of the time will be spent training.\"\n\nPhotos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Tendai Mtawarira, South Africa \u2013 Since making his debut in 2008, Zimbabwe-born Tendai Mtawarira -- nicknamed \"The Beast\" -- has been an ever-present for South Africa. He's racked up 110 caps, becoming the most capped prop in South African rugby history. Now 34, the Rugby World Cup could be the perfect swansong for Mtawarira. Hide Caption 1 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Dane Coles, New Zealand \u2013 Coles had to supplant long-serving All Blacks hooker Keven Mealamu for a spot in the starting XV, but when the opportunity came, he grabbed it with both hands. He was a nominee for the World Rugby Player of the Year in 2016 and after missing over a year due to a ruptured ACL, Coles will play a leading role for his country if New Zealand is to win a third consecutive World Cup title. Hide Caption 2 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Tadhg Furlong, Ireland \u2013 Furlong has enjoyed a remarkable rise in recent years. Having burst onto the scene as a 22-year-old for Leinster, he made his senior Ireland debut at just 23, started all three of the British and Irish Lions' games against New Zealand in 2017 and was part of Ireland's Six Nations grand slam in 2018. With excellent handling skills, he redefined the expectations of a modern tighthead prop. Hide Caption 3 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Eben Etzebeth, South Africa \u2013 At 6 feet 8 inches tall, Etzebeth is a man-mountain who will need little introduction for seasoned rugby fans. The lock became the youngest South African player ever to reach the 50-cap milestone, being only 24 at the time. Following the World Cup, Etzebeth will move to French side Toulon for the 2019/20 season. Hide Caption 4 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Maro Itoje, England \u2013 Since making his England debut in 2016, Itoje has fast become one of head coach Eddie Jones' key players. He was part of England's Six Nations grand slam that year and its title defense in 2017. Itoje was the youngest player named in the 41-man British and Irish Lions squad and appeared in all three tests against the All Blacks.

Having broken through into the Wallabies team aged just 20, the flanker has been a mainstay in head coach Michael Cheika's side, featuring in the 2015 World Cup that finished as runner-up. Enjoy watching him while you can -- the 2019 World Cup will be his final act as an international. Hide Caption 6 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Ardie Savea, New Zealand \u2013 A former sevens player, Savea enjoyed a breakthrough 2018 which saw him become an integral part of New Zealand's dominance.

Hide Caption 8 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Gareth Davies, Wales \u2013 Davies has cemented his position as Warren Gatland's first choice nine over the past few years. His acceleration and ability to fly through gaps in opposition defenses will make him an attacking threat in Japan. Hide Caption 9 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Christian Lealiifano, Australia \u2013 Lealiifano's story is one of the most inspiring of those playing at the World Cup. He was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2016 and earlier this year made his return to Australia's starting lineup. In Japan, he will lead an exciting Wallaby backline. Hide Caption 10 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Cheslin Kolbe, South Africa \u2013 With dancing feet and explosive speed, Kolbe is arguably the most potent attacking threat in rugby. At only 5 feet 6 inches tall, the wing is proof that size doesn't always matter. He was a key part of the Springboks' squad that recently won the Rugby Championship. Hide Caption 11 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Sonny Bill Williams, New Zealand \u2013 As an international in both rugby league, union and sevens, Williams is unique. The center was a World Cup winner in 2011 and 2015 and will no doubt play a vital role if the All Blacks hope to achieve a historic treble. Hide Caption 12 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Manu Tuilagi, England \u2013 Tuilagi is never far away from the headlines. One of England's most dynamic players, he attracted unwanted attention at the 2011 World Cup when he was arrested for jumping into Auckland harbor following England's exit from the tournament. On the field, Tuilagi has been sidelined with a number of injuries but appears back to his rampaging best ahead of the World Cup. Hide Caption 13 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Josua Tuisova, Fiji \u2013 Tuisova's highlight reel is quite something, an endless stream of clips showcasing his power and speed. He won Olympic gold with Fiji Sevens at Rio 2016 and, like many of his Fijian teammates, can light up a game with an array of skills Hide Caption 14 of 15 Photos: Predicting the stars of RWC 2019 Beauden Barrett, New Zealand \u2013 It's impossible to have a team of \"Players to Watch\" and not include Barrett. He is a back-to-back World Rugby player of the year and was part of the 2015 World Cup-winning side. Primarily a fly-half, Barrett has been featuring at full-back for the All Blacks in recent games. Hide Caption 15 of 15\n\nstudy conducted by YouGov in 2013 found that 21% of the Japanese population likes rugby, a figure not close to 70% in South Africa and 63% in New Zealand, but a significant fan base nonetheless which equates to 11 million people.\n\nTicket sales for the World Cup have been healthy, with 85% of the 1.8 million available sold by the start of August.\n\nThe prospect of rugby's showpiece event being held in Japan has also piqued interest amongst foreign fans. It is expected that over 600,000 will descend for the tournament, and players have spoken highly of Japan as a rugby host.\n\n\"One thing I can say is that the people are really welcoming, and the hospitality was awesome,\" Italy international Sebastian Negri, who played two tests in Japan last year, recently told CNN Sport.\n\n\"It was just good to experience a different culture. The World Cup's going to be very, very special. It's going to be done in a Japanese way, for sure, completely different. They'll do it in their own way. But it's really exciting, and I'm just buzzing to get over there.\"\n\nCulture clash\n\nThe country has been bracing for an influx of supporters.\n\nIf history is anything to go by, then Japan has form of impeccable conduct at these kind of events. At last year's FIFA World Cup, the national team won plaudits for leaving its changing room spotless , while fans also helped pick up litter from the stands after games.\n\n\"The hospitality in Japan is the best in the world,\" said Leitch. \"You walk into a shop and they say hello and thank you -- just the small things here make a difference.\n\n\"They've got a great standard amongst society, and everyone abides by it. There are no written rules or anything like that, but, you know, there's no rubbish bins here because everyone takes their rubbish home.\"\n\nMichael Leitch commands a Japanese maul against New Zealand in November 2018.\n\nThe national team which Leitch has skippered for the past five years is an emblem of multiculturalism, hardly a typical snapshot of country with such a small immigrant population\n\nScan through the squad list and you'll find players harking from New Zealand, Australia, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, and South Africa.\n\n\"From my personal perspective, I hope that [the team's visibility during the World Cup] does encourage more open debate and a more open outlook on issues such as race inequality and immigration in Japan,\" says Macnaughton.\n\n\"Those are all social issues that have been bubbling under the surface in Japan and openly debated in Japan and South Korea for decades now -- attitudes to race and attitudes to mixed race children, immigration, equality and inclusion.\n\n\"I think if Japan can somehow leverage the Brave Blossoms to spark some debate about these very important issues, I think that would be a great thing.\"\n\nTime to shine\n\nAs for Leitch, he's seen his diverse team thrive on the world stage and break into the top 10 of World Rugby's rankings for the first time.\n\n\"There's no special treatment towards this player or that player,\" says the number eight, who himself has a Kiwi father and Fijian mother.\n\n\"We all go out and we eat together, and we mix and mingle. There's no separation, so I guess it's accepting that this team is multicultural and just go with it.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby in Japan: Cherry blossoms rise up Replay More Videos ...

Coach Jamie Joseph revealed last year that home-based players were earning just \u00a313 ($16) per day while on tour in Europe, while professional, foreign-based players weren't getting paid at all.\n\nWhat drives the players to compete at an international level, said Joseph, is a desire to play against the world's best teams at the world's biggest rugby venues.\n\nAnd now that opportunity is coming to their doorstep.\n\nIn a pool alongside Scotland, Ireland, Russia and Samoa -- and with an army of home fans behind them -- the Brave Blossoms have their best ever chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time.", "description": "Japan has been a quiet presence on rugby's international stage for decades, but now the Far East nation is set to soak up the limelight.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190909112722-japan-rugby-fan-2015-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
