Of course, social media weighs in", "language": "en", "text": "The actor posted a video of herself singing along to the Fugees, sparking online debate over whether or not she should have said the N-word\n\nLast night, Twitter was alight after actor Gina Rodriguez who is Puerto Rican, posted a video of herself getting her hair and makeup done while singing along to the Fugees song Ready or Not. All was going swimmingly \u2013 until she failed to skip over the N-word.\n\nThe reaction was swift and cutting. Some made the point that Rodriguez had the opportunity to post herself singing any other line in that song. So why choose the most controversial one?\n\nRacismDog Owners \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@Racismdogowners) Gina Rodriguez could have recorded herself singing any other part of that song that *didn't* have the n-word in it yet she went on Instagram, looked straight at the camera, and said it. But y'all on here talking about \"why is saying a word in a song bad\"\n\nA few hours later, Rodriguez issued what most saw as a non-apology, causing an even bigger stir: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended anyone by singing along to the Fugees, to a song I love, that I grew up on,\u201d she said, in her best Siri voice.\n\na chicken on her last legs (@lNTHERAlN) what kind of whack apology ... gina rodriguez said don\u2019t worry guys I have the pass because i grew up on lauryn hill pic.twitter.com/EJRe8d9KaX\n\nAnd then the conspiracy theories began: that the video was a PR stunt to try to keep the actor \u2013 best known for the title role in Jane the Virgin \u2013 relevant. Perhaps the real conspiracy, as remarked on by writer Saeed Jones, should have been about who was being paid to do her makeup.\n\nSaeed Jones (@theferocity) Theory: Gina\u2019s make-up artist is black and fed up with the bullshit. Tell me this isn\u2019t a revenge color palette! pic.twitter.com/wqHEsE7Hiq\n\nA more heartfelt apology has since been uploaded to her online platforms, in which Rodriguez states: \u201cIn song or in real life, the words I spoke should not have been spoken \u2026 The word I sang carries a legacy of hurt and pain that I cannot even imagine.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: not everyone agrees that she shouldn\u2019t have said it. Many black commentators pointed out that the topic is complex, because Puerto Ricans (where Rodriguez\u2019s parents are from) share black culture.\n\nThis argument is explained in great detail in an episode of Black(ish) from 2015. At a work meeting, two of the characters go through guidelines for the rest of their team. They are:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t say the N word, period. Mexicans can\u2019t say it. Dominicans can, so can Puerto Ricans \u2013 which should have gotten Rodriguez off the hook unless she is in the same category as Jennifer Lopez, who is not allowed: If \u201cyou\u2019re a J-Lo Puerto Rican\u201d, you can\u2019t say it \u2013 nor if you are Ricky Martin or Marc Anthony, they explain.\n\nAccording to this list, Puerto Ricans seen as not having close enough ties to the black community are \u201cno bueno\u201d. But the Rosie Perezes, Fat Joes and other Terror Squad Puerto Ricans of the world \u2013 those who share an affinity with black culture \u2013 can.\n\nThe distinctions can be confusing \u2013 for example, CNN host Don Lemon is a \u201chell no \u2013 not even when he\u2019s quoting the president\u201d, whereas Bill Clinton is a \u201che probably shouldn\u2019t say it neither, but I wouldn\u2019t be crazy mad if he did\u201d.\n\nIf this all sounds confusing, it\u2019s because it is. There\u2019s no hard science \u2013 many notable African Americans, including Black(ish) actor Tracee Ellis Ross, don\u2019t use the word.\n\nOthers believe in \u201creclaiming\u201d it \u2013 allowing black people to have a word that white people can\u2019t use redistributes some kind of power, at least over that word. It\u2019s interesting to note, for example, that Eminem \u2013 who may have had permission based on his proximity to black culture \u2013 has never used it in a song.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth reminding people that this is not a literal fight over a word. Because anyone, technically, can say the N-word \u2013 alone, in the comfort of their own homes. Those complaining about not being able to use it are usually just people who want to say it in public, bringing up a whole host of other questions (Do they not care about the visceral reaction some have to it? Why not?)\n\nThese questions apply to Rodriguez \u2013 perhaps she should have watched this tutorial on how not to say the N-word when singing your favourite rap songs.", "description": "The actor posted a video of herself singing along to the Fugees, sparking online debate over whether or not she should have said the N-word", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f65a8d6e30eba8a5072573c0771e193e46b2d5a/0_356_2096_1257/master/2096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=672149115449ebd083f9f0cf5447d93f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
