But what would their financial situation be if something happened to you? That's a situation that no one likes to think about, but it's an important one to consider.\n\nIdeally, you will either have saved enough to provide for your family or have adequate life insurance policies in effect that would take care of them. Even if that's the case, though, it raises another question: What should your family do with the money after you're gone to ensure they're financially secure?\n\nThere are many potential answers to this question. We could get into a lengthy discussion of asset allocation and look at ways to diversify investments. Instead, let's look at what Warren Buffett has to say on the matter. Buffett is one of the most successful investors in history. He's laid out an investing plan for his family to be followed when he's gone. Here's what Buffett's plan is -- and why it's a good one for your family, too.\n\nWarren Buffett More\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe 90/10 plan\n\nBuffett's plan is about as simple as it gets. In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) shareholders, he wrote that the instructions in his will state that the trustee is to invest 90% in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, with the remaining 10% to be invested in short-term government bonds. (Note: all of Buffett's Berkshire shares will be distributed to charities.)\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha suggested that the trustee invest the larger amount into a Vanguard index fund. He didn't specify, however, whether he preferred the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500 index, or the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO), an exchange-traded fund that also tracks the S&P 500 index.\n\nWhy does Buffett like this simple investing plan for his family after he's gone? He wrote to Berkshire shareholders, \"I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors -- whether pension funds, institutions, or individuals -- who employ high-fee managers.\"\n\nBased on history, Buffett's take is spot on. Earlier this year, S&P Dow Jones Indices released an annual report that compared the average performance of actively managed funds versus the S&P 500 index. For the ninth consecutive year, the majority of fund managers failed to top the S&P 500. Keep in mind that this was during a runaway bull market that should have relatively easy for funds to pick great stocks.\n\nInterestingly, over 85% of large-cap funds have underperformed compared to the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. Nearly 92% of these funds have trailed the S&P 500 over the last 15 years.\n\nOne big reason behind this dismal track record for actively managed funds is their high fees. Buffett likes the low-cost approach with index funds. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has an annual expense ratio of 0.14%, while the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF annual expense ratio is a super-low 0.03%.\n\nThe 10% that Buffett recommends investing in short-term government bonds, by the way, serves as a hedge to the stock index fund investment. When the S&P 500 goes down, short-term government bonds tend to rise in value.\n\nWhat about the risks of investing in index funds?", "description": "The legendary investor's strategy for his family is simple -- and effective.", "authors": ["Keith Speights", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YB7I6V4tjguTPmprCAe2Vg--~B/aD00NjY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/608c5fac118d9e304c8cb0ede3df97ba", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
