He made 212.\n\nIndia won the first two Tests by big margins in Visakhapatnam and Pune.", "description": "India are on the brink of a series whitewash after South Africa crumbled while following-on in the third Test in Ranchi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9377/40be7bba73bf4685848ac458fc8f3abe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
