While the ban could cost 90,000 jobs, more importantly it won\u2019t stop the genesis of this outbreak. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), illicit substances are the culprit of this epidemic, not legal pods. The U.S. instead should take notes from how other countries regulate e-cigarettes, which could end this war on vaping.\n\nEngland, which has a 14 percent smoking rate, recognizes the importance of vaping. Recently in London, two hospitals have allowed vape shops on their premises to help curb smoking, calling it a \u201cpublic health necessity.\u201d While foreign to the U.S., England understands that with 80,000 people dying annually from smoking, every person they can get on vaping is a life saved. In fact, England now boasts a lower smoking rate among teenagers at 6 percent compared to the U.S. at 8.1 percent.\n\nBut England is not alone in their efforts to reduce smoking. In France, the French High Council for Public Health recommends e-cigarettes as an effective mean to quit smoking while Canada doesn\u2019t even classify e-cigarettes as a tobacco product.\n\nUnfortunately, and from no help from the FDA, consumers and lawmakers in the U.S. are under the false assumption that vaping shares the same health risks as smoking. This year alone, 60,000 people posted on Twitter they were going to stop vaping because of the outbreak. While the intention is admirable the results show the contrary, as most will ditch the vape only to go back to the cigarette.\n\nAndrew, who\u2019s 30-years old, took up vaping to quit smoking but has since come full circle and returned to smoking because of the misinformation. \u201cIf it turns out it is actually quite bad for your health, then why even compromise in the first place?\" said Andrew.\n\nAll this hysteria could be avoided if the FDA changed its definition on what constitutes a tobacco product. Currently, anything that has tobacco or contains a tobacco-based byproduct (i.e. nicotine), falls under the jurisdiction of the FDA, which coincidentally includes e-cigarettes. It\u2019s this ambiguity that allows the administration to ban flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nWhy should e-cigarettes even be classified as tobacco products in the first place? Nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) aren\u2019t ruled as tobacco products, despite them obviously containing tobacco. Even Mitchell Zeller, director of the Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA, has stated that e-cigarettes are a cessation tool for smokers, and outlawing them would lead people \u201cback to combustible tobacco products.\u201d\n\nIf the FDA is unwilling to reclassify e-cigarettes, then it should at least realize that flavors aren\u2019t the culprit of this \u201cepidemic.\u201d According to their own estimates fruit and menthol-based flavors are now equally favored by high school students at 66 and 64 percent, respectively. Based on the consumption trajectory of their trend, menthol-based flavors would take over fruit flavors by next year. By 2020, the FDA could no longer claim that companies are attracting kids with fruity flavors if menthol becomes the most popular flavor.\n\nBut given the government\u2019s harsh record on e-cigarettes, this is just the beginning. San Francisco has already banned e-cigarettes this year, while Michigan and New York just recently announced to outlaw all flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nPerhaps if the U.S. were to consider more efficient approaches, as England has, and treat e-cigarettes like NRTs then more people would transition off smoking. This action by the administration sets a dangerous precedent that misleads people and can become disastrous for cigarette smokers looking to quit. Unfortunately for these people, things just got a whole lot harder.\n\nJanson Q.
