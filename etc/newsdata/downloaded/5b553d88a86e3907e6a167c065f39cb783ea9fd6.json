Despite knocking off the first ranked opponent of her UFC tenure, Barber doesn\u2019t have her sights set on a top 10 opponent for her post-fight callout.\n\nIn fact, Barber decided to reach outside the rankings and called out Paige VanZant when she spoke to Jon Anik on the microphone post-fight. Backstage at the event, Barber was asked if she thinks VanZant (8-4 MMA, 5-3 UFC) will accept a fight against her. \u201cThe Future\u201d isn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBut if she does, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d\n\nAfter Barber made the callout inside the cage, her Roufusport teammate Ben Askren shared his opinion in classic Askren fashion. Barber echoed his sentiments.\n\n\u201cI will absolutely ruin her Instagram career,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThese elbows hit hard and they cut you up.\u201d\n\nI think @MayceeBarber may ruins @paigevanzant Instagram career if they get in the cage \u2014 Ben Askren (@Benaskren) October 19, 2019\n\nAlthough she has her eyes set on \u201c12 Gauge,\u201d Barber doesn\u2019t have a specific card in mind for her UFC return. If a fight against VanZant doesn\u2019t materialize, Barber said there are options.\n\n\u201cIf Paige turns down that fight, I\u2019m going to assume I\u2019m 9-0,\u201d Barber said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about a couple different things. I\u2019ve had a couple of different conversations. There\u2019s been talk about Antonina Shevchenko. Obviously, any of the girls in the division \u2013 I don\u2019t really care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s whoever (UFC president) Dana (White) and my team decide on. We\u2019ve talked about a couple of different names, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nWhether it be against VanZant, Shevchenko or someone else, Barber said she thinks she should fight in a main event or co-headliner next. Whomever she faces, Barber promises she\u2019ll come out looking to end the fight as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI believe I belong at the top,\u201d Barber said. \u201cI\u2019m someone people want to watch fight and I\u2019m an exciting fighter. I can guarantee when I come out, I\u2019m going to come out swinging and I\u2019m going to come out looking for a finish.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN 6 took place Friday at TD Garden in Boston.
