One is its persistent revelation that we, the people, are so susceptible to the razzmatazz of offense as to be insufficiently appreciative of defenders. Another is the curious reality that the sport\u2019s bushels of lopsided rivalries wind up lending more magic to upsets when those rivalries do go upturned. Both truths turned up Saturday in the upset of the year, in the Athens less ancient than that other Athens.\n\nDefenders long have protected Saturday night moods in American college towns, preventing our despicable rivals from marring our dreams and entitlements. Yet of the 81 Heisman trophies, we have managed to give just one to a player primarily a defender, and that guy had to return punts and catch 11 passes to help surmount the bias.\n\nIt\u2019s with joy, then, that we can extol from the masses of semi-anonymous defenders of Saturday one Israel Mukuamu, \u00ad6-foot-4 cornerback, South Carolina. Before the Gamecocks\u2019 astonishing 20-17, double-overtime road upset of then-No. 3 Georgia that helped South Carolina budge to 3-3, Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm had zero interceptions and one turn of expert praise from Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly, who described Fromm\u2019s rarefied precision in avoiding turnovers.\n\nNow, Fromm has thrown three interceptions, all to Israel Mukuamu.\n\n[Ryan Hilinski lost a brother to suicide. Now he\u2019s also a college QB and honoring his memory.]\n\nTwo were not just interceptions but some of the better catches on display this entire mad autumn. Mukuamu\u2019s 53-yard interception return just before halftime not only stemmed from Javon Kinlaw\u2019s rush toward Fromm, and not only provided a 17-10 lead that stuck around a long time, but featured Mukuamu lurching skyward to his left to snare the ball, then staying in bounds before making his merry trip up the sideline. The second, with 9:25 left, involved an outstretched snare with a stunning turn of dexterity at keeping the ball above the grass.\n\nThe third, a reacting catch off a tip, happened in the first overtime, which was handy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player and uncharacteristic,\u201d South Carolina Coach Will Muschamp told reporters about his towering cornerback, who switched from safety this past offseason and once tweeted: \u201c6\u20194\u201d playing corner? Yeah I\u2019m about to change the game!\u201d Further, Mukuamu credited his teammates by telling reporters that Georgia had \u201cnever played a D-line like us,\u201d the kind of crazy-confident comment that can occur in only about 130 of the 130 Football Bowl Subdivision programs.\n\nStill further, here are some biographical morsels about a defensive player: The family moved from South Carolina to Louisiana, where Mukuamu finished high school, then the three-star recruit committed to Florida State, then Jimbo Fisher left Florida State for Texas A&M, then Mukuamu headed for South Carolina. Here\u2019s what Mukuamu, a polite man and an eager student, told South Carolina reporters in August: \u201cI remember one time in third grade, I had a C, and my mom, actually my parents, didn\u2019t let me play football that year.\u201d\n\nSometimes, a third-grade C can wind up ruining an Athens night.\n\nThat three-touchdown-underdog South Carolina got outgained 468-297, and out-possessed 36:04-23:56, and out-snapped 95-68 proved again how turnovers do matter so much in American life and added further shock to the only occasion Saturday that altered the College Football Playoff landscape up ahead.\n\n[College football winners and losers: LSU proves formidable and relentless]\n\nElsewhere, entertaining form held. LSU and its dazzling new passing game ought to be ranked No. 1 after surpassing Florida, \u00ad42-28, on a Baton Rouge night in which the impressive teams included LSU (6-0) and Florida (6-1). LSU quarterback Joe Burrow completed 21 passes in but 24 tries, and the LSU denizens, for so long forlorn without the fun passes thrown in other towns, looked positively rapturous as star wide receiver Ja\u2019Marr Chase streamed up the right sideline on the 54-yard touchdown that closed the scoring.\n\nOklahoma (6-0) looked fascinating while beating Texas. Alabama (6-0) won at Texas A&M but left Coach Nick Saban prattling about the \u201crat poison\u201d of complacency from the praise that comes from those who see Alabama and notice excellence. Baylor found 6-0 with a double-overtime win over Texas Tech that provided the fans\u2019 dream of a controversial call (on an apparent Baylor fumble in the first overtime), as controversial calls alleviate the tedium of everyday conversation for weeks and months to come while providing much-craved pique. Wisconsin (6-0) continued such steely command with its 38-0 wallop of faded Michigan State, and Minnesota (6-0) continued such steady growth in its 34-7 wallop of Nebraska, so does all that mean there might come a humongous Paul Bunyan Axe game Nov. 30 in Minneapolis?\n\nThere might.\n\nIt certainly means that Wisconsin at Ohio State on Oct. 26 looks plump with pregame anticipation, and it certainly spurs a reminder, especially after a week in which Minnesota prepared for game-time cold by dousing its players with wintry water as they took the practice field.\n\nReminder: Many have dismissed Minnesota Coach P.J. Fleck as a flake, and if a guy who led Western Michigan to a 13-1 record and a No. 1 national ranking in turnover margin, and now has Minnesota at 6-0, is a flake, then may we all seek flake-dom.\n\nStill, at another long day-and-night\u2019s end, the deepest truth lurked somewhere in that presumably merry night in Columbia, the South Carolina capital. Yes, it\u2019s eccentric that there\u2019s a sport that draws hundreds of thousands of people to stadiums to witness conclusions that so often seem foregone. Yes, Georgia held a \u00ad51-18-2 lead in that border rivalry coming in. Yes, as Georgia has revved up under its alumnus Kirby Smart, seemingly rendering post-Spurrier South Carolina a map dot again as Georgia alumnus Muschamp started out, and the past four meetings had gone 52-20, 28-14, 24-10 and 41-17.\n\nYet without all those realities and all that time apparently wasted spent traveling to, parking for and watching them (except at tailgates, where time is never wasted), the upset of Saturday would not have mattered with such oomph. A country that considered the noon matchup an afterthought would not have known the pleasure of being amazed.\n\nThat\u2019s even given that Georgia still can access the playoff, the way these national champions did: Ohio State in 2014 when it lost to Virginia Tech, Alabama in 2015 when it lost to Mississippi, Clemson in 2016 when it lost to Pittsburgh, Alabama in 2017 when it lost to Auburn. And that\u2019s even given Saturday\u2019s downer of an ending, when the great Georgia senior kicker Rodrigo Blankenship missed a 42-yard field goal on the last play. That led the winning coach, Muschamp, to begin his postgame comments with: \u201cRodrigo Blankenship is and has been an unbelievable representative of the University of Georgia and kicker, and my heart goes out to him in losing in that fashion. He\u2019s an outstanding young man and about all the right things in college athletics.\u201d\n\nOn so many Saturdays in college football, you wake up and you know what will happen, but then some Saturdays, it turns out you don\u2019t. Some days, a program standing 18-51-2 against another goes and finds its nemesis at one of its historic peaks yet wins inexplicably, with three interceptions from a giant named Israel and one gracious comment from an underdog coach about a distinguished kicker.", "description": "Of the 81 Heisman trophies, we have managed to give just one to a player primarily a defender.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "October At Am", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-6n_X_tFRRNvfUQUhF8ocycly4Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KK3F5LXN7QI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
