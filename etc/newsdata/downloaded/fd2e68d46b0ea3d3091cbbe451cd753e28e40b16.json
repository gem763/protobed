U.S. air strikes have at times hit targets linked to al-Qaeda in northwest Syria in recent years.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the air strikes had pounded bases belonging to jihadists near the town of Maarat Misrin on Saturday. The UK-based monitor said more than 40 militants, including some commanders, were killed.\n\nInterfax news agency cited Russia's military as saying the strikes had hit between Maarat Misrin and Kefraya village.\n\nWhile artillery hit parts of Idlib in the past 24 hours, there was a lull in air strikes that had been pounding the region in recent weeks, the Observatory, a rebel official and rescue workers have said.\n\nIt was the second such ceasefire declared in the past month in Idlib, which is in Syria's northwest corner - the only big chunk of the country still in rebel hands. A truce in early August collapsed three days in, after which the Russian-backed army pressed its offensive and gained ground.\n\nBouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said the ceasefire was temporary and would serve the strategy of Damascus \"to liberate every inch\".\n\n\"(Turkish President Tayyip) Erdogan will be forced to leave Syrian land ... This is our decision, not by his choice,\" she told al-Mayadeen TV in an interview late on Saturday.\n\nTurkey, which backs rebel factions, and Russia, Assad's key ally, brokered a \"de-escalation\" deal in 2017 that sought to curb fighting in Idlib. It does not cover jihadist militants.\n\nUnder its deals with Russia and Iran, Turkey's military has a dozen posts in the Idlib region. Ankara also backs rebel forces that hold tracts of territory north of Idlib near its border.\n\nTurkey's foreign minister said on Friday the military would leave only once there was a political solution, which remains elusive after more than eight years of war and several rounds of failed U.N. peace talks.
