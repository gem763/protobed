Schiff (D-Calif.) demanded that acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire turn over details of what was later reported to be a conversation between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, seeking dirt on former vice president and potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden. Schiff wrote: \u201cYou do not possess the authority to withhold from the Committee a whistleblower disclosure from within the Intelligence Community that is intended for Congress.\u201d Maguire is set to appear before Schiff\u2019s committee this week, but if the acting DNI isn\u2019t forthcoming, what will Schiff do about it?\n\nOn Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wrote to members of Congress: \u201cIf the Administration persists\u201d in preventing Maguire from disclosing information about the call and the whistleblower complaint that prompted the congressional inquiry, \u201cthey will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d Forceful words, particularly coming from a speaker who has taken an admirable slow-and-steady approach to congressional oversight of Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nWith impeachment proceedings now appearing increasingly likely \u2014 seven Democratic House freshmen wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post on Monday headlined, \u201cThese allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect,\u201d and Pelosi will reportedly support creating a select committee to consider impeachment \u2014 Congress has the larger issue of the president\u2019s fitness for office to consider. What\u2019s ultimately at stake in Maguire\u2019s testimony isn\u2019t whether he\u2019s thwarting the statutory whistleblower process \u2014 though that\u2019s significant \u2014 but the issue at the heart of this particular whistleblower case: Did the president withhold military aid from Ukraine to get its government to look for potentially compromising information about one of his possible presidential opponents?\n\nPelosi quoted Lincoln to justify not impeaching Trump. She missed his point.\n\nTrump\u2019s alleged conduct is why Congress continues to face the question it has considered since at least the inception of the Mueller investigation: Have high crimes and misdemeanors been committed? If so, impeachment is the appropriate constitutional remedy, and those considerations outweigh the contemptuous conduct of any given witness. But the conduct of potential witnesses isn\u2019t hypothetical, either, and if Congress wants to protect its institutional prerogatives and authority, its members shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the issue \u2014 as Democrats move toward impeachment, they should also revive their ability to enforce contempt.\n\nIndeed, one of the reasons the impeachment question remains unresolved is that Congress\u2019s efforts to conduct oversight are routinely brushed aside by members of the administration.\n\nIn July, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway ignored a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee, looking into whether she had violated the Hatch Act. In April, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declined to testify about the proposed addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has refused a written demand, made pursuant to statute, from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) to turn over Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nIn several instances, House Democrats have gone to court to try to enforce their oversight authority, but in the short term, by not aggressively penalizing contempt for their subpoenas, they\u2019ve inadvertently sapped their own power to deal with recalcitrant members of the executive branch. In the long term, it undermines Congress\u2019s status as a co-equal branch of the federal government.\n\nTo be clear, as former White House counsel, I certainly recognize that there are instances where the executive might contest congressional subpoenas based on executive privilege \u2014 including in cases where a potential witness isn\u2019t a part of the executive branch. For instance, if a president consulted a former government employee, a think tank CEO, an academic or anyone else, that conversation should tentatively qualify for executive privilege protection, assuming it was, as claimed, for proper governmental purposes and not, by contrast, as part of a coverup or conspiracy.\n\nBut at the same time, Congress has broad inherent powers to investigate, including the executive. In Lewandowski\u2019s view, being compelled to testify was about \u201cTrump haters\u201d going down \u201crabbit holes,\u201d suggesting that he was justified in his selective answers to questions from members of Congress. But that\u2019s not his call to make.\n\nLike anyone else, he can be summoned to provide evidence in any well-lodged congressional investigation, reasonably related to the powers of the Congress defined in Article I of the Constitution. Lewandowski was plainly contemptuous of the Judiciary Committee when he refused to fully to cooperate with an investigation wholly within its power.\n\nOn that basis, he deserved to be held in contempt, and the failure of the committee to act immediately to levy meaningful consequences against him drove a nail in the coffin of contempt as a tool the legislative branch can use to maintain its place as an equal branch of the federal government.\n\nThe power to investigate necessarily requires the means to compel witnesses to testify. And the power to compel implies the power to hold witnesses in contempt with tangible penalties for contemptuous conduct. When criminal or civil court judges hold someone in contempt, they can fine or jail the party, witness or attorney whose noncompliance is found contemptuous.\n\nIn the past, Congress has done this, too. In 1821, the Supreme Court held that, if the House of Representatives was to avoid the \u201ctotal annihilation\u201d of its power and hoped to avoid being \u201cexposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness, caprice, or even conspiracy\u201d it was faced with (an apt description of Lewandowski\u2019s performance in open hearing), there was little alternative but to confirm that Congress must have the inherent power to fine and imprison those who behaved contemptuously toward it. Inherent because, according to the Congressional Research Service, the criminal contempt of Congress statute \u201cprovides that any person who \u2018willfully\u2019 fails to comply with a properly issued committee subpoena \u2026 is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a substantial fine and imprisonment for up to one year.\u201d CRS adds:\n\n\u201cHistorically, the House and Senate relied on their own institutional power to not only enforce congressional subpoenas, but also to respond to other actions that either house viewed as obstruction their legislative processes or prerogatives.\u201d\n\nIn 1927, in a case involving the Teapot Dome scandal, the high court upheld the Senate\u2019s power to arrest and jail a witness, the brother of then-Attorney General Harry Daugherty, for refusing to appear. Recalling Watergate, Jonathan C. Rose, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon, argued Monday that \u201cto command the attention of the Trump White House, the actual arrest of an appropriate witness or two might well be required.\u201d\n\nIf that seems drastic \u2014 and I concede it would be appropriate only in rare situations \u2014 Congress can and should at least impose stiff financial penalties on misbehaving witnesses.\n\nTrump thinks Biden pulled a scam in Ukraine because it\u2019s what Trump would have done\n\nThere are logistical impediments, certainly, to the House directing its sergeant at arms to go out and arrest members of the executive branch, and if they tried, it could set up a new constitutional crisis within an existing one.\n\nAs Lawfare\u2019s Benjamin Wittes notes, asserting inherent contempt power in this way \u201chasn\u2019t been deployed in a long time, and it\u2019s not 100 percent clear that courts would tolerate it.\u201d But there\u2019s a risk that runs in the other direction: If the stonewalling of the current administration, and Congress\u2019s acquiescence so far, wind up demonstrating that there\u2019s nothing the legislative branch can do to enforce its power, then it\u2019s difficult to say that we have an effective system of checks and balances \u2014 one of the ideas that animates our system of government.\n\nExecutive privilege disagreements are fought out in this area of delicate constitutional balance. As White House counsel during the days when then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) tortured the Clinton administration with specious investigations, I personally engaged in a number of those battles: The House Oversight and Reform Committee once voted to hold me in criminal contempt when we were simply unable to compromise on a committee request for documents. The issue was eventually resolved, in part with the help of a GOP congressman also named Jack Quinn. He would joke that his constituents were outraged that their representative went to work for President Bill Clinton.\n\nAfter that contempt vote, I called him up and said, \u201cJack, we have a problem.\u201d He responded, \u201cYes, we do, and I better help you out of this mess.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine that kind of good-humored cross-party cooperation taking place now.\n\nThese battles have historically burst into the open only infrequently, simply because officials in the affected branches have typically found ways to accommodate each other\u2019s legitimate government interests. When, for example, I had to navigate situations in which the public disclosure of information from the executive might harm the national interest, we almost always found a way to \u201cread in\u201d a small bipartisan group of legislators without exposing the information too broadly.\n\nThe incentive to compromise goes away, though, if officials, or other witnesses, know that a contempt of Congress citation isn\u2019t worth the paper that it\u2019s printed on.", "description": "Our system of checks and balances only works if the legislative branch\u2019s oversight power has teeth.", "authors": ["Jack Quinn", "Jack Quinn Served As President Bill Clinton S White House Counsel", "Chief Of Staff To Vice President Al Gore He Is A Cnn Legal Analyst", "A Partner In The Law Firm Of Manatt", "Phelps"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/C6OZgshMdkvXkVLG-IgGjbeMdGM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5JM3VJW5UUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
