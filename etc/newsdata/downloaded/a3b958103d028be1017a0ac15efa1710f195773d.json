The light helped her figure out how to open the main exit door. But there was no gangway, so she was staring at what she said was a 40 to 50 foot drop to the ground, hardly an attractive means of escape.\n\nShe focused the flashlight on the plane's exterior, hoping that the reflection might catch someone's attention. In time, the driver of a luggage cart came to her rescue.\n\nAdams said Air Canada representatives offered her a ride home and then called her twice to apologize and say they've launched an investigation into how she was missed by the plane's crew when everyone else got off the flight in Toronto.\n\nShe says she's still recovering. \"I haven't got much sleep since the reoccurring night terrors and waking up anxious and afraid I'm alone locked up someplace dark,\" she wrote.\n\nA representative for Air Canada confirmed Adams' account, adding they \"remain in contact with her.\"", "description": "A female passenger tells a story about being overlooked when other passengers and crew disembarked an Air Canada flight to Toronto.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/06/21/gettyimages-955073684_wide-609fdcd01bd0b2958e409d9157927185d0369b0d.jpg?s=1400"}
