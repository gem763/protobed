REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nGovernment data released on Friday showed core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, rose 0.5% in September from a year earlier, slowing from a 0.7% gain in the previous month.\n\nThe rise in the core consumer price index for Japan\u2019s capital city, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, undershot the median estimate of a 0.6% increase.\n\nIt was the slowest growth since May last year and weighed by declines in energy prices.\n\nThe stubbornly weak inflation and overseas headwinds are piling pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up an already massive stimulus programme to forestall risks of a delay in hitting its elusive 2% inflation target.\n\nThe central bank will scrutinise the inflation data and other key indicators at its next rate-setting meeting on Oct. 30-31, when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price projections.\n\nAt its policy meeting last week, the BOJ signalled its readiness to expand stimulus as early as next month by issuing a strong warning about risks that threaten Japan\u2019s export-reliant economy.\n\nBut with interest rates at zero and companies wary about boosting spending amid growing uncertainty and risks, many analysts are sceptical that topping up monetary stimulus could accelerate inflation.\n\nThe so-called core-core CPI in Tokyo, which strips away the effects of both energy and fresh food prices, rose 0.6% in September, slowing from a 0.7% gain in August, the data showed.\n\nTokyo\u2019s overall CPI rose 0.4% in September from a year earlier, after 0.6% growth in the previous month.\n\nYears of heavy money printing have failed to shake off entrenched deflationary mindset among the public and corporations, dashing the hopes of the central bank that aggressive stimulus will put an decisive end to deflation.\n\nUnder its current forecasts issued in July, the BOJ expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.0% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2020 and fall short of its 2% target for the following two years.", "description": "A leading indicator of Japan's core consumer inflation slowed for a second straight month to its lowest rate in more than a year, underscoring the challenge for the central bank in hitting its 2% price target.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434356781&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q02W", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
