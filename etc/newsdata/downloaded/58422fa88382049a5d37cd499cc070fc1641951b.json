It was a bit like the Frankfurt Show in September, where organisers refused to reduce the foot print of their much-diminished show, which just meant you walked more to see less.\n\nSo who won and who lost out in this process? Certainly journalists' shoe leather fell victim, as you either paid a fiver to get a return rail trip between the halls, or took Hobson\u2019s Choice of a half an hour queue for a free bus ride or a half an hour yomp between the halls.\n\nToyota\u2019s position here is moot. As well as being Japan\u2019s, if not the world's, biggest car maker, it is a major sponsor for the Olympics and the Paralympics so Big Site being dug up is in its long-run benefit. Akio Toyoda, Toyota's president, holds a similar position at Jama, so he signed the show contract knowing full well that this year would be far from a vintage example of what has traditionally been one of the most technically interesting shows in the calendar. And it was the motor show which lost the most; in terms of logistics if not content it was one of the worst I have ever attended.", "description": "Car makers were ill served by the Japanese Motor Manufacturer\u2019s Association, the organisers of the Tokyo Motor show, although some were more ill served than others.", "authors": ["Andrew English", "Paul Hudson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213886167-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
