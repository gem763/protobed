In this backdrop, several entities are eyeing to solve the issue. The latest one is BP and Reliance Industries Ltd\u2019s (RIL) joint venture if a top executive of the former is to be believed.\n\nThe JV is looking to set up a charging network across the country in the near future. This would involve setting up of charging stations at the retail sites as well as the connecting infrastructure for these stations to operate on.\n\nThe move has been confirmed by none other than BP\u2019s group chief executive officer Bob Dudley on Monday. \u201cAs we plan to go forward is providing electric charging at the retail sites and networks. So, it doesn\u2019t involve constructing the cars or vehicles\u2026And over time when it makes sense, we will put charging networks,\" Dudley was quoted as saying in a recent report.\n\nMukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries (R) with BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley (L) (Representative Image: Reuters)\n\nDon't Miss 131 SHARES 706 SHARES 218 SHARES 151 SHARES\n\nBP RIL electric chargers\n\nRIL and BP had announced a joint venture back in the first week of August this year, aimed at establishing a fuel-retailing network in the country. The plan is to set up a total of 5,500 fuel retail outlets through the JV, which is owned 51% by RIL and 49% by BP.\n\nThese outlets will have all the fuel options for consumers - petrol, diesel, CNG, LPG and now, electric chargers. RIL is looking at its British partner for the last option, as BP Plc now has expertise in the EV charging space, having acquired UK\u2019s largest EV charging company now called BP Chargemaster last June. As of now, the company operates more than 7,000 public charging points in the UK through its largest EV charging network named Polar.\n\nNow the aim is to establish a similar network in India. \"I am very optimistic about the joint venture we are forming with Reliance on the (fuel) retail market. So, we will bring all types of new things, electrification, mobility, bringing convenience marketing together with Reliance,\" Dudley was quoted as saying in a report by Livemint.\n\n(Representative Image: Reuters)\n\nElectric Vehicles in India\n\nThe JV has a strong reason to enter the EV charging space in India. Citing the lack of an appropriate charging network in the country, the government had recently announced its own plans to solve the issue. For this, it came up with revised guidelines around electric vehicle charging infrastructure earlier this month.\n\nAs per these guidelines, the government will install one electric vehicle charging station after every four kilometres within cities. Similarly, a charging station will be installed every twenty five kilometres on both sides of highways connecting to these cities. Setting up of these charging stations will be carried out in phases.\n\nIn addition, the new guidelines allow setting up of a charging infrastructure at home or office without the need of a license. Any individual wishing to do so will be helped by the distribution company in the process.", "description": "The joint venture of BP Plc and RIL is looking to set up electric vehicle charging stations across the country.
