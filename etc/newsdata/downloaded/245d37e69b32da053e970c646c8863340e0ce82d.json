Shares of Netflix rose 9.2 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to US$312.69.\n\nThat performance, combined with concerns about new competitors, had weighed on Netflix shares, which had fallen 21 per cent from the last earnings report through regular trading on Wednesday.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix was boosted by new seasons of shows such as Stranger Things and 13 Reasons Why. The company added 6.77 million paid customers around the globe, topping the nearly 6.7 million average expectation of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\n\u201cNetflix results were good enough that they assuaged concerns about price sensitivity and penetration levels in the domestic markets,\u201d said Fitch director Patrice Cucinello. \u201cA caveat is that competition hasn\u2019t hit yet.\u201d\n\nThe company projected it would pick up 7.6 million customers in the last three months of the year. Analysts had expected a forecast of 9.4 million. The company will release a new installment of The Crown and Martin Scorsese film The Irishman during that time.\n\nBut it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service from Walt Disney Co. that will be stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney\u2019s popular Marvel, Star Wars, animation and other properties.\n\nApple Inc. also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc.\u2019s HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp., are expected to enter the market next year.\n\nThe likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption Netflix letter to investors\n\nNetflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.\n\nNetflix acknowledged, however, that it was still taking a hit from price increases that took effect earlier this year in the United States.\n\n\u201cRetention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,\u201d it said.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix\u2019s net income rose to US$665 million, or $1.47 per share, from US$403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nTotal revenue rose to US$5.25 billion from about US$4 billion. Analysts on average had expected US$5.52 billion.\n\nIn the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions \u2014 Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said.", "description": "Shares jump 9.2 per cent as company 'assuages concerns' over prices, penetration numbers", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Neha Malara"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/netflix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
