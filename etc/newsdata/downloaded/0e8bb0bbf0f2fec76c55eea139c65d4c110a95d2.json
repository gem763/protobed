It turns out he was just using Bloomberg\u2019s equipment so he could actually hear the interviewer\u2019s questions.\n\nYou would think that his handler would have tackled him before he got to the cameras https://t.co/FoYdQnc8Xp \u2014 John Paczkowski (@JohnPaczkowski) September 25, 2019\n\nMany assumed the mistake was the fault of an off-screen corporate handler not doing their job properly. Being shown using your competitor\u2019s product after revealing your company\u2019s alternative is not a great look, there\u2019s no doubt about that. But it turns out this isn\u2019t a case of corporate executives being clueless, or public relations personnel dropping the ball.\n\nIn fairness those were Bloomberg\u2019s AirPods with the line into the program. I had to do the same after David Limp https://t.co/yRENR5Ncem \u2014 Carolina Milanesi (@caro_milanesi) September 26, 2019\n\nHowever, tech analyst Carolina Milanesi, who was interviewed by Bloomberg right after Dave Limp, pointed out that the AirPod, which she was also required to wear, was used by the camera crew to provide a direct feed to the interviewer\u2019s questions.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that Amazon\u2019s PR team requested an invisible earpiece for Limp once they realised what gear Bloomberg\u2019s crew was using, but the interview was undoubtedly scheduled well in advance, and given the demand for Limp\u2019s attention after all of Amazon\u2019s reveals yesterday, there presumably was no time to set him up with an alternative.\n\nIt\u2019s a case of poor timing more than anything; not an embarrassing gaffe for Amazon by any stretch of the imagination. More embarrassing might actually be the fact that Bloomberg requires guests to share the same AirPod? I don\u2019t care how many boxes of alcohol wipes you go through, if it\u2019s something that\u2019s been in someone else\u2019s ear, it\u2019s not going anywhere near mine.
