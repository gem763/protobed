Testimony from key Trump aides has brought closer a vote on impeachment and thus a Senate trial.\n\nA two-thirds majority would be needed to convict and remove the president. The New York Times reported this week that McConnell has begun preparing his caucus, offering a PowerPoint presentation \u201ccomplete with quotes from the constitution, as he schooled fellow senators on the intricacies of a process he portrayed as all but inevitable\u201d.\n\nThere is no substitute for American leadership Mitch McConnell\n\nMost observers, including the New York Times, think McConnell\u2019s grip on a party loath to break with Trump renders conviction unlikely. McConnell has vowed to stop it.\n\nBut as some Republican moderates will face pressure at the ballot box over impeachment, so foreign policy remains a key GOP interest, particularly the need for the US to look strong and to fight Islamic extremists.\n\nThis week, as the Trump administration scrambled to contain the damage in Syria, fighting continued and Russian troops moved in to fill the vacuum, dismay over Trump\u2019s capitulation to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan spread among Republican senators.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s rebuke was both oblique and partisan: he did not mention Trump by name and he did mention, and blame, Barack Obama three times. But it was nonetheless a rebuke.\n\n\u201cThere is no substitute for American leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo other nation can match our capability to spearhead multinational campaigns that can defeat terrorists and help stabilise the region. Libya and Syria both testify to the bloody results of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018leading from behind\u2019.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also made pointed reference to bipartisan agreement in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIn January,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfollowing indications that the president was considering withdrawing US forces from Syria and Afghanistan \u2026 the Senate stepped up. A bipartisan supermajority of 70 senators supported an amendment I wrote [which] stated our opposition to prematurely exiting Syria or Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said he had been \u201cdisheartened that nearly all the Senate Democrats running for president\u201d did not back the amendment but \u201cthe consensus position of nearly all Republicans and a number of Democrats was encouraging\u201d.\n\nBernard-Henri L\u00e9vy: Trump's Syria withdrawal is 'a nightmare and completely predictable' Read more\n\nDemocratic presidential contenders support the impeachment process. No Republican senators have yet said they do \u2013 the former Ohio governor and 2016 presidential hopeful John Kasich did so on Friday \u2013 but criticism of Trump, not only by his frequent critic Mitt Romney of Utah but from allies such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, is more often to be heard.\n\nThe former senator Jeff Flake has said that if a vote were held in private, as many as 35 Republicans would vote to remove Trump. Presuming all Democrats and independents did so, 20 defections would be enough.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump has continued to lash out on Twitter over the impeachment inquiry. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nA rolling drumbeat of reports and revelations continues to increase pressure that has caused Trump, characteristically, to lash out on Twitter, backing his position on Syria, attempting to question the validity of the impeachment inquiry and attacking its leaders in viciously personal terms.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the president opened with simply: \u201c#StopTheCoup.\u201d\n\nHe had reason to tweet more. On Friday, CNN reported that Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and a leading player in the president\u2019s Ukraine policy, had pressed the White House and state department to grant a visa to Viktor Shokin.\n\nShokin, formerly Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, was removed under international pressure led by Biden as vice-president to Obama, because he was seen as weak on corruption.\n\nTrump and his allies allege that Biden wanted to relieve pressure on his own son, Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden but Hunter Biden has been moved to defend himself, relinquishing a position tied to China and saying this week he regretted his involvement in what he called a \u201cswamp\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani has said Shokin promised to reveal \u201cdirt\u201d on Democrats.\n\nCNN\u2019s report was based on testimony to House committees by George Kent, a state department official. Others who have offered testimony damaging to Trump include the former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch; the British-born former White House adviser Fiona Hill; and the current European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland.\n\nMulvaney admitted to a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Was that a genius move? | Cas Mudde Read more\n\nA battle over access to records pertaining to Ukraine goes on. This week, Giuliani said he would not comply with a subpoena. The energy secretary, Rick Perry, embroiled in the Ukraine scandal, announced his resignation. But the most damaging blow came from inside the White House.\n\nThe key issue is whether Trump offered Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy a quid pro quo: an unfreezing of nearly $400m in US military aid in return for what Trump called in a 25 July phone call \u201ca favour\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, suggested there had been such a deal, and told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d \u2013 a slogan which swiftly appeared on T-shirts as the Trump fundraising juggernaut rolled on.\n\nAmid reported dismay in Trump\u2019s inner circle, Mulvaney tried to walk his comments back. He did not seem to succeed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an Etch-A-Sketch,\u201d Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican, told the New York Times, miming use of the toy, which lets children erase their doodles and start again. \u201cThere were a lot of Republicans looking at that headline yesterday when it came up.
