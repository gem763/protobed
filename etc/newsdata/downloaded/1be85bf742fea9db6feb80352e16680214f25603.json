Impact of Fed Bond-Buying Will Depend on Treasury\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve insists its planned hoovering-up of Treasury securities is a \u201ctechnical\u201d measure that isn\u2019t quantitative easing and won\u2019t meaningfully impact the economy. But that may depend on how the Treasury Department responds to the central bank\u2019s plan.\n\nIf the Treasury reacts by stepping up its issuance of Treasury bills and cutting back on sales of longer-dated securities, that would tend to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates -- which is exactly what the Fed\u2019s crisis-era QE programs were intended to do.\n\nBut if the Treasury keeps its issuance plans the way they are now, then the Fed\u2019s massive buying risks squeezes in the bills market that could push up prices.\n\n\u201cThe impact the Fed\u2019s purchases have is dependent on what the Treasury Department does with issuance,\u2019\u2019 Drew Matus, chief market strategist for MetLife Investment Management, said in an email.\n\n\u201cIf they boost bill issuance and cut note and bond issuance, it could have a stimulative effect on the economy,\u2019\u2019 said Matus, who once worked on the New York Fed\u2019s open market desk that implements the central bank\u2019s interest-rate intentions.\n\nThe interplay between the politically-independent Fed and Treasury highlights the difficulties of carrying out monetary policy in a world where rates are low and central banks are more dependent on asset purchases to manage their economies.\n\nA Treasury spokesman declined to comment on what the department intends to do. The Treasury is slated to announce its quarterly refunding plans on Oct. 30, a few hours before the Fed concludes a policy meeting.\n\nThe Fed said on Friday that it will begin buying $60 billion of Treasury bills per month to improve its control over the benchmark interest rate it uses to guide monetary policy after turmoil rocked money markets in September.\n\nPurchases will continue \u201cat least into the second quarter of next year,\u2019\u2019 the central bank said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIf you stretch purchases into the second quarter, that amounts to at least $400 billion,\u2019\u2019 said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva.\n\nIn foreshadowing the Fed\u2019s decision earlier this week, Chairman Jerome Powell repeatedly maintained that any planned securities buying would not be a resumption of QE.\n\nNot QE\n\n\u201cIn no sense is this QE,\u2019\u2019 Powell told the National Association for Business Economics conference in Denver on Oct. 8.\n\nUnder quantitative easing, the Fed bought bonds to lower long-term borrowing costs and boost stock prices and the economy during and after the financial crisis.\n\nPowell argued that the Federal Open Market Committee was not out to spur the economy by resuming growth of its balance sheet, as was the case under its crisis-era buying campaign.\n\nInstead, it is responding to last month\u2019s strains in short-term money markets by supplying more liquidity in the form of bank reserves.\n\nAs if to hammer that message home, the Fed is creating those reserves through purchases of bills with a maturity of one year or less, rather than buying longer-term Treasury debt, as it did under QE.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s apparent concern with how the public would perceive today\u2019s announcement seems heightened enough to conclude that it was a primary consideration in deciding which sector of the Treasury market they would purchase,\u2019\u2019 Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note on Friday.\n\nTrump Attacks\n\nSome of that concern may also be political. President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused the Fed of keeping monetary policy too tight and at various points has urged it to resume asset purchases.\n\nSome Fed watchers concur with Powell\u2019s assessment of what the Fed is up to.\n\n\u201cThis is not QE or even QE lite,\u2019\u2019 Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, said in an Oct. 8 note. \u201cThe central bank is responding to market demand for central bank reserves with minimal duration as it did before 2007.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe September scramble for reserves was triggered by a combination of corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury debt sales that temporarily sent the rate on overnight securities repurchase agreements as high as 10%.\n\nWrightson ICAP LLC chief economist Lou Crandall said that a lot depends on how the Treasury responds.\n\n\u201cIf they cut coupon issuance, then guess what, this is QE,\u2019\u2019 he said. If the Treasury doesn\u2019t, then it runs the risk of spawning turmoil in the bills market.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know which of their allergies give them the worst rash,\u2019\u2019 he said in discussing the Treasury\u2019s options.\n\n--With assistance from Saleha Mohsin and Christopher Condon.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rich Miller in Washington at rmiller28@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Scott Lanman, Alister Bull\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve insists its planned hoovering-up of Treasury securities is a \u201ctechnical\u201d measure that isn\u2019t quantitative easing and won\u2019t meaningfully impact the economy.
