(Montana Department of Commerce)\n\nOfficials in Montana are warning residents for the second time this year about surveys sent by the Republican National Committee that mimic the look of federal census forms, with the goal of soliciting money for President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nThe mailers are labeled \u201c2019 Congressional District Census\u201d and inform recipients that they\u2019ve been \u201cselected to represent Voters\u201d in Bozeman, Mont. The accompanying literature makes repeated requests for donations, urging recipients to send at least $15 to \u201chelp pay for the costs of processing [the] Census Document\u201d if they are unable to afford an amount in the requested range of $25 to $1,000.\n\nThe potentially misleading mailings come as the U.S. Census Bureau is preparing for what\u2019s expected to be one of the most challenging federal counts in decades. The bureau is grappling with factors like a switch to digital and the fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add a citizenship question to the survey.\n\n[Wilbur Ross\u2019s false claim to Congress that the census citizenship question was DOJ\u2019s idea]\n\nAfter the documents landed in mailboxes across four Montana counties, state officials put out a warning about the \u201cimitation Census survey.\u201d In a Friday news release, the Montana Department of Commerce reminded residents that legitimate census survey documents are postmarked from the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, rather than political groups, and never ask for money.\n\n\u201cMontanans need accurate information about the Census to make sure we have a complete count of the folks who live here,\u201d Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney, a Democratic candidate for governor, said in the release, which was first reported by the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. \u201cA complete count means the state will get its fair share of federal funding. The official Census is easy to complete, secure, and does not cost money. An accurate and complete Census count for Montana is too important to take lightly.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee did not respond to request for comment.\n\nEmilie Ritter Saunders, a spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Commerce, said the forms first popped up this spring, prompting her office\u2019s first response of the year. Some residents reached out to ensure that the department was aware of the impostor surveys, while others were confused as to what they were receiving.\n\n\u201cWe want to immediately squash any confusion. Our job is to make sure Montanans have accurate info about the census,\u201d Ritter Saunders said.\n\nThe \u201cimitation surveys\u201d are cause for concern among state officials tasked with ensuring a complete count: Montana has roughly $2 billion in federal funds on the line for expenditures from highway construction to food programs, Ritter Saunders said.\n\n\u201cThat funding is critical for a state like Montana that has a relatively small population,\u201d she said. \u201cEstimates show that Montana is also on the cusp of receiving another congressional representative.\u201d\n\nSeats in the U.S. House of Representatives are reapportioned every 10 years based on a state\u2019s growing or declining population.\n\nRitter Saunders said the RNC has sent out look-alike census forms in at least one prior census. In 2010, some people \u2014 including the Democratic governor of Montana and a Democratic representative in Georgia \u2014 reported getting such a survey, according to ProPublica.\n\n[2020 Census likely target of hacking, disinformation campaigns, officials say]\n\nPhony census mailers are enough of a concern that Congress in 2010 passed the Prevent Deceptive Census Look Alike Mailings Act.\n\nThe Montana mailers include a letter signed by RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, which says Trump has requested a \u201cCensus of every congressional district be completed immediately to help ensure reelection.\u201d It says the information is needed to create voter profiles and \u201ctarget audiences with the truth concerning President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats win this battle,\u201d the letter says, \u201cit will prove disastrous for America\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe survey itself includes questions such as \u201cHow confident are you that America\u2019s economy will continue to improve in the next 12 months?,\u201d \u201cDo you support President Trump in his determination to appoint judges who will adhere to strict constitutional principles and not use the court to advance their personal ideologies?\u201d and \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 fixation on \u2018climate change\u2019 has led to costly regulations that are negatively affecting our nation\u2019s economy across-the-board. Do you think climate change is a major threat to our nation?\u201d\n\nTerri Ann Lowenthal, a census expert who served as staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee in the 1980s, condemned the mailers.\n\n\u201cNo organization, whether it\u2019s political or a private business, should be using the word \u2018census\u2019 in any of its mailings from now until the 2020 census is complete,\u201d Lowenthal told The Washington Post. \u201cThey are trying to attract attention and are doing so at the expense of public confidence in a constitutionally required civic activity.\u201d\n\nMailings that mimic the real census have been a problem since at least the 1990s. Congress has passed at least two laws since then \u2014 most recently the 2010 law \u2014 aimed at curbing mail that impersonates a federal agency.\n\nLowenthal said it\u2019s difficult to judge whether the mailers from Montana run afoul of any laws without first seeing the envelope they were sent in to determine if the material gives the impression it\u2019s an official government mailing. As ProPublica reported, the misleading census forms from 2010 did not violate any laws.\n\n\u201cIn this case, using the word Census, even with a capital \u2018C,\u2019 does not equate to impersonation of the U.S. Census Bureau,\u201d it reported at the time.\n\nRead more:\n\nRepublican Rep.
