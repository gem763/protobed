That was the point of my story. I quoted Edward C. Chow, who follows Ukrainian policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who said the involvement of the vice president\u2019s son with Zlochevsky\u2019s firm undermined the Obama administration\u2019s anti-corruption message in Ukraine\u2026\n\nBut somebody obviously read my piece, as well as others like it, because questions about the Bidens in Ukraine suddenly came roaring back this year. Giuliani, Trump, and their lackeys began spreading the false accusation that Biden had traveled to Ukraine to blackmail the government and force officials to fire the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to derail an investigation into Burisma.\n\nIn May, when this issue began to surface, The Intercept\u2019s Robert Mackey wrote an excellent piece debunking the lies in the new pro-Trump version of the Biden story. In the process, he provided greater detail than I had included in my 2015 story. He wrote that Shokin had been forced from office at Biden\u2019s urging because he had failed to thoroughly investigate corruption and stifled efforts to expose embezzlement and misconduct by public officials. Biden did threaten to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Shokin was ousted. But that was because Shokin had blocked serious anti-corruption investigations, not because he was investigating Burisma.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Risen", "Theintercept.Com I-Wrote-About-The-Bidens-And-Ukraine-Years-Ago-Then-The-Right-Wing-Spin-Machine-Turned-The-Story-Upside-Down"], "top_image": ""}
