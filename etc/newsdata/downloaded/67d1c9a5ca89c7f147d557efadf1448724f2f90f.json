And on Monday evening, the Washington Post reported on the timing of Trump's decision, which came roughly a week before his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nThe Post reported that Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to put the brakes on approximately $400 million in military aid for Ukraine before the call.\n\nAnd on Sunday, the president confirmed he discussed investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, during the conversation with Zelensky. But he rejected the notion he dangled military aid over Ukraine to urge it toward investigating Biden, a top political opponent and the 2020 Democratic frontrunner.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that his main concern with providing aid to Ukraine is that other countries are not paying their fair share.\n\n\"I want other countries to put up money. I think it's unfair we put up the money. Then people called me and said let it go. I let it go,\" Trump said. \"We paid the money. The money was paid. But very importantly Germany, France, other countries should put up money and that's been my complaint from the beginning.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that during the phone call, Trump pressed Zelensky at least eight times to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the Bidens over their dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe younger Biden sat on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas-extraction company, from 2014 to early this year. Trump and Giuliani accused the elder Biden of trying to stymie a criminal investigation into Burisma in 2016 by pushing the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general leading the inquiry.\n\nWhile Biden did seek the prosecutor's removal, those accusations are unsubstantiated, with government officials and Ukrainian anticorruption advocates in fact saying that Shokin had hampered the investigation into Burisma long before Biden had entered the picture, according to The Journal.\n\nTrump denied suggestions that he told the Ukrainians that the military funds were conditioned upon investigating Biden. But he appeared to acknowledge on Monday that the aid package was at least somewhat on his mind during the call with Zelensky.\n\n\"It's very important to talk about corruption,\" Trump said. \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? It's very important that on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption.\"", "description": "President Trump has rejected the notion he dangled military aid over Ukraine to urge it toward investigating former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger", "Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a28c82e22af3d557fe1f6-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
