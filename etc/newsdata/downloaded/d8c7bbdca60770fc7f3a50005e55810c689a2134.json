They\u2019ve been poisoned with exotic substances, shot in the back, defenestrated, passed away from implausible illnesses\u2014yet Khodorkovsky, without question Putin\u2019s most important opponent in exile, remains alive and well in London.\n\nHere in the Russian capital, among those who feel they may be targeted as well, there are two basic theories about how best to stay alive: try to stay quiet, or shout back. Khodorkovsky takes the latter approach.\n\n\u201c Were Khodorkovsky to be murdered, the repercussions could be dramatic. But that does not mean he\u2019s safe. \u201d\n\nIt was the end of the working day at Khodorkovsky\u2019s new office on Wimpole Street, in central London. Outside, pedestrians enjoyed the calm, balmy evening, men stood in tight groups around corner pubs, shoppers hurried to make final purchases at luxury boutiques.\n\nIt was an improbable backdrop for talk about violent plots at home in Russia, and Khodorkovsky\u2019s ideas about how to counter them. \u201cI have been trying to understand what\u2019s going on through some of my multiple channels in the Russian government,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in an exclusive interview.\n\nKhodorkovsky was once Russia\u2019s richest man, head of the Yukos oil company, until he challenged Putin\u2019s rising power. Accused of multiple crimes on what he says were trumped-up charges, Khodorkovsky spent a decade imprisoned in Siberia. When, finally, he was released, he went into exile and became the leader of the Open Russia organization, positioning himself as as one of Putin\u2019s strongest and most persistent critics, while drawing on what he calls \u201cchannels in Russian power\u201d to warn him of plots and conspiracies.\n\nMore than 10,000 officers and bureaucrats work in hundreds of rooms in the maze of the Kremlin administration and law enforcement ministries in Moscow, Khodorkovsky points out, and not all of them agree with the impunity of the secret services, the unlawful violence, and the assassinations of opposition activists and leaders in Russia and abroad.\n\n\u201cI received information recently about an assassination attempt ordered against me. When my channels in Moscow informed me about the special operation being plotted, I sent messages back, saying: \u2018This one, too, will not be left unnoticed\u2019 So that is how we\u2019ve been fighting an information war with the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nThe former oligarch did not provide The Daily Beast with any evidence of the threat against him. But amid the charges and counter-charges and sometimes ludicrous denials in the Kremlin-controlled media, there\u2019s a growing, cumulative backlash against Russia for the hits allegedly orchestrated by Putin\u2019s services.\n\nEven Putin-friendly U.S. President Donald Trump has had to embrace sanctions and diplomatic actions. Were Khodorkovsky to be murdered, the repercussions could be more dramatic still. But that does not mean he\u2019s safe.\n\n\u201c Putin wants to be able to deny explicit complicity while he takes credit implicitly. \u201d\n\nA significant part of Putin\u2019s game is the strategic use of information about the murders to intimidate his enemies, including and especially those who think they might be targeted next. Typically, it appears Putin wants to be able to deny explicit complicity while he takes credit implicitly. On at least two occasions his alleged agents have used poisons that not only were very rare, but when discovered and analyzed pointed straight back toward the Russian secret services.\n\nIn the first case, former Russian agent and defector Alexander Litvinenko, a vocal critic of Putin, was killed in London in 2006 with the very rare radioactive isotope polonium 210 produced by the Russian nuclear industry. Earlier this year, another former Russian agent and defector living quietly in the English town of Salisbury, Sergei Skripal, almost died after exposure to the poison known as novichok, which was developed as a sophisticated chemical weapon by the former Soviet Union\u2014and only by the Soviet Union.\n\nThe British have identified two Russians they claim were responsible for the attempt on Skripal, which also led to the hospitalization of his daughter and a bystander, and the death of a woman who picked up the Nina Ricci perfume bottle that had contained the nerve agent.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s media have tried to say the Russians were innocent tourists, but one was identified by the private investigative news site Bellingcat as an officer in the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Subsequently the Russian newspaper Kommersant confirmed the ID.\n\nA different murder fraught with symbolism was the assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, gunned down right outside the Kremlin walls in 2015. And there are many other examples.\n\n\u201c The decision makers in power have gone crazy. \u201d \u2014 Mikhail Khodorkovsky\n\nNone of these operations ever was traced directly to Putin, but all of them served to heighten fears among his enemies and critics. Khodorkovsky has no doubt that in his case, Putin was aware of the alleged assassination plot against him, and whoever leaked the information about it may have meant to grate on the former oil magnate\u2019s nerves.\n\nIs Khodorkovsky getting paranoid, given the modus operandi of his very real enemy? He says no. And Khodorkovsky is not new to the world of threats.\n\nIn April 2006, while he was imprisoned in a Siberian prison camp thousands of miles from Moscow, another inmate slashed his face while he slept. Khodorkovsky woke up covered in blood. The wound was not life-threatening, but was taken as a warning.\n\nThese days, he says, \u201creliable channels of information\u201d provide him and his international team with important hints about what Putin and his closest circle are up to. \u201cThere are many people in Moscow who feel responsible about preventing my assassination,\u201d Khodorkovsky told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey realize that the decision-makers in power have gone crazy; the law enforcement agencies don\u2019t need to kill me, as I am not somebody related to their operation. But the control of the opposition is their job, so they are obliged to fulfill the president\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Khodorkovsky is neither a former intelligence agent, like the two spies, Skripal and Litvinenko, poisoned in the U.K.; nor was he a former Kremlin team member, like Mikhail Lesin, Putin\u2019s adviser and founder of Russia Today TV channel, who died mysteriously in Washington.\n\n\u201dThey [sources] tell me that Putin is not aware of this order to kill me, while I am convinced Putin is well-informed,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the first days of the novichok crisis, Khodorkovsky has blamed Putin for Skripal\u2019s poisoning: \u201cTo me it is obvious that either Putin ordered the poisoning attack on Skripal or his secret services have gotten out of control, which is also his fault.\u201d\n\nAnimosity between Khodorkovsky and Putin goes back years. Many in Russia are convinced that back in 2003, Putin personally ordered Russia\u2019s richest man locked up behind bars. The arrest happened shortly after Khodorkovsky was abrupt and confrontational at a meeting with Putin in front of the country\u2019s leading businessmen and television cameras.\n\n\u201cTo change the system of criminal capitalism, it is necessary to change your bureaucracy,\u201d Khodorkovsky told Putin that day. \u201cYour bureaucrats take and demand bribes.\u201d Putin promised to check if Khodorkovsky\u2019s own company, Yukos, had its tax payments in order. Shortly after that meeting, Khodorkovsky was arrested for tax evasion and was sent to the prison camps.\n\nAs soon as Putin freed him in 2013, Khodorkovsky left Russia and was granted residency in Switzerland. He had managed to save about $600 million in accounts abroad. Then, two years later, when Khodorkovsky refused to lie low, a Moscow court charged him with murder.\n\n\u201c After Nemtsov was killed, somebody called me and said that there were four people on the list for assassination and that I was one of them. \u201d \u2014 Mikhail Khodorkovsky\n\nOver time, the threats against Putin\u2019s opponents have served to harden the resistance. Hundreds of Putin\u2019s new critics emerge to replace the victims.\n\nRussia\u2019s leading investigative journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, famous for pinning down the crimes committed by state officials in Chechnya, was murdered at age 48, on President Putin\u2019s birthday, in October 2006, after receiving multiple threats. But today Russian online news publications and social media are bursting with articles and posts\u2014more reporters emerge every year, devoting themselves to investigating President Putin and his allies\u2019 illegal actions.\n\nThe tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died of heart failure while in police custody as a result of state officials denying him medical treatment as he investigated fraud. He was 37. But hundreds of thousands of activists have joined Alexey Navalny\u2019s anti-corruption movement that investigates similar corruption schemes.\n\nIn 2015, before Nemtsov, opposition leader and former vice prime minister, was shot dead in view of the Kremlin\u2019s walls he had lived for years under a constant shower of threats. Navalny has continued Nemtsov\u2019s activism, and continues to be a magnet for menac.\n\nIn January 2014, a few weeks after Khodorkovsky left prison, Nemtsov visited him in Switzerland. They had previously met in the Kremlin, when Nemtsov was in power. And now the two leading opponents of Putin discussed Khodorkovsky\u2019s future. The ex-oligarch had plans to build a philanthropic empire and develop a strategy for a future democratic Russia.\n\nAfter that trip, Nemtsov told friends and supporters about Khodorkovsky\u2019s thoughts about reforming Russia's political system, removing the power over Russia from the hands of one man.\n\n\u201cAfter Nemtsov was killed, somebody called me and said that there were four people on the list for assassination and that I was one of them,\u201d Khodorkovsky told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey also said that out of the assigned 24 million ruble budget, the group had spent only 17 million.\"\n\nToday, Khodorkovsky and his Open Russia group are running dozens of media, educational and human rights divisions across Russia; their employees organize seminars and conferences, defend arrested opposition activists and help NGOs and civic groups around the region.\n\n\u201cI have lots of projects in Russia, none of them are commercial and philanthropy means losses,\u201d Khodorkovsky said with a big smile. To feel comfortable about pouring money into Russian civil society, Khodorkovsky and his life-long business partners invested in real estate and other business enterprises in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn Russian liberal circles, Khodorkovsky is often criticized for being na\u00efve and detached from reality, especially when it comes to controlling the work of his own employees.\n\n\u201cIt often happens that one of his media groups does not know what the others are doing; his employees spend a lot of his money without achieving much; I sometimes wonder how he became a billionaire,\u201d says Yelena Panfilova, senior manager of Transparency International. Panfilova added that Khodorkovsky often became enamored of new people and fresh ideas.\n\n\u201c I have been actively involved in Trump\u2019s election campaign, and am part of the group on strategy development. \u201d \u2014 Simon Kukes, Russian-American Trump donor, whose emails to a Russian official were exposed by Khodorkovsky\n\nRecently, one of Khodorkovsky\u2019s investigative teams known as Dossier Center turned up information that might have bearing on investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. They got hold of emails allegedly sent by a Texas-based Russian-American businessman named Simon Kukes\u2014who donated $283,000 to the Trump Victor PAC\u2014to Vyacheslav Pavlovsky, a former Russian ambassador to Norway and now the vice president of Russian Railways.\n\n\u201cI have been actively involved in Trump\u2019s election campaign, and am part of the group on strategy development,\u201d Kukes wrote. \u201cI will be in Switzerland July 20th [2016] till August 2nd. Let me know how you are doing, and whether you want to meet.\u201d\n\nBoth The Guardian and NBC News picked up the initial story. Kukes would not be interviewed but responded by email that \u201cthat he thought his donations would help him make contacts in Houston, but that he regrets having made them in light of the press coverage they generated.\u201d The Guardian reported that they began two weeks after a now-infamous July 2016 meeting between Russian representatives and members of the Trump campaign\u2014including Donald J. Trump Jr.\u2014in Trump Tower.\n\nAs Kukes put it in one email to Pavlovsky after attending a fundraiser for the candidate, he thought Trump\u2019s chances were \u201cvery good.\u201d In fact, many rich Russians naturalized as Americans apparently shared that opinion, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in one case even $1 million, to political action committees supporting Trump.\n\nBut what was Khodorkovsky\u2019s interest in all this?\n\nIn fact, Kukes used to work for Khodorkovsky. In the spring of 2003, Kukes became vice president of Khodorkovsky\u2019s giant oil company, Yukos; and a few months later, on Oct. 25, Khodorkovsky was arrested.\n\n\u201cIt is strange that Khodorkovsky is investigating his former partner Kukes,\u201d says Alexey Kandaurov, former head of Yukos\u2019 analytical department. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody ever took Kukes seriously in the Kremlin and it is unlikely that Trump listened to Kukes\u2019 pitiful donation for the campaign, \u201d Kandaurov told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201c They were Russian killers. \u201d \u2014 Khodorkosky, talking about who murdered three freelancers he hired\n\nAnother of Khodorkovsky\u2019s reporting projects had fatal results for the journalists involved, and while he wants to discover the truth about the activities of Putin, the Russian secret services, and the oligarchs who serve both, he also wants to find better ways to protect those who investigate them in the public interest.\n\nEarlier this month the philanthropist created a new foundation, Justice for Journalists, after three Russian freelance journalists were murdered while investigating Russian private military contractors in the Central African Republic.\n\n\u201cThe effort he makes to protect journalists around the world is noble and rare, I will do everything to help Khodorkovsky create the system of prevention, to defend reporters from assassinations,\u201d says Panfilova of Transparency International.\n\nAs we talked about the murders in Africa there on Wimpole Street in London, Khodorkovsky was furious, offering some critical details that have come out of his inquiries.\n\n\u201c According to the working version of the murder investigation that we have now, they were Russian killers,\u201d Khodorkovsky told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey first shot one of the three journalists and then received an order to finish the others.\u201d\n\nIt appears that anyone investigating the murder may be in danger. Pyotr Verzilov, an activist with Pussy Riot, allegedly was poisoned right before he was supposed to publish his investigative report about the three murdered journalists.\n\nIn another case a reporter from Khodorkovsky\u2019s team of investigative journalists, Sergey Kanev, had to escape from Russia after a serious threat: Russian law enforcement agencies tried to accuse the journalist of preparing a terrorist attack on President Putin. Shortly prior the accusations, Kanev was investigating Skripal suspects, the alleged Russian GRU officers.\n\nOn Sunday, journalist Matvey Ganapolsky summed up the situation for Kanv in an interview on Echo of Moscow. \u201cThis would be my diagnosis: authorities are not even trying to make up something more sophisticated, they simply make up a terrorism story about Kanev, an investigative journalist with 30 years of experience.\u201d\n\nMuch like the three journalists killed in Africa, Kanev had worked for Investigation Control Center, another investigative group funded by Khodorkovsky.\n\nEcho of Moscow conducted its own social study on Sunday: the majority of the radio\u2019s listeners, 64 percent, said that Kanev was right to be investigating the poisoning attack on Sergei Skripal.\n\nDozens of Russian independent journalists have been killed in the past two decades of Putin\u2019s rule. But the new Khodorkovsky organization will also look at violence against journalists more broadly. More than 700 reporters were killed in the course of their work around the world in the past two decades.\n\nAt a time when there is no hope that state institutions will protect people from the abuses of the powerful, Khodorkovsky said, \u201cJournalists are the last non-military defense left for the civil society in its fight against authoritarian regimes.\u201d\n\nWith additional reporting by Christopher Dickey", "description": "Mikhail Khodorkovsky knows well the fate of those who criticize Russia\u2019s president and secret services.
