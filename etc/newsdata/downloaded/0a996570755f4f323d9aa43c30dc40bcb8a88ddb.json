REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nThe charges unsealed in federal court in Manhattan mirror those against one of Halkbank\u2019s former executives, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was found guilty and sentenced to prison after a trial in the same court last year.\n\nHalkbank could not immediately be reached for comment after business hours in Turkey. A U.S. lawyer for the bank declined to comment.\n\nThe United States and Turkey are at odds over Turkey\u2019s military offensive into northeastern Syria against Kurdish-led militia. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a set of sanctions on Monday to punish Ankara for the invasion.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday to urge a ceasefire and emphasize the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to sanctions until a resolution is reached, the White House said.\n\n\u201cThis indictment constitutes an additional step that does not contribute positively to the current situation of U.S.- Turkey relations,\u201d an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington told Reuters.\n\nTurkey began its cross-border operation just days after Erdogan told Trump in a phone call on Oct. 6 that he would go ahead with a long-planned move against U.S.-allied Kurds in the region, opening a fresh front in Syria\u2019s eight-year civil war.\n\nTrump moved U.S. forces out of the way, an abrupt policy change after years of American troops fighting alongside the Kurd-led Syrian Democratic Forces against Islamic State.\n\nTuesday\u2019s indictment is the latest development in a U.S. criminal case that first became public in 2016 with the arrest in Miami of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader accused of playing a central role in the sanctions evasion scheme. Atilla, a Halkbank deputy general manager, was arrested in New York the following year.\n\nZarrab pleaded guilty and testified for U.S. prosecutors at Atilla\u2019s trial. Zarrab said that Iran, with the help of Halkbank and Turkish government officials including Erdogan, used a complex web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold, food and medicine to get around U.S. sanctions.\n\nU.S. prosecutors said some officials took bribes as part of the scheme.\n\nThe prosecutors are seeking to compel Halkbank to forfeit money and property, though they did not give a specific amount.\n\nAtilla was sentenced to 32 months in prison following his conviction. He was released and returned to Turkey earlier this year. At the time of Atilla\u2019s conviction, Erdogan condemned the case as a political attack on his government.\n\nGold trader Zarrab, before pleading guilty, hired Rudy Giuliani, a longtime associate of Trump, to try to negotiate a deal between the U.S. and Turkish governments to secure his release.\n\nGiuliani has more recently attracted attention as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Federal prosecutors are examining Giuliani\u2019s interactions with two men he worked with in Ukraine who were arrested last week on campaign finance charges.\n\nGiuliani also said on Tuesday that he would not cooperate with the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into Republican Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.", "description": "U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday charged Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran - an indictment that may complicate tension between NATO allies Washington and Ankara.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441280206&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E22X", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
