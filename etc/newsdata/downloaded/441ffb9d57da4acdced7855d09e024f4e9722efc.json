Naina Helen Jama/TT News Agency/via REUTERS\n\nAmerican John Goodenough, at 97, became the oldest winner of a Nobel prize and shares the 9 million Swedish crown ($906,000 award equally with Stanley Whittingham from Britain and Akira Yoshino of Japan, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.\n\n\u201cLithium-ion batteries have revolutionised our lives since they first entered the market in 1991. They have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society, and are of the greatest benefit to humankind,\u201d the academy\u2019s Nobel committee said.\n\nWhittingham developed the first functional lithium battery in the early 1970s. Goodenough doubled the battery\u2019s potential in the following decade and Yoshino eliminated pure lithium from the battery, making it much safer to use.\n\nSpeaking on Japanese TV after hearing of his win, a smiling Yoshino said he was glad to have helped the environment.\n\n\u201cI am happy that Lithium ion battery won the prize in that context,\u201d he said, adding that he also hoped it would inspire others: \u201cI hope this will become an encouragement for young researchers.\u201d\n\nGregory Offer, an expert in mechanical engineering at Imperial College London, said the scientists\u2019 work had led to \u201cone of the key enabling technologies of the 21st century\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey have already underpinned the mobile revolution, and are now essential to help us solve the problem of climate change by electrifying transport and storing renewable electricity generation,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\nPeter Somfai, a professor of organic chemistry and a member of the Nobel committee for chemistry, said it was clear why the three should have won.\n\n\u201cThis is a technology we use every day. Most people have a mobile phone, electric vehicles are getting more popular. So... it\u2019s pretty straight forward why it\u2019s an important discovery, he told Reuters.\u201d\n\nThe prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created and funded in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901.\n\nThe Nobel prizes for medicine and physics were awarded earlier this week. The awards for literature, peace and economics will be announced in the next few days.\n\n(Graphic of Nobel laureates - here)", "description": "Three scientists won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Chemistry on Wednesday for developing and refining rechargeable lithium-ion batteries which made the global information technology, mobile and fossil-fuel free revolutions possible.", "authors": ["Niklas Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438797743&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980WB", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
