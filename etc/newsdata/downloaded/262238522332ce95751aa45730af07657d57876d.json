And that\u2019s just one of the products Microsoft is rumored to have lined up for its Surface event on Wednesday morning in New York, which is set to kick off at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET.\n\nRegarding the revolutionary new device, multiple rumors have suggested that Microsoft will finally take the wraps off its foldable computer (codenamed Centaurus) during this event. According to Windows Central, the foldable will have two displays connected by a hinge, and Evan Blass says it will be powered by a new OS dubbed Windows 10X which is \u201cdesigned for dual- and folding-screen devices\u201d and runs desktop apps in \u201ccontainers.\u201d\n\nMore from BGR\n\nAside from Centaurus, Microsoft is also expected to debut the Surface Pro 7 (with USB-C support), Surface Laptop 3 (which will come in both 13-inch and 15-inch variants), a Surface tablet powered by Qualcomm\u2019s ARM processor, and a smart speaker that could compete with the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home.\n\nWe actually got a chance to see renders of many of these devices ahead of time, also thanks to Evan Blass, so if you want to see what Microsoft will be showing off today, just click over to our report right here.\n\nThere could also be a surprise or two in store, though the leaks have been piling up in recent days, and it\u2019s a bit hard to imagine that anything flew completely under the radar. It\u2019s also worth noting that not everything mentioned above is guaranteed to be shown off today, especially the foldable PC and smart speaker.\n\nIf you want to watch the event live, you can either visit Microsoft\u2019s website or head to the event page on Twitter. You can also watch the YouTube stream, which we\u2019ve embedded above.\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "description": "Microsoft's annual product reveal events might not be subject to as much fervent anticipation as Apple's yearly iPhone unveiling, but this year, Microsoft has a chance to outdo one of its biggest rivals with a revolutionary device that could shape the future of laptops.
