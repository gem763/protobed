Many refugees oppose the move, which some human rights experts fear could spark a new crisis.\n\nDensely populated Bangladesh has been grappling with large refugee numbers, with local communities turning hostile toward Rohingya after a second failed bid to send thousands back to Myanmar in August.\n\nThe number of refugees in Cox\u2019s Bazar has swelled since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that U.N. investigators have said was conducted with \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee.\n\nA U.N. human rights investigator who visited in January said she feared a new crisis if Rohingya were taken to the island.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of things that remain unknown to me even following my visit, chief among them being whether the island is truly habitable,\u201d said Yanghee Lee, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar.\n\nShah Kamal, secretary of Bangladesh\u2019s Disaster Management Ministry, said the government was in talks with U.N. agencies to move the refugees to Bhasan Char, which it has been developing for the past three years.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to be concerned about floods because we have built storm surge embankment, with all other facilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo one will be moved there against their will.\u201d", "description": "Bangladesh will start relocating Rohingya Muslims to a flood-prone island off its coast next month as several thousand refugees have agreed to move, a government official said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ruma Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
