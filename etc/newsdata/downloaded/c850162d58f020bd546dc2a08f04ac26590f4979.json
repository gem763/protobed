House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and the chamber\u2019s two other top GOP leaders joined in lawmakers\u2019 lopsided slap at Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nMaking Republican defections all the more noteworthy: They came as the two parties are at each other\u2019s throats over the Democratic impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nWhile virtually all Republicans have rallied behind Trump in the impeachment fight, this is a moment \u2014 barely a year from the 2020 elections \u2014 when the White House and GOP lawmakers can ill afford to show divisions.\n\nNo one was suggesting the GOP\u2019s schism with Trump over Syria would soften the party\u2019s opposition to tossing him out of office.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a completely different issue,\u201d said No. 3 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.\n\nNo Republicans attacked Trump personally, instead carefully focusing their criticism on the policy.\n\nStill, the unfettered way in which Republicans openly belittled his troop withdrawal was noteworthy, both for its sweep and for the freedom that GOP lawmakers seemed to feel in opposing him.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called it a \u201cdark day\u201d that would have been \u201cmuch darker\u201d if the two parties hadn\u2019t united in voicing their opposition to the troop pullback.\n\nNo. 3 House GOP leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming said Syrian Kurds are \u201cfacing what looks like a betrayal\u201d by the U.S.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who\u2019s been a staunch Trump defender since he entered the White House but a critic of his troop withdrawal, said Trump was making \u201cthe biggest mistake of this presidency.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump had said the Kurds would be fine because \u201cthey know how to fight,\u201d Graham told reporters, \u201cTo suggest the Kurds are safer is really delusional.\u201d\n\nAnd Graham all but said Trump would be to blame if there\u2019s a new terrorist attack by Islamic State militants. Many fear that group will be revived as Turkey batters the very Kurdish fighters who\u2019ve been helping the U.S. neutralize them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be to the president\u2019s detriment if there\u2019s any attacks on our country, inspired attacks, not directly attacks, then he\u2019ll own it,\u201d Graham said.\n\nAlso wading in was Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who\u2019s not seeking reelection and has clashed with Trump over immigration and other issues.\n\nHurd called Trump\u2019s withdrawal a \u201cdisastrous decision\u201d because the U.S. is abandoning an ally and ceding influence in the region to adversaries like Russia and Iran. He recalled his pre-Congress experience as an undercover CIA counter-terrorism officer.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I learned when I was in the CIA was to be nice with nice guys and tough with tough guys, not the other way around,\u201d he said pointedly.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has repeatedly called the move \u201ca mistake\u201d and expressed a determination to do something to correct it, though the answer is unclear.\n\nA former senator and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who had frequent clashes with Trump and retired last year, has made few public statements since leaving Congress but weighed in on Wednesday.\n\nAsked in an interview why the GOP pushback has been so strong, Corker said, \u201cIt was such an irresponsible, precipitous decision where thousands of people are going to die. It\u2019s at a whole new level.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, of course, showed no hesitance in using even stronger language against Trump.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., labeled the withdrawal a \u201cdangerous and stupid decision.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, said Trump \u201chas never put his life on the line for his country\u201d like U.S. soldiers in Syria have done.\n\n\u201cPerhaps if he had not dodged the draft by lying about his feet, sending another American in his place to Vietnam,\u201d he\u2019d know that \u201cnothing is more evil than betrayal,\u201d Moulton said.\n\nThat was a reference to a deferment that allowed Trump to not serve in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs. Critics have accused him of draft dodging because Trump hasn\u2019t been able to recall which foot had the problem.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A \"dark day.\" A \"betrayal.\" The \"biggest mistake of this presidency,\" and \"really delusional.\" And that was President Donald Trump's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/7c5735_trump-90812-michael-mccaul-kevin-mccarthy-house-minority-leader-kevin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
