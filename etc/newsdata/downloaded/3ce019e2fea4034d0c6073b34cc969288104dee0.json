Just stay where you are, it's not worth moving because it could be the difference,' he said.\n\nThe snake expert advised everyone to carry some form of first aid if they were going to be outdoors during the summer months.\n\n'It's always best to carry first aid and to have a pressure bandage. That bandage could be the difference between life and death.'\n\nMr McKenzie said clothing can be substituted as a bandage if you don't have one to hand.\n\nThe most common snakes that Australians should be on the look out for are eastern brown snakes and tiger snakes.\n\nBoth are extremely venomous with the brown snake being responsible for 60 per cent of snake-related deaths in Australia.\n\nBrown snakes are considered highly aggressive and a bite can kill in under half an hour if untreated.\n\nEastern brown snakes are found in in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nTiger snakes are found in southern areas in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania.\n\nOn average, there is one death from a Tiger snake bite every year.\n\nTiger snakes (pictured) are found in southern areas in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania and are responsible for one death every year", "description": "An Australian snake expert has revealed the best ways to keep safe from snakes during summer, and how to treat a bite if you are attacked.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20306486-0-image-a-19_1572310393396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
