You wanna wrestle?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere's no reason for me not to release my medical records.\u201d\n\nIt came after Thursday\u2019s third primary debate on national TV when rival nominee Julian Castro, 44, appeared to play the age card by suggesting Mr Biden \u2013 who would be 78 when he took office \u2013 was confused about his own health care proposals.\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" Mr Castro asked repeatedly while accusing Mr Biden \u2013 wrongly \u2013 of becoming mixed up about his own health insurance proposals.\n\nCory Booker, another younger nominee at 50, went on record after the debate to say there were \"a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling\".\n\nSuggestions about the former Delaware senator\u2019s mental competence have not been helped by a series of gaffes, anachronisms and remarks perceived to show unwitting racism while on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s debate, he appeared to suggest some black parents should have social workers visiting as a matter of routine, while, at an earlier speech in Iowa he told his audience: \"Poor kids are just as bright as white kids\".\n\nIn the second candidates' debate in July, he was widely mocked after appearing to become confused over the difference between texts and websites. He urged viewers to visit Joe30330. No such site existed. Aids had told him to tell viewers to text Joe30330 it later emerged.\n\nAll the same, Mr Biden remains the steady frontrunner over the nine remaining candidates to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nSpeaking on Friday, he acknowledged this \"I know I get criticised,\" he told supporters, \"although fewer and fewer are criticising me.\"\n\nRead more\n\nBiden goes on the offensive amid intense clashes in Houston\n\nThe 14-year feud between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren\n\nBiden accidentally refers to Sanders as 'the president'\n\nJoe Biden denies making up war hero story on campaign trail\n\nJoe Biden asks audience to imagine Barack Obama\u2019s assassination\n\nJoe Biden says poor kids are \u2018as talented as white kids\u2019", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has attempted to brush off concerns about his age and health by asking a reporter who had questioned if he would release his medical records: \u201cyou want to wrestle?\u201dThe 76-year-old former US vice-president pledged to provide evidence of his fitness for leadership", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CsUUjJQ9h2gU0igP8pNhAQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b6494cfa357ae67d33e4f3248d8d2f61", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
