And there was even a clever twist \u2014 each film would be based on that month\u2019s holiday.\n\nWhile the potential to spotlight new voices in horror on an international streaming platform was welcome news for genre fans, the experiment has not resulted in the best batting average. Even die-hard fans of the series would tell you that it\u2019s been inconsistent at best. For every installment that impressed, there has been at least one that has disappointed. And now, with this week\u2019s release of twelfth chapter, it\u2019s high time we finally figure out which episodes you should actually watch by ranking them all. Consider this your guide to Hulu\u2019s Into the Dark.\n\n12. \u201cDown\u201d (Episode 5)\n\nWhile some of the installments of Into the Dark come apart at different times, none are as front-to-back loathsome as this Valentine\u2019s Day chapter about two people stuck in an elevator. Directed by the talented Daniel Stamm (The Last Exorcism), Down features two beautiful people named Guy (Matt Lauria) and Jennifer (Natalie Martinez) stuck in an elevator over a long holiday weekend. Before the alarm has really even gone off, they\u2019ve gotten each other\u2019s clothes off, but then Down reveals its hand when we learn that Guy is really Jennifer\u2019s stalker. It gives the whole thing a punitive, gross angle \u2014 Jennifer is being punished for having sex with a handsome man in an elevator \u2014 and then everything about it starts to make less and less sense. The characters are inconsistent, there\u2019s absolutely no real tension, and the gender politics are antiquated. If this is the first episode you watch, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up.\n\n11. \u201cAll That We Destroy\u201d (Episode 8)\n\nSome of the worst dialogue and performances sink the Mother\u2019s Day chapter of Into the Dark. Again, as is often the case here, there\u2019s a decent idea \u2014 they just don\u2019t do anything with it. Arguably the most Black Mirror-esque installment, this is the tale of a genetic scientist who has finally figured out how to clone people. How does she use this technology? To create copies of a woman for her serial-killer son to murder. Again and again. Yes, it\u2019s icky, but arguably clever in that her son doesn\u2019t get the same thrill he does from killing real women as it\u2019s too controlled a situation. He needs the real panic, and to take the real life. Sadly, the writing here goes from bad to abysmal, and the performances get dragged down with it. There\u2019s nothing worse in this series (and maybe on all of Hulu) than the exposition-heavy virtual-reality scenes between Samantha Mathis and Frank Whaley in which they go over the plot again and again just to make sure we get it.\n\n10. \u201cI\u2019m Just Fucking With You\u201d (Episode 7)\n\nApril Fool\u2019s Day was probably rich with ideas on the Into the Dark whiteboard, but this horror-comedy feels more like a prank on viewers. It\u2019s one of the ugliest and least enjoyable installments in that it gives us no one to care about, pitting two sociopaths against each other and letting them chew on the scenery. Hayes MacArthur is somewhat entertaining as Chester, a loudmouth jerk who\u2019s always playing pranks on people and is very clearly physically dangerous and probably a serial killer. Chester is fascinated by Keir O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Larry, who checks into a motel that Chester is pretending to manage (it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s done something awful to the owners pretty early on). The problem is that Larry is a jerk too, the kind of troll who goes beyond standard, bad social behavior and becomes actually abusive and dangerous. As we learn more and more about how awful Chester and Larry are, the whole venture comes apart, until it ends with such a cheap gotcha twist that you\u2019ll want to take a shower to wash the whole icky thing off.\n\n9. \u201cThe Body\u201d (Episode 1)\n\nThe first episode of Into the Dark has one of the best premises of the entire series but never quite figures out what to do with it. It also had the blessing of being able to use Halloween as its holiday setting. In this one, Tom Bateman plays a suave hit man who has to dispose of a body quickly. Given that it\u2019s a holiday in which people can get away with odd looks, he basically just wraps it up and starts walking, presuming that most people will hesitate when they see a bloodied man dragging something wrapped in plastic. Wacky hijinks ensue. It\u2019s a great idea for a short film, which this originally was, but comes apart when it gets stretched out to feature length. Tonally inconsistent and with a flat central performance, this one only comes to life when Aurora Perrineau pops up in the supporting cast. Otherwise, just watch the short.\n\n8. \u201cTreehouse\u201d (Episode 6)\n\nThe best overall ensemble in the history of Into the Dark makes the relative failure of this installment that much more disappointing. To celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, James Roday of Psych fame directed this twist on female empowerment and convinced Jimmi Simpson (Westworld), Mary McCormack, and Stephanie Beatriz to star. Simpson is excellent as a celebrity chef who has had a history of bullying and aggressive behavior. He\u2019s about to get a serious #MeToo moment courtesy of a group of witches. While the horror genre is likely to become overcrowded with stories of male jerks learning lessons, this one doesn\u2019t have enough teeth. All of the ideas feel half-developed, and it\u2019s just not as vicious as one wishes it would be. Like a lot of Into the Dark, it pulls its punches, ending up more of an interesting miss than it should have been.\n\n7. \u201cPure\u201d (Episode 12)\n\nWhat should be one of the most disturbing and powerful chapters of Into the Dark is a failure of execution more than concept. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, it feels like this story of the resurrection of Lilith to destroy a group of hypocritical fathers should have more teeth and rely less on jump scares for most of its run time. Jahkara Smith (NOS4A2) stars as Shay, a teenager who has just discovered her biological father after the death of her mother. The problem is that dear old Dad wants Shay to make a Purity Promise, a pact to stay a virgin until her wedding day, leading to a series of sequences about the awfulness of the patriarchy and how much they love to try and control women\u2019s bodies. Like a regrettable number of original movies on this list, there are elements here that work \u2014 ideas, performances, even individual scenes \u2014 but it\u2019s a failure to bring them all together that keeps it from the top half of the first year of the series.\n\n6. \u201cThey Come Knocking\u201d (Episode 9)\n\nGrief drama, supernatural thriller, and home-invasion-flick tropes are tossed in a blender in this mildly effective episode that would have been something special at about an hour but stretches a little thin at 85 minutes. Clayne Crawford of Rectify stars as a father headed to the middle of the desert to scatter his dead wife\u2019s ashes. When the family arrives in their isolated, no-phone-signal mobile home, they\u2019re startled when hooded, black-eyed children knock on the door and ask to come in. And then things get really weird. Directed by Adam Mason, They Come Knocking contains more striking imagery and genuine emotion than most installments in this series, even if it does hit a few beats too many times.\n\n5. \u201cSchool Spirit\u201d (Episode 11)\n\nStretching the boundaries of what a holiday-themed horror movie can be, Mike Gan\u2019s August entry uses going back to school as its narrative crux (and parents around the world probably agree that back-to-school day is one of the best holidays of the year). A riff on slasher movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, with a bit of John Hughes flavor, \u201cSchool Spirit\u201d is about a group of teens stuck in Saturday detention at the end of the first week of school. There\u2019s an urban legend about someone dressed as the school mascot (an admiral) who kills unruly students, and there wouldn\u2019t be a movie if it wasn\u2019t true! Some of the kills inject some actual gore into a series of films that have been light in that department, but it\u2019s a film that takes way too long to get to the good stuff, not building actual tension until the effective last half hour. You\u2019ll likely have moved on to a different movie class by then.\n\n4. \u201cFlesh & Blood\u201d (Episode 2)\n\nSadly, we\u2019re already getting into the \u201cyeah, it\u2019s not great\u201d portion of the Into the Dark legacy, but this one ranks a little higher, thanks to a totally committed performance by Dermot Mulroney. The typically affable actor plays against type as a man whose daughter (2019 breakout Diana Silvers of Booksmart and Ma) starts to suspect he may be a serial killer. And you thought your Thanksgiving was awkward. Wes Craven\u2019s creative collaborator Patrick Lussier (he edited most of Craven\u2019s late career) directs this installment with a workmanlike approach, not quite bringing it enough style but allowing Mulroney and Silvers enough space to do their work. Sadly, the whole piece kind of deflates in the final act, when Lussier can\u2019t find the right tone to keep the tension, but it\u2019s worth seeing for the performances.\n\n3. \u201cPooka!\u201d (Episode 3)\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a coincidence that most of the best installments of Into the Dark come from directors who had done strong work previously. Nacho Vigalondo, who directed the well-received Timecrimes and Colossal, is the biggest name in this series. Both of those films are very playful with genre rules, and Vigalondo approaches his Into the Dark with a similar degree of risk-taking. The Christmas episode of this series stars Nyasha Hatendi as an out-of-work actor who gets a job selling a new toy called the Pooka, which is a super-creepy doll that repeats back what kids and parents say to it. Dressing up as a crazy creature gives our hero more courage but leads him down a dark path in what is basically a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde riff. While there\u2019s a lot to like here, even an episode this solid suffers from the biggest problem of the Into the Dark series \u2014 they all would have better as hour-long episodes than 85-minute movies.\n\n2. \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d (Episode 4)\n\nThe New Year\u2019s installment of Into the Dark remains one of the most ambitious and most successful to date, largely because it has actual ideas of its own and anchors them to solid performances. It also has a talented director in Sophia Takal, who helmed an excellent little thriller from 2009 called Always Shine, starring Mackenzie Davis. Takal directs the saga of the worst New Year\u2019s Eve party ever. Alexis (Suki Waterhouse) gets together with some old high-school friends and invites the most successful alum of their circle, Danielle (Carly Chaikin), but they have more than a Champagne toast in mind. They\u2019re finally going to teach Danielle, who bullied a girl into suicide when they were young, a lesson she\u2019s long deserved. Takal\u2019s film is smart about how the self-help movement is really a form of bullying \u2014 so many of them work to tear people down so they\u2019ll be needed to build those people back up \u2014 and contains one of the best Into the Dark performances from Chaikin.\n\n1. \u201cCulture Shock\u201d (Episode 10)\n\nThe Independence Day installment of Hulu and Blumhouse\u2019s series is the only one that can legitimately be called great. It\u2019s ambitious, surreal, and daring \u2013 reminiscent of The Purge at first and then Get Out in the way it uses social issues of today in a way they\u2019ve never been used before. Martha Higareda gives the best performance in the series as Marisol, a very pregnant woman trying to cross the Mexican border. The first act of \u201cCulture Shock\u201d is a harrowing look at the real-life dangers of immigration, and then director Gigi Saul Guerrero takes a sharp turn into something completely unexpected \u2013 a mesmerizing look at the American Dream. Marisol wakes up in a world that would scare the Stepford Wives, and she seems to be the only one who can sense that this society isn\u2019t quite right. The final twist of \u201cCulture Shock\u201d doesn\u2019t completely work, but there\u2019s enough to recommend it by that point \u2013 including great performances from Barbara Crampton and Richard Cabral \u2013 that it tops this list without any hesitation.", "description": "Even diehard fans of this series would tell you that it\u2019s been inconsistent at best.
