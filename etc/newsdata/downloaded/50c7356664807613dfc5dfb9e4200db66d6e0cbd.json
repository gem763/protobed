All of that plateau and the steep cliff over there.\u201d\n\nSix months after wildfires torched this part of Ethiopia\u2019s Simien Mountains, the scars are healing: heather and grass have returned to carpet the hilltop, brightened by the yellow daisies which bloom after the long rains. On the near side of the valley lie barley fields, rippling in the wind.\n\nThe scene is bucolic. But, as Assefa explains, these montane grasslands and the rare wildlife they host are under threat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Simien Mountains are home to the highly endangered Ethiopian wolf. Photograph: Claudio Sillero/EWCP\n\nTwo fires broke out earlier this year, ravaging one of the oldest natural Unesco world heritage sites, and destroying, at least temporarily, the habitat of some of the world\u2019s rarest species: the copper-coated Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a goat found nowhere else on earth.\n\nFew doubt the blazes\u2019 cause. The park\u2019s wolf monitors \u2013 which include Assefa \u2013 saw, through binoculars, two men setting tussocks alight, though they couldn\u2019t confirm their identities.\n\n\u201cThey did it in five areas, on purpose,\u201d he says. The fire raged for several days, and it took thousands of locals including a nearby football club \u2013 eventually assisted by a team of Israeli firefighters \u2013 to bring the flames under control. Around the same time the Bale Mountains, in the country\u2019s south, were also affected by wildfires that lasted for more than 20 days and which experts attributed to human encroachment on the park.\n\nIncidents like these shed light on the pressures threatening Ethiopia\u2019s fragile wildlife and delicate ecosystems: accelerating competition over resources as the human population swells, political instability, global heating and mass tourism.\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis situation,\u201d says Greta Iori, Ethiopia technical advisor for the Wildlife Conservation Society, who fears the country\u2019s endemic species are being driven close to extinction. \u201cWe are inundated with issues when it comes to wildlife.\u201d\n\nEthiopia was one of the first countries in Africa to establish national parks. The Simien Mountains were formally added to these in 1969, and today there are 20 national parks, and many more protected areas nationwide. For a country with few minerals or natural resources such as oil, assets like these are an important source of national income.According to the World Bank, \u201cnatural capital\u201d, including forests and agricultural land, accounts for 40% of Ethiopia\u2019s total wealth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ethiopia was one of the first countries in Africa to establish national parks.

In Omo national park, in the far south of Ethiopia near the border with Kenya, the government is building sugar factories and vast irrigated plantations. Awash national park, the country\u2019s oldest, is severed in two by the railway and eastern highway towards Djibouti. Abijatta-Shalla, south of Addis Ababa, is home to a soda ash factory.\n\nMeanwhile, ethnic unrest in eastern Ethiopia has had an enormous impact on Babile Elephant Sanctuary, one of the country\u2019s most important elephant ranges. According to Iori a huge number of new human settlements have appeared inside its borders since 2017.\n\nThe elephant population is under extreme pressure due to \u201cheightened and unavoidable human-elephant conflict\u201d, she says. A population of about 500 could be decimated \u201cin a blink of an eye\u201d through poaching, with park staff struggling to secure the sanctuary.\n\n\u201c2019 has been brutal with an incredible spike in elephant killings,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve already lost in Babile, and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nNationwide, conservation efforts have been stymied in recent years by civil unrest and the political transition following the appointment of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in 2018.\n\n\u201cIn general Ethiopia has never been a huge poaching-for-trafficking hotspot \u2013 but since law and order has crumbled we\u2019ve seen a spike in opportunistic poaching and subsequent trafficking,\u201d Iori says. \u201cThe police and army are busy with other things, and the risk of getting caught is low.\u201d\n\nIn the Simien Mountains the problems are less advanced and the park better managed. But similar dynamics are present. When political protests broke out in 2016, the park was a target of popular anger, with locals breaking prohibitions against tree-chopping and livestock grazing. \u201cEveryone was rushing to get his share,\u201d recalls Assefa. \u201cWe lost two of the best wolf habitats.\u201d\n\nToday the park\u2019s authorities still struggle to enforce local laws designed to protect the natural environment.\n\n\u201cThere is a big conflict between the young, unemployed people and the park management,\u201d Assefa explains. He reckons the fires this year were started by locals disgruntled by the authorities\u2019 heightened clampdown on livestock grazing inside the park\u2019s perimeters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Setegn, a local farmer, says he depends on his livestock for survival. Photograph: Henning Neuhaus\n\nSetegn, a local farmer whose house lies just beyond the park, admits he grazes his animals inside the boundary marked by the main road. \u201cThe park management said we can\u2019t cross the road \u2013 they say we won\u2019t get any benefit from tourism unless we graze on the right-hand side,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very difficult. There is no survival for us without livestock.\u201d\n\nOthers interviewed by the Guardian expressed the same concerns, saying their incomes had been badly hit by the restrictions.\n\nThe barley fields on the left of the road are another sign of human intrusion, and of the waning authority of the park management, notes Nick Crane, the British owner of Simien Mountain Lodge. \u201cThey encroach slowly \u2013 imperceptibly \u2013 so you hardly notice it,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to Abebaw Azanaw, the park warden, there are about 130 households around the edges of the park.\n\nRelocating them would be costly and could spark renewed conflict. In 2016 the entire village of Gichi \u2013 nearly 500 households located on the escarpment where the fire started \u2013 opted to move to a new settlement near the town of Debark, which cost the government on average $17,000 (\u00a314,000) per family. The compensation was sizeable but many complained about a lack of electricity in their new homes on arrival, and of a lack of jobs. Some threatened to return to the park.\n\n\u201cWe learnt from Gichi that it is very difficult to resettle people from the park,\u201d says Assefa.\n\nThe root of the problem is common in many developing countries when it comes to conservation: how to strike the right balance between the resource demands of local residents and the need to protect the natural environment for future generations.\n\nPromoting tourism is part of the answer, should it mean jobs and higher incomes for locals, but only if managed well.\n\nIn 2015 the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that it intended to triple foreign visitors to more than 2.5 million by 2020.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The walia ibex, only found in the Simien Mountains. Photograph: Santiago Urquijo/Getty Images\n\nBut for John Watkin, who worked in the Simien Mountains as the chief technical advisor for Africa Wildlife Foundation between 2018 and 2019, \u201cuncontrolled tourism\u201d is the most serious threat to the park\u2019s wildlife.\n\n\u201cThe park infrastructure is simply not set up for huge numbers of tourists \u2026 Tourism is always looking for a new hot destination, and Ethiopia is it. But unless it is done well it is going to cause serious problems,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Crane, one answer is to increase the park price for foreign visitors, to try to limit the number coming to the Simien Mountains each year.\n\nMeanwhile Watkin suggests Ethiopia considers alternative conservation approaches that allow communities to take ownership of the process, moving away from the state-led \u201cfortress conservation\u201d model that prevails. He notes examples in Kenya and Tanzania, where local communities run eco-lodges and tourism ventures while ensuring the landscape is protected. \u201cThey\u2019re 20 to 30 years ahead of Ethiopia in this,\u201d he says.\n\nSuch approaches might make it possible for Ethiopia to square the circle between conservation and development.\n\n\u201cThe core of the problem is that tourism is not working for the locals,\u201d says Joshua Amlakse, a Simien Mountains guide. \u201cNothing ends up in the local community.\u201d", "description": "Wildfires and an encroaching population are threatening grasslands that host some of the world\u2019s rarest species", "authors": ["Tom Gardner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e8ed5a461f2629fd2a9fb256c7395508608f01d/0_218_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=068f44c6a86ba163334b69284d9251f4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
