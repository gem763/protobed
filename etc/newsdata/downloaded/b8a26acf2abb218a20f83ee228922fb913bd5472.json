Just, no.'\n\nAnd a second said: 'I'm sorry but mashed potato needs gravy.'\n\nThe man from Derby, pictured above and who appears to be an avid runner, said he felt 'ostracised' after receiving several negative responses on social media\n\nHowever, some people that saw the post came out to defend Chris's choice of meal.\n\nOne typed: 'I see no problem with this! Carbs with a side of carbs...love toast, love mash...lots of fibre! Just needs to be covered in more cheese...food of champions Chris!'\n\nAfter seeing the comments, Chris said he felt 'ostracised' and that he never realised this 'was such a monitory group'.", "description": "Rolls-Royce employee Chris Duro from Derby posted a picture of his 'culinary classic' mashed potato on toast on Facebook, but was hit with a wave of criticism over the carb-heavy meal.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19829188-0-image-a-31_1571304345346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
