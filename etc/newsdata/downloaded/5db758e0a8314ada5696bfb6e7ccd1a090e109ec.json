UBS downgraded its shares from 'buy' to 'neutral' and rolled back its target price from 225p to 235p. RBS fell 2 per cent, or 4.4p, to 219.2p.\n\nDawn Fitzpatrick, a non-executive director at Barclays who is also chief investment officer at billionaire George Soros's hedge fund Soros Fund Management, splashed out \u00a31.5m buying shares in the British bank. Barclays rose 0.7 per cent, or 1.22p, to 171.72p. Director share purchases on a more modest scale boosted esports firm Gaming Realms and mining minnow Rainbow Rare Earths on the junior market.\n\nAIM-listed Gaming Realms jumped 12.8 per cent, or 0.85p, to 7.5p after chairman Michael Buckley bought another 2m shares for \u00a3100,000. And Rainbow bosses \u2013 chief executive George Bennett and chairman Adonis Pouroulis \u2013 spent \u00a3163,934 each, snapping up 5.5m shares for 3p each. It climbed 6 per cent, or 0.15p, to 2.65p.\n\nThe FTSE 100 for the most part brushed off uncertainty about the prospect of a December election, shedding 0.34 per cent, or 25.02 points, to finish at 7306.26, while the FTSE 250 tracked 0.21 per cent lower to close down 41.83 points at 20,168.33.\n\nThe volatility on global stock markets over the summer, driven by Brexit and the US-China trade spat, was a boon for online trading platform Plus500. Revenues between July and September rose 10 per cent to \u00a386m and the number of new customers using Plus500 to trade surged to 24,359 from 20,684 in the same period of 2018.\n\nIt follows a plunge in profits last year when Plus500 and its peers were knocked by European regulators clamping down on trading of risky financial products. Plus500 rose 5.5 per cent, or 43.4p, to 832p.\n\nOilfield drilling equipment provider Hunting lost ground as it said challenging conditions, particularly in the US market, would hit profits, putting full-year figures at the lower end of City forecasts. It fell 1 per cent, or 4p, to 416p.\n\nOver on AIM, oil and gas tiddler Cabot Energy nosedived 46.7 per cent, or 1.75p, to 2p, after it said it was looking to quit the junior market and go private.\n\nSports nutrition specialist Science in Sport added 1 per cent, or 0.5p, to close at 50.5p, after it said that Neil Tinegate, a former digital director at Heineken and Argos, will join as ecommerce director.\n\nWomenswear retailer Sosandar jumped a further 7.5 per cent, or 1.5p, to 21.5p, building on a rally it made on Monday after it revealed sales surged 53 per cent in the first half.", "description": "More than 97 per cent of Royal Mail staff balloted by the Communication Workers Union have backed a strike - though whether this will go ahead is very much uncertain.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
