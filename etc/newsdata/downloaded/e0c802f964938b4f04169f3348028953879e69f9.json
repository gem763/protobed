His government also passed legislation for medically-assisted dying and set a nationwide price on carbon, one that has yet to be enacted by some of the country's 10 provinces and three territories.\n\nMr Trudeau, however, quickly abandoned his pledge to dump the first-past-the-post electoral system, knowing his Liberals would be disadvantaged in any proposed change. He also soured his relationship with aborigines when he sacked the country's first indigenous justice minister over a burgeoning corruption scandal, and then enraged environmentalists - who had been firmly on his side - by buying a $C4.5 billion ($5 billion) pipeline to deliver Alberta oil to the Pacific coast.\n\nScheer comes from the Canadian west, rich in potash and oil and gas, Canadian Press/AP\n\nHis progressive image was also damaged by old images of him dressing up in brownface or blackface at least three times \u2014 including in a video in which he is seen wearing an Afro wig and sticking his tongue out.\n\nIt's the expansion of that 1100-kilometre pipeline across the Rocky Mountains delivering oil to the Pacific port of Vancouver - and hopefully new Asian markets - that was a key plank in the platform of Mr Trudeau's main competitor, Andrew Scheer, of the Conservative party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScheer comes from the Canadian west, rich in potash and oil and gas, but that region's economy has suffered as world oil prices retreated and as petroleum exporters suffer with a $US15 per barrel discount on the price of oil being shipped south from landlocked Alberta to the US market.\n\nConceding defeat, Mr Scheer told his supporters in Regina, Saskatchewan: \"I have spoken with Mr Trudeau and my message tonight is the strength of our democracy is not only by the ballots we cast but how we move forward after they\u2019re counted.\"\n\n\"But I put Justin Trudeau on notice, his leadership is damaged and when his government falls, Conservatives are ready and we will win,\" Mr Scheer said.\n\nIn the vote-rich area surrounding Toronto - Canada's largest city with a metropolitan population of some eight million - Mr Trudeau's Liberals appeared set to hold onto many of the gains they made when they swept the region four years ago.\n\nIn French-speaking Quebec, the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ate into Mr Trudeau's support, taking as many as 33 seats in the House of Commons, up from 10 in October 2015.\n\nCanada's jobless rate is hovering near a 40-year low at 5.5 per cent, buoyed by the September creation of some 54,000 new jobs. That has helped power the economic expansion, second in the G7 nations only to that of the US - the country's biggest trading partner - to a 3.7 per cent annual pace.\n\nMuch of Mr Trudeau's slide in popularity can be blamed only on himself. He took power, promising a gender-equal Cabinet, but he has since retreated from that promise and earlier this year lost two strong women ministers, including Jody Wilson-Raybould, the aboriginal woman from British Columbia who served as justice minister and attorney general.\n\nJagmeet Singh is the leader of Canada's third largest national party, the New Democrats. Canadian Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country's ethics watchdog ruled that Mr Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest laws by inappropriately pressuring Wilson-Raybould to reach an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, an engineering firm in Montreal. He said he was trying to protect some 8000 jobs in his home province of Quebec.\n\nIt was the second time he was rebuked on ethics, having earlier accepted a paid family vacation at the Bahamas home of multimillionaire the Aga Khan. Then there was the widely panned trip to India, which turned into a series of photo-ops in bright silk costumes of his family in front of monuments, and a security scare when his government had invited a convicted Sikh terrorist to a reception.\n\nMs Wilson-Raybould, a tribal leader of the We We Wai Kai Nation, was the sole independent elected to the Parliament, having raised C$400,000 with no official party support to retake her seat in downtown Vancouver.\n\nIt now remains to be seen how he will form a government, possibly leaning on the separatists from Quebec - although that brings its own problems - or with the New Democrats, led by the bright turban-wearing Jagmeet Singh, and possibly by the Green Party, and its leader, Elizabeth May.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, tarnished by a series of scandals, lost his majority government, but was likely to stay in office.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6113%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_797%2C$y_319/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c20dcacb6d9ff99b950963ad25ac03611ea1fe35", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
