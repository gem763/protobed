This was proven yet again by the recent outcry from members of the foreign policy establishment over the now-dead news that the United States was close to finalizing a deal with the Taliban. Despite nearly 18 years of conflict, the prospect of a U.S. withdrawal within the next year is somehow still considered by many to be a mad rush toward the exit.\n\nTheir argument never really changes. They insist we have to fight terrorists over there so we don\u2019t have to fight them here. It\u2019s what everyone, from hawkish Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham to Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has said repeatedly since negotiations with the Taliban began. But this mentality doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, and perfectly illustrates how warped our view of the world has become since the events of September 11 \u2014 a tragedy from which we learned all the wrong lessons.\n\nSince World War II, global hegemony has been the U.S foreign policy goal, but the shock of 9/11 injected this idea with steroids. Before, the United States had largely been unconcerned about the threat of non-state terrorists. There were certainly people within the FBI and CIA who tried to sound the alarm bells in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they were unable to capture the attention of both the Clinton and Bush administrations.\n\nThe latter\u2019s reaction to 9/11 swung the pendulum completely in the opposite direction, with little regard for the negative, unintended consequences such a move would bring. The existence of terrorism anywhere on the planet was deemed an unacceptable risk, and the United States needed to actively work not only to counter the threat, but to totally eradicate it. As the 9/11 Commission Report made clear, the American homeland suddenly became the entire planet.\n\nThis risk threshold \u2014 where the existence of bad guys justifies nearly any action to curtail it \u2014 has driven the global war on terror for the last two decades. The United States can\u2019t leave Afghanistan because pre-9/11 conditions will re-emerge and terrorists will be at our front doors. This ignores the fact that the \u201csafe haven\u201d theory of terrorism has been debunked time and again, and that 9/11 was planned from multiple points across the globe, including right here in the United States.\n\nExcessive fear of terrorism \u2014 whether from al Qaeda, ISIS and its various branches, Iranian proxies, or al-Shabaab in Somalia \u2014 drives U.S. action in the war on terror \u2014 which has done little to actually keep us safe and much to make the world more insecure. The U.S. invasion of Iraq shows us that much. But we don\u2019t need to police the entire world to defend ourselves. Endless military campaigns needlessly sap the United States of power, treasure and lives, and sow a lot of discord and dysfunction in the process.\n\nDomestic politics haven\u2019t been immune from the consequences of 9/11, either. Militarism abroad begets militarism at home. In building an extensive national security apparatus to deal with foreign threats, the federal government has created a monster that violates our domestic liberty.\n\nAt airports, we submit our person and property to TSA, as they rifle through our belongings and fondle us in a display of security theater that isn\u2019t effective. The NSA created a surveillance state with no significant constraints that leaves very little of our private communications untouched by government. Our own citizens, including a teenage boy, have been executed by unnecessary strikes overseas.\n\nMoreover, this paranoia laid the groundwork for the populism and nativism that now looms large over both American and European politics. A straight line can be drawn from pushing \u201csee something, say something\u201d mindsets (where Muslims have been kicked off planes for undue suspicion) to migrant detention centers at the border, aimed at stopping an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people from the so-called third world. When the government operates in a constant state of emergency in its foreign policy, it\u2019s only a matter of time before that seeps into domestic life as well.\n\nThe attack on 9/11 was a horrifying tragedy, but we have let it animate our politics in ways that we failed to foresee in the immediate aftermath and in ways that don\u2019t provide tangible benefits for our security. Our American homeland doesn\u2019t envelop the planet, and we don\u2019t need to act like it does. The first step toward restoring some balance to both our foreign policy and domestic politics is to let go of the siege mentality that 9/11 produced, once and for all.\n\n\u2022 Jerrod A.
