UPDATE 3-Oil ticks up as rising crude stocks are offset by products demand * Chinese economy registers slowest growth in nearly three\n\ndecades\n\n* China's September refinery throughput up 9.4%\n\n* U.S. crude stocks rise, product stocks fall-EIA\n\n\n\n(Updates prices, adds comment, changes dateline to London)\n\nBy Shadia Nasralla\n\nLONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose slightly on\n\nFriday as concern over an economic slowdown in China, the\n\nworld's biggest oil consumer, was countered by bullish signals\n\nfrom both the Chinese and U.S. refining sectors.\n\nErasing earlier losses, global benchmark Brent crude oil\n\nfutures rose 10 cents to $60.01 a barrel by 0927 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures\n\nedged up by 26 cents to $54.19. Both contracts were on track for\n\nweekly declines of less than 1%.\n\nIn the third quarter, China's economic growth slowed to 6%\n\nyear on year, its weakest for 27-1/2 years and below\n\nexpectations, dogged by soft factory production amid sluggish\n\ndomestic demand and continuing trade tensions with the United\n\nStates. China's September refinery throughput, however, was up 9.4%\n\nyear on year at 56.49 million tonnes, boosted by new refineries\n\nand some independent refiners resuming operations after\n\nmaintenance.\n\nU.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing\n\ndown a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next\n\nmonth, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.\n\nIn the United States, falling product stocks countered\n\nhigher U.S. crude oil stocks USOILC=ECI , which rose by 9.3\n\nmillion barrels in the week to Oct. 11. That compared with\n\nexpectations for an increase of 2.9 million barrels. EIA/S\n\n\"The actual key takeaway from the report was that the U.S.\n\nis inching closer to energy independence,\" PVM analysts said in\n\na note. \"The country was a net exporter for crude and refined\n\nproducts for a second consecutive week for the first time on\n\nrecord.\"\n\nElsewhere, the joint technical committee monitoring a global\n\noil production pact between the Organization of the Petroleum\n\nExporting Countries (OPEC) and partners found that compliance is\n\nbeing exceeded, with cuts for September representing 236% of\n\nagreed quotas, sources said. OPEC and its allies, including Russia, have agreed to limit\n\noil output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March\n\n2020.\n\nOPEC lowered its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to\n\n0.98 million bpd while leaving its 2020 demand growth estimate\n\nunchanged at 1.08 million bpd, its latest monthly report said.\n\n\n\nUPDATE 3-Oil ticks up as rising crude stocks are offset by products demand", "description": "UPDATE 3-Oil ticks up as rising crude stocks are offset by products demand", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6T0FW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
