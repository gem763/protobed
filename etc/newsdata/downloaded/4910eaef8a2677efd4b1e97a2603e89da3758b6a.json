General Assembly meeting.\n\nNATO allies Turkey and the U.S. have started joint land and air patrols along part of the border strip, but Ankara says Washington is moving too slowly to establish a sufficiently large safe zone to push Syrian Kurdish forces from the border.\n\nTurkey has been angered by U.S. support for Kurdish-led forces which fought Islamic State in Syria. It considers the Kurdish YPG fighters a terrorist organization and wants them removed from more than 400 km (250 miles) of border.\n\nThe YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said they will pull back up to 14 km in some areas. Turkey says the U.S. had agreed that the \u201csafe zone\u201d should extend 32 km into Syria.\n\nErdogan reiterated complaints over U.S. support for the Kurdish fighters, saying Washington was providing them with arms.\n\n\u201cWe have no wish to come face to face with the U.S.\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we cannot afford to overlook the support that the U.S. is giving to a terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nHis comments about border preparations came a day after two security sources said doctors have been stationed in southern Turkish provinces to prepare for a possible incursion into Syria.\n\nOne source said doctors\u2019 leave had been suspended. \u201cWe have been preparing for a long time,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe operation can be conducted whenever deemed necessary.\u201d\n\nTurkey has already launched two military incursions into northern Syria since 2016, targeting Islamic State and YPG forces west of the Euphrates", "description": "Turkey is ready to act on its southern border with Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said, after warning that it could take unilateral steps if the U.S. does not establish a \"safe zone\" in northeast Syria this month.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432339128&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0FZ", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
