The board has therefore decided to exit the markets in an orderly manner.\u201d\n\nThis will leave the company with 1,172 stores in the UK and Ireland, and a minority shareholding in its German operation, which is run by the Australian franchisee Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises. The UK firm formed a joint venture with DPE in 2015 after struggling in Germany.\n\nThe news came as Domino\u2019s reported a 2.7% decline in international sales in the 13 weeks to 29 September, its third quarter, partly hit by a decline in tourist numbers in Iceland. The previous half-year results showed losses at operations in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden more than tripled to \u00a36.4m, dragging underlying group pretax profit down 7.4% to \u00a342.3m.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nOverall sales rose 3.4% to \u00a3313.5m in the third quarter, with like-for-like sales in the UK up 3%. Domino\u2019s opened nine UK outlets in that period. However, like-for-like orders slipped 0.5% in the quarter and items per order fell 2.4%, while prices rose 1.8%.\n\nDomino\u2019s, which is looking for a new chief executive and a new chair, said the UK and Ireland remained \u201cchallenging and the consumer backdrop subdued\u201d. With the 31 October deadline for Brexit looming, consumers and businesses are increasingly worried about the impact on the economy, jobs and incomes.\n\nThe company has been stockpiling ingredients in case a no-deal Brexit disrupts supplies. They include tomato sauce for its pizza bases from Portugal and other imported ingredients such as frozen chicken, tuna and pineapple.\n\nDomino\u2019s remains locked in a row with its 63 franchisees in the UK, who run almost all of its 1,118 stores, over their share of profits. The prolonged dispute, which will run into next year, has affected normal working practices, the company says, with a potential hit to sales. For example, some franchisees have refused to participate in national marketing campaigns.\n\nRachel Fox, an equity analyst at the Irish stockbrokers Goodbody, said: \u201cDomino\u2019s announcement that it is pulling out of international markets does not come as a huge surprise, albeit at an earlier stage than we expected. The international business has been increasingly loss-making over the years, due to factors including expensive labour and difficulties in grasping local consumer dynamics.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the UK, the focus will be on a resolution of the ongoing franchisee dispute, given it will need to drive sales growth in its domestic market. This is increasingly important [because of] competition from delivery services such as Just Eat and Deliveroo as aggregators continue to encroach on incumbents in this space.\u201d", "description": "Pizza delivery giant\u2019s increasing losses prompt plan to sell up and leave four markets", "authors": ["Julia Kollewe", "Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42405367193d67ddebdd5886d39e5a08b0bd00c1/0_35_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a39f0ace135ef65cc3a357bb6ab9040", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
