He deleted the tweet, as if that could make the whole thing go away. Next, again via Twitter, came a carefully worded apology that pleaded ignorance of the Hong Kong situation and dabbled in both sides-ism. The Rockets organization was similarly penitent, and rumors began to circulate that Morey, one of the league\u2019s most talented executives, could lose his job. Having a successful basketball team is good for business. But if winning games comes at the expense of losing millions of dollars in broadcast rights and sponsorship deals, then even a talent like Morey becomes disposable.\n\nBut however much the Rockets may have wanted to fire Morey, it was never going to happen. Since the days when it policed the dress of its players in an attempt to shed the sport\u2019s \u201cthuggish\u201d image, the NBA has gone to great pains to paint itself as America\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d sports league, where members of its largely black work force are encouraged to speak their mind on social issues\u2014especially when it comes to expressing anti-Trump sentiment. Morey getting run out of town for accidentally having a political opinion, especially one so in-line with mainstream liberalism, would be decidedly off-brand. The last thing the NBA wanted was to make a martyr of Morey, or risk turning him into an Oxford-clad version of Colin Kaepernick.\n\nThe league\u2019s initial response to the Morey fiasco was garbled, vague, and contradictory. It sought to simultaneously contain the damage done to the relationship with China and reassure fans that individuals having opinions about politics\u2014especially when those opinions were as banal as \u201cdemocracy is good\u201d\u2014was a core \u201cvalue\u201d of the league. The statement, wishy-washy as it was, met with a swift backlash, one compounded by an open letter from Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai, in which the Chinese national suggested that people with no grasp of the situation in Hong Kong should, in effect, stick to sports. It actually would have been a fair criticism of Morey, except for the fact that the Hong Kong-China relationship is remarkably low on moral ambiguity, and to insist that there\u2019s a great complexity there is a pretty transparent way of siding with, or at least being sympathetic to, the latter. And let\u2019s not forget that Tsai, who as the founder of the mega-conglomerate Alibaba has benefited more than literally anyone from China\u2019s authoritarian-capitalist model, is hardly a neutral voice on the issue.\n\nThe league\u2019s failure to mount a full-throated defense of the Rockets\u2019 GM, and its insistence on acknowledging the Chinese government\u2019s unhappiness, were taken as an indication that the NBA\u2019s fealty to its bottom line was getting in the way of its conscience. But the problem is not that the NBA was expected to take any particular position on the Hong Kong protests, or that it wants to make money. It was the league\u2019s refusal to play along with its own narrative. The NBA wasn\u2019t supposed to be this cynical, and here it had become a victim of the standard that it had quite cannily set for itself.\n\nThis made it susceptible to attacks from conservatives who have a longstanding beef with the league over its perceived liberalism. Ted Cruz relished the opportunity to point out that a left-leaning institution was siding with a repressive commie regime, while a Bari Weiss op-ed in The New York Times pilloried the league for failing to live up to its \u201cwoke\u201d reputation, which for her suggested that all \u201cwokeness\u201d was a sham. Predictably, Donald Trump himself eventually got involved. When Warriors coach Steve Kerr\u2014who has been sharply critical of this administration\u2014refused to say much of anything about the Morey situation, the president gleefully accused Kerr of being a coward and a hypocrite. When Kerr suggested that America should worry about its own issues, and mused that \u201cthe world\u2019s a complex place and there\u2019s more gray than black and white,\u201d it sure seemed like Trump had a point.", "description": "The dust-up belies the pro basketball's reputation as the \"good\" league.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Friedman"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/5941c24facbe5710e654a40d45413810d5803ff7.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
