More than that, it\u2019s been beneficial to her weight cut, which has historically been rough.\n\nDern badly missed weight in her previous fight, but reported on Wednesday that she\u2019s 118 pounds and well ahead of schedule for Friday\u2019s weigh-in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just keeping me focused and her smiles are keeping me happy and focused,\u201d Dern told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at the UFC on ESPN+ 19 open workouts. \u201cThe weight cut is going great. I think the breast-feeding helps with the weight cut breastfeeding all the time it\u2019s keeping my weight down. It\u2019s the best weight cut ever so I was surprised.\u201d\n\nTypically female fighters do not come back so quickly after having a child. In this instance, though, Dern said the timing was perfect, especially because she hasn\u2019t competed since May 2018.\n\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d be back fast,\u201d Dern said. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be back but didn\u2019t know if the labor would be a sea section but the labor, even though it was long, it was OK. I got back to training and the two weeks after I got back to training I told my manager, \u2018When is my next fight?'\u201d\n\nDern returns to action at UFC on ESPN+ 19, which takes place at Amalie Arena and streams on ESPN+. She doesn\u2019t get a pushover in Ribas, who has just one blemish on her record and has a well rounded skillset including a jiu-jitsu black belt.\n\nRibas has said she doesn\u2019t fear a grappling fight. Dern is about as high-level as it gets on the mat, and while she thinks she will ultimately best her opponent, she thinks Ribas is her toughest MMA foe when it comes to jiu-jitsu skills.\n\n\u201cI definitely think grappling is probably like the worst change because that\u2019s my best part,\u201d Dern said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to train a lot of years to get to my experience of grappling, but she is a black belt and I thought of all the girls I fight she would be the only least concerned because she does have that black belt and judo black belt background too. I think of all the girls I fight she\u2019s probably the one who feels the most comfortable if we go to the ground.\u201d\n\nFor more from Dern, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Mackenzie Dern says her body is holding up strong ahead of her octagon return at UFC on ESPN+ 19.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mackenzie-dern-ufc-tampa-open-workouts.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
