On Sunday, Donald Trump said the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, ready to respond to attacks on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia, in which it believes Iran was involved. But warning bells, akin to those used to alert fog-bound mariners steering towards rocks, have been ringing out for months. They have mostly been ignored. The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance, measured in lives and petrodollars, is now coming due.\n\nTrump is even trying to sell the Saudis nuclear technology. What would you think, were you in Iran\u2019s shoes?\n\nIt\u2019s easy and convenient to solely blame Iran, as American and British officials routinely do without conclusive evidence. Rather, it is serial western and regional miscalculations that have drawn us ineluctably into this dread vortex.\n\nHow can disaster be averted? Who can stop a slide into a wider war that could swiftly engulf regional states from Israel to Saudi Arabia, and drag in US, British and maybe even Russian forces? Clues can be found in the mistakes that led to this point. Answers, if they exist, will only come through informed statesmanship of the sort signally lacking so far.\n\nMention of which brings us, first, to Trump and Iran. Tehran\u2019s regime has been viewed as a threat by the US since the 1979 revolution. But it was Trump, with his unrivalled ability to make bad situations worse, who ripped up the Iran nuclear deal on 8 May last year, imposed punitive economic sanctions, and sparked the immediate crisis. His enmity has hurt Iran\u2019s citizens \u2013 but not the regime.\n\nIn erring so idiotically, Trump preferred the advice of his discredited former national security adviser, John Bolton, over the personal pleadings of Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. He also gave short shrift to his chum Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, who made a last-minute dash to Washington. A damaging rift with Europe over Iran began that day.\n\nIran\u2019s fractious, fractured leadership rallied, improbably unified by Trump. Military and clerical hardliners are now taking the fight \u2013 a fight, as they see it, against regime change by the US \u2013 to their enemies, principally the Saudis and Israelis.\n\nOld geopolitical faultlines were recklessly aggravated and inflamed. Any sensible policy would seek to balance the regional claims of Shia Muslim Iran and the Sunni house of Saud. But the west \u2013 turning a blind eye for decades to pitiless autocracy, legalised misogyny and religious bigotry \u2013 has continued to court Riyadh and its corrupting riches.\n\nHere again Trump jumped in, making shockwaves. Not content to cement the Saudi alliance during his first overseas visit as president, Trump made crown prince Mohammed bin Salman his new best friend. When the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents, Trump turned defence attorney. He is even trying to sell Salman nuclear technology. What would you think, were you in Iran\u2019s shoes?\n\nThe failure of US and British leaders, among others, to halt Salman\u2019s disastrous war of choice in Yemen marked another stage in this downward spiral. Ignoring war crimes and what the UN calls a worst-in-the-world humanitarian catastrophe, they continue to peddle arms, advice and diplomatic cover for Riyadh.\n\nWhen the Yemen civil war began in 2015, there was scant evidence of active Iranian military support for the Houthi rebels. Yet now, reacting opportunistically to US attrition, Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards are apparently supplying \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 the drones, missiles and limpet mines used to attack Saudi oil fields, airfields and tankers.\n\nWhat a result. Let\u2019s presume to question the US\u2019s chief diplomat, Mike Pompeo, about this extraordinary own goal. Hey, Mike, how do you turn a disagreement into a war? His answer: punch your opponent into a corner from which he cannot escape. What did Trump, Bolton and CIA director Gina Haspel think would happen when the US shredded the enrichment deal? What\u2019s happening is that Iran is resuming the very activities that so alarm them.\n\nOr here\u2019s a question for another well-known international statesman: Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Is Iran already seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, as you claim \u2013 or are your pressure tactics more or less guaranteeing that it will? If it does, then that, surely, will be in large part thanks to your endless sabre-rattling. How does this make Israel safer?\n\nTrump is seriously, frighteningly unstable - the world is in danger | Robert Reich Read more\n\nThis threat of general conflagration, whipped up by design or sheer incompetence, now overshadows the region as a whole. In the name of repulsing Iran, Israel is almost daily engaged in covert military operations against Tehran\u2019s allies and proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria \u2013 where, shamefully, civil war still rages.\n\nIt gets worse. Reports from Kuwait say the drones that hit the Saudi oil installations at the weekend overflew the country, suggesting they came from Shia militia bases in Iraq. In this developing regional war, Israel and the Saudis are, in effect, on the same side. Iraq\u2019s government wants no part of it. But, thanks to the vacuum left by the US after the 2003-11 occupation, Tehran wields considerable influence in Baghdad.\n\nThe very last thing Iraqis want is the Americans coming back, using their territory as a forward base in a wider Iranian siege. Yet Trump suggested exactly that last year. Can this scenario be ruled out? Not entirely. And so reason takes flight and the maelstrom builds. Urgently needed now are competent leaders who know how to calm a storm before all are sucked under.\n\n\u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s hostility towards Iran has made a delicate situation explosive, says foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall", "authors": ["Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ae54fd7e1392e1cbc5df38abbda0cb7d6bd98c6/0_279_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bc44cef9c3e106d9f7bc61ecd098bd0a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
