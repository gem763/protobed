And they are important, they are the people who are going to inherit the mess we\u2019ve made.\n\nIn an earlier clip released from the interview, Attenborough singled out Australia\u2019s responsibility with the Great Barrier Reef and just how shit a job our recent governments have been doing with that responsibility.\n\nYou can watch the full interview below:", "description": "David Attenborough has praised the efforts of the young kids getting out and striking and protesting over climate change inaction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-24-at-10.05.40-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
