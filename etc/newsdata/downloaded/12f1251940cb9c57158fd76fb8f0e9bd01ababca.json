And they gave us art, sciences, geometry, drama,\u201d he added.\n\nGeographer, writer and Oxford University teacher Nick Middleton cited nomadic communities as an example of a parallel society separated from \u201csettled communities who dominate the planet\u201d.\n\n\u201cGovernments don\u2019t like people who move,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn Europe we have Gypsies who like to move around and governments hate them. They can\u2019t control them, they can\u2019t tax them, but also it\u2019s difficult to educate their children.\u201d\n\nHailing crypto currencies as a tool for breaking free, Rosenberg said the bitcoin, one of the major topics of the congress, was becoming a success story.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching an entire economic system rise out of nothing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe first bitcoin transaction was 10,000 bitcoin for a pizza. Now we\u2019re looking at a global currency that has withstood tremendous attacks, tremendous scorn and hate. And it just keeps going on.\u201d", "description": "Prague (AFP) \u2013 A hackers\u2019 congress in Prague on Friday hailed the new cryptocurrencies as a tool to break free from the constraints of modern", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/788363_paul-rosenberg-founder-cryptohippie-data-protection-company-advocates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
