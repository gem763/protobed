After all, developer The Coalition was reorganised to work on nothing but Gears Of War games.\n\nGears 6 will presumably be a Project Scarlett game though, so you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to hear anything about it yet. But art director Aryan Hanbeck has offered an interesting tease of what the next game might look like.\n\nInterviewed on Iranian podcast Wassup Conversations, as spotted by IGN Australia, Hanbeck stated that a major visual influence is TV show The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\n\u2018One thing \u2013 the guys here will probably laugh if they see this \u2013 but I\u2019ve been telling all the artists non-stop to go watch Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2026 The composition, the colour, and just the cinematography and symbolism is just off the charts,\u2019 said Hanbeck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So, I watched that and I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow we gotta find a way to get more of this stuff in Gears 6.\u2019\n\nGears 5 already departed somewhat from Gears Of War\u2019s famously brown colour scheme, with a wider use of colour and some different architectural styles.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale though makes heavy use of colour coding for different types of characters as well as sporting a very stark style of cinematography, with very precise framing and minimalist, natural lighting.\n\nDespite the colour-coding of outfits the colours for the rest of the show are usually very subdued, creating an almost dreamlike quality \u2013 which is presumably what Hanbeck is interested in.\n\nHe also mentions that, as many guessed, Destiny 2 was an influence for the look of Gears 5, so a serious TV show known for its excellent cinematography is quite a switch.\n\nThe other reason The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is a surprising choice is that Gears Of War\u2019s lore involves some very dubious elements that are rarely mentioned in the games but do come up in the novels.\n\nThe most notorious is the Birthing Creche programme of \u2018breeding farms\u2019, used to repopulate the planet after the initial Locust invasion.\n\nWhether Gears 6 will address this aspect of the lore or if the influence from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is purely visual remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly an interesting choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Gears 5 beats Fortnite as most played game on Xbox One\n\nMORE: Gears 5 review \u2013 does bigger mean better?\n\nMORE: Dave Bautista from Guardians Of The Galaxy to be a playable character in Gears 5", "description": "The first whispers about the next Gears Of War have covered a surprising subject: the fact that the game will be influenced by a TV show.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gears-5-main-930f_1571733240.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
