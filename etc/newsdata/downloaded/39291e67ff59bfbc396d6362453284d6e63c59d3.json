On the one hand, inflatable reservist Mark Francois MP has previously promised that we will leave the EU on 31 October, or \u201cthis country will explode\u201d. On the other hand, Devon-based extremist Katie Hopkins has previously tweeted that we will leave the EU on 31 October, or \u201cI will drink a pot of tea naked in the Apprentice losers cafe with Farage\u2019s face on each nipple.\u201d\n\nWe will not be leaving the EU on 31 October.\n\nAccording to some reports, Brexit coins minted with the 31 October date \u201ccould be worth up to \u00a3800\u201d. So could \u20ac1 coins, soon enough. Still, the cabinet hoarding the misprinted Brexit coins to pay for their skiing holidays would be an irony we could all get behind.\n\nDavid Cameron\u2019s \u2018greased piglet\u2019: a fitting image for the Brexit moment | Marina Hyde Read more\n\nIf you\u2019re keeping track of the accounts, Boris Johnson has just blown \u00a3100m on an ad campaign insisting the UK was leaving on 31 October, even though the chances of this were always so slim they amounted to Conservative party election positioning. Given that seven months ago the prime minister was describing \u00a360m spent on the historical sex abuse inquiry as money \u201cspaffed up a wall\u201d, it\u2019s important that you get his Brexit ads in perspective. They were complete bollocks, and at the same time almost twice as valued as investigating mass institutionalised child rape. It\u2019s a very exciting branding space for the Tories to be in.\n\nStrange to think that, in another timeline, we would all currently be pooling our corned beef and lightbulbs in anticipation of Theresa May\u2019s planned Festival of Brexit. Instead, we\u2019re waiting to see whether the French will give us an election. Yesterday, Boris Johnson told MPs in the Commons tea room that he had asked the French to block the Brexit extension request. In a documentary filmed when he was foreign secretary, Johnson told the cameras that the French were \u201cturds\u201d. So it will be interesting to see which version of our friends and partners turns up. What\u2019s the French for, \u201cYou want picking up in the morning, pal?\u201d\n\nThe prime minister wants a Christmas election, but at present that old Scrooge Jeremy Corbyn won\u2019t give him one. Despite having a deal that parliament merely wished to properly scrutinise, we are told that no-deal plans are being stepped up by Michael Gove (who frequently appears to have been visited by three spirits). \u201cWe are triggering Operation Yellowhammer,\u201d he announced on Sunday. You\u2019re triggering us all, dear.\n\nAnd what if they can\u2019t get an election? Then, like a lot of other comedy shows, the Conservative government has decided to have a strike episode. South Park did one once, where the nation of Canada goes on strike because it feels disrespected by the world.\n\nAs for how the Tory version will play out, instinct suggests you should put your money on \u201cfor mirthless laughs\u201d. We\u2019ll have no choice but to watch Conservative ministers presenting themselves as victims of The Man, which is a bit like Peter Sutcliffe presenting himself as a victim of the Yorkshire Ripper. Consequently, they\u2019ll be forced to band together and take industrial action to protect their way of life. Listen, they just want their dignity. They know that when these jobs go there\u2019ll be nothing else, bar retraining as an arms lobbyist or non-executive director of Goldman Sachs.\n\nSadly, we know from bitter experience the privations of a winter strike for those involved. The Conservatives wisely outlawed sympathy actions in the past, so they won\u2019t face having to go through it without essential auxiliary services such as unwanted child collection and Ocado. But do begin putting aside your spare pennies to buy the young Rees-Moggs footwear, while their da makes soaring speeches behind an SW1 brazier. \u201cMy father went down the money pit, I went down the money pit, and, so help me, my son will have a money pit to go down.\u201d\n\nExcept not. This week, Jacob could be found in the House of Commons, explaining why the withdrawal agreement bill that the government actually had a majority for was suddenly nowhere to be seen, by adapting the famous poem from the Scarlet Pimpernel. \u201cThe answer lies with Sir Percy Blakeney,\u201d he honked of that novel\u2019s hero. \u201cThey seek it here, they seek it there, those parliamentarians seek it everywhere. Is it in heaven, or is it in hell? That damned elusive Brexit bill!\u201d Oh dear. Of course, much to the chagrin of their silly 50-year-old boy, the hugely bourgeois Rees-Moggs would have been entirely safe during the French Revolution. The voluminously suited Jacob\u2019s chief exposure to Sir Percy Blakeney would have run along the lines of the latter\u2019s remark to the ghastly government official Chauvelin: \u201cSink me! Your tailors have betrayed you. T\u2019would serve you better to send them to Madame Guillotine.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s nice to see Jacob disporting himself with the confidence of a man yet to realise Dominic Cummings is building an oubliette for him to spend any election in.\n\nAnd so to that gilet-clad Loki. This week we\u2019ve had so many definitive and yet contradictory anonymous No 10 rants about what fiendish stratagem is next. Yet here we are, in the same place. The October Surprise is that there is no surprise. There are mayflies that survive longer than Cummings\u2019 briefings, which now have a four-hour lifespan yet somehow always achieve their destiny. They are an essential component of a media ecosystem that kind of knows that not signing a mandated letter means jack shit in legal terms, but will write it anyway because their news editor\u2019s Mr Right Now and needs the appearance of fresh meat. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s all retail. Isn\u2019t it?\n\nWith both main party leaders taken up with hourly contradiction, their extravagantly gifted junior troops have been on hand to desecrate the airwaves. Informed by Kay Burley that the polls said Labour wouldn\u2019t win, shadow lord chancellor Richard Burgon retorted: \u201cThe polls said we wouldn\u2019t win last time.\u201d Burley: \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nReposting this exchange, Tory minister Johnny Mercer failed to appreciate his precise comic status as the Tory Burgon. \u201cI sometimes get teased for being thick because I spurned university to join up and serve when I was 19,\u201d Mercer sensationally revealed. \u201cThen I see what a Cambridge degree and career in politics does for this guy and so many others of my colleagues, and think I got it about right.\u201d If you say so yourself. I do enjoy Johnny\u2019s tireless attempts to disguise his raging self-regard as affable humility. His entire output reads like one of those guys who replies to the pictures porn stars tweet: \u201cMornin darlin! All the better for seeing u! Think u posted that one just for me!!!!!\u201d\n\nJennifer Arcuri came late to the party. But the Johnson franchise is unthinkable without her now | Marina Hyde Read more\n\nAll in all, another vintage week in the national journey. We remain in the wandering hands of a government that doesn\u2019t want 16- and 17-year-olds to vote because they aren\u2019t mature enough, but will go on strike if it can\u2019t get its election exactly when it wants it. Meanwhile, 16- and 17- year olds are having to bunk off their childhoods to draw the attention of infantilised adults to the looming risk of ecological and social collapse.\n\nOne month ago, members of Boris Johnson\u2019s government were lining up to tell teenagers that missing one day of school was unacceptable and wrong. Presumably we\u2019ll now hear from those same ministers how missing weeks of your six-figure-salary job running the country is right and heroic. What a time to be existing, when the best escape route feels like giving Xboxes to politicians, and waiting for the nation\u2019s children to grow up.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s latest threat paints his government as a victim, says Guardian columnist Marina Hyde", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f66b46924f5353b2be3a35972a5210d3b92304/0_63_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c728983bb97abc81bf98ea81ab48367c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
