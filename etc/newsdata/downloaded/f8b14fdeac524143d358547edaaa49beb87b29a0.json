With about 900 students attending Pleasant Ridge, this is no easy task, but Cook says he\u2019s ready to \"go big or go home.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t have a lot of kids books,\" said Cook. \"So I put it out on Facebook, I wanted to see if any of my friends had any books that they needed to clean off their bookshelves at home and it kind of spiraled from there.\"\n\nThe amount of feedback Cook received was phenomenal.\n\n\"We\u2019re probably sitting at 450 maybe 500 books,\" he said. There are stacks of books occupying space all over his office.\n\n\"I want to make sure there\u2019s not one single kid that\u2019s going under the radar, I want to make sure that I\u2019m actually saying hey to every kid, talking to every kid, celebrating every kid,\" Cook added. \"I\u2019m never going to stop collecting books.\"", "description": "It's Friday, Sept. 6, 2019.
