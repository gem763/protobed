All of this is gonna look very difficult for the government,\" they said.\n\nAnother Conservative MP, who represents a seat in Scotland, told Business Insider that their preference, along with their colleagues north of the border, was for Johnson to deliver Brexit before the country went to the polls.\n\nTheir warnings come as an influential group of Remainer Tory MPs moved to block Johnson from holding an election.\n\nUp to 20 of the \"One Nation\" group of moderate Conservative MPs, led by former prime ministers David Lidington and Damian Green, plan to vote against an election, according to a Telegraph report.\n\nAt least 41 of One Nation group met with the deputy chief whip Amanda Milling this weekend to say they did not want an election.\n\nThere is scepticism among Conservative MPs that the party will return a majority at the next election, despite most opinion polls giving Johnson a comfortable lead over Corbyn's Labour.\n\nIn particular, they fear that the government's plan to target Brexit-voting Labour seats would not be enough to offset its losses in Scotland and the south, where many constituencies voted against Brexit in 2016.\n\nAn MP who sits as an independent after losing the Conservative whip last month said: \"They [Downing Street] believe that Boris is an electoral genius and they'll be able to frame the choice as Corbyn versus Johnson and walk it.\n\n\"But they're underestimating the Lib Dems and the number of seats they'll lose in Scotland.\"\n\nThey added: \"For them, it all depends on these northern Leave voters \u2014 but there just aren't that many [winnable] northern seats.\n\nThere just aren't that many [winnable] northern seats... They hate the Tories fundamentally and it will take generations to change - Conservative MP.\n\n\"Some of them [seats] are hopeless. They hate the Tories fundamentally and it will take generations for that to change.\"\n\nAnother concern is that Leave voters will punish the party if they have failed to deliver on its promises, especially after Johnson was forced this week to abandon his \"do-or-die\" pledge to deliver Brexit by October 31.\n\nA former Conservative minister told Business Insider: \"They'll jump to the Brexit Party if it's [the election] is before a deal.\"\n\nConservatives warn Johnson to expect a Remain backlash\n\nThe Conservative Party is currently on an average of 36% in the opinion polls, with Labour trailing far behind on 24% and the Liberal Democrats on 18%.\n\nWhile the numbers look good for the Tories, a number of strategic issues could work against them, one of which is tactical voting by Remain voters.\n\nLib Dem MP Heidi Allen has already launched a cross-party organisation called Unite to Remain which is in talks with pro-Remain parties about work together at the next election.\n\nThe People's Vote campaign, a well-funded campaign group for second referendum, is preparing to launch a tactical voting website of its own, designed to limit the number of pro-Brexit MPs winning seats. Pro-Remain group Best For Britain is developing a similar tool.\n\nOne MP who lost the Conservative whip last month said: \"I think the party is in danger of underestimating the impact of tactical voting.\"\n\nThey added: \"The typical Westminster view is, well the Conservatives are on 35 or 36 points, Labour is on 24, the Liberals are on 20, so the Conservative party wins, because of a split opposition,\" the MP said.\n\n\"But the problem for the Conservatives is where the Liberals are strong, Labour is very weak. And where Labour is strong, almost invariably the Liberals are very weak. So there is almost a natural opportunity for tactical voting.\"", "description": "Conservative Members of Parliament speak out to Business Insider about their fears over the outcome of the upcoming general election.", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db31737dee019314b3f6308?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
