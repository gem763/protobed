A Simmons College of Kentucky spokesperson confirmed that they received the money, but college officials have not said what will be done with it. An announcement is planned for Thursday, college spokesperson said.\n\nThe original donation funding the $2,000 awards that paid for student living expense was pulled because of what officials at Simmons College of Kentucky seemed to decline the donation from Papa John's in light of a $1 million donation from John Schnatter, the Papa Johns founder who resigned as the company CEO after making racist remarks. The story was first reported by the Courier Journal.\n\nThe unexpected withdrawal of the scholarships was announced at about the same time as Schnatter's pledge. The move ushered him back into the spotlight after he resigned amid backlash for publically criticizing the NFL and his use of a racial slur more than a year ago.\n\nThe donation from the pizza franchise, according to the school, was supposed to cover living expenses, such as food and housing. The students were notified by The Rev. Dr. Kevin W. Cosby, the college president, that the funds were revoked,\n\nThe question of who was responsible for pulling the money from the 10 students pitted Papa John's against Simmons officials. Simmons said it declined to take money from Papa Johns only after being pressured by company officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original donation funding the $2,000 awards that paid for costs like housing and books was pulled because of what officials at Simmons College of Kentucky called a conflict of interest that was created when the school accepted a $1 million donation from John Schnatter, the Papa Johns founder who resigned as the company CEO after making racist remarks.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Cosby had claimed that the withdrawal of the funds was a direct attack on the students.\n\n\"It felt as though someone has taken weapons of mass destruction and flown them into the hopes and dreams and aspirations of some of America\u2019s most vulnerable students,\" Cosby said.\n\nA Simmons spokeswoman said the school meant only to delay the scholarships and school officials were acting under pressure from Papa John\u2019s diversity director. The school spokeswoman says the company was made uncomfortable by Schnatter\u2019s donation. Meanwhile, a Papa John\u2019s spokeswoman had denied that and said the school\u2019s rejection was unexpected.\n\nIn emails sent from the school to the company and shared with FOX Business, it appears that the college is actively declining the money.\n\n\"In light of recent news, it is best to decline your scholarships at this time and perhaps look at other ways to partner in the future,\" Von Purdy, Simmons director of development, wrote.\n\nA Simmons spokesperson said the word choice in the email was made after earlier phone calls from Papa Johns that pressured college officials to return the money.\n\nIn an email response to the school, a Papa John's official seems to agree that they don't want the company and Schnatter to be conflated.\n\n\"We completely understand the conflict of interest here between John Schnatter's donation to Simmons and the relationship between the Papa John's brand and the college,\" Victoria Russell Chief of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion of Papa John\u2019s wrote. \"Thank you for being proactive in sending this and clearly separating John and the brand.\"\n\nSchnatter stepped down as CEO of the Louisville-based pizza chain in 2017 after blaming disappointing sales on the NFL player protests. He later resigned as its chairman after using the N-word during a company conference call.\n\nSchnatter told FOX Business earlier this month in an exclusive interview that he resigned because he was ready to retire.\n\n\u201cI was not forced to retire,\u201d he told Maria Bartiromo on \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d, adding, \u201cwe had a fantastic nine-year run. We took the stock from about $6.40 a share at almost 80 bucks. And so good run, good fun, good time -- we were ready to go.\u201d\n\nSchnatter had said his comments regarding the NFL were \u201cmisconstrued\u201d and that the company was at fault for not correcting the record.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI would have liked [NFL Commissioner] Roger Goodell just to fix the problem. Remember, a third of our budget was the NFL\" Schnatter said. \"So when the ratings I think were down some 20 percent ... it was hurting our business, it was hurting our franchisees, it was hurting our small business owners.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the conference call, Schnatter added that his words \u201cgot twisted.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nJulia Limitone contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Papa Johns and that the pizza-delivery company has given Simmons College of Kentucky $30,000, a confirmation from the college that the money was received and a clarification about why it seems like the college proactively declined Papa John's original donation.", "description": "The state's only historically black college and the American pizza franchise are trying to figure out is who responsible for revoking scholarships.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/papa-johns-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
