No doubt that a successful deal will not only benefit both the major economies of the worlds that started this 15-month long tussle; but will also save other economies of the world from more damage. I find that the steady gold prices look evident enough to move more upward due to growing fear of global economic slowdown, if this tariff trade tussle is not resolved shortly.\n\nFinally, I conclude that a steep downward move of S&P 500 Index below the level of 2957 will confirm the continuity of this exhaustive move up to the level of 2828.\n\nWatch my video on S&P 500 futures below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MFsqVY1QhC8\n\nS&P 500 - Daily Chart\n\nS&P 500 - 4 Hr.
