That is, until Aukerman convinced him otherwise.\n\nFor example, Galifianakis balked at asking Natalie Portman: \u201cYou shaved your head in 'V for Vendetta,' did you also shave your V for vagina?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that that question was too much. I actually asked them to edit that out,\u201d Galifianakis says.\n\nAfter that interview, the \u201cFerns\u201d co-creators developed a \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d dynamic, as Aukerman puts it. \u201cHe reads the paper and goes, \u2018Oh, I'm not going to say this,\u2019 and then looks to me,\" and Aukerman will adamantly insist Galifianakis ask the question.\n\nThis happened in 2014 when he interviewed Barack Obama and asked, \u201cHow does it feel to be the last black president?\u201d\n\nSome guests, including Hillary Clinton, worry how they'll come off\n\n\u201cFerns\u201d rules require guests to come on the show without knowing the questions beforehand. When the camera rolls, Galifianakis improvises and riffs on prewritten questions. Celebrities just have to react.\n\nAhead of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp wanted the nominee to do a \u201cFerns\u201d interview, but \u201cthey didn't want to do it the way that we normally do,\u201d with Clinton going into the interview blind. Aukerman refused and Clinton ultimately agreed to his terms.\n\nBut her team was scared about how it would turn out.\n\n\u201cPeople get really worried about (the interview), and then you put it out and they love it,\" Auckerman said.\n\nBernie Sanders passed on an interview; Oprah and Elton John pulled out last minute\n\n\u201cWe asked Bernie Sanders to do one and he said no,\u201d says Galifianakis, who appreciated that the politician wouldn't try to win over voters with an off-brand comedy video. \u201cI respected him so much for that.\u201d\n\nLess than appreciated: When representatives ask to get their celebrity client on the show, and the star ultimately passes after planning has begun. According to Aukerman, that happened with Oprah Winfrey and Elton John.\n\nWhile shooting More\n\n'Ferns' creators don\u2019t take notes from stars, with a couple of exceptions\n\nThe Obama jokes had to be cleared by his speechwriters beforehand.\n\n\u201cThat's the one that we sort of struck a compromise,\" says Aukerman, who understood that an exception could be made for the commander in chief.\n\nAnd when it came to the 2011 Jennifer Aniston interview, Galifianakis ultimately felt bad about the plan to surprise her with a Brad Pitt lookalike on camera. He asked her beforehand if she was OK with it, and, as Aukerman recalls, \u201cShe, I think rightly, was like, \u2018It's not that I don't think it's funny. It's just anything that continues this conversation about me and Brad Pitt just prolongs me having to talk about it.\u2019 And so we said no.\u201d\n\nThe theme song became a thorny issue\n\nFun fact: The \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d theme is actually taken from a certain famous 1976 Robert De Niro movie. Aukerman didn't know that 11 years ago, when the music became part of the first \u201cFerns\u201d episode.", "description": "With the arrival of Netflix's 'Between Two Ferns: The Movie,' Zach Galifianakis and Scott Aukerman share insider dish about the celebrity interviews.", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GV9_OEd6xTNtIXDN6A1aTA--~B/aD00OTc5O3c9ODIxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/6395d164369ceda8f33b1ed06ad9ee01", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
