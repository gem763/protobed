The euro also extended gains against the British unit.\n\n\"A sense of rational optimism around Brexit has given way to more uncertainty as to the pound, and UK risk markets were roiled\" by the prospect of an election, said AxiTrader analyst Stephen Innes.\n\nHe added that a national vote would amount to a referendum on Johnson's Brexit strategy.\n\nEquity markets were fluctuating through the morning as investors keep an eye on the events in Westminster, while also awaiting the latest developments in the China-US trade talks.\n\nOptimism that the two economic superpowers will hammer out details for a mini agreement by next month have helped support equities this week.\n\n- Bump in the road -\n\nHowever, there remain concerns that the talks could be derailed at the last minute, with the passage of a US bill defending civil rights in Hong Kong the latest bump in the road.\n\nThe law would end the Hong Kong-US special trading status unless the State Department certifies annually that city authorities are respecting human rights and the rule of law.\n\nSenators are due to agree to the legislation, following their colleagues in the House of Representatives, but China has threatened to retaliate if it becomes law.\n\nAdding to the mix were comments from Vice President Mike Pence, who vowed support for Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters and hit out at China's trading behaviour.\n\n\"The real catalyst for rising US-China risk is the senate vote of the Hong Kong bill. China has already said it will retaliate once the bill is passed,\" said Rodrigo Catril at National Australia Bank.\n\nHowever, he did point out that in the past \"the US and China have isolated issues from the broader tariff negotiation, Huawei for example\".\n\n\"While the Hong Kong issue is exponentially larger than Huawei, until more clarity unfolds this could be compartmentalised away from trade talks along with the growing laundry list of US grievances against China.\"\n\nHong Kong and Shanghai each fell 0.5 percent in the morning session while Tokyo went into the break flat.\n\nSeoul was marginally down, with Taipei and Jakarta both 0.2 percent off but Sydney, Singapore and Wellington were in positive territory.\n\n- Key figures around 0230 GMT -\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: FLAT at 22747.08 (break)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.5 percent at 26,668.42\n\nShanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.5 percent at 2,925.05\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 86.46 pence from 86.41 pence at 2045 GMT\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2844 from $1.2846\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 108.64 yen from 108.66 yen\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1105 from $1.1101\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 20 cents at $56.03 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN 22 cents at $61.45 per barrel\n\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.1 percent at 26,805.53 (close)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.9 percent at 7,328.25 (close)", "description": "Sterling struggled to bounce back from losses owing to renewed Brexit uncertainty after Boris Johnson proposed a general election to resolve the long-running saga, while Asian markets were mostly down after a broadly positive week.
