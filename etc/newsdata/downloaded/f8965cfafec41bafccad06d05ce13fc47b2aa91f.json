With Diwali celebration over the weekend, the pressure was even higher and everyone was crumbling to keep up their social game. Luckily, we had a few tricks to champion over others in the race for the most likes. Here's how you can try them too:\n\nDitch the DSLR\n\nYou don\u2019t need a DSLR to capture your festive moments, just the right smartphone. Our device \u2013 went with the OnePlus 7T Pro Mclaren Edition. The fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor and 90Hz refresh rate make sure you can go click all night long without the phone getting hanged. And the three-camera setup of 48MP + 16 MP + 8MP is just what you need. It also features a 16MP pop-up selfie camera.\n\nKnow Your Smartphone\n\nThe key to capturing the finest pictures is to know the different modes available on your smartphone and making the most of it. The OnePlus 7T Pro Mclaren Edition features several options like the portrait mode, the nightscape mode 2.0, the Pro mode and even an Ultra Shot mode.\n\nThe portrait mode adds the bokeh effect that blurs the background and adds a dept to the images. Keep your hands steady and identify your subject in the pictures, just like we did for the below image.\n\nDon't Miss 322 SHARES 296 SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 1.2 K SHARES\n\nIf you going for a low-light click, don\u2019t worry, the nightscape mode will do the trick. You wouldn\u2019t even need to turn the flash on.\n\nGroup Shots Can Look Good Too!\n\nThe best part about the OnePlus 7T Pro is the wide-angle option available in all the modes. From a portrait to a landscape click, the camera captures the depth in a 117 degrees field of view, giving you the best results. We went wide to capture the complete rangoli for this shot and it looks pretty flawless to us.\n\nYou can also use the wide-angle mode for all your group selfies as well. If there are more people or simply want to add a picturesque landscape to your selfie, use the wide-angle shot.\n\nIt\u2019s All In The Macro Details\n\nThe macro mode lets you go close to any subject and capture it without moving out of focus. The details are clear and the shot doesn\u2019t lose its clarity, keeping the image a high resolution hit.\n\nLiked the features? Go try them and let us know what worked best for you!", "description": "In the age of Insta-like and Insta-followers, everyone wants to know that one trick that\u2019ll take them a notch higher than the others on the social media ladder.
