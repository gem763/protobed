He is really the supervillain. He's the one who really gets under Bond's skin. He's a nasty piece of work,' she told Empire magazine.\n\nBad guy: Rami Malek's Bond villain will be a 'nasty piece of work' it has been claimed; seen in early October in Malibu\n\nBond will have his hands full: James Bond will again be played by Daniel Craig\n\nMalek, 38, previously revealed that he wanted an assurance from director Cary Joji Fukunaga that his villain would not be a religious fundamentalist or an Arabic-speaking terrorist, and he cited his pride in his Egyptian heritage as the reasoning behind his stance.\n\nHe said: 'It's a great character and I'm very excited. But that was one thing I discussed with Cary. I said, \"We cannot identify him with any act of terrorism reflecting an ideology or a religion.\n\n'\"That's not something I would entertain, so if that is why I am your choice then you can count me out.\" But that was clearly not his vision. So he's a very different kind of terrorist.'\n\nStraight from her mouth: The Bohemian Rhapsody star will play evil Safin in upcoming espionage blockbuster No Time to Die and producer Barbara Broccoli (pictured this month) has claimed the big screen baddie will be more than a match for Daniel Craig's 007\n\nThe star also admitted that he feels pressure starring in a Bond film, describing it as 'something we all grow up with' and praised the writing team behind No Time to Die.\n\nHe added: 'It's another extremely clever script from the people who have figured out exactly what people want in these movies.\n\n'But I feel a substantial weight on my shoulders. I mean, Bond is something that we all grow up with.'\n\nIt was confirmed on Friday that film has wrapped, as the official 'James Bond' Twitter account posted a picture of Joji Fukunaga and Craig together.\n\nThe tweet read: 'That's a wrap on #NoTimeToDie. See you in cinemas April 2020.'", "description": "The Bohemian Rhapsody star will play evil Safin in upcoming espionage blockbuster No Time to Die and producer Barbara Broccoli has claimed the baddie will be more than a match for Bond.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/19/20293838-0-image-a-10_1572292083594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
