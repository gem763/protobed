The three BDU-33s, non-explosive ordnance designed to simulate M1a-82 bombs, fell somewhere off Highway 129 near Suwannee Springs in northern Florida.\n\nWhile the dummy bombs were inert, they did include a pyrotechnic charge that could be dangerous if mishandled.\n\nA bird strike, a problem that has cost the Air Force millions of dollars over the years, was identified as the cause of the accidental weapons release in July. It is currently unclear what caused Thursday's incident.\n\nNOW WATCH: The Air Force's A-10 Warthog targets ISIS fighters with this massive gatling gun", "description": "It happened again.
