I have to keep working hard in every training session, every game. Every game I want to prove myself to the gaffer,\u201d he said.\n\nWolves coach Nune Espirito Santo was deeply disappointed by his side\u2019s performance, which featured plenty of slick passing but very little in the way of defensive stability.\n\n\u201cThat was a bad, bad performance. We started the game well but the mistakes we made, we cannot go and repeat them. We know they cannot happen again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was defensive errors, the game changed with the goal. We lost concentration. I am dissatisfied. There is no point being angry at them, but I need them to get better.\u201d\n\nChelsea, who host Liverpool next week, are up to sixth on eight points while Wolves, who visit Crystal Palace looking for their first win of the season, are 19th on three points.", "description": "Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham scored a superb hat-trick as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-2 in their Premier League clash on Saturday, spoiling the home side's celebration of the 130th anniversary of their Molineux Stadium.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429840631&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0LD", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
