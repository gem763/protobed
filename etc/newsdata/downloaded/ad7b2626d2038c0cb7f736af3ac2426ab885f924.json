She was very popular, and all the guys thought she was the hottest girl in our grade.\n\n\u2018I thought she was really pretty, and I must have been crazy, but I decided I\u2019d ask her to the school dance.\n\n\u2018It was my final year of school, and I just thought \u201cwhy not?\u201d. I was anticipating for her to reject me straight away and just laugh in my face.\n\n\u2018But amazingly, she said yes, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was so excited for the dance that I bought a new suit, got a haircut and hired a limo.\n\n\u2018I wanted to impress her. I nervously drove to her house, walked up and rang the bell. She opened it and just said \u201csorry, you\u2019re too fat to fit through the door\u201d and slammed the door in my face.\n\nAnthony now has his own personal training company (Picture: TRANSFORM YOUR FUTURE / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\u2018I was heartbroken. I went back to the limo and cried my eyes out. But then I gathered myself, and thought well, you have a suit on so you might as well go to the dance.\n\n\u2018But I had a terrible time, and everyone laughed and bullied me when they found out what happened. It was horrible.\n\n\u2018I sank into a major depression after that, which lasted years after high school ended. I never thought anyone could love me and that I\u2019d be alone forever.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony believes his weight gain was down to an \u2018addiction\u2019 to fast food.\n\nIn his teens he would have two footlong meatball subs with a large bottle of coke for breakfast, a KFC burger meal from KFC and a pack of Magnum ice creams for lunch, and two large pizzas plus another two-litre bottle of coke for dinner \u2013 meaning he was consuming around 10,000 calories per day.\n\nIn 2014 Anthony was told he was on the verge of developing type two diabetes. That urged him to make a change.\n\nA day in Anthony's diet: Anthony\u2019s diet before: Breakfast: Two footlong meatball subs and a two-litre bottle of coke\n\nLunch: A large KFC burger box meal and a four-pack of Magnum ice creams\n\nDinner: Two large pepperoni pizzas from Domino\u2019s Anthony\u2019s diet after his transformation: Breakfast: Oats with a scoop of protein power and one banana and two cups of green tea\n\nLunch: Red meat with green vegetables and brown rice\n\nDinner: Grilled chicken with mixed vegetables and brown rice\n\nOccasional dessert: Halo Top choc mint ice cream\n\nHe said: \u2018I didn\u2019t know how to eat properly and didn\u2019t care. I was addicted to fast food.\n\n\u2018I never thought about my health until my doctor said I was about to get diabetes. I broke down in tears and realised I needed to change my life.\n\n\u2018I stopped eating fast food and began cooking for myself. I also stepped foot into a gym for the first time back in 2014 and haven\u2019t looked back.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter overhauling his life and improving his health, Anthony was still shocked to be contacted by the girl who ditched him for being overweight.\n\n\u2018I was always rejected and would get laughed at when I approached girls,\u2019 says Anthony. \u2018But now women are asking me on dates all the time.\n\n\u2018I went from having three matches on Tinder when I was fat, to now having over 1,000 matches with girls. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nThe text from the girl who initially rejected Anthony when he was overweight (Picture: TRANSFORM YOUR FUTURE / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\u2018Then about a year ago, that same girl who was so cruel to me before our school formal, somehow got my number through my Instagram page and sent me a text apologising for being a bully and asked if we could go on a date.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe it and didn\u2019t even reply. I\u2019ll forgive, but I would never forget.\u2019\n\nAnthony now hopes to support others on a journey towards improving their health, and has since opened his own personal training business called Transform Your Future.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve gone through a lot, but my experiences have made me the man I am today,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018My message is to just never give up, even when everything seems hopeless.\n\n\u2018My goal now is to help others who have been through the same things I have. If I can do it, anyone can do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I feel so much happier about life and I\u2019m looking forward to the future.\u2019\n\nMORE: Obesity is \u2018not down to a lack of willpower\u2019\n\nMORE: So you want to get a friendship tattoo?
