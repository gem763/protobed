This is crystalized while looking towards its hash rate \u2013 a metric that is often considered a key indicator of network strength \u2013 which just set a fresh all-time-high yesterday.\n\nAccording to data from Blockchain.com, BTC\u2019s hash rate hit highs of over 98 million tera-hashes per second (TH/s) yesterday, which marks a sharp increase from its annual lows of just over 30 million TH/s that were set in December when the crypto was trading in the lower-$3,000 region.\n\nBecause the cryptocurrency is currently expressing significantly robust technical strength, it is highly likely that its price will soon reflect this, which could lead to an influx of new market participants.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "The CME is now opening that gates for traders to begin holding a significantly higher number of open Bitcoin (BTC) contracts than is currently allowed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-price-cme-futures-gap-shutterstock_1064227739-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
