He was held without bail, awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. On August 10, Epstein died by suicide at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center.\n\nIn his career as a financier, Epstein met and developed ties to some of the world's most famous names, like Bill Gates, as well as people like MIT's Marvin Minsky and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman. In a New Yorker report published over the weekend, Gates was connected to Epstein through a donation to MIT.\n\nBut Epstein's arrest in July wasn't his first encounter with law enforcement. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl, and federal agents originally sought to connect him to the sexual abuse of nearly 40 girls. He served 13 months in a Florida jail before being released on probation.", "description": "The private dinners, known informally as the \"billionaires' dinners,\" are held by the New York literary agent John Brockman.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.cOAOkmkKMHaqXduWQ4WBg--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/4eb5023ca0bcba8554be362420c6de60", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
