He will not have needed exhaustive entries. It wasn't that sort of game.\n\nBig men, kicking, mostly. With 30 minutes remaining the amount of football had already exceeded that played in England's meeting with New Zealand the previous day.\n\nEddie Jones wouldn't have minded that. He would have appreciated the absence of surprise in this match, too, and its bruising, competitive closeness. Maybe he will have approved of the outcome, also.\n\nEddie Jones (in white cap) was in the stands to see South Africa overcome Wales on Sunday\n\nSouth Africa managed to come out on top in what was a bruising encounter on Sunday\n\nAn England-Wales final could have been quite random, the way meetings between the nations often are. And Warren Gatland is a wily competitor, as he proved with the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand.\n\nHe has a way of staying in games that lends itself to unpredictability; much as Wales did here. With an injury list mounting game by game - two off in the first-half on Sunday, to add to the five first-team names already down - somehow Wales contrived to tie the scores 16-16 with 15 minutes remaining. It was a magnificent feat of endurance, even if it didn't always make for the most scintillating entertainment.\n\nYet Gatland also has a track record of narrow defeats in this tournament, and so it proved once more. The difference between extra-time and a place in the cursed bronze final was prop Dillon Lewis coming in at the side.\n\nJerome Garces gave the dreaded signal and Handre Pollard maintained his 100 per cent record with the boot. There were four minutes remaining. Against a team as physically resilient as South Africa, it was never likely to be enough.\n\nA World Cup final in Yokohama against Wales would have been an awkward one for England\n\nJones is too canny to say this is the final he wanted, but perhaps this was the final he thought he would get. There has been a lot of discussion about hotel allocation since the semi-finalists were known, how much is decided by team pecking order - New Zealand at the top, obviously, getting first choice - how much by edicts from World Rugby.\n\nJones always maintained that England's presence in Tokyo Disneyland before their semi-final was not his doing. It is noticeable, however, that this week England will decamp to the central Tokyo accommodation that has been occupied by South Africa since before their quarter-final with Japan.\n\nDid England, who are believed to be ranked above the Springboks by whatever means World Rugby have of deciding these things, have a say in this decision? And did Jones have a hunch South Africa might be his final opponents, so wanted to remove them from their comfort zone? Never underestimate the world of marginal gains.\n\nEither way, Jones will certainly have been pleased with the run-out the Springboks received, man of the match Pollard even admitting that his team never felt comfortable, despite looking stronger in the opening half.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland is a wily competitor, as he proved with the Lions in New Zealand\n\nRassie Erasmus, South Africa's coach, spoke of his admiration for Gatland and his fear that, somehow, Wales were going to find a way to win in the end. This is, after all, a man who coached the British and Irish Lions to a drawn series in New Zealand having led for three minutes of 240 across three Tests.\n\nThere is no doubt that Gatland is capable of extraordinary feats and it is fitting that his final match will be against the nation Jones referred to as the gods of the game, New Zealand, in Tokyo on Friday. The third-fourth place play off is never where a nation wishes to be, few games are memorable, and many are tame, second-rate, second-string affairs.\n\nPitting Gatland against his native country, however, is befitting and even if the 80 minutes are more ceremonial than fiercely competitive, it at least allows him to depart with honour. It will be Steve Hansen's final game as All Blacks coach, too.\n\nGatland spoke of staying in the arm wrestle with South Africa and that is pretty much what it was. A physical tussle, lacking great skill or inspiration, and scant spectacle for long periods. The Springboks won because Pollard's kicking was faultless and, for their try, powerful centre Damian de Allende refused to be stopped.\n\nEngland can now prepare for a physical encounter against the imposing Springboks next week\n\nWales stayed in it because Alun Wyn Jones made a wonderfully brave call to take a scrum on the five metre line rather than kick for the posts, a decision that pulled his team level against all expectations. It was bold because South Africa's scrum had to that point been on top, and Erasmus had recently introduced fresh bodies each one seemingly taller than the last.\n\nThey looked like those giant figures that used to reduce the It's A Knockout commentators to hysterics; awkward mountains of men. The put-in at line-outs these days are practiced by aiming the ball at a coach who stands on top of a ladder. Not a small one, either. Not the type one might use to change a light bulb. Bigger than that.\n\nSo Jones knows what is coming this weekend. A big match, against big men, with big physicality. 'If you can draw a line in the sand and take your opponent backwards, you're winning those small battles,' said try scorer de Allende. But there will be nothing small about Saturday's final, off the field, or on it.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE YOKOHAMA STADIUM: The gentleman in the Houston Texans baseball cap sat in the stand scribbling his notes.
