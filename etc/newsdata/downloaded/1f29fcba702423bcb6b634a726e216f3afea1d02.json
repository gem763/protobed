The future of the imperial family for coming generations rests instead on the shoulders of his nephew, 13-year-old Hisahito, who is second in line for the throne after his father, Prince Akishino.\n\nNaruhito's grandfather, Hirohito, in whose name Japanese troops fought World War Two, was treated as a god but renounced his divine status after Japan's defeat in 1945. Emperors now have no political authority.\n\nThough many Japanese welcomed the enthronement ceremony, some shrugged it off as a nuisance.\n\n\"There is no need for such an elaborate ceremony. Traffic has been restricted and it is causing inconvenience for ordinary people,\" said Yoshikazu Arai, 74, a retired surgeon.\n\n\"The emperor is necessary now as a symbol of the people, but at some point, the emperor will no longer be necessary. Things will be just fine without an emperor.\"", "description": "Japanese Emperor Naruhito formally proclaimed his ascendancy to the throne on Tuesday in a centuries-old ceremony attended by dignitaries from more than 180 countries, pledging to fulfil his duty as a symbol of the state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/94/46/1000x563_cmsv2_f7c875db-c22d-5e68-95ea-7dd28cf4e5ea-4249446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
