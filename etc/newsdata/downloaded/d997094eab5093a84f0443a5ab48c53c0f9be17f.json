Young people are leading transformative movements on climate change, gun control, police brutality and criminal justice that are reverberating in the halls of Congress and the White House.\n\nThis burst of political energy belies a deeper and more profound observation: Adolescence itself is a period of great promise. And with thoughtful policymaking at the local, state and federal levels, we can better realize its potential.\n\nExtensive research conducted over the past decade illustrates that adolescents experience transformative cognitive, social and neurobiological changes during this period in their lives. They are primed to build lasting relationships with peers and adults, shape their identities, lead activist causes and recover from past adversity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith adolescents representing a quarter of the entire population in the United States, policies that harness their emerging creativity, independence and problem-solving skills can have transformative effects. That\u2019s a message reinforced in a recently issued landmark study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\nLegislators at all levels, including the House Committee on Education and Labor, and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, have an opportunity in the coming budget year to invest in programs and interventions that nurture the developmental opportunities of adolescence.\n\nIn the process, we cannot lose sight of the fact that too many of our young people are unable to reap these developmental benefits due to severe economic, social and structural disadvantages \u2014 and the associated risks, pressures and stresses that come with them. These differences in opportunity lie at the root of enduring racial and socioeconomic disparities in academic attainment, mental health, economic security and even mortality rates, not only in adolescence, but well into adulthood.\n\nAs we invest in youth-serving systems and align them with what we know about adolescence, we must make sure they can also begin to address these core disparities. If we do not, we miss a critical opportunity to develop our nation\u2019s human capital \u2014 and we also run the risk of deepening inequity.\n\nAdolescence is a time when we can bolster our investments and elevate young people\u2019s future trajectories \u2013 in health, education, employment and personal growth \u2013 for the better. This is a message that should have bipartisan appeal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFortunately, decades of research have identified policies and programs that are proven to generate positive outcomes and can help reverse this trend, allowing all adolescents to flourish.\n\nWith dedicated federal assistance and investments, states and localities should expand access to hands-on, applied curricula that nurture adolescents\u2019 social-emotional and decision-making capabilities. And they can empower school and district leaders to build supportive school climates that prioritize long-lasting, meaningful adult relationships.\n\nOur legislators can promote closer collaboration with health care providers in an effort to build an integrated, comprehensive system that enables all young people to access physical, behavioral and mental health supports during a critical period of their development.\n\nIn conjunction with local and state law enforcement, federal policymakers can fund promising practices that address enduring disparities in the justice system, which intensify during adolescence. From expanding access to supportive familial relationships and relevant educational experiences to reducing the use of solitary confinement, we can nurture teens\u2019 healthy development.\n\nBy empowering our youth-serving systems with, and investing in, proven policies and practices that realize the often-unfulfilled promise of adolescence, we can strengthen the well-being of our nation as a whole.\n\nRichard Bonnie is the Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law and director of the Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy at the University of Virginia.
