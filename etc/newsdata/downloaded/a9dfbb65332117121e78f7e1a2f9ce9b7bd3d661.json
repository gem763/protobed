Firms were reluctant to hire new staff, the survey found, leading to the slowest increase in job creation since January 2015.\n\nSimon Wells, the chief European economist at HSBC, said: \u201cToday\u2019s PMIs make grim reading, particularly for Germany. Since the peak of the German manufacturing PMI in December 2017 there have been a few occasions where signs of stabilisation have been snuffed out.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cThe latest falls have added a new leg down after a period of relative stability since the end of the first quarter. With the PMIs now signalling a deeper German manufacturing contraction and increasingly showing the manufacturing sector infecting the service sector, the risk of outright German recession is high.\u201d\n\nIHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said Germany was likely to avoid a repeat of the 0.1% decline in gross domestic product during the second quarter if firms continued to work through backlogs of orders to keep staff busy while new orders dried up.\n\nHe said third-quarter GDP was on course to rise by 0.1%, though with momentum weakening as the quarter closed.\n\n\u201cThe goods-producing sector is going from bad to worse, suffering its steepest downturn since 2012, but a further worrying trend is the broadening out of the malaise to the service sector, where the rate of growth has now slowed to one of the weakest since 2014,\u201d he said.", "description": "German private sector shrinks, contributing to wider manufacturing recession", "authors": ["Phillip Inman", "Hans-Werner Sinn", "Yanis Varoufakis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19cd22590195de67d4bfed0fa9e3f0013563667/0_191_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6570580eb2d6a968e9a7c6e527f6b6de", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
