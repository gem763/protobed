The consumer group estimated that Barclays has closed 481 sites during that period \u2013 33 per cent of its network \u2013 although the bank has refused to disclose an official figure.\n\nOne in ten free cash machines also closed or started charging customers between January 2018 and May 2019.\n\nIn July this year MPs on the Treasury Select Committee called for banks to pay for Britain's 11,500 Post Offices to act as proxy branches.\n\nThey criticised the Government for failing to hold banks to account for leaving millions of rural customers without some basic banking services.When banks close branches they typically point customers towards local Post Offices as many offer simple cash and cheque services.\n\nBarclays said customers will still be able to deposit cheques and cash and check balances \u2013 but will not be able to withdraw money with debit cards. Customers can currently take out up to \u00a3300 a day over the counter using their card.\n\nA small number of customers with a special cheque book may still be able to access cash, but those with ordinary cheque books will not, Barclays added.\n\nBarclays said customers will still be able to deposit cheques and cash and check balances \u2013 but will not be able to withdraw money with debit cards\n\nNatalie Ceeney, of the Access to Cash Review, said: 'The cash system that supports communities must be cherished, not undermined. It is for that reason that I urge Barclays to reconsider.'\n\nMartyn James, of complaints service Resolver, added: 'In doing this, Barclays is putting profits before its customers. Access to cash is essential to people, especially the elderly or vulnerable.' Last year Barclays Group made \u00a33.5billion in profit before tax. The bank's chief executive Jes Staley earned \u00a33.4million, down \u00a3500,000 on the previous year because his bonus was docked after he tried to unmask a whistleblower.\n\nBarclays was one of the banks hardest hit by the PPI scandal and has paid out \u00a39.2billion since 2011.\n\nIt is expected to pay out another \u00a3360million, but could be forced to increase this if the number of genuine victims is higher than expected.\n\nBarclays denied its decision was to do with cost-cutting and said it was investing in schemes to help its customers access their cash. Last night the bank pledged not to close any more branches in remote areas, or where it is the last bank in town, for the next two years.\n\nIn July this year MPs on the Treasury Select Committee called for banks to pay for Britain's 11,500 Post Offices to act as proxy branches\n\nIt will also introduce a cashback scheme in 200 locations in January, which will allow customers in remote areas to withdraw cash from local businesses. The Post Office is expected to make an announcement on the changes this week.\n\nThe Mail is campaigning to save rural post offices and the services they offer to remote communities.\n\nAdam Rowse, managing director of branch-based banking for Barclays, said: 'By maintaining last-in-town or remote branches over the next two years, and working with the community, we hope to increase demand and keep these branches viable.'\n\nA spokesman for banking trade body UK Finance said: 'The industry is committed to ensuring access to cash remains free and widely accessible for those that continue to need it.'\n\nEarlier this month, ATM network provider LINK launched a scheme, funded by banks and building societies, to enable remote communities to request a free cash machine.", "description": "In yet another blow to rural and elderly customers, the high street giant yesterday confirmed that it will this week tell customers they won't be able to take money out at their local Post Office from January.", "authors": ["Amelia Murray Money Mail Chief Reporter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19419724-0-image-a-115_1570493368488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
