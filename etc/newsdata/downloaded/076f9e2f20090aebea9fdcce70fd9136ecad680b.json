We are just lacking performance and power compared to the others,\u201d said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.\n\nFinnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, the Briton\u2019s sole remaining rival with four races to go, was fourth \u2014 a situation that would see the championship battle continue to Texas next weekend if repeated in Sunday\u2019s race.\n\nBottas\u2019s time was still 0.614 adrift of Vettel.\n\nHamilton has to score 14 points more than Bottas, winner of the previous race in Japan, on Sunday to wrap up the title.\n\nThat means finishing on the podium at a circuit that has not favoured him and Mercedes in the past two seasons, despite the Briton securing the title there on each occasion.\n\nVettel and Leclerc had lapped on the slower, medium tyres in the morning with Hamilton on the fastest softs.\n\nThe morning session was halted with around half an hour remaining when Racing Point\u2019s Lance Stroll smacked his car into the tyre wall.\n\nThere was little real damage and the Canadian was able to return to the track before the end of the session, with the top three setting their fastest times after the red flag interruption.\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Alexander Albon, fourth in the morning, spun into the barriers after five laps of the second session.\n\nFerrari arrived in Mexico as many people\u2019s favourites, having racked up five poles in a row, with Red Bull also seen as contenders for another win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into this weekend knowing that Ferrari are massively quick usually on the straights and obviously straights are a powerful element of this circuit,\u201d Hamilton had told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be getting another pole \u2014 unless it rains, which can change everything.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Vettel lapped fastest for favourites Ferrari in Friday practice for a Mexican Grand Prix that could crown Lewis Hamilton a six times Formula One world champion.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445004911&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1SQ", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
