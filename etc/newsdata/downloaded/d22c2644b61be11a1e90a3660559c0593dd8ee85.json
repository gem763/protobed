According to the official recall, the Mini models were determined to be at increased risk of crash due to \u201ccorrosion at the starter motor power supply cable connectors, which could lead to the inability to restart the engine following an engine shutdown by the start-stop (MSA) system.\u201d\n\nThe same recall determined the BMW models were at increased risk of crash because \u201clubrication of some internal components within the steering rack may have been exposed to excessive water or salt which could result in higher than normal steering effort or steering binding.\u201d\n\nThe recall also warned of damage to electrical wires and connectors in the cars. The list of models affected included the BMW 2 Series, 3 Series, 4 Series, 5 Series, 6 Series, 7 Series, i3 electric hatch, i8 electric coupe, X1 crossover, Z4 roadster, Mini Cooper, Cooper Convertible, Coupe, Mini Paceman and Mini Roadster.\n\nThis week, BMW of Canada sent Gizmodo the following statement in response to the situation:\n\nWhile we cannot confirm without seeing individual VINs, it appears that the vehicles pictured may be among those involved in the Port of Halifax recall. This recall was implemented in conjunction with Transport Canada. It was issued due to risks relating to the exposure of certain vehicles to excessive standing water or salt for an extended period of time at the port of entry in Halifax in 2015. It was deemed that this exposure could result in a number of issues including, for example, damage to electrical systems. All vehicles subject to the recall were removed from service. BMW and MINI retailers worked with affected customers to replace their vehicle with a new vehicle as quickly as possible.\ufeff\n\nThe photos Luke sent show some M models, including an M4 and a few M6s. That\u2019s a lot of good car just sitting there going to waste. Why hasn\u2019t somebody started a spec salvage racing series with these yet? Can we try?", "description": "If, by random chance, you may have wandered over to the ADESA salvage yard in Vancouver, British Columbia anytime over the last four years, you would have discovered a field of nearly 3,000 seemingly brand-new BMW and Mini models parked bumper to bumper, just rotting away....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
