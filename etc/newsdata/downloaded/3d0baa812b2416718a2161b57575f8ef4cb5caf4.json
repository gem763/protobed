Elaine Luria speaks with Laura Tierney, left, and her mother, Heather, after a town hall at New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach on Oct. 3. (Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.) went home to one of the most politically divided districts in the state to defend her support of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump and found a town hall crowd that alternately praised and derided her decision.\n\nThe freshman Democrat, who joined six other first-term moderates with national security backgrounds to call for the formal investigation last week, defended her position Thursday even as she acknowledged it may imperil her in a Virginia Beach district carried by Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cI understand that in the district I represent, the seat may typically be held by a Republican,\u201d said Luria, who has been meeting with constituents during a two-week recess from Congress. \u201cPeople would say: \u2018Well, why would you do that? You might not be reelected.\u2019 I don\u2019t care because I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nWith that, much of the audience sprang to their feet and a grinning supporter started recording her on his phone. The gathering was heavy with Luria\u2019s backers but some dissenters spoke out, others submitted written questions and Republicans staged a protest on the sidewalk outside the church that hosted the event.\n\nThe protest at Luria\u2019s town hall and a similar event held Friday outside the Henrico district office of Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) are part of a coordinated effort from state and national Republicans to target Democrats who won red districts and support impeachment.\n\nThe Republican National Committee created a campaign, called Stop the Madness, complete with a website as a clearinghouse for volunteers and protests, and spent $2 million in television and digital ads focused on more than 60 Democrats who Republicans say broke their promise to work with Trump.\n\n\u201cWithin 10 months they\u2019ve sort of jumped to the other side on the Nancy Pelosi, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], socialist squad side and jumped in both feet saying it\u2019s time to impeach the president,\u201d Virginia GOP chairman Jack Wilson said of Spanberger and Luria. \u201cWe wanted to remind [Luria] what she told her constituents less than a year ago, and her constituents were watching.\u201d\n\nThe congressional office that represents Virginia Beach, where the economy depends on the Navy and Department of Defense, has flipped back and forth between Democrats and Republicans over recent years, making it one of the state\u2019s swingiest districts.\n\nLuria, a former Navy commander, defeated incumbent Republican Scott W. Taylor in 2018 with help from voters turned off by President Trump and a local elections scandal that tarnished the reputation of her opponent, a former Navy SEAL.\n\nAnalysts say her race for reelection in 2020 could be among the most competitive in the nation. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House, started airing television ads this week targeting Luria and Reps. Matthew Cartwright (Pa.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.), Democrats who all hail from districts carried by Trump and who favor an impeachment inquiry. Luria is running unopposed.\n\nThe town hall started with Luria standing on stage at the New Hope Baptist Church convocation center at a lectern draped with red, white and blue bunting.\n\nShe later stepped down to answer questions in four categories \u2014 impeachment, public safety, health care and general \u2014 written by audience members on index cards and pulled out of a box at random, a format that did not allow her to interact one on one with voters.\n\n\u201cBravo to you on your brave, patriotic decision on the impeachment inquiry,\u201d read the first question. It was followed by an enthusiastic 20-second standing ovation from most of the several hundred people in attendance. One man shouted his dismay.\n\nLuria said it was a sad time for the nation, but her voice rose as she went on to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t spend 20 years defending our country in uniform to watch something like this happen and to watch and our Constitution be trampled on.\u201d More applause followed.\n\nThe next questioner was critical of impeachment efforts and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Luria didn\u2019t flinch. She explained why she believed Trump\u2019s use of his office to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden was grounds for an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear instance of the president of the United States enlisting the help of a foreign leader to influence and malign a potential political opponent to affect the outcome of our next election all under guise of trying to fight corruption,\u201d Luria said, speaking over another outburst from the same man in the audience.\n\nThe moderator, James H. Allen Jr., president of the Virginia Beach Interdenominational Ministers Conference, took over. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sit here and be respectful, get out,\u201d he said to the man.\n\n\u201cWith all of the issues facing the country, why is it that the Democrat Party is focused on impeachment?\u201d read another question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Adam Schiff and it\u2019s not Democratic Party that got us here, it\u2019s the actions of Donald Trump,\u201d Luria replied, as the man shouted out.\n\nAllen tried again: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to come here and disrespect the congresswoman or our church. And if you have a problem with that, leave now. This is not your turn. Okay? Thank you.\u201d He stayed and remained silent.\n\nThe next question accused her of a \u201crush to judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you seek to remove the president of the United States for nothing, no impeachable offenses, especially when your party is so guilty of so much?\u201d read another. It\u2019s time to \u201cclean house,\u201d the question said.\n\n\u201cWe have elections every two years, so if you don\u2019t like who is representing you, you can vote them out,\u201d Luria said.\n\nIn all, Luria answered a rapid-fire series of about 15 questions and comments on impeachment, which broke evenly between fans and detractors. \u201cThank you\u201d was written in large letters on one card, while another urged her to \u201cget off the Pelosi bandwagon and stop this impeachment b.s.\u201d\n\nOutside, a Trump supporter who would only give her first name, Dena, out a fear of reprisals from her liberal neighbors, said she sees no reason to impeach Trump. She wore a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d flag as a cape and a matching cap.\n\n\u201cMy tax bill was a lot smaller this year. My brother didn\u2019t have to pay the Obamacare penalty,\u201d she said, listing ways she thinks Trump has improved the country.\n\nAs she spoke, a man leaving the town hall shouted out his window, \u201c2020!\u201d in support. \u201cWoo hoo!\u201d she said.\n\nJohn Fredericks, a conservative radio host and Luria constituent who spoke at the small Stop the Madness protest on the sidewalk, called the event Luria\u2019s \u201cfairy tale town hall.\u201d He predicted the president will come to the district once or twice next year to rally the base.\n\n\u201cThe only hope she has is she wins by attrition. If there\u2019s a viable candidate, she loses,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the town hall, Allen, the moderator, said enough Democrats are incensed by the \u201ctreasonous\u201d actions of the president to deliver Luria a second term.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an abomination, quite honestly,\u201d said Allen, a Navy veteran. \u201cImpeachment, [speaking] from a personal perspective, what took them so long?\u201d\n\nMany of the Democrats in the crowd said they volunteered for Luria\u2019s 2018 campaign and plan to do all they can to help her win reelection.\n\nThat included Frank Lang, a former Navy reservist and retired psychologist from Virginia Beach who summed up Luria\u2019s call for impeachment as \u201ca courageous step \u2014 considering the district she represents.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Freshman Democratic Rep.
