When Parliament returns for its new session, the queen makes a speech setting out the government's agenda.\n\nProrogations typically only last a matter of days, but this one is lengthy because it encompasses a period of time previously set aside for Parliament to recess for annual political party conferences. By choosing to prorogue instead, Johnson's government ensured that opposition members can't cancel the recess to focus on stopping Brexit.\n\nThe state of play: Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative Party on the promise that he will deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 \"do or die\" \u2014 with or without a deal. A majority of members of Parliament oppose a no-deal Brexit, which experts and even Johnson's own government admit could cause shortages of food, fuel, medicine and more.\n\nJohnson and the EU essentially have one more chance to strike a deal during the European Council session on Oct. 17\u201318, though it's highly unlikely that will happen. If, by some miracle, the two sides do come to an agreement, Parliament will have between Oct. 21\u201331 to approve the deal.\n\nWhat they're saying: Activists and politicians who oppose leaving without a deal are outraged that Johnson has taken the extreme step of undercutting Parliament's power at such a critical moment.\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow, who had previously said he would fight an attempt to circumvent Parliament with \"every bone in my body,\" condemned the move as a \"constitutional outrage.\"\n\nwho had previously said he would fight an attempt to circumvent Parliament with \"every bone in my body,\" condemned the move as a \"constitutional outrage.\" Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his Labour Party would join other members of Parliament in doing \"everything we can\" to \"stop Boris Johnson's smash-and-grab against our democracy.\"\n\nsaid his Labour Party would join other members of Parliament in doing \"everything we can\" to \"stop Boris Johnson's smash-and-grab against our democracy.\" More than 1 million people have signed a petition demanding that Parliament not be suspended unless the Brexit deadline is extended.\n\nWhat's next? Parliament will return from recess to sit for a short session next week, during which lawmakers are expected to take steps to block a no-deal Brexit in the limited time they have.\n\nOption 1 is a legislative fix forcing the government to seek another extension from the EU, but there are no binding Brexit bills currently on the agenda.\n\nforcing the government to seek another extension from the EU, but there are no binding Brexit bills currently on the agenda. Option 2 is a vote of no-confidence, which would give MPs a window of 14 days to form a caretaker unity government with the express purpose of blocking no-deal.\n\nwhich would give MPs a window of 14 days to form a caretaker unity government with the express purpose of blocking no-deal. Option 3 is a general election, assuming anti-no-deal lawmakers can't gather enough support to form a government. But Downing Street officials have already said that Johnson would likely hold any snap election after Brexit has been completed on Oct. 31.\n\nThe bottom line, via BuzzFeed News: \"One senior Brexiteer equated Downing Street\u2019s strategy to a [soccer] team wasting time at the end of a match.
