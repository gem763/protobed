We have gone through a thorough process and looked at all the options that were available to us. Chris was the standout candidate,\u201d said Giles. \u201cI believe he is what we need to take our international teams forward. He is somebody we know well, but it is his intimate understanding of our structures and systems and his close relationships with Test captain Joe Root and white-ball captain Eoin Morgan that will help us develop our plans for the next few years.", "description": "Chris Silverwood has said he is \u201cthrilled and honoured\u201d to be appointed England head coach and will take charge of the side for the tour to New Zealand later this month.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212279388-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1TJOa7BZ2Re4vzncv8bVr5IJUf7Hyxq67IAaSz0vTU0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
