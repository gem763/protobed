And, if you live in Westwood, um, yikes. Sorry, buddy. The 90024 ZIP Code which centers around the neighborhood comes in at number four on Rent Cafe's new survey of the most expensive places to live across the entire United States.\n\nSpots one, two, and three predictably went to ZIP codes in Manhattan \u2014 as did the spots from seven to ten, and then again form 12 to 20, and\u2026 well, apparently Manhattan has a whole lot of ZIP codes \u2014 but spots four, five, and six are all California. Coming up right behind Westwood is 90048, a ZIP code in the Beverly Grove part of town, and then one San Francisco 'hood.\n\nIt's not easy to be the most expensive neighborhood in Los Angeles, a city where rent prices seem to be on a constant skyward trend, but Westwood manages. The study finds rent prices in the ZIP code to average $4,944 per month. That number is just over 4% higher than in their 2018 survey.\n\nIf $4,896 per month feels a little steep, Rent Cafe also published a companion list of 50 ZIP codes where the average rent comes in under $600. The most affordable of all? The 67213 in Wichita, Kansas, with an average price of just $423. That's a whole month for roughly the equivalent of three days in Westwood.", "description": "The 90024 ZIP code ranks No. 4 on\u00a0Rent Cafe's new survey\u00a0of the most expensive places to live across the entire United States.", "authors": ["Brittany Martin", "Los Angeles Magazine"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0f5844af9094a6244fcf3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
