She told Fox News that about two weeks ago she was going through her normal routine inspecting clothes when she found the cash inside a coat that a man had dropped off.\n\n\u201cWhen I put my hand in the pocket, I felt something. When I pulled the money out, it made me panic a little bit, So, I put it back in the pocket for a second and then I took it back out of the pocket and ran over and put it in the register, and immediately called the owner of the store,\u201d Kimes told Fox News.\n\nSISTERS REUNITED AFTER 75 YEARS THANKS TO ONLINE DNA TEST\n\nShe said she\u2019d never found that much cash before.\n\n\u201cWe found 50 cents, a dollar, ChapStick, a little note, a piece of gum, something like, but never $7,000.\u201d\n\nKimes said she instinctively knew she wanted to return the money to the rightful owner.\n\n\u201cI was shocked.
