We are also exploring other potential legal avenues to help protect the confidentiality of the information.\"\n\nMeikle added the provider would be dumped by the Commission and apologised for the breach.\n\n\"While this breach has resulted from criminal activity and our provider failing to meet the obligations we placed on it, it is our job to keep sensitive information safe,\" she said.\n\nA pair of independent reviews have begun in the wake of the theft, as well as ComCom contacting its suppliers to seek security assurances.\n\nPeople concerned whether they are caught up in the breach are urged to contact ComCom.\n\nLast month, the Commission said New Zealand did not need regulatory intervention for a fourth national network.\n\nFollowing the launch of 2degrees, Vodafone and Spark's market shares have dropped by 12.5% and 8% respectively since 2009.
