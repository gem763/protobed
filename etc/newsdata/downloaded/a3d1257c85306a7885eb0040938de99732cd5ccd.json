Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus was unlike anything we\u2019d seen before, and now, 50 years later, the British Film Institute is marking this comedic landmark with a spectacular birthday party.\n\nThroughout this month the BFI is screening all sorts of Python treats, from TV shows to feature films, from documentaries to home movies, but the most intriguing elements are the shows that came before. Although Monty Python was revolutionary, it didn\u2019t happen in isolation. It grew out of numerous strands in postwar British comedy, and it\u2019s these strands which make Monty Python at 50 more than just a rerun of greatest hits.\n\nSo where did Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus begin? Probably the biggest influence on Monty Python was The Goon Show, that absurdist radio series written by Spike Milligan, and performed by Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and (briefly) Michael Bentine. The Goon Show and Milligan\u2019s TV series, Q5, both feature in John Cleese and Michael Palin\u2019s Pick of Python Influences, a key part of this season.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Cook and Moore\u2019s subsequent sketch show, Not Only\u2026 But Also, has been selected by John Cleese as an inspiration.\n\nBut Python wasn\u2019t just a British ensemble. True, five of the team were British, and all Oxbridge graduates to boot (Michael Palin and Terry Jones met at Oxford; John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle all met at Cambridge) but the sixth member, Terry Gilliam, was American, and it was his bizarre animations which gave the show its definitive aesthetic.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 50 years of Monty Python Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

One of his inspirations was the surreal visual gags of American comic Ernie Kovacs. Kovacs\u2019 life was cruelly cut short when he died in a road accident in 1962. This month, to mark the centenary of his birth, Gilliam is introducing a selection of highlights from Kovacs\u2019 career.\n\nEven more important were the TV shows the Pythons made before they became Monty Python. You can see two of them in this season: At Last the 1948 Show and Do Not Adjust Your Set. The 1948 Show was a sketch show written and performed by Cleese and Chapman (with Marty Feldman, Aimi MacDonald and future Goodie Tim Brooke-Taylor). Do Not Adjust Your Set was a children\u2019s show featuring the other four Pythons (Idle, Jones, Palin and Gilliam) and the wonderfully silly Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. \u201cIt was a dress rehearsal for Python,\u201d says Neil Innes, a member of the band who went on to work with Python on TV, onstage and in the movies.\n\nAt first it may seem surprising that two-thirds of Monty Python, a late night adult TV show, should emerge from a programme specifically designed for kids. However, when you stop and think about it, it makes perfect sense. One of the main elements of Monty Python was its childlike sense of fun. Although it was billed and scheduled as a children\u2019s programme, Jones, Palin, Idle and Gilliam never set out to make comedy for children. They simply did what they thought was funny. Consequently, although kids loved it, the show also attracted an adult audience, including Cleese and Chapman, who used to stop work early whenever it was on, so they could watch it. \u201cWe were all very close to childhood,\u201d says Innes. \u201cWe knew nothing about children\u2019s television, other than having fun, playing games and imagining things.\u201d\n\nSo who brought these two shows together, and turned them into the most extraordinary show in the history of British comedy? Well, it was Cleese who made the first approach to the Do Not Adjust Your Set team (he\u2019d already worked with Palin on a one-off sketch show called How to Irritate People) but it was Barry Took who approached the BBC on their behalf.\n\nBarry Took is now best remembered as the presenter of TV\u2019s Points of View (in which pedantic viewers wrote in with nit-picking complaints and queries) but off-camera he was a far more significant figure, the creator (with Mary Feldman) of the classic sitcom Bootsie & Snudge, and a key player in the development of British comedy. Took approached the BBC about Monty Python and even though the Pythons didn\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019d put in it, the BBC (to their eternal credit) commissioned 13 programmes. That was in the good old days when BBC executives trusted the talent. They didn\u2019t micromanage, so the Pythons had the freedom to experiment. It was this freedom which enabled them to create such an innovative and unusual show.\n\nWhat made it so special? Well, the absence of punchlines, for one thing. Ever since the days of Music Hall it had been a comic axiom that sketches had to end with a big closing gag to bring down the curtain. A lifetime later, on TV, that old-fashioned orthodoxy prevailed. Even Peter Cook and Dudley Moore clung to this convention in their otherwise progressive sketch shows, often ending a brilliant sketch with a lame one-liner.\n\nThe Pythons weren\u2019t the first to notice that punchlines were a curse, but they were among the first to dare to ditch them. Spike Milligan was the very first (his Q5 series was broadcast while Monty Python was in production \u2013 a sign that change was in the air) but the Pythons found a far neater way to segway from one sketch into another. Gilliam\u2019s crazy cut-ups could bridge the gap between any two sketches, however incompatible. You simply told him where to start and where to finish and he filled in the rest. That clumsy compere\u2019s link, \u201cAnd Now for Something Completely Different\u201d, was rendered utterly redundant. Instead, it became their catchphrase.\n\nCarol Cleveland was hired to be a \u201cglamour stooge\u201d (as she describes it) in the first series. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to last very long,\u201d she told her husband. She subsequently appeared in 30 episodes, all four Monty Python movies, and performed with the Pythons onstage in the UK and the US. Yet she recalls being utterly mystified when she first read the script. \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she thought, but when Gilliam\u2019s animation filled the gaps, it all came together. \u201cIt was only when I saw the animation and how it actually fitted in that I realised how this show was linked together,\u201d she remembers. \u201cOne thought just drifting into another, like a stream of consciousness.\u201d\n\nBut there was more to it than a lack of punchlines and Gilliam\u2019s zany flights of fancy. The performers were a perfect blend. Cleese played the authority figures, Idle played the cheeky chappies, Palin was lovable, Jones was intense. Chapman was superb at playing decent, beleaguered everymen (a role he perfected as King Arthur in Monty Python & the Holy Grail and Brian in The Life of Brian). Gilliam played the manic, guttural grotesques. Carol Cleveland also gave the show something extra, especially on TV. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just a pretty face \u2013 they realised I could be funny in my own right.\u201d\n\nBefore the first live recording, the Pythons had no idea whether anyone else would find it funny, but they didn\u2019t really care. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t try to second guess their audience. They simply set out to amuse themselves. \u201cThey were like schoolboys, larking about,\u201d recalls Carol.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a winning formula on the small screen. It also worked really well onstage, as Neil Innes discovered when he performed with the Pythons at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London\u2019s West End. \u201cDrury Lane was an extraordinary success,\u201d he says.\n\nBut above all, it was all about the quality of the writing. The Pythons always saw themselves as writers first and performers second (before they teamed up, only Cleese was a famous face, as opposed to a familiar byline, on account of his appearances alongside Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett in The Frost Report). This meant when it came to casting, the success of the sketches was always paramount. The power struggles were always about which sketches made the final cut, rather than who got to play which part.\n\nAs with the performing, there was great variety in the writing. Cleese and Chapman generally wrote together, as they had done since university. Likewise Jones and Palin. Idle usually wrote alone. Like The Beatles, to whom they\u2019re often compared (and to some extent resembled) this resulted in a range of styles, from several diverse sources. Cleese and Chapman tended to write more wordy sketches. Jones and Palin were more interested in character. Idle\u2019s sketches were more conventional. His Nudge Nudge, Wink Wink sketch was originally written for (and rejected by) The Two Ronnies.\n\nThe Pythons had no idea whether anyone else would find it funny, but they didn\u2019t really care. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t try to second guess their audience. They simply set out to amuse themselves. They were like schoolboys, larking about\n\nAnd then there was the music. Everyone remembers Idle\u2019s \u201cAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life\u201d but there are loads of other classics (\u201cThe Galaxy Song\u201d from The Meaning of Life; \u201cThe Lumberjack Song\u201d from the TV series). It\u2019s not easy to write a song that everyone can still sing along to half a century later. No wonder George Harrison was such a fan. It was thanks to him that Life of Brian went ahead \u2013 he mortgaged his home to make it.\n\nThe other thing the Pythons recognised was that being avant-garde was no excuse for being lax \u2013 quite the opposite, in fact. They were never afraid to criticise each other\u2019s work, cutting (or even axing) each other\u2019s sketches. The result was far tighter \u2013 and invariably funnier \u2013 scripts. \u201cCleese is one of the most brilliant analytical comedy brains \u2013 maybe it\u2019s studying law that teaches you this,\u201d says Innes. (Cleese read Law at Cambridge.)\n\nThat intellectual rigour was something all the Pythons shared. When they were writing for other people\u2019s shows, TV executives would often veto their more esoteric suggestions. \u201cThey\u2019ll never get it in Bradford,\u201d would be the patronising response (TV execs always underestimate the collective savvy of the viewing public). Free to do whatever they wanted, with only the other Pythons to answer to, they proved that viewers in Bradford (or wherever) were perfectly capable of getting it. \u201dThe Pythons didn\u2019t dumb anyone down, they brought them along \u2013 they didn\u2019t treat people as idiots and people got it, and I think they respected the fact that they weren\u2019t being treated as idiots,\u201d says Innes. \u201cThey assumed their audience was intelligent.\u201d And they were right.\n\nToday the term Pythonesque has entered the English language, yet this remarkable TV show (and the films and books and records that sprang from it) might quite easily have never been called Monty Python at all. For a long time it had no name because the team couldn\u2019t decide on one (A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket, Owl-Stretching Time and The Toad-Elevating Moment were just some of the numerous working titles). Eventually BBC execs started calling it Barry Took\u2019s Flying Circus (Flying Circus was RAF slang for balls-up) simply as a reference point in their internal memos.\n\nThe Pythons didn\u2019t dumb anyone down, they brought them along \u2013 they didn\u2019t treat people as idiots and people got it, and I think they respected the fact that they weren\u2019t being treated as idiots\n\nThe Pythons liked the Flying Circus bit (although it confused a lot of viewers) and eventually settled on Monty Python \u2013 thinking it sounded like a seedy impresario. It almost became Gwen Dibley\u2019s Flying Circus, after a woman whose name had caught Palin\u2019s eye. This could have posed a legal problem, so Monty Python triumphed. Just think: if Palin\u2019s suggestion had prevailed, we might well be describing stuff as Dibleyesque instead.\n\nEven though most people still regard Monty Python as quintessentially British (despite Gilliam\u2019s unique input), it was the show\u2019s success in America which gave it proper staying power. \u201cThe Pythons had doubts \u2013 they didn\u2019t think it would work there,\u201d says Carol. Their worries were unfounded. If anything, Monty Python became even bigger in the States.\n\nBecause there was no video in those days (let alone Netflix or YouTube) the shows were hard to track down, so the Python LPs became very popular. These albums attracted a cult following in the States, often among people who\u2019d never even seen the TV shows. When the Pythons toured America, they were treated more like rock stars than comedians. The BBC shows were then shown ad infinitum on PBS, America\u2019s public access TV network, meaning American viewers saw them a lot more often than British viewers back in Britain.\n\nBuoyed by this exposure, they played Broadway and the Hollywood Bowl. Carol likens these shows to pop concerts, full of screaming fans. \u201cEverybody was standing up, cheering and shouting \u2013 we could hardly get a word out.\u201d One of the main talking points in America was their fondness for wearing women\u2019s clothes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do drag in America in those days. I think that was the first thing that stuck out there, the fact that these men dressed as women.\u201d\n\nGraham Chapman\u2019s untimely death in 1989 (from cancer, aged just 48) put an end to Python, pretty much, though they\u2019d not really worked together since their last movie, The Meaning of Life, in 1983. The remaining members got back together for their sell-out show at the O2 in 2014, and Spamalot (Idle\u2019s musical of Monty Python & The Holy Grail) was a big hit on both sides of the Atlantic. However it\u2019s for the TV shows, Holy Grail and Life of Brian that they\u2019ll be remembered. The latter remains their masterpiece \u2013 heretical but not blasphemous, as Terry Jones put it (quite rightly). \u201cIt was, cleverly, not about offending anybody who had deep religious beliefs,\u201d says Innes. \u2018\u201dIt pointed clearly at the absurdity of how people follow things.\u201d\n\nLooking back, it\u2018s incredible to think that only 10 years separated their first TV show from their crowning glory, The Life of Brian. They\u2019ve achieved a great deal on their own (Gilliam\u2019s movies, Palin\u2019s travelogues, Jones & Palin\u2019s Ripping Yarns, Eric Idle\u2019s Rutles, Cleese\u2019s Fawlty Towers...) but in another 50 years it\u2019s as an ensemble that they\u2019ll be remembered, and people will still be using the word Pythonesque to describe something that\u2019s both ridiculous and erudite, both extremely clever and extremely silly. Would Dibleyesque sound quite the same? Somehow, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nMonty Python at 50 is at BFI Southbank until 1 October.
