A new front line in national defense has become the White House Situation Room, where the military struggles to accommodate a commander in chief who is both ignorant and capricious. In May, after months of threatening Iran, Trump ordered the carrier group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln to shift from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf. On June 20, after an American drone was downed there, he ordered a retaliatory attack\u2014and then called it off minutes before it was to be launched. The next day he said he was \u201cnot looking for war\u201d and wanted to talk with Iran\u2019s leaders, while also promising them \u201cobliteration like you\u2019ve never seen before\u201d if they crossed him. He threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d and dispatched a three-aircraft-carrier flotilla to waters off the Korean peninsula\u2014then he pivoted to friendly summits with Kim Jong Un, with whom he announced he was \u201cin love\u201d; canceled long-standing U.S. military exercises with South Korea; and dangled the possibility of withdrawing American forces from the country altogether. While the lovefest continues for the cameras, the U.S. has quietly uncanceled the canceled military exercises, and dropped any mention of a troop withdrawal.\n\nSuch rudderless captaincy creates the headlines Trump craves. He revels when his tweets take off. (\u201cBoom!\u201d he says. \u201cLike a rocket!\u201d) Out in the field, where combat is more than wordplay, his tweets have consequences. He is not a president who thinks through consequences\u2014and this, the generals stressed, is not the way serious nations behave.\n\nThe generals I spoke with didn\u2019t agree on everything, but they shared the following five characterizations of Trump\u2019s military leadership.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mark Bowden", "Theatlantic.Com Magazine Archive Military-Officers-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
