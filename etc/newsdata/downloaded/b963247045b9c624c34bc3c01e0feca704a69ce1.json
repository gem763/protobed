REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\n\nA slump in the residential property market is leaving many builders struggling to repay loans to shadow lenders - housing finance firms outside the regular banking sector that account for over half of the loans to developers.\n\nWith about $10 billion of development loans coming up for repayment in the first half of 2020, according to Fitch Rating\u2019s Indian division, the fallout could spread to mainstream banks that have lent money to the shadow lenders or invested in their bonds.\n\nIndian financial authorities, including the central bank and government, have said this year that the banking sector\u2019s bad loans - totalling more than $150 billion - are on the decline for the first time in four years after ballooning during a debt crisis.\n\nBut the number of property developers falling into bankruptcy has doubled during the past nine months, piling pressure on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), commonly known as shadow lenders.\n\nPotential implosions of these NBFCs could expose banks, according to 12 banking and real estate sources.\n\nA senior banking industry official, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said banks would be affected by the property cash crunch in three ways: their lending to NBFCs, their own direct exposure to developers and also individuals who do not repay mortgages.\n\n\u201cIt will be a triple-whammy,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Indian banking system could be hit by billions of dollars of additional soured debt, the cash crunch in the housing market has levied a toll in human misery.\n\nRetired Squadron Leader Krishan Mitroo has paid 90% of the cost of his house in Noida, northern India, to developer Jaypee, and the property was supposed to be handed over five years ago. However, Jaypee was forced to delay the project and went into insolvency in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe project has been stuck and there is no progress at all. Even the bankruptcy court has not been able to resolve the issue so far, it is just hanging in thin air,\u201d Mitroo said. He did not say how much money he had paid, but properties in that project range from about $56,000 to $140,000.\n\nSeveral such projects are stuck across the country and buyers are waiting for new developers to take interest and complete them with the hope that their hard-earned money, which has been stuck for years, won\u2019t be lost forever.\n\nBAD LOANS PILE \u2018HUGE\u2019\n\nThe property sector has been battling a downturn for the last 3-4 years. Things have now, however, hit a critical point due to a liquidity crunch hitting shadow banks that are big lenders to both developers and property buyers.\n\nAs of June 30, 421 realtors were under the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP), up from 209 on Sept. 30 last year, data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India shows.\n\nDefaults by two housing finance companies, Dewan Housing Finance Corp and Altico Capital, have increased fears of contagion to the banking system..\n\nDewan and Altico did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nShadow lenders will be highly exposed when loans worth roughly 700 billion rupees come up for repayment in the first half of 2020, as many builders may struggle to repay, Fitch\u2019s India Ratings said last month.\n\n\u201cThe number of stressed assets in real estate are huge,\u201d said Rohit Poddar, managing director at Poddar Developers. \u201cThe stress now is just the start, only the mid-sized to large developers will survive, others will die.\u201d\n\nIf three-quarters of the high-risk category of outstanding real estate loans is not repaid, that could lead to additional bad debt of $15 billion on banks\u2019 books in the next few years, according to confidential research conducted by one of India\u2019s leading real estate consultancies for an international financial client, and provided to Reuters.\n\nThe Nifty Bank index, which surged in late September after the government moved to slash corporate tax rates, gave up more than half those gains as of Friday. Concerns about real estate loans were one factor, according to analysts, but the fall was also driven by low growth in the economy and the overall worsening asset quality of certain lenders.\n\nBanks\u2019 gross non-performing assets fell to 9.3% of total loans as of March, from 11.5% a year earlier, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nThe improvement was bigger than the RBI had expected, having forecast a drop to 10.3% by March and saying last December the ratio had fallen for the first time since 2015. The central bank said in June it expected bad loans to continue to fall in the current financial year, both the ratio and absolute sum.\n\nBut India still has the highest bad-loan ratio among major economies; by comparison Italy, which has endured a major banking crisis, had a ratio of 9% at the end of last year.\n\nYes Bank and IndusInd Bank have the largest direct exposure to the commercial real estate sector and would be susceptible to \u201casset-quality difficulties\u201d if the real estate sector continues to slow, according to a Moody\u2019s report in mid-September, which also said other banks such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are likely to feel the pinch.\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on potential difficulties arising from the real-estate exposure covered in the Moody\u2019s report.\n\nThe chief financial officer of a large public-sector bank said the problems emerging in real estate loan repayments were a major cause of worry.\n\nIt is unclear what individual banks will do to address the problem. State-owned banks, which dominate the sector, have already received tens of billions of dollars from the government in recent years to shore up their finances.\n\nInternational banks have a very small presence in the Indian market.\n\nJOB LOSSES LOOM\n\nIndian banks\u2019 bad debt pile ballooned as a result of out-of-control lending in 2006-11 when the economy grew rapidly, and beyond that. They under-reported their bad loans for years until they were forced by the central bank to recognise and address the issue in 2015.\n\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das touched on the real estate issue this month, saying the central bank would be looking at the sector as part of its six-monthly report on the stability of the financial system. The next report is due to be released in December.\n\nThe RBI declined to make any further comment on banks\u2019 exposure to bad real estate loans.\n\nA rebound in the real estate market could alter the situation, but the outlook is looking increasingly bleak.\n\nSeveral industry sources said builders were struggling to offload properties, even though they are ready to offer buyers up to 25% discounts on listed rates. The situation now is so severe that real estate inventories across India are at an all-time high of nearly four years and property prices have not risen in most parts of the country in the last 4-5 years.\n\nProjects worth 1.8 trillion rupees ($25 billion) are stalled across India, according to property consultancy firm Anarock.\n\nAs developers go to the wall, more than half a million direct jobs may be lost in the coming months, the National Real Estate Development Council said. The number of indirect job losses from related industries like cement and steel may be even higher.\n\nSlowing sales are piling on the pain, with buyers staying away because they increasingly can\u2019t afford properties.\n\nThe house price-to-income ratio, which measures the cost of housing versus the change in income levels, rose from 56.1 in March 2015 to 61.5 in March 2019, indicating home purchases have become less affordable.\n\nWhile consumers are staying away, investors are also wary of residential purchases due to low rental yields and meagre-to-negative capital appreciation.\n\n\u201cSluggishness in sales is further raising concerns of the borrowers defaulting on the interest and EMI payments,\u201d said Parth Mehta, Managing Director, Paradigm Realty.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Labourers work at the construction site of a residential building on the outskirts of Kolkata, India, February 1, 2019. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\n\nAs the sector gets stressed further, repayments to lenders are likely to get further hit and banks will be increasingly unwilling to lend to property financiers and developers.\n\nPankaj Kapoor, chief executive of real estate consultancy firm Liases Foras, described the cash crunch in the sector as a \u201cbloodbath\u201d that would deteriorate further.\n\n\u201cThis situation is likely to continue for another two years, which means builders may have to offer more discounts.\u201d", "description": "India might have thought the worst of a bad loans crisis was past, but a severe cash crunch in the real estate industry could augur fresh strife for its banks.", "authors": ["Nupur Anand", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440283897&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C05F", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
