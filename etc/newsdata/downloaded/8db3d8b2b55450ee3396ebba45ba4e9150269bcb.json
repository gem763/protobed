What\u2019s new?\n\nAt this point, Netflix cleaning up at an awards show is no longer breaking news. Last year, the streaming service received 112 nominations, becoming the first company to beat out HBO for the most nods in 18 years. The behemoth continued on as an awards powerhouse Saturday night, earning 15 Emmys. It won for several programs, among them \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway;\u201d \u201cPatriot Act with Hasan Minhaj;\u201d \u201cCarmen San Diego;\u201d the Hannah Gadsby comedy special \u201cNanette;\u201d and \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d The closest competing network was National Geographic with eight wins \u2014 and seven of those were for the documentary \u201cFree Solo.\u201d\n\nJames Corden beats Beyonc\u00e9\n\nThe late-night host might want to keep an eye out for the Beyhive. Though anyone with an Internet connection surely thought Bey\u2019s \u201cHomecoming\u201d concert movie was one of the year\u2019s smash hits, Corden bested her in the outstanding variety special (prerecorded) category. In fairness, Corden had some pretty strong ammunition: His \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segment featuring Paul McCartney, in which the two drive around Liverpool and the former Beatle plays a surprise show at a pub, took home the prize. The most surprising aspect? Kanye West didn\u2019t show up with an unsolicited opinion.\n\n\u2018The Simpsons\u2019 is still at it\n\nThis old dog is still up to its old tricks \u2014 namely, winning Emmys. The animated program, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, shocked everyone by taking home its 11th Emmy \u2014 and first since 2008. GoldDerby, which sets odds on awards shows, gave the show a 9/2 chance of winning outstanding animated program, the worst in its category. But something about \u201cMad About the Toy,\u201d which follows Grandpa reflecting on his part in getting a gay man fired years earlier and trying to make things right with him, struck a chord with the voters.\n\nRachel Bloom receives a statue \u2014 and announces a pregnancy\n\nThe multitalented comedian had a pretty nice evening. First, she, along with Adam Schlesinger and Jack Dolgen, won an Emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song \u201cAntidepressants Are So Not a Big Deal,\u201d which appeared in her CW show, \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend.\u201d And that was the second-most-newsworthy thing about her night. After receiving the award, she told reporters backstage she was pregnant. \u201cSo, that\u2019s what\u2019s next for me. I might as well do it at an Emmy news conference. I was going to post an Instagram, [but] \u2026 I\u2019m three months pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I get to tell my child that she was with me when this happened, which is really cool!\u201d\n\nHBO dominates the documentary awards, leading with \u2018Leaving Neverland\u2019\n\nHBO\u2019S tremendously emotional documentary tracing Michael Jackson\u2019s alleged history of sexually abusing young boys has made a lot of headlines lately, mostly because of Dave Chappelle\u2019s poking fun at it in his latest special, \u201cSticks & Stones.\u201d On Saturday, that conversation changed when it won the Emmy for outstanding documentary. HBO had a nice night, also taking home the trophy for exceptional merit in documentary filmmaking for \u201cThe Sentence,\u201d which took on the complex topic of mandatory minimum prison sentences.\n\nReview: A devastating and credible \u2018Leaving Neverland\u2019 will turn you off Michael Jackson for good\n\nSeth MacFarlane ties record for most voice-over Emmys\n\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d wasn\u2019t the only long-running animated comedy recognized on Saturday. Remember that old cartoon \u201cFamily Guy\u201d? Well, it\u2019s still on television and just earned its creator yet another Emmy. MacFarlane has won the award three times in the six years since outstanding character voice-over performance became its own category in 2014. (He won one before, when the character award was included in the outstanding voice-over performance Emmy.) With four under his belt, he\u2019s tied with Dan Castellaneta and Hank Azaria of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for the record.\n\nYouTube continues to compete\n\nThe online video streaming service won its first Emmy in 2013, a technical one for its personalized video recommendations. Well, it hasn\u2019t slowed down, earning four Emmys on Saturday night. Three awards went to C\u00e9line Desrumaux, Jasmin Lai and Bruno Mangyoku for outstanding individual achievement in animation for their work on \u201cAge of Sail.\u201d The other went to NASA\u2019s interactive coverage of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon test flight to the International Space Station, which was broadcast on YouTube.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s just getting started\n\nAfter winning best host of a reality or competition program for the fourth consecutive year for \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d RuPaul is now tied with \u201cSurvivor\u201d host Jeff Probst for the record. \u201cI show up to work because I love drag queens, love dramatic people, love being around people who march to a different drummer,\u201d RuPaul said after winning. \u201cDrag is dangerous. Drag is not politically correct,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people say, \u2018You\u2019re mainstream,\u2019 but drag will never be mainstream.\u201d Additionally, the show, which was nominated this year for 14 Emmys overall, won outstanding hairstyling for a multicamera series or special and outstanding costumes for variety, nonfiction or reality programming.", "description": "Night One of the awards ceremony included record ties for RuPaul and Seth MacFarlane and a baby for Rachel Bloom.", "authors": ["Travis M.
