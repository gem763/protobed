He would not play other players,\u2019 Green told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\u2018It was the same team, the same formation every week, maybe one or two changes and Callum just wouldn\u2019t get a look-in.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d go into training and he\u2019d tear it up day in, day out and the things he would try in training with no pressure\u2026 and he\u2019d do it in games.
