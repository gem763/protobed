Apple is spending heavily on new content and promises a \u201cpowerful and inspiring lineup of original shows, movies and documentaries.\u201d\n\nEntertainment colossus Disney will launch its own online streaming service, chock full of popular franchises such as \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Marvel superheroes, on November 12 in the US, Canada and the Netherlands, before rolling out worldwide.\n\nAnd more competition looms on the horizon, as AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia will launch its \u201cHBO Max\u201d in early 2020 after reclaiming the rights from Netflix to stream its popular television comedy \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock service is also launching next year.\n\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger told investors on a recent earnings call that \u201cnothing is more important to us\u201d than the Disney+ platform.\n\nAs well as offering Disney\u2019s enormous back catalog, including all animated films and Pixar movies within its first year, it will feature freshly commissioned shows. It will cost $6.99 a month in the US.\n\n\u2013 Spotlighting originality \u2013\n\nNetflix, which began streaming television to subscribers online some 12 years ago, has so far stayed ahead of Amazon Prime and Hulu, key rivals in the US market.\n\nNetflix chief executive Reed Hastings said he is unfazed by the new rivals.\n\n\u201cDisney will be a great competitor,\u201d he told analysts recently. \u201cApple is just beginning but, you know, they will probably have some great shows too.\u201d\n\nThe budget for original shows at Netflix this year is $15 billion, and the California-based company this week announced plans to issue $2 billion in notes to have more cash for uses including creating and acquiring content.\n\nIves said Netflix remains the leader until proven otherwise.\n\n\u201cNetflix is on the top of the mountain and will continue to be the leader, but there are legitimate opportunities for number two and number three players with Apple, HBO, and Amazon in the running,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nBig-name entertainment industry talent has been recruited to make shows for the competing services, and Netflix is also showcasing local talent from countries around the world.\n\n\u2013 Cable TV obsolete? \u2013\n\nAs Disney and other major studios begin streaming directly to viewers, and keep coveted shows or films on their own services to attract subscribers, traditional cable companies \u201cshould be very concerned,\u201d according to IHS Markit analyst Fateha Begum.\n\n\u201cThe cable service provider as a middle man bundling content is no longer needed,\u201d Begum said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think cable TV will die, it still provides the one place for content you want, but this will push cable and pay TV services to innovate further.\u201d\n\nCable TV companies may have to end revenue-boosting tactics such as charging monthly fees for boxes needed to access their services.\n\nOnline streaming services accounted for a third of paid video subscriptions worldwide last year, with the rest going to traditional pay TV, according to IHS Markit media platforms executive director Maria Rua Aguete.\n\nShe expected the number of streaming subscribers worldwide to grow 19 percent to 921.8 million next year, and then another 16 percent to 1.1 billion in the year 2021.\n\n\u201cWith the new flexible services threatening to convert more consumers into cord-cutters and into leaving the pay-TV ecosystem behind, besieged pay-TV providers are justifiably feeling the heat,\u201d Aguete said.\n\nMeanwhile, the expense and complexity of accessing a variety of streaming services for shows could give rise to aggregators that bring options together in a single place, perhaps in the Amazon Prime style of mixing subscriber content with films for purchase or rent.\n\nMore than 50 streaming television services have launched or will launch in the year ahead, according to Mobilocity analyst Gerry Purdy.\n\n\u201cUntil now, it has been Netflix\u2019s world and everyone else has been paying rent,\u201d Ives said.\n\n\u201cOver the next three to six months, we are going to see an all out battle for consumer mind-share.\u201d", "description": "San Francisco (AFP) \u2013 The streaming television war is set to enter a new phase as titans Apple and Disney take direct aim at market leader \u00a0Netflix,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/23c7de_apple-has-enlisted-stars-as-steve-carell-reese-witherspoon-jennifer-aniston-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
