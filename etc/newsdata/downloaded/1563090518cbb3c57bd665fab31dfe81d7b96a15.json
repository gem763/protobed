In this case, the actor was Joaquin Phoenix, who\u2019d played Jesus Christ in one of Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s previous projects, Mary Magdalene. This time, though, the mercurial actor plays a very different kind of messiah. Taking the title role in Phillips\u2019 controversial new release, Phoenix stars as an embattled clown who accidentally becomes the face of a violent anarchist movement in early-80s Gotham City.\n\nSpeaking to Deadline\u2019s Andreas Wiseman, Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir revealed that, initially, she\u2019d been hired by Phillips simply to come back to him with some ideas rather than a full score. \u201cTodd contacted me probably half a year before they started shooting,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe told me he was working on this film and asked if I was interested in reading the script, which I of course was \u2014 and I had quite a strong response to it. Todd asked if I was interested in writing some music just based on those feelings. He didn\u2019t really give me any instruction, as such, he was just curious to hear what I felt.\u201d\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nGu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir explained that such a response is easier to form at such an early stage. \u201cIt\u2019s quite different when you\u2019re reading a script, because you\u2019re not influenced by the costumes, or the edits, or the choreography \u2014 it\u2019s a really good time to be able to just connect to the story on a kind of visceral level. It\u2019s very rare to have the opportunity to do that, because I\u2019m normally hired quite late in the process and you\u2019re kind of just thrown in after the final cut. And then as I kind of started to find (the music), it was almost like I was struck by lightning.\u201d\n\nBecause she had been brought in so early, Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir had the added bonus of seeing her work inform the film. \u201cJoaquin was having a bit of a hard time finding his way into the character,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand finding his way into this transformation, so Todd said, \u2018Hey, I think it might be helpful just to listen to the music.\u2019 So he did, and he told me later that it really helped him to become the character. It was amazing to see him transform \u2014 such a beautiful interaction.\u201d\n\nImmediately after, the Contenders audience was treated to a sneak peak at Edward Norton\u2019s passion project Motherless Brooklyn, in which he stars as a gumshoe on the trail of inner-city corruption in 1950s New York. Speaking to Deadline\u2019s Tom Grater, double Oscar nominee Dick Pope \u2014 best known for his work with Mike Leigh \u2014 revealed that Norton had been invested in the film for a long time, ever since snapping up the rights to Jonathan Lethem\u2019s 1999 novel of the same name.\n\n\u201cEdward carried this film with him for 20 years,\u201d said Pope. \u201cHe had a complete vision for it, from beginning to end. And, actually, that vision never wavered. When he first asked me to read the script, he sent me a look-book of visual ideas for the film and it was absolutely beautiful. You could have published it. It was beautiful, noirish and incredibly exciting, and challenging visually. And I must say a lot of the images within that book are on the screen.\u201d\n\nThe film captures that flavor of classic noir, but Pope said that he\u2019d taken care to make sure that seemed organic rather than stylized and synthetic. \u201cEdward wanted the patina of old cinema, that rich and lush look, but without it looking like (we\u2019d used) a special treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I shot with old lenses, which is exactly what I\u2019d shot Mr Turner with. Old 40s and 50 lenses. Lenses that have flaws, aberrations in them. They\u2019re not quite right, and I found that worked really well, in terms of combating the modern with the old.\u201d\n\nBAFTA and Golden Globe-nominated composer Daniel Pemberton (Yesterday, Molly\u2019s Game, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse) joined the conversation to explain that he, too, had been experimental in terms of finding the right feel for the film. \u201cThe main protagonist is a guy called Lionel who\u2019s got Tourette\u2019s Syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cThe score is trying to capture the story from his perspective, and there\u2019s two elements to him. There\u2019s a very restless side to him \u2014 his mind is constantly ticking over \u2014 and then there are scenes where he\u2019s more focused and there\u2019s a serenity there. But one of the big things Edward and I also talked about trying to do was create a sense of the time period, and so the world of the film is steeped in jazz.\u201d", "description": "Warner Bros presented a very eclectic but solidly awards-friendly slate at The Contenders London today, headed up by Todd Phillips\u2019 recent Venice Golden Lion winner Joker. \u201cMost composers have a director they work with, but I -- accidentally -- had an actor,\u201d laughed Joker composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir", "authors": ["Damon Wise"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xz.gbCgItFGImFjmZsZ0Tw--~B/aD0xMzY1O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deadline.com/f195190da3d3f074518d15e47255c141", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
