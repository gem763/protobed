The Nasdaq COMP, -1.60% fell 117 points, 1.5%, to 7,792.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 have now both broken below their 100-day moving averages.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dow DJIA, -1.79% lost 344 points, or 1.3%, to finish 26,573.04, the S&P 500 SPX, -1.72% fell 37 points, or 1.2%, to end at 2,940.25.

The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 4.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nA private-sector employment report from Automatic Data Processing showed that a modest 135,000 jobs were created in September, another sign that hiring is slowing along with the broader U.S. economy. That missed the Econoday consensus forecast of 152,000 jobs. The average monthly job growth for the past three months also fell to 145,000 from 214,000 for the same time period last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. Everyone smells a weakening economy,\u201d said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard. \u201cThe ISM data spooked them, the construction data sucked and everyone realizes the economy is slowing down. There\u2019s nothing that says recession yet but everyone\u2019s looking around the corner.\u201d\n\nMarket participants are hoping the Federal Reserve will further lower interest rates when it meets in October, but the Fed may be reluctant to cut again with rates not far from zero, Blitz said. \u201cAll you hear about from the Fed is how they don\u2019t have a lot of basis points to give away so they have to be careful and do maximum effect.\u201d\n\nBut if economic data continues to disappoint, \u201cthe data might force their hands,\u201d Blitz told MarketWatch.\n\nThe ADP payrolls report is published ahead of the more closely followed U.S. Labor Department\u2019s nonfarm-payroll report due on Friday.\n\nLater Wednesday morning, the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of the U.S. in its pursuit of additional tariffs against E.U. goods over what the Trump administration says is illegal subsidies granted to Airbus. As much as $7.5 billion of imports could be subject to fresh tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. and China are due to resume talks next week on resolving the trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nIn other data, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude oil inventories were up 3.1 million barrels compared to last week, marking the third-straight weekly increase, another signal of a slowing economy as demand slackens.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.62% shares rose nearly 3% after the company cut a deal to avoid an upcoming opioid litigation trial.\n\nShares of pharmaceutical company Savara Inc. SVRA, -58.16% tumbled 47% in morning trading after the company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found its application for a new medication insufficient.\n\nDiscount-broker stocks continued to fall after the Tuesday announcement by Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, -2.90% that it would cut most trading commissions to zero. TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp. AMTD, -2.44% lost 3% in early-morning trading.\n\nFord F, -3.93% fell after the automaker reported third-quarter vehicle sales fell 4.9% from a year ago to 580,251 vehicles, as a 10.5% drop in sport-utility vehicle (SUV) sales and a 29.5% tumble in car sales offset an 8.8% rise in truck sales. General Motors GM, -3.66% also fell after reporting poor quarterly sales.\n\nBoeing BA, -2.74% was lower after a report said an engineer filed an internal ethics complaint over the company\u2019s decision to reject a safety system for the 737 Max on cost grounds that he believed could have reduced risks tied to two fatal crashes.\n\nHow did other markets trade?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.47% was down nearly 4 basis points to 1.61% on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery CLX19, -2.16% was down 85 cents, about 1.5%, to $52.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nGold for December delivery GCZ19, +1.03% jumped $12.40, nearly 0.9%, to reach $1,501.90 an ounce.\n\nIn Asia, Chinese equity benchmarks were closed in observance of the 70th anniversary of Communist rule.
