If there\u2019s one night when people can actually get away with doing whatever they want regardless of consequences, it\u2019s the Purge (as coined by The Purge movie). Sure, the fictional annual event takes place in March and Halloween takes place in October, but otherwise the two are a natural match. The Purge movie costumes are also insanely easy ways to look terrifying on Halloween, since a mask is doing most of the work for you.\n\nThe first film in the franchise, The Purge, came out in 2013, and there have been four sequels and a TV show since. (A fifth sequel is tentatively planned for summer 2020.) That means we have at least half a decade of creepy masks to draw from when it comes time to plan your Purge outfit. (And, as the sequels have gone on, the masks have only gotten more creative and more elaborate.) You can also try achieving the look with just face paint and ditch the mask entirely.\n\nNot a fan of The Purge but dig the ease of these costumes?
