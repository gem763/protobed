Adesanya\u2019s victory this past Saturday night at UFC 243 has only furthered the rivalry and stimulated a deeper war of words. It\u2019s only been three days, but the two champions have verbally sparred multiple times.\n\nAs a result of comments made by Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) on Monday, Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC) fired back with some heated words of his own Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn a series of tweets, the light heavyweight champ targeted Adesanya\u2019s love for \u201cDragon Ball Z\u201d in vintage Jones fashion. In the first of three tweets, Jones quoted Adesanya\u2019s comments and added his own editorial.\n\nAll I hear is \u201cI\u2019m a bitch, I dance better than Jones.\u201d Oh and some weird shit about big American balls in your mouth. https://t.co/aLNjHVBsTF \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 8, 2019\n\nIn the second of three messages, Jones was more direct when he flung insults at the Nigeria-born New Zealander\u2019s love for \u201cDragon Ball Z.\u201d The light heavyweight champion questioned Adesanya\u2019s career goals and called him a \u201c(expletive) nerd.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not out here searching for dragon ball Z fans, I\u2019m in pursuit of these history books. Being mentioned with history\u2018s greatest combatants ever. Fucking nerd \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 8, 2019\n\nJones\u2019 final jab kept things short and sweet, but he still managed to sneak in some expletives nonetheless. The tweet was a compliment toward \u201cDragon Ball Z\u201d \u2013 but more so a backhanded one directed at Adesanya.\n\nYou\u2019re right, dragon ball Z is way too gangster for his bitch ass https://t.co/59yyVHTgZq \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 8, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no telling if Adesanya and Jones will square off in the future, but if they do, their organic promotion has put a \u201csuper\u201d in \u201csuperfight.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
