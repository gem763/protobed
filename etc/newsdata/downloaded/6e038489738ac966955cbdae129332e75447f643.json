While Apple has succeeded in turning its white, dangling AirPods into a status symbol, wireless ear buds are gaining popularity despite, not because of, their design.\n\nTo the credit of those companies, product design experts say it\u2019s difficult to create a pair of wireless, Bluetooth-enabled devices that sit comfortably but unobtrusively in the ear, provide high-quality sound and still capture the user\u2019s voice. For one thing, the human body interferes with Bluetooth signals, so transmitting information to both ear buds in a synchronized fashion is complicated.\n\nThe newest devices to enter the fray are Microsoft\u2019s Surface Earbuds, which the company unveiled this week at an event. The ear buds have touch and voice controls and retail for $249. The most visible part of each bud is a flat white disc that measures slightly less than an inch in diameter, about the size of a quarter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast week, Amazon announced its $129.99 Echo Buds, which are black, resemble round earplugs and are also about the size of a quarter. Visually, they are similar to Samsung\u2019s equally priced Galaxy Buds, which are available in black, white and yellow and debuted in February.\n\nRock this way: AirPods, Beats and Bose wireless earbuds take the headbang test\n\nNone of the devices has escaped the wrath of social media. When they were introduced, AirPods were the butt of many a Twitter joke, and the devices have since been compared to Q-tips, corn cob holders and \u201can angry praying mantis.\u201d Only after competitors were introduced did they seem streamlined in comparison. The Surface Earbuds were variously described on the Web this week as refrigerator magnets, the mint candy Mentos, ear gauges and \u201cchonky bois,\u201d a term used to describe pudgy pets.\n\n\u201cSo Apple ear buds look like cigarettes hanging out of your ears while Surface ear buds look like you\u2019ve been tagged as a part of an animal migration experiment,\u201d tweeted Kevin Giszewski, a software engineer and podcast creator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo Apple earbuds look like cigarettes hanging out of your ears while Surface earbuds look like you've been tagged as a part of an animal migration experiment.#MicrosoftEvent #microsoft pic.twitter.com/s56p9wtsZQ \u2014 Kevin Giszewski (@KevinGiszewski) October 2, 2019\n\nApple, Samsung and Microsoft didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nOther tech companies have followed Apple\u2019s lead in part because ear buds have become big business for the company. Though Apple doesn\u2019t disclose AirPods sales, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates that the company will sell between 55 million and 60 million AirPods this year, the equivalent of roughly $9 billion in revenue. That\u2019s an important source of income as consumer interest in the iPhone wanes and the global smartphone market begins to slow.\n\nThe Apple Card is a beautiful baby bird and should be handled as such\n\nIn addition to seeing wireless ear buds as a cash cow, companies also view the devices as a path to lock consumers into their product and service ecosystem, as well as a way to bring digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa into the user\u2019s broader world.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft\u2019s Earbuds allow users to open their Outlook email and calendars with their voice and instantly stream music by triple-clicking either bud. Consumers can also use the buds to interact with their PowerPoint presentations.\n\nIves said there is a small window of opportunity for other ear bud manufacturers to encroach on Apple\u2019s market dominance before the third-generation AirPods are released, which Ives says is likely to happen in early to mid-December. He expects the devices to include active noise-canceling technology, which is present in the Echo Buds and some other manufacturers\u2019 products but not the Surface Earbuds or Galaxy Buds. The market penetration for wireless headphones is 10 percent to 12 percent, according to Ives. While it would be difficult for anyone to make a dent in Apple\u2019s market share, tech companies are still trying.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s an all-out assault,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThese are really aggressive moves by competitors.\u201d\n\nTruly wireless headphones first appeared on the market in 2015 \u2014 devices from Earin and Bragi were among the initial batch \u2014 and became more popular after Apple\u2019s AirPods launched in 2016. The devices have become such a symbol that retailer ASOS is selling an AirPod-like \u201cfaux headphone ear piece\u201d for $9.50.\n\nApple\u2019s market share was 53 percent in the second quarter of 2019, according to a Counterpoint Research report, the equivalent of about 14.3 million devices. That\u2019s a decline from the 60 percent share Apple had for the prior two quarters, a slide driven by sales from second-tier competitors like Xiaomi AirDots. Samsung holds the No. 2 spot behind Apple with 8 percent market share.\n\nAD\n\nIf your spouse snores like a warthog, Bose has some new headphones for you\n\nTech industry analyst Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies said she believes Microsoft\u2019s Surface Earbuds could capture some of Apple\u2019s market share because consumers will value the device for its ability to interact with Microsoft\u2019s other software and not just its sound transmission capabilities.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think about it as, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to a store for ear buds, and here is what I\u2019m getting,\u2019 \u201d Milanesi said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, \u2018I\u2019m a Surface person. I buy into the brand. I\u2019m a heavy Office user, and I want to use this with the capabilities that Office brings to me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn that sense, the Surface Earbuds are more comparable to Amazon\u2019s Echo Buds, which Amazon touts as being seamlessly integrated with its Alexa digital assistant.\n\nAs for Giszewski, he says he\u2019s sticking with the \u201cgarden-variety\u201d wireless ear buds he purchased for $30. That is, he said, until tech companies can come up with something that looks less ridiculous.\n\nAD", "description": "Apple is leading with AirPods that don\u2019t look like giant Mentos.", "authors": ["Marie C.
