Does anyone care?\n\nThe death of the signature has been predicted for many years, but another knell has just been sounded: after a 20-month investigation, the Law Commission has ruled that electronic signatures are, in most cases, a \u201cviable alternative to handwritten ones\u201d.\n\nElectronic signatures have been around in one form or another for a while \u2013 they include clicking on \u201cI accept\u201d buttons, as well as apps that allow you to upload a signature for PDF contracts. But the handwritten signature had a relatively short life as a legally binding flourish: before most people could write, the point of signing a document was that you performed the act in front of a witness. That\u2019s why, legally, an X would always suffice.\n\nBack when they mattered, most of us spent almost as much time practising our signatures as we did learning to forge our mother\u2019s.

Nobody looks at the name scrawled on the back of your credit card any more. The mark you make with your fingernail on the iPad of a van driver in acknowledgement of a delivery bears no resemblance to your name, or even to writing \u2013 you\u2019d struggle to produce a legible X. No one cares.\n\nCelebrities used to have to sign a lot of autographs, but the selfie is now the preferred form of keepsake, and typically more valuable.\n\nFor the moment, authors still need to sign books, and Wimbledon players still put their mark on oversized tennis balls, but the increasing invalidity of the signature has made even these gestures seem suspect.
