REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nAt 1527 GMT the rand was 0.66% weaker at 15.2900 per dollar.\n\n\u201cAn optimistic move by the rand to test the R15.00/$ mark was short-lived as renewed risk-off sentiment filtered into markets yesterday, with trade tension once again taking centre stage,\u201d Bianca Botes, treasury partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, said in a note.\n\nTop-level trade discussions between the United States and China are scheduled for Oct. 10-11, with reports that the Trump administration was moving ahead with discussions on curbing capital flows into China keeping investors on edge.\n\nWashington also blacklisted eight Chinese tech companies, while U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a deal to end the trade dispute may not yet be quite in the offing.\n\nElsewhere reports that Brexit talks between Britain and Brussels were close to breaking down added further uncertainty.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the minutes from the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s September meeting on Wednesday for clues on whether the central bank will cut rates at its October session.\n\n\u201cThe rand could well claw its way back to R15.00, and below, should risk sentiment improve and expectations of a Fed rate cut towards the end of the month prevail,\u201d Botes said.\n\nOn the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index fell 0.35% to 48,465 points, while the All-Share index dropped 0.48% to 54,454 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot of noise-making, one big melting pot of uncertainty, and markets don\u2019t like that,\u201d said Ryan Woods, a trader at Independent Securities. \u201cThat is why you are seeing this progressive sell-off across the board.\u201d\n\nAmong the fallers on the Top-40 index, Absa slid 2.20% to 149.00 rand and Shoprite weakened 1.81% to 124.97 rand.\n\nCurbing further losses were gold shares, which rose 1.82% as global uncertainty sparked a flight to safe-haven assets.\n\nHarmony Gold rose 2.7% 48.35 rand, Gold Fields gained 1.86% to 83.84 rand and AngloGold Ashanti closed up 1.47% at 315.55 rand.\n\nIn fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 added 6.5 basis points to 8.28%.", "description": "South Africa's rand and stocks weakened on Tuesday as concerns over the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks and escalating tensions between London and Brussels sparked a flight to safety, denting appetite for riskier but high-yielding assets.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438500943&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9719P-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
