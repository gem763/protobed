This pattern of destruction that takes months to recover from is usually encountered during ransomware infections only.\n\nIncident has long-lasting effects on Demant's business\n\nBut while the company's staff have been recovering IT infrastructure, the biggest losses came from the impact of not having access to these systems in the first place.\n\nThe company reported \"delays in the supply of products as well as an impact on our ability to receive orders.\"\n\nFurthermore, \"in our hearing aid retail business, many clinics across our network have not been able to service end-users in a regular fashion.\"\n\nThese business upheavals have been a disaster for the company's bottom line. In a message to its investors, Demant said it expects to lose somewhere between $80 million and $95 million.\n\nThe sum would have been higher, but the company expects to cash in a $14.6 million cyber insurance policy.\n\nMost of the losses have come from lost sales and the company not being able to fulfill orders. The actual cost of recovering and rebuilding its IT infrastructure were only around $7.3 million, a small sum compared to the grand total.\n\n\"Approximately half of the estimated lost sales relates to our hearing aid wholesale business. The incident has prevented us from executing our ambitious growth activities in some of the most important months of the year - particularly in the US, which is our biggest market,\" Demant said in a press release last week.\n\n\"A little less than half of the estimated lost sales relates to our retail business where a significant number of clinics have been unable to service end-users in a regular fashion. We estimate that our retail business will see the biggest impact in Australia, the US and Canada followed by the UK. The vast majority of our clinics are now fully operational, however, due to the effect of the incident on our ability to generate new appointments during September, we expect some lost sales in the next one or two months, which is also included in the current estimate.\n\n\"Our remaining business activities, Hearing Implants, Diagnostics and Personal Communication, have also been impacted by the incident, but with a relatively smaller overall Group impact due to the nature and size of these businesses,\" it added.\n\nThe company expects the incident to have a long-lasting effect on its bottom line, proving again why businesses can't ignore their cyber-security posture anymore.\n\nDemant is not the only major company to suffer a major cyber-security infection in the past year. Past incidents mostly include ransomware incidents, such as those at defence contractor Rheinmetall, airplane parts manufacturer Asco, aluminum provider Norsk Hydro, cyber-security firm Verint, the UK Police Federation, utility vehicles manufacturer Aebi Schmidt, Arizona Beverages, engineering firm Altran, the Cleveland international airport, and chemicals producers Hexion and Momentive.", "description": "After a month, hearing aid manufacturer Demant has yet to recover after the attack.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/e8bee033-2dad-4651-bdca-8784ccaac1ba/thumbnail/770x578/969c7339f781a26f39723499672e0854/hearing-aid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
