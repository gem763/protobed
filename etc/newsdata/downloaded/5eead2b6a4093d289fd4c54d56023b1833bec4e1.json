Reuters\n\nSpanish fashion retail chain Zara has landed in hot water in China, one of the world\u2019s most lucrative fashion markets.\n\nThe fast fashion brand had on Monday (September 2) been accused by Chinese media for allegedly supporting Hong Kong\u2019s protests. In particular, the Global Times \u2013 a newspaper affiliated with Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily \u2013 reported that it closed some of its stores in the city for one day.\n\nA notice put up on a Zara store in Hong Kong on September 2. Weibo\n\nIn a strongly-worded article, the Global Times said Zara had closed the stores on the same day that tens of thousands of Hong Kong\u2019s anti-extradition student protesters went on strike by skipping classes on the first day of school.\n\n\u201cWhy did some Zara stores in Hong Kong close for a day at such a sensitive time? There are reasons to question this. Zara has not taken active steps to eliminate this doubt quickly,\u201d the article said.\n\nIt added: \u201cOne cannot help but conclude that the management of Zara Hong Kong, or at least some of its stores, is willing to echo the three strikes. They are even willing to make a special show of it. They probably think that some of the risk is worth it.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times also demanded a \u201csolemn explanation\u201d from the Inditex-owned fashion house, before ending with a warning that \u201cZara should not make serious misjudgments\u201d.\n\nNews of Zara\u2019s selected store closures appeared to anger Chinese netizens, who called for a boycott of the brand.\n\nIn response, Zara said on Monday night that it supported the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy in Hong Kong, adding that it \u201chas never supported the strikes\u201d.\n\nHowever, Chinese netizens seemed unimpressed with Zara\u2019s statement, pointing out that the brand still had not explained why only some of its stores were closed on the day of the student strikes.\n\n\u201cThey should remain shut, not come out with statement. It\u2019s exhausting. Just shut down and it will be easier,\u201d one Weibo user said.\n\nAnother said: \u201c(Zara) copies the designs of the first class, but has second class workmanship and third class quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to earn Chinese money but don\u2019t support China. No point buying such a brand,\u201d one consumer added.\n\nOne Weibo user referenced recent controversies surrounding other brands that were seen as supportive of the protests by writing: \u201cThanks to Hong Kong\u2019s mess, we can save lots of money. No need to drink (Hong Kong) milk tea, and no need to buy so and so brands. How awesome.\u201d\n\nRead also:\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam reportedly said she would quit if she could and had \u2018very limited\u2019 ability to contain protests\n\n[PHOTOS] Police wallop people in train, protesters bash MTR stations: here\u2019s a rundown of Hong Kong\u2019s violent weekend\n\nZara is part of the biggest fashion company in the world.
