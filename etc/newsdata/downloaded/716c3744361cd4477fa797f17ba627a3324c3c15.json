I looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u2019\u201d Biden recalled telling Poroshenko.\n\n\u201cWell, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,\u201d Biden told the Council on Foreign Relations event, insisting that President Obama was in on the threat.\n\nInterviews with a half-dozen senior Ukrainian officials confirm Biden\u2019s account, though they claim the pressure was applied over several months in late 2015 and early 2016, not just six hours of one dramatic day. Whatever the case, Poroshenko and Ukraine\u2019s parliament obliged by ending Shokin\u2019s tenure as prosecutor. Shokin was facing steep criticism in Ukraine, and among some U.S. officials, for not bringing enough corruption prosecutions when he was fired.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials tell me there was one crucial piece of information that Biden must have known but didn\u2019t mention to his audience: The prosecutor he got fired was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings that employed Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, as a board member.\n\nU.S. banking records show Hunter Biden\u2019s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts \u2014 usually more than $166,000 a month \u2014 from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.\n\nThe general prosecutor\u2019s official file for the Burisma probe \u2014 shared with me by senior Ukrainian officials \u2014 shows prosecutors identified Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm, Rosemont Seneca, as potential recipients of money.\n\nShokin told me in written answers to questions that, before he was fired as general prosecutor, he had made \u201cspecific plans\u201d for the investigation that \u201cincluded interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would like to emphasize the fact that presumption of innocence is a principle in Ukraine\u201d and that he couldn\u2019t describe the evidence further.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWilliam Russo, a spokesman for Joe Biden, and Hunter Biden did not respond to email messages Monday seeking comment. The phone number at Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC in Washington was no longer in service on Monday.\n\nThe timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s and Archer\u2019s appointment to Burisma\u2019s board has been highlighted in the past, by The New York Times in December 2015 and in a 2016 book by conservative author Peter Schweizer.\n\nAlthough Biden made no mention of his son in his 2018 speech, U.S. and Ukrainian authorities both told me Biden and his office clearly had to know about the general prosecutor's probe of Burisma and his son's role. They noted that:\n\nHunter Biden's appointment to the board was widely reported in American media;\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kiev that coordinated Biden's work in the country repeatedly and publicly discussed the general prosecutor's case against Burisma;\n\nGreat Britain took very public action against Burisma while Joe Biden was working with that government on Ukraine issues;\n\nBiden's office was quoted, on the record, acknowledging Hunter Biden's role in Burisma in a New York Times article about the general prosecutor's Burisma case that appeared four months before Biden forced the firing of Shokin. The vice president's office suggested in that article that Hunter Biden was a lawyer free to pursue his own private business deals.\n\nPresident Obama named Biden the administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine in February 2014, after a popular revolution ousted Russia-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych and as Moscow sent military forces into Ukraine\u2019s Crimea territory.\n\nAccording to Schweizer\u2019s book, Vice President Biden met with Archer in April 2014 right as Archer was named to the board at Burisma. A month later, Hunter Biden was named to the board, to oversee Burisma\u2019s legal team.\n\nBut the Ukrainian investigation and Joe Biden\u2019s effort to fire the prosecutor overseeing it has escaped without much public debate.\n\nMost of the general prosecutor\u2019s investigative work on Burisma focused on three separate cases, and most stopped abruptly once Shokin was fired. The most prominent of the Burisma cases was transferred to a different Ukrainian agency, closely aligned with the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, known as the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), according to the case file and current General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.\n\nNABU closed that case, and a second case involving alleged improper money transfers in London was dropped when Ukrainian officials failed to file the necessary documents by the required deadline. The general prosecutor\u2019s office successfully secured a multimillion-dollar judgment in a tax evasion case, Lutsenko said. He did not say who was the actual defendant in that case.\n\nAs a result, the Biden family appeared to have escaped the potential for an embarrassing inquiry overseas in the final days of the Obama administration and during an election in which Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonMcConnell hits Pelosi for having 'crumbled' to liberal pressure Poll: Biden leads 2020 Democrats by 2 points as Warren surges Hillary Clinton backs impeachment inquiry into Trump MORE was running for president in 2016.\n\nBut then, as Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign ramped up over the past year, Lutsenko \u2014 the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden once hailed as a \u201csolid\u201d replacement for Shokin \u2014 began looking into what happened with the Burisma case that had been shut down.\n\nLutsenko told me that, while reviewing the Burisma investigative files, he discovered \u201cmembers of the Board obtained funds as well as another U.S.-based legal entity, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, for consulting services.\u201d\n\nLutsenko said some of the evidence he knows about in the Burisma case may interest U.S. authorities and he\u2019d like to present that information to new U.S. Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrDemocratic senators request probe into whistleblower complaint The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by National Association of Manufacturers - Trump defends Ukraine motives while attacking Biden Trump walks tightrope on gun control MORE, particularly the vice president\u2019s intervention.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Biden had correlated and connected this aid with some of the HR (personnel) issues and changes in the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Lutsenko said.\n\nNazar Kholodnytskyi, the lead anti-corruption prosecutor in Lutsenko\u2019s office, confirmed to me in an interview that part of the Burisma investigation was reopened in 2018, after Joe Biden made his remarks. \u201cWe were able to start this case again,\u201d Kholodnytskyi said.\n\nBut he said the separate Ukrainian police agency that investigates corruption has dragged its feet in gathering evidence. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any result from this case one year after the reopening because of some external influence,\u201d he said, declining to be more specific.\n\nUkraine is in the middle of a hard-fought presidential election, is a frequent target of intelligence operations by neighboring Russia and suffers from rampant political corruption nationwide. Thus, many Americans might take the restart of the Burisma case with a grain of salt, and rightfully so.\n\nBut what makes Lutsenko\u2019s account compelling is that federal authorities in America, in an entirely different case, uncovered financial records showing just how much Hunter Biden\u2019s and Archer\u2019s company received from Burisma while Joe Biden acted as Obama\u2019s point man on Ukraine.\n\nBetween April 2014 and October 2015, more than $3 million was paid out of Burisma accounts to an account linked to Biden\u2019s and Archer\u2019s Rosemont Seneca firm, according to the financial records placed in a federal court file in Manhattan in an unrelated case against Archer.\n\nThe bank records show that, on most months when Burisma money flowed, two wire transfers of $83,333.33 each were sent to the Rosemont Seneca\u2013connected account on the same day. The same Rosemont Seneca\u2013linked account typically then would pay Hunter Biden one or more payments ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 each. Prosecutors reviewed internal company documents and wanted to interview Hunter Biden and Archer about why they had received such payments, according to interviews.\n\nLutsenko said Ukrainian company board members legally can pay themselves for work they do if it benefits the company\u2019s bottom line, but prosecutors never got to determine the merits of the payments to Rosemont because of the way the investigation was shut down.\n\nAs for Joe Biden\u2019s intervention in getting Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor fired in the midst of the Burisma investigation, Lutsenko suggested that was a matter to discuss with Attorney General Barr: \u201cOf course, I would be happy to have a conversation with him about this issue.\u201d\n\nAs the now-completed Russia collusion investigation showed us, every American deserves the right to be presumed innocent until evidence is made public or a conviction is secured, especially when some matters of a case involve foreigners. The same presumption should be afforded to Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, Devon Archer and Burisma in the Ukraine case.\n\nNonetheless, some hard questions should be answered by Biden as he prepares, potentially, to run for president in 2020: Was it appropriate for your son and his firm to cash in on Ukraine while you served as point man for Ukraine policy? What work was performed for the money Hunter Biden\u2019s firm received? Did you know about the Burisma probe? And when it was publicly announced that your son worked for Burisma, should you have recused yourself from leveraging a U.S. policy to pressure the prosecutor who very publicly pursued Burisma?\n\nJohn Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists\u2019 misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.
