And frankly, I am here for it. In raging torrent that is our world unravelling, we all need to grab onto something to stay afloat. In my case, it\u2019s the love handles of the bodacious brown bears of the Brooks River.\n\nFat Bear Week is a competition where the internet gets to vote on the fattest bear of Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park and Preserve. But above all, it is also a celebration of all things \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cbear.\u201d\n\nIn springtime, the bears of Katmai emerged from hibernation as shadows of their late autumn selves, having spent all winter snoozing and living off the fat they stored up. Once hibernation is over, the bears engaged in a race against time to pack on the pounds in preparation for winter. The girthy ursines have spent all summer chowing down on salmon, berries, and whatever else they can get their claws on. Anyone with an internet connection has been able to watch their transformation on webcams run by explore.org, and now we all have a chance to vote on who has become the fattest bear of the Brooks River.\n\nIntroducing the one, the only, the gloriously fat Holly - for your #FatBearWeek consideration. pic.twitter.com/h73njEYDp8 \u2014 explore.org (@exploreorg) September 30, 2019\n\nThe park has set up a single-elimination bracket, similar to March Madness but, you know, with fat bears. Folks can vote on Facebook for their favourite bears, and a winner will be crowned next Wednesday \u2014 or, as it\u2019s known on the Gregorian calendar, Fat Bear Wednesday. This marks the fifth year the park has opened up the competition to the world (in 2014, rangers began celebrating it by letting park visitors vote).\n\nBeadnose, last year\u2019s winner and subscriber to the hot girl summer ethos before it was a thing, isn\u2019t part of this year\u2019s competition. She hasn\u2019t been seen this summer, which in the wilds of Alaska is usually a sign she\u2019s gone to that salmon-filled river in the sky. But the competition does include monster bears of years past, including the aptly named 747 and Chunk as well as threepeat champion Otis.\n\nKatmai scientists will also do a more scientific assessment beyond the internet vote (shocking, I know), conducting 3D scans of the bears to gauge just how fat they really are. But while science is great and all, Fat Bear Week is really about what you feel in your heart.", "description": "Hot girl summer is all but over, but \"fat bear fall\" has arrived....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qjafrz3ynnuooboxso87.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
