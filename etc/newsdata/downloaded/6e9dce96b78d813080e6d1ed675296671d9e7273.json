Below is the word that most identifies each candidate\u2019s entire discourse over the course of the night, using established methods for determining which words are most meaningful among a sea of platitudes.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo gather a baseline of language that Republican candidates favor, TIME looked at the frequency of each word in last night\u2019s debate, the previous 2015 debate, and 11 debates from the 2012 presidential cycle. Then we looked at each candidate\u2019s responses from Thursday\u2019s debate and identified words that he used much more frequently than other GOP candidates past and present. A small amount of editorial discretion was used to pick the word that best captured a candidate\u2019s performance using this sort of analysis.\n\nAll photographs from Associated Press.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-17-at-12-18-55-am.png"}
