And that\u2019s falling on already wet ground as we\u2019ve had quite a lot of rain this weekend, so it could cause localised flooding and disruption, so it could impact rush hour this evening.\u201d\n\nA further weather warning for rain on Tuesday covers the area south of Birmingham down to the south coast, including south Wales, but not all of Cornwall and Devon.\n\nThundery downpours with the possibility of hail is expected across the south west, moving to the south east by the afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see some heavy rain,\u201d Ms Maxey said. \u201cWe could see 40-50mm possible in only a couple of hours. The clouds are quite slow moving which is why you get this build-up of rainfall.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s fairly normal for this time of year, and there\u2019s nothing unusual about it \u2013 it will just be on the tops of the mountains. We\u2019re not just about to see six foot of snow on Plymouth Hoe or in the middle of Manchester, it\u2019s just the mountain tops in Scotland.\u201d\n\nMs Maxey also said in addition to rain and the localised flood risks, there is additional concern due to the spring tides, which have been the highest of the year \u2013 posing a threat to coastal areas.\n\nLater in the week, more unsettled conditions are expected, partly due to Hurricane Lorenzo, which has now diminished to a category 2 storm. \u201cBy the time it comes to the UK it will be an ex-tropical storm, it won\u2019t be a hurricane anymore,\u201d Ms Maxey said.\n\nThe Met Office\u2019s computer weather models are yet to reach a consensus on how Lorenzo will move after it leaves the Azores, but some suggest the storm could pass by the UK entirely, others indicate it could bring strong winds to the north of Scotland, and others point to it crossing the south west of the UK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to say what the exact impact will be, but we\u2019re looking at potentially some wet and windy weather through Thursday and into Friday, but exactly how strong the winds will be and where we see the rain is a little bit uncertain at the moment.\u201d\n\nFollowing the weekend\u2019s downpours, there was no train service from Sheffield to Manchester due to water on the tracks, and there were speed restrictions in the opposite direction.\n\nThe operator warned it had imposed speed restrictions on many parts of its network due to safety concerns.\n\nNorthern Rail asked cycling fans turning out for the final day of the UCI Road World Championships in North Yorkshire on Sunday to rethink their travel plans after the route had to be changed to avoid flooding. The fanzone in Harrogate also had to be closed.\n\nDespite the heavy weather, the Men\u2019s Elite Road Race went ahead, although organisers had to amend the route to skip some of the most scenic parts of the Upper Dales.\n\nUndeterred by the appalling weather, thousands of fans lined the route with umbrellas and wellies to watch one of the biggest events on the cycling calendar.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Heavy rain, lightning and hail are set to lash\u00a0parts of the UK following a weekend of downpours which caused flooding in many areas and saw the transport network struggling to cope.
