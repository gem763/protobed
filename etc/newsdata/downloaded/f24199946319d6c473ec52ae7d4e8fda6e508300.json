I have to say if the Turkish plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don't expect the European Union to pay for any of it.' NATO NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday Turkey had 'legitimate security concerns' and had informed NATO about its attack against Kurdish fighters in Syria. 'I count on Turkey to act with restraint and ensure that any action it may take in northern Syria is proportionate and measured,' he said after meeting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. 'It is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering.' Germany German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Turkey's operation would lead to further destabilisation of the region and could strengthen Islamic State. He urged Turkey to end the operation. France France's European affairs minister Amelie de Montchalin said France and Britain would call a U.N. Security Council meeting over the Turkish offensive. France, Germany and Britain are finalising a joint statement condemning the advance. Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the operation risked destabilising the region and harming civilians. Denmark Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: 'Deeply concerned about Turkish military operation in Syria. In my view, this is a regrettable and wrong decision, which can have serious consequences for civilians and the fight against ISIL (Islamic State).' Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin urged his Turkish counterpart President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to 'think carefully' before taking any action. Erdogan for his part told Putin that the offensive 'will contribute to Syria's peace and stability and ease the path to a political solution'. Netherlands 'I call on Turkey not to follow the path it has chosen,' Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said. 'No one can benefit from the potentially terrible humanitarian consequences. The operation can trigger new refugee flows and harm the fight against IS and stability in the region.' UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had 'serious concerns' about Turkey's military action. He said: 'This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus.' Iran Iran on Thursday called for an 'immediate halt' to the Turkish Syria offensive.\n\nOne of the prisons where Islamic State detainees are held was hit by a Turkish air strike, the SDF said on Twitter.\n\nThe Turkish border town of Akcakale was quiet for much of the morning after sporadic gunfire and the sound of tank movement were heard in the early hours, Reuters journalists said. Explosions just over the border had rocked the town of Tel Abyad earlier in the night, they said.\n\nTurkey regards the Kurdish militia as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish PKK militants waging a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nTroops have entered Syria at four points, two of them close to Tel Abyad and two close to Ras al Ain further east, according to Turkish media reports. Air strikes killed at least five civilians and three SDF fighters, while dozens of civilians were wounded, the SDF said. Thousands of people fled Ras al Ain towards Hasaka province, held by the SDF.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said the group's fighters had repelled a ground attack by Turkish troops in Tel Abyad.\n\nTanks and troops had been massing on the border since Trump announced that American troops would step aside.\n\nHours after the assault was launched, President Trump tweeted that US troops should 'never have been' in the Middle East in the first place.\n\nIn Damascus, Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad warned that the Assad government 'will defend all Syrian territory and will not accept any occupation of any land or iota of the Syrian soil'.\n\nEarlier, Turkish television reports said Turkish jets had bombed Syrian Kurdish positions across the border from Turkey.\n\nIn the face of the onslaught, Kurdish authorities announced a general mobilisation, urging all civilians to 'head to the border with Turkey... to resist during this delicate historical moment'.\n\nKurdish leaders said they would hold their erstwhile US ally and the whole international community responsible for any 'humanitarian catastrophe'.\n\nIn Ras al-Ain, Kurdish-led security forces set up checkpoints and stockpiled tyres to set alight to blur the vision of Turkish military pilots.\n\nRas al-Ain was one of the places from which US troops withdrew on Monday.\n\n'We will not leave this land,' said Kaws Seem, a 32-year-old Ras al-Ain resident. 'War has been chasing us for years, and everyday Erdogan threatens us with a new attack,' he added.\n\nIt was expected that Ras al-Ain and Tal Abad would be the focus of the first assaults.\n\nKurdish forces have dug trenches and tunnels in both areas, covering streets with metal canopies to block the cameras of Turkish drones.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday he had 'serious concerns' about Turkey's military action.\n\nHe said: 'This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus.\n\n'Turkey has shown considerable generosity in hosting so many Syrian refugees.\n\n'But we will not support plans for returns until the conditions are in place for a voluntary and safe return home.'\n\nSmoke rises from Tel Arkam village in the Ras al Ain countryside on Thursday as Turkey continues its offensive into the border territory\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' military vehicles moving, at Syrian border in Akcakale district of Turkey's Sanliurfa province on Thursday\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian village of Tel Arkam on Thursday as fresh barrages rain down on the northern border today\n\nMembers of Turkey-backed Syrian National Army wave as they are on the way to northern Syria for a military operation in Kurdish areas, near the Syrian border, in Akcakale\n\nSyrian National Army members toll towards the border on Thursday as they join their comrades in the Turkish army as part of the operation\n\nSmoke rises after howitzers of Turkish Armed Forces batter targets this morning in Tell Abyad as part of Turkey's Operation Peace Spring\n\nTurkish soldiers stand guard near the Turkey Syrian border on Thursday as their comrades flood into the neighbouring country today\n\nTurkish armoured vehicles escort members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army as they enter Syria today\n\nMembers of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army roll towards the northern border of their homeland, with a machine gun mounted on the back of their truck\n\nTurkish armoured vehicles escort members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army on Thursday as forces are mustered at the border\n\nA military lorry carrying two tanks rolls towards the Syrian border in Hatay province, Turkey, on Thursday as the ground assault takes shape\n\nTurkish soldiers stand guard at Akcakale, on the Turkish side of the border, a short distance from Tell Abaid in Syria amid reports that a small force had moved into the country\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' armoured vehicles and armoured personnel carriers were seen in convoy towards the Syrian border at Turkey's Hatay yesterday\n\nCivilians ride a pickup truck as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in the northeastern town of Ras al-Ain in Syria's Hasakeh province along the Turkish border on Wednesday\n\nTurkish commandos in armoured vehicles were seen travelling towards the Syrian border on Wednesday as they are being dispatched to support border units in Hatay, Turkey\n\nTurkish Army's armoured tanks artillery fire as Turkish troops along with the Syrian National Army begin Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria on Wednesday\n\nPrior to the invasion Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, two of the four British ISIS soldiers known as the 'Beatles' were taken into US custody.\n\nThere were fears the men would escape from Syrian jail after a Turkish invasion.\n\nThey beheaded seven American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers, boasting of the butchery in videos released to the world.\n\nErdogan tweeted yesterday that his armed forces along with the Syrian National Army had launched 'Operation Peace Spring' to 'prevent the creation of a terror corridor' along the Turkish border.\n\nSmoke rises at the site of Ras al-Ayn city of Syria as Turkish troops along with the Syrian National Army begin Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' armoured vehicles and armored personnel carriers, carrying Turkish commandos move towards to Turkey's Syrian border as they are being dispatched to support the units at the border, in Kilis yesterday\n\nA woman walking as smoke billows behind her following Turkish bombardment in the northeastern town of Ras al-Ain in Syria's Hasakeh province along the Turkish border yesterday\n\nFrom the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria on Wednesday, in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, smoke billowed from a fire inside Syria during bombardment by Turkish forces\n\nLarge explosions rocked Ras al Ain, just across the border from the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.
