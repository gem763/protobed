Her movements thereafter are not known.\n\n\"We are very worried that's why we are using all forces to search for her,\" Koh Rong town governor Nuon Bunthol said.\n\nPreah Sihanouk province Police Chief Chuon Narin said at least 20 people had been questioned on whether they met Bambridge the night of the party.\n\n\"We are questioning as many people as possible and we haven't detained anyone,\" he said, adding that he feared she might have drowned.\n\nHer brother Harry Bambridge wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday: \"EVERYONE I need you all to share as much as possible about my sister. ... More noise that gets made puts more pressure on the island to find her.\"\n\nBunthol said Bambridge's brother as well as her father and mother had arrived in Cambodia on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Prak Chan Thul; editing by John Stonestreet)", "description": "Cambodian police said they had questioned at least 20 people but made no arrests as they continued the search for a 21-year-old British woman who went missing last week, as her brother urged renewed efforts to try to find her.
