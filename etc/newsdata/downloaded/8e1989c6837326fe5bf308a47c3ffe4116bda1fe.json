You are in a van full of terrorists, nervous, silent, about to do something awful. The van arrives, and a man with a bomb strapped to his chest strides out into a crowded urban space, detonator in hand. He moves to pull the trigger, and we smash cut to the title: Modern Warfare.\n\nAs an opening statement, the scene is doing a lot of things in very little time. I don\u2019t feel good about any of them.\n\nFirst, the obvious: Modern Warfare demands your attention. It\u2019s a play for shock and awe, the developers telling you to put your damn phone away because they aren\u2019t fucking around. Look a little deeper, and there\u2019s another thing this scene says: This is what modern warfare is like. People in a van with bad intentions ready to violently collide with your life at any moment. This is what our soldiers are fighting, and what you will fight over the next few hours of this game. The phrase Call of Duty is missing from that title card, suggesting that what you\u2019re about to experience isn\u2019t so simple as the franchise title would suggest. It\u2019s also a challenge\u2014do you think your morals can make it through a complicated situation like this intact? Do you know what you would do? Would it in fact be the right thing?\n\nI\u2019m only a few hours into Modern Warfare\u2019s campaign, but from the start, it is writing some exorbitant checks, and I\u2019m not confident that it can cash any of them. It\u2019s a feeling that only grows in the second level: a mass shooting in London\u2019s Piccadilly district.\n\nThis is all in the first 20 minutes.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that such events should not be depicted in a game, but that 10 years after Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\u2019s \u201cNo Russian\u201d level, there is little to commend for merely \u201cgoing there.\u201d We\u2019ve been there. The challenge is providing a compelling reason for doing it.\n\nI\u2019m not confident that one will arise, because more than anything, Modern Warfare endeavours to be a Call of Duty game. It\u2019s a sprawling military thriller with brilliant pacing and a cast of characters who each bring a different perspective to a complicated, amorphous conflict. There are chemical weapons on the loose, and the elite military forces of the United States and the United Kingdom find themselves on the same asymmetrical playing field as Russian extremists, a barely fictional terrorist organisation called Al-Qatala, and the local resistance from the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Urzikstan.\n\nCall of Duty games have traditionally postured as if their brand of military thrill ride has something meaningful to offer outside of a white-knuckle action story, that depicting the realities of conflict is a noble end in and of itself. If that were true, we\u2019d probably have noticed it sometime over the last decade. Instead, Call of Duty\u2019s influence has been most widely felt via EXP meters added to a genre of video game that never really had them before.\n\nIf there\u2019s a sliver of hope, it\u2019s that this time around, I know the characters. They make an impression, and in very little time. The CIA operative Alex, the British police Sergeant-turned-SpecOps liaison Kyle Garrick, the Urzikstani resistance leader Farah, her brother Hadir: I know their faces and voices, I understand their role in the grand scheme of things. They\u2019re introduced well, and with great economy. At times\u2014particularly when Alex begins to assist Farah\u2019s resistance\u2014Modern Warfare seems interested in criticising previous games in the series, casting you as a sympathetic version of the guerrilla fighters that other Calls of Duty had you mowing down. Other times, its only real interest in depicting an even more \u201crealistic\u201d take on combat than before seems to be simply because it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 cool, man. There is hubris in this.\n\nI want Modern Warfare to be more than an expensive, meticulously-rendered shock jock act. Because it\u2019s easy to get someone\u2019s attention with arresting imagery ripped from the headlines, but it\u2019s harder to keep that attention\u2014especially when you haven\u2019t earned it.", "description": "It opens with a suicide bombing.
