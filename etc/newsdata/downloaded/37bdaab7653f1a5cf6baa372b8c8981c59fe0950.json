Municipalities are central to the realisation of such important objectives as:\n\nRedressing apartheid\u2019s spatial geography;\n\nThe promotion of thriving local economies that facilitate social inclusion and cohesion; and\n\nCultivating an atmosphere in which the broad democratic humanist values espoused in the Constitution find meaningful expression in local communities.\n\nHe would constantly remind elected public representatives and public servants of the need to renew their commitment to serve the people with loyalty\n\nOR would have been alive to the idea of the Gross National Happiness Index, especially with regard to such indicators as the wellbeing and residents\u2019 standard of living, governance, health, education, community cohesion and diversity management.\n\nA lawyer and highly cultivated political activist, OR understood the point sharply brought into relief by successive colonial and apartheid regimes to the effect that the law is as important in shaping a society\u2019s structure and its ideational outlook as its store of factors of production \u2013 land, labour and capital.\n\nSo, he would insist that municipalities engage in a comprehensive review of their by-laws to determine the course and pace of reversing apartheid spatial geography, promoting inclusion, social cohesion and unlocking local economic potential.\n\nHe would constantly remind elected public representatives and public servants of the need to renew their commitment to serve the people with loyalty while asserting that the people are active participants in development and should, as a consequence, claim and reclaim their agency in a nationwide process of \u201cLetsema\u201d \u2013 the coming together of people for a common purpose.\n\nTambo would perhaps initiate a process of national reflection about the appropriateness of the continued use of the phrase \u201cservice delivery\u201d \u2013 which decontextualised, might increasingly inverse if not altogether distort government indigent policy measures and other tasks relative to citizens\u2019 roles and responsibilities; especially the need to promote self-reliance as a vital national attribute.\n\nHow do we engage in such an important discussion, mindful of the ambiguities immanent in it and the potential for opportunistic misreadings and misinterpretations by the ulterior-inclined?\n\nThis shortage of skills at local government remains one of the binding constraints that hinder governance and the expeditious delivery of services at this sphere.\n\nWith this in mind, OR would undoubtedly call on young professionals who, for reasons of upward mobility, prefer to work in urban areas, to consider innovative ways to avail their skills especially to rural municipalities that do not command sufficient resources to remunerate highly sought-after specialised skills, such as engineering, accountancy and medicine.\n\nFor is it not an abnormality that even after the Auditor-General has reported on the widespread problems and challenges in many of our municipalities, most of what our young people can do is to opine and express their disquiet in social and other media?\n\nWe must rekindle the spirit that shines through the famous letter in which a youth tells his parent: \u201cIf we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for [human]kind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Buffalo City Metro stands ready to engage with young and retired professionals alike as we build a database of a cadre of skilled people who serve as a port of call to address an array of challenges that cannot be resolved without marshalling skilled personnel.\n\nREAD: What kind of politics do we need?\n\nDrawing from the experience of the ANC-run farm in Mazimbu, Tanzania, OR would pose some questions about issues connected to the land as the country prepares itself for a major overhaul in land ownership patterns.\n\nThese questions would inspire a much-needed agricultural skills programme to train people in agricultural economics and modern farming methods.\n\nThe success of such a programme is as much a provincial and national government responsibility as it is the responsibility of local governments in whose jurisdictions the process of land reform will take place.\n\nGiven the highly politicised nature of the land question, OR would have reached out to our white compatriots in particular to sensitise them to the fact that their immediate and long-term interests are better served by a greater equittable share in the resources that make up our national economy rather than the continued expression of wealth and poverty in racial and gender terms.\n\nXola Pakati is mayor of the Buffalo City metro and chairperson of the SA Cities Network Council\n\n\n\n", "description": "This Sunday South Africa will celebrate the 102nd anniversary of the birth of the late former president of the ANC, Oliver Reginald Tambo, one of the most inspired and inspiring pathfinders of our freedom and democracy.", "authors": ["Xola Pakati"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6656/587114d04ccf4c1780073e20bb4e02a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
