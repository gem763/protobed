According to a cash appearance bond document obtained by ET, Marty, paid $500 to bail Dash out of jail on Monday.\n\nAccording to the Pasco County, Florida, Complaint Affidavit obtained by ET, Dash and Marty allegedly \"became involved in a verbal argument. The defendant pushed the victim and slapped him in the face. The victim sustained red scratch marks to his left upper arm from being pushed. The defendant was taken into custody for domestic battery.\"\n\nDash's manager told ET in a statement that the couple \"had a marital dispute in their Tampa, Florida, suburb.\"\n\n\"Pasco County Deputies were dispatched to their residence. No charges were pressed by her husband, however, deputies arrested Ms. Dash peacefully, as a formality,\" the statement noted.\n\n\"The marital dispute, while personal and unfortunate, has since been blown out of proportion,\" the statement continued. \"Ms. Dash is a domestic abuse survivor from a previous relationship and has championed for other abuse victims to speak up. The untruthfulness being reported saddens Ms. Dash and her family -- no further comments will be made and we ask that Ms. Dash and her family's privacy will be respected.\"\n\nDash and Marty tied the knot on April 6, 2018, 10 days after meeting for the first time.\n\nFor more on the martial dispute and subsequent legal drama, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nStacey Dash Pleads Not Guilty to Domestic Battery, Says She 'Cannot Afford to Hire a Lawyer'\n\nStacey Dash Drops Out of Congressional Race 1 Month After Announcing Campaign\n\nStacey Dash Calls Jesse Williams a 'Hollywood Plantation Slave' After His Moving BET Speech\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Dash's husband, Jeffrey Marty, addressed the actress' recent arrest in a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AuwsMs.oAid38AlRSNCMQw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/63fa7995fb75358747607f5a853bee72"}
