(AP) - Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has returned to practice on a limited basis, but tight end Miller Forristall could be out for the next six weeks.\n\nCoach Nick Saban says Tagovailoa could be \u201ca game-day decision\u201d with a sprained right ankle but he took snaps and went through some work \u201con air\u201d in Wednesday\u2019s practice. He didn\u2019t go through team drills as the second-ranked Crimson Tide prepares for the Nov. 9 game against No. 1 LSU.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a day-by-day, game-day decision,\u201d Saban said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing really else that I can say about it. I can tell you that his mentality has been really good in terms of how he\u2019s working, the things he\u2019s doing and how he\u2019s progressing and his attitude of trying to get back on the field and trying to progress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always a good sign.\u201d\n\nTagovailoa underwent a \u201ctightrope\u201d procedure on Oct. 20. The high ankle sprain is the same injury the 2018 Heisman Trophy runner-up suffered in the Southeastern Conference championship game last season, just to the other ankle.\n\nHe returned in time to play in the College Football Playoffs against Oklahoma, but this would be a quicker comeback.\n\nMac Jones started for the Tide against Arkansas last weekend.\n\nForristall got hit in the throat in the Arkansas game and had surgery to repair an injury to his voice box.\n\nForristall has 12 catches for 131 yards and three touchdowns. Saban says it didn\u2019t initially seem like a serious injury and Forristall was able to return to the game. Backup tight end Major Tennison has 21 yards and a TD on three catches.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has returned to practice on a limited basis, but tight end Miller Forristall could be out for the next six weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/arkansas_alabama_football_59761_c0-121-2907-1816_s1200x700.jpg?311fa84d110a9596e3dcbd636287ecc6aefaa425", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
