As Moussa Sissoko embarked on a surge out of his own half, the Liverpool midfielder attempted to stop him. He was stretching to make the challenge but not stretching far enough. Sissoko skipped away, evaded another tackle by Georginio Wijnaldum and in doing so launched the move that resulted in Tottenham Hotspur taking the lead after just 47 seconds.\n\nBut for the subsequent 5,353 seconds plus stoppage time, it was hard to find any fault with his performance. No player on the pitch at Anfield made more successful tackles. No player made more interceptions. Only Dejan Lovren made more recoveries. Only Trent Alexander-Arnold created more chances. Only Andy Robertson completed more passes in the attacking third. He was everywhere and everything to Liverpool\u2019s performance.\n\nOne of Fabinho\u2019s few unsuccessful attempts at playing the ball was actually the most significant pass of all. His chip over the top of Tottenham\u2019s defence brushed Danny Rose but still found Jordan Henderson, who duly scored Liverpool\u2019s equaliser. The touch off Rose meant the pass was recorded as inaccurate and he was deprived of an assist. It would have garnished an already excellent performance.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But whatever combinations are suggested, Fabinho\u2019s place is non-negotiable. He is the one constant in every preferred line-up because he effortlessly balances the fragile attack-defence equilibrium of Klopp\u2019s system.\n\nPep Lijnders, Klopp\u2019s assistant, put it best in an interview with ESPN in February. \u201cInside the \u2018organised chaos\u2019 that we want, that we like, he is like a lighthouse,\u201d he said of Fabinho. The Brazilian is there to prevent accidents, sweeping up opposition counter-attacks which come when your full-backs play more like wingers. \u201cHis timing, his vision, his calmness, it gives another dimension to our midfield play,\u201d Lijnders explained.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

His debut only came in September. His first Premier League minutes were a month later. In fact, Sunday marked the anniversary of his first league start \u2013 a 4-1 win over Cardiff City. In his next, in a 1-1 draw at Arsenal, he played poorly.\n\n\u201cYou know in the beginning I thought we had to change the system to a \u2018double six\u2019 midfield that he was used to at Monaco,\u201d Klopp revealed this week. Liverpool did play with two deep-lying midfielders at times early last season, particularly in the winter months when Fabinho began to play more regularly. It is a testament to his talents that Klopp altered a tried-and-tested system to better accommodate his new \u00a343.7m signing.\n\nBut by and large, Klopp\u2019s treatment of the 26-year-old was largely one of tough love, keeping him out of the starting line-up until convinced that he was completely ready. Compare that to this season, when Fabinho has started 14 of Liverpool\u2019s 16 games, playing in all but the EFL Cup win at MK Dons.\n\nOf the 29 league games he has started during his Anfield career, Liverpool have won 25, drawn five and lost none. He was only a second-half substitute at the Etihad in January, when Manchester City inflicted the only defeat that Klopp\u2019s side would suffer all season.\n\nMeanwhile, at City, Pep Guardiola has been trialling a new holding midfielder. Rodri has started well enough but there have been occasions where he has appeared out of sync with his side\u2019s pressing and general style of play. Injuries have not helped, least of all the one the Spaniard himself suffered earlier this week, but Guardiola tends to throw new signings straight in regardless. Perhaps if he had given Rodri more time to adapt, the gap at the top would be smaller than six points.\n\nAfter all, they only need look at the base of Liverpool\u2019s midfield to see a player who was eased in gently and is now arguably the league\u2019s best in his position.", "description": "The day did not start particularly well for Fabinho.
