(Picture: Channel 4/Getty)\n\nThe Circle favourite Tim was an instant hit with viewers thanks to his eccentric personality and lovable demeanor, but now the theology professor has divided viewers by stanning Margaret Thatcher.\n\nDuring last night\u2019s episode, the contestants were discussing politics, when Tim shook all of Twitter.\n\n\u2018I adore Mrs Thatcher,\u2019 he said.\n\nHe also riled up millions when declared the former Prime Minister \u2018got it right\u2019.\n\nIn turn, viewers flocked to Twitter to share their dismay (and shock) at the dramatic turn of events.\n\nme watching tim saying he loved thatcher, please don\u2019t ruin it for yourself tim #thecircle pic.twitter.com/8mPwPsswkG \u2014 \ud835\udcbf\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udcb9\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udc52 \u2728 (@jcdiet) October 9, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I trusted you Tim!\u2019 one exasperated fan fumed.\n\nAnother added: \u2018Please don\u2019t ruin it for yourself Tim.\u2019\n\nFans also made the point that Tim, a gay man, showing his support for the former Conservative leader didn\u2019t exactly line up with her stance on LGBT+ rights.\n\nTim now faces a backlash against viewers (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018How can Tim as a gay man say Margaret Thatcher \u201cgot it right\u201d?\u2019 one critic asked. \u2018When section 28 went through on her watch?\n\nSection 28 was a law passed by Thatcher\u2019s government which made the \u2018promotion\u2019 of homosexuality illegal throughout schools and local authorities in Britain.\n\nNo Tim.. Thatcher was a terrible prime minister. Her stance on LGBT+ rights was disgusting. #TheCircle \u2014 Danny (@r2danny2) October 9, 2019\n\nHow can Tim as a gay man say Margaret Thatcher 'got it right' when Section 28 went through on her watch? And he's the favourite?! #thecircle \u2014 Sam McFaul (@SamMcFaul) October 9, 2019\n\nHave seriously gone off #TheCircle with the amount of Thatcher sycophants in there. Tim especially. An educated, articulate, intelligent gay man who lived through that era, and he's a Thatcher fan-boy? The failure of the British education system laid bare to see. \u2014 Sal (@muddyringlets) October 10, 2019\n\nOf course, some fans still supported Tim, and praised the 58-year-old for speaking his mind.\n\nIf you liked Tim but now don\u2019t because he liked Thatcher then you need to have a long hard look at yourself in the mirror. You can like someone who has different political views to you #TheCircle \u2014 Neil Monnery (@neilmonnery) October 9, 2019\n\nI don't care on the Tim Thatcher stuff.. no one is perfect, he is still the best by a country mile + at least he has been open and honesty throughout which is more that can be said for most of the others #TheCircle #Backstabbers \u2014 Danny Jackson (@JustDanny92) October 9, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEagle-eyed viewers also yesterday uncovered a tragic story from Tim\u2019s past as his partner Necati opened up about a traumatic event from his past.\n\nTim was also one of the only players to successfully guess that the dumped Beth and Jack were catfishing the group as \u2018Joyce.\u2019\n\nThe Circle airs weekdays from 10pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
