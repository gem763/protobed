I just thank God he came out with the help of friends and a passer by.\n\n\"I thought he was joking when he first told me. It gave him such a shock, it has left us all feeling shocked about what happened.\"\n\n(Image: birminghammail.co.uk/)\n\nThe mother-of-two said her son was soaking when he came home. He had visited the nearby Premier Inn, where hotel staff kindly provided towels so he could dry himself down a little.\n\nOn the very same night, Steve Worthington and his 11-year-old son Lewis stepped straight into the water.\n\nThe 41-year-old had to battle to keep his lad\u2019s head above the water as they desperately tried to clamber to safety.\n\nWe just stepped straight in and went straight under the water,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have never been down there and we couldn\u2019t see any warning signs in place. The whole area is thick green weeds \u2013 it looks just like grass.\n\n\u201cThe water was freezing cold and me and we must have gone under quite a few times, it was so scary. We must have been struggling for like five minutes.\"\n\nMr Worthington said he has since had nightmares since the plunge and his youngster is now mentally scared.\n\n(Image: birminghammail.co.uk/)\n\nA spokesman for the Canal & River Trust, which oversees the waterway near to the site, said: \u201cWe are aware that there is a problem with an overgrowth of weed in the basin, which can make it seem as though the area is covered in thick grass, hiding the water underneath.\n\n\u201cSafety signs have been installed at the basin warning people of the danger. Removing the weed is an ongoing battle and there will be a team from Canal & River Trust out in the basin to clear sections of the weed in the next few days.\u201d\n\nBut Rebecca Whitehouse from the charity warned the weeds would likely be back soon. She added: \"This weed is a ferocious grower and, as soon as we\u2019ve cleared it, it grows back in a matter of days. Not only does the weed create a hazard as people and pets get confused thinking its grass, but it is also really costly to remove.\"", "description": "New signs have been installed by the Canal and River Trust to warn people of the danger, at the Walsall, West Midlands canal", "authors": ["Kelly Ashmore", "Image", "Birminghammail.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566720.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_121019Slug_10756JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
