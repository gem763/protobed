It'll probably have to be a bit of individual brilliance because the creativity of the team isn't really there, especially without (Paul) Pogba playing.\n\n\"(Marcus) Rashford is capable of it, Dan James is capable of it. Maybe a set-piece, and Harry Maguire could be capable of it.\"\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nScholes went on to taunt Liverpool over last season's goalless draw at Old Trafford in February, claiming that the loss of two points there cost the Reds the league title.\n\n\" Liverpool missed a big chance to win at Old Trafford last year, you could argue they blew the league at Old Trafford last year,\" he said.\n\n\"United were really struggling at the time with injuries, very much as they are this year. After maybe half an hour they had to make the three subs, and Liverpool were really poor on the day.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"We know they (Liverpool) are a good team, we know what quality they've got, but they've still got to come to Old Trafford and prove they can win a game there.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool captain Gerrard, meanwhile, is adamant that the league leaders will win at Old Trafford for the first time since 2014, when he scored two penalties in a 3-0 success.\n\n(Image: Rangers FC/Press Association Ima)\n\n\"Yes. Liverpool will win,\" said the Rangers manager at his Friday press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Hearts in the Scottish Premiership.\n\n\"They've played eight and won eight. The front three are in fantastic form, they're not conceding many goals, they're European champions. Do you want any other reasons why I think Liverpool are going to beat Man United?\n\n\"Did you think I was going to say anything different?!\"", "description": "The legendary midfielders have cast their eyes over Sunday's clash between their former clubs", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Manchester United Getty Images", "Empics Sport", "Getty Images", "Rangers Fc Press Association Ima"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646995.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Paul-Scholes-and-Steven-Gerrard-make-Man-Utd-vs-Liverpool-predictions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
