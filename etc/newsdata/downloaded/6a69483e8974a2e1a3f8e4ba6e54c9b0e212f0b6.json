In other words, the investment offers a similar investment return as a non-impact investment fund that carries similar risks, Elmhirst says.\n\n\u201cWe don't believe we should compromise return for impact,\u201d Elmhirst says.\n\nThe KKR fund is the second US$1 billion-plus impact-investment fund from a major alternative-investment firm on the market, following The Rise Fund from TPG Growth, a more than US$2 billion private-equity impact investment fund launched in 2016. Bain Capital closed a US$390 million impact fund in 2017, while Bloomberg has reported that Apollo Global Management is also raising a US$1 billion impact fund. TPG is also raising money for a second Rise Fund.\n\nUBS also was drawn to the KKR fund because it has a dedicated team in place, globally, to run it, including \u201cpeople who have been with the firm a long time\u2014so they are proven,\u201d Elmhirst says.\n\nBy putting veteran private-equity professionals in place, KKR is also nodding to the fact it will be relying on its practiced approach to private equity, including the networks and resources they have used over time to find deals. Sometimes this approach leads to potential investments in companies that are not large enough for the firm\u2019s other funds, including its US$13.9 billion flagship investing in North America, or the US$9.3 billion Asian Fund III.\n\n\u201cKKR frequently uncovers investment opportunities that are too small for its flagship fund, but nonetheless are interesting investment opportunities\u2014that's where this fund sits,\u201d Elmhirst says.\n\nOn its website, KKR points out the firm already has invested US$5.3 billion in companies that \u201cadvance solutions\u201d to various social, environmental, and societal goals, meaning it knows what to look for when it comes to companies that can make a positive impact.\n\nKKR Global Impact focuses on lower middle-market businesses (those with annual revenues from US$5 million to US$50 million) that touch on what it calls \u201cglobal imperatives,\u201d including mitigating and adapting to climate change and training workers to utilize new and emerging technologies.\n\nIn 2018, Global Impact invested in Barghest Building Performance, a Southeast Asian company that makes energy efficient heating and cooling systems for commercial and industrial buildings. This year it\u2019s invested in the Indian firm Ramky Enviro Engineers, which provides environmental management services.\n\nUBS is more than halfway to meeting its US$5 billion commitment, from, among other investments, US$471 million raised in the UBS Oncology Impact Fund in 2016 and US$110 million raised for the Rethink Impact fund in 2017, a venture-capital fund focused on gender diverse technology companies. In 2017, UBS investors also invested US$325 million in The Rise Fund.\n\nThe minimum investment for UBS clients in the KKR fund is US$250,000, in line with other private equity investments. About a third of the interest in the fund came from the U.S., while one quarter was in Asia.\n\nElmhirst believes that more established firms are likely to follow KKR and others into the impact investing space, in large part because many of the themes underlying impact investing\u2014like more efficient and effective delivery of health care, or the reduction of single-use plastics in packaging\u2014can lead to investments in companies that are more forward-thinking and competitive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thinking that\u2019s leading large firms to look at the impact space\u2014to see it not just as what they should be doing, but to see it as a real investment opportunity,\u201d Elmhirst says. \u201cThat is a fundamental shift that is starting to occur, and that will lead to the establishment of impact investing as a mainstream source of investment opportunity, which would be great in terms of delivering on the UN SDGs.\u201d", "description": "The fundraising brings the global wealth management firm closer to a $5 billion commitment to addressing the UN sustainability goals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103832/social"}
