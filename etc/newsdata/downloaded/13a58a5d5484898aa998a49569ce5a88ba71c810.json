(AP) - The Jacksonville Jaguars aren\u2019t giving up on disgruntled defender Jalen Ramsey.\n\nThe Jags would prefer to keep their star cornerback after several days of trade talks with other NFL teams, according to a person close to the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity Friday because details of trade talks have not been publicly discussed. The decision came amid a much-needed, 20-7 victory over Tennessee.\n\nRamsey hugged several fellow defensive backs after the win, appearing to say goodbye in what many believed would be his final game with Jacksonville (1-2). Behind the scenes, though, teammates, coaches and members of the front office were working to try to repair Ramsey\u2019s fractured relationship with the franchise, specifically with top executive Tom Coughlin.\n\nJaguars owner Shad Khan had several meetings at the facility earlier in the week in hopes of solving issues. That might include giving Ramsey the long-term contract extension he wants, the person said.\n\nJacksonville told Ramsey during the offseason that it had no plans to pay him with two years remaining on his rookie deal.\n\nLos Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff, Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz and Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott - three of the four players selected ahead of Ramsey in the 2016 NFL draft - already have signed extensions.\n\nAlthough Ramsey causes as many headaches for his own team as he does opponents, there\u2019s no question the Jags would have a difficult time replacing him - even if they receive two first-round picks in a trade.\n\n\u201cMy focus is so high on one thing that I really try to avoid all things that are going on around me,\u201d said coach Doug Marrone, whose heated exchange with Ramsey in Houston served as the catalyst for the player\u2019s trade request. \u201cI\u2019ve just been focused on really helping the players, really helping this team, win football games. All the other stuff - you guys know me better than anyone - my social skills aren\u2019t very good.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nMinshew Mania is trending in Jacksonville.\n\nRookie Gardner Minshew threw two touchdown passes against Tennessee and would have had a third if not for a drop in the end zone. He\u2019s already beloved after three games, with some fans chanting his name every time he steps on the field and others adorning fake mustaches and bandanas to mimic his signature style.\n\n\u201cNothing rattles this kid,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at communication and I think he\u2019s really good at preparing himself and making sure there are no surprises out there for him. That\u2019s just a guy that has a maniacal work ethic.\u201d\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nJacksonville\u2019s ground game has been mostly dismal.\n\nLeonard Fournette carried 11 times for minus-8 yards before breaking a 69-yarder late Thursday. Marrone said the offensive line is getting little push to open holes, but doing fine in pass protection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing a good enough job up front,\u201d Marrone said. I have no issues with how Leonard is working and trying. I think he might be trying too much because of the frustration. He has the ability of being a great player, but we have to do a much better job all around. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to get this thing going.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJacksonville\u2019s defense held division foes Houston and Tennessee to a combined 20 points while recording 13 sacks. Calais Campbell had three of the unit\u2019s nine sacks against the Texans, with Josh Allen, Dawuane Smoot and Taven Bryan also chipping in.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at successful defensive lines, it\u2019s about waves and how you can bring them in waves and keep them fresh and keep them going,\u201d Marrone said.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nDede Westbrook had three drops Thursday, including one in the end zone with no defenders on him. Westbrook was widely expected to be the team\u2019s No. 1 target, but DJ Chark and Chris Conley have been more consistent options.\n\nINJURED\n\nLinebacker Myles Jack was placed in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol. Campbell left the game twice and is nursing injuries to both legs - his right foot and left ankle.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n110.6 - Minshew\u2019s passer rating, the highest for any rookie after three games in the Super Bowl era.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nFind ways to renew Ramsey\u2019s faith in the front office.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Jacksonville Jaguars aren't giving up on disgruntled defender Jalen Ramsey.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/titans_jaguars_football_53842_c0-339-3880-2601_s1770x1032.jpg?2d51a5d436744799d9484fbabb643ca3b4ac6863", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
