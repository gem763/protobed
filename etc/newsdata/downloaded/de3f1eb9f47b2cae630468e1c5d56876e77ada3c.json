You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nThunberg at the Climate Action Summit at the UN headquarters in New York City. Carlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nThunberg tweeted Monday that she, along with 15 other children hailing from 12 countries, had filed a legal complaint accusing five countries of inaction on global warming that violated the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nRead more: These are the 17 countries that have done the most to limit global warming since 2017\n\nThe treaty, which is 30 years old, is one of the most widely ratified in history and children have been able to file legal complaints to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child since 2014, according to France Info.\n\n\"Today at 11:30 I and 15 other children from around the world filed a legal complaint against 5 nations over the climate crisis through the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,\" Thunberg tweeted.\n\nWhy the biggest culprits among the world's top greenhouse-gas emitters haven't been included in the complaint\n\nThe complaint called out nations that have ratified the treaty but that, according to the activist, had failed to uphold their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nArgentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey were mentioned in the petition.\n\nThe children slammed the countries, stressing that the greenhouse-gas cuts the countries agreed to were still inadequate in helping reach the goal set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nRead more: Harvard scientists want to limit how much sunlight reaches Earth's surface to curb global warming\n\nScientists have warned that an increase of 2 degrees Celsius in global average temperatures will result not just in rising sea levels but in a hike in the regularity and severity of heat waves and other serious consequences.\n\nThe five named countries join 44 others that ratified the convention's power to hear complaints against them; however, the United States and China, which are the biggest culprits among the world's top greenhouse-gas emitters, haven't signed the section of the treaty allowing children to seek justice for infringements.\n\nAs a result, China and the US were not included in the complaint.\n\nScientists have warned that an increase of 2 degrees Celsius in global average temperatures will result in rising sea levels and other issues such as frequent heat waves.

So nice to see!\"", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron told Europe 1 that her stance was a \"very radical\" one to have taken and was likely to \"antagonize societies.\"", "authors": ["Sophie Levy Ayoun", "Ruqayyah Moynihan", "Business Insider France"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89f7b02e22af3c38288cf3-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
