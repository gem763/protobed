But Bloomberg reporter Benjamin Penn thought differently. He chose to \u201cunearth\u201d the above Facebook conversation by maliciously misconstruing it. And because his editor foolishly allowed him to frame it dishonestly as an anti-Semitic remark, Olson felt compelled to resign his post at the Department of Labor rather than cause controversy.\n\nThis must not be allowed to stand. We hope that Olson will be restored to his position and in the most public way possible. Think of it as a needed a dagger through the eyeball of online \u201ccancel culture\u201d and a way to humiliate those who traffic in it.\n\nWithout the full contemporaneous context, the hilarity of Olson\u2019s Facebook post might go unappreciated. So let\u2019s go back in time to 2016.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washington Examiner", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Editorials Reinstate-Leif-Olson-Never-Give-In-To-Cancel-Culture"], "top_image": ""}
