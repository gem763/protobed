The two branches worked out a compromise that Congress passed as the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act in 1998 and amended in 2010 and 2014.\n\nHow can Congress get whistle-blower complaints?\n\nThat law sets up a special process that allows intelligence employees or contractors to provide information to Congress in exchange for protecting them from retaliation or the threat of reprisal. Under that procedure, they submit the complaint for lawmakers to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.\n\nUnder the law, the inspector general must decide within 14 days whether the information is credible. The inspector general must also determine whether the allegations amount to an \u201curgent concern,\u201d meaning they relate to a \u201cserious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of the law or executive order, or deficiency relating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the director of national intelligence involving classified information.\u201d\n\nIf the complaint meets that standard, the inspector general is supposed to forward it to the director of national intelligence. The law says that within seven days of receiving the complaint, the director in turn shall forward the material to the House and Senate intelligence oversight committees.\n\nIs that what happened here?\n\nNo. While the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael K. Atkinson, told Congress that he had determined that the complaint was credible and qualified as an \u201curgent concern,\u201d Mr. Maguire has refused to transmit it to Congress.\n\nCan the whistle-blower do anything more?\n\nThe Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act says that if the inspector general rejects a complaint as not credible or not presenting an urgent concern, the official who filed it may still then provide the information to Congress. But in order to continue to be legally protected from reprisal, he or she must obey directions from the director of national intelligence on how to approach lawmakers in a way that secures classified information.\n\nThat raises another loophole: The whistle-blower first must obtain specific directions from the director of national intelligence before he or she can obey them. Here, Mr. Maguire is apparently refusing to provide any, according to a House Intelligence Committee official.", "description": "Congress and the Trump administration are in a standoff over a secret complaint related to President Trump and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/us/politics/20dc-legal/20dc-legal-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
