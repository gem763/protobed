I bring the washing in. I put the kids\u2019 games away,\u201d Despreaux said in a phone interview, as one of her four young charges, ranging in age from 6 months to 2 \u00bd years, mewed in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nThe government this week opened a three-week window of public consultation about its planned regulations that will take effect Jan. 1. It is proposing that crops treated with \u201cthe most dangerous substances\u201d be separated from homes, schools and other workplaces by no-spray zones at least 10 meters (33 feet) across.\n\nFor other chemicals, there would also be 10-meter zones around high-growing crops, including vines and fruit orchards, and five meters across for cereals and other shorter crops.\n\nThe buffers could be shrunk further, to three meters for vineyards and short crops and five meters for tall crops, if farmers use cutting-edge spraying techniques, the government says. It invited public comment online, and said the distances could be modified as a result. A final government decision on their size is due by December.\n\nWhile some environmental campaigners welcome the zones\u2019 introduction, many said the proposed distances were ridiculously small.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to give the impression that something is being done,\u201d Bibeyran said. \u201cThey won\u2019t protect anybody.\u201d\n\nShe spent 14 years working for a Listrac vineyard that sprayed with industrial chemicals, watching with growing alarm as flora and fauna disappeared. She now works in a vineyard in Margaux that farms organically, proudly declaring: \u201cWe have loads of insects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference over 14 years was stunning,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became rare to see a rabbit cross the vineyards or to see swallows.\u201d\n\nAgricultural groups complain the proposed buffers unfairly target farmers for using perfectly legal products. Some warned zoning will backfire, with insects and diseases preying on crops\u2019 untreated edges.\n\nJean-Marie Fabre, president of the Independent Winemakers of France, said no-spray zones risked becoming \u201csources of contamination that will spread diseases to the rest of the vineyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be the same as putting someone with the plague among people who have been vaccinated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe policy could force farmers to rip out untreated vines and other crops, shrinking planted acreages and hurting their bottom-line, Fabre said. If the zones contaminate treatable areas, farmers may have to spray more than they do now, he added.\n\nUrban creep into agricultural areas has exacerbated the conflict between farmers and their neighbors. Around Bordeaux, for example, families seeking space have moved in droves onto what used to be farmed lands, building homes amid vineyards.\n\nDespreaux and her husband moved from Paris in 2002. She says they were unaware they\u2019d be living cheek-by-jowl with farmers who spray.\n\n\u201cWe were na\u00efve,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had known there\u2019d be these risks, we would never have come here. I regret it.\u201d\n\nAlthough agro-chemicals are officially certified, she doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019re safe and doesn\u2019t trust government officials to stand up to the influence of agricultural lobbies. Tractors spray vines behind her house every two weeks, and sometimes every week, from April when the grapes form to September when they\u2019re harvested, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because the best period of the year, when it\u2019s nice outside, is when we have to stay inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t walk in the vines with the kids because it\u2019s not possible. It puts them in danger. We live in the countryside but we don\u2019t have the advantages of living in the countryside.\u201d\n\nFabre said the onus should be on property developers to set up buffer zones around new buildings.\n\n\u201cThe farmers didn\u2019t move closer to houses, the houses moved closer to them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe fears the consultation launched Monday will stoke public concerns about chemicals he insists are risk-free if correctly used, giving voice to \u201cdisinformation and even demagogy that will trump science.\u201d\n\nDespreaux said she\u2019s braced for a long battle.\n\nCampaigning with Bibeyran and others in a region where wine-producing chateaux underpin local economies and jobs, she says she\u2019s treated \u201cas a tree-hugger and a bit mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not understood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chateaux have so much power. But we won\u2019t give up and allow ourselves to be poisoned.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When tractors laden with pesticides and other chemicals start spraying the vineyards that produce fruity Bordeaux wines, Marie-Lys Bibeyran's phone starts to ring.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Leicester"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/france_grapes_of_wrath_35979_c0-101-3192-1962_s1770x1032.jpg?cba32a700f90ac654b035f520a49eedc73f7731c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
