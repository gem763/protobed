No f**king hell what do you think?\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t invite me to the previous four weddings, so I\u2019m not going to go to this one,\u2019 he told BANG Showbiz.\n\nWhile Liam has only actually been married twice (and not four times like Noel claimed), his brother wasn\u2019t on the guestlist for his 1997 wedding to Patsy Kensit or when he tied the knot with Nicole Appleton in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam said last month that he would like to make amends with Noel for the sake of their mother, and that he would send him an invite but doesn\u2019t think his brother will attend.\n\nHe told The Mirror: \u2018My mam is like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to invite him\u201d. And I will. They\u2019ll get a little envelope through the door. They won\u2019t come \u2026 but you never know.\n\nThe pair have been on bad terms since 2009 (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018Like I said before, they go to the opening of anything so as soon as they open it, it\u2019ll be like, \u201cCome on Noel, get your Dermot O\u2019Leary outfit on, we\u2019re going out.\u201d\u2019\n\nLiam popped the question to Debbie during a holiday on the Amalfi coast in Italy, and is \u2018buzzing\u2019 to walk down the aisle for the third time.\n\nHe revealed: \u2018Third time lucky. I\u2019m ready to do it again. I\u2019m buzzing more than her. This one\u2019s going to be a big thing.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d been talking about it for ages and Debbie was going, \u201cI\u2019m not too sure, I can\u2019t be a**ed\u201d. The sun was coming down, we were having a drink and I went, \u201cLook, shall we do it?\u201d\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt looks like it\u2019s going to take a lot more than a wedding to make amends between Noel and Liam, though, as the pair have had a decade-long feud since Noel quit Oasis in 2009 after a backstage row which led to Liam swinging a guitar at Noel\u2019s head \u2018like an axe\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
