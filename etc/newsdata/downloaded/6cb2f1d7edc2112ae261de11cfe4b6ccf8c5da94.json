Of this, $87 billion was to be used to increase surpluses and pay down debt and the rest was to fund spending promises in health, education and even wage subsidies for childcare workers.\n\n\"We won\u2019t win the next election simply relying on a big spending agenda nor running on the policies of the past in glossy brochures promising a solution to everything for everyone,'' Mr Marles said.\n\n\"We will win it with a clear and persuasive argument about the kind of society a Labor government will build. One that at its core provides a bedrock for growth and productivity.\n\n\"And with it, we offer the Australian people a legitimate embrace of aspiration.\"\n\nAnti-aspirational agenda\n\nMr Marles argues that the anti-aspirational agenda was why Labor lost the vote of its traditional base \u2013 the lowest income earners.\n\n\"We sought to quarantine parts of our traditional base and offer handouts rather than hope,'' he said.\n\n\"They simply didn\u2019t feel we went to the election offering them the tools to move forward, but instead we wanted them to settle for a range of subsidies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe singled out two policies: one offering pensioners $1000 in free dental care every two years, and Bill Shorten's signature $2.3 billion boost to Medicare to provide free or heavily subsidised cancer treatment.\n\n\"Yes, unquestionably making cancer treatment not reliant on your income is a worthy and noble policy,'' he said.\n\n\"Yes, affording dignity to pensioners so they don\u2019t have to suffer years without the dental treatment they need is the hallmark of a decent and caring Australia.\n\n\"But those propositions were lost, because at our heart we didn\u2019t offer all Australians a root and branch growth and productivity agenda.\"\n\nMr Marles joins a growing list of Labor figures putting their view on why the election was lost and how the next can be won, all ahead of the November 8 handover of the review into the loss, conducted by former SA Labor premier Jay Weatherill and former federal minister Craig Emerson.\n\nOn the weekend, Mr Shorten accepted responsibility for the loss and agreed Labor's policy agenda was too unwieldy, creating too many messages and causing voter anxiety.\n\nFormer Treasurer Wayne Swan, who believes in the redistribution of wealth, has agreed in a new essay, arguing that Labor had too many policy proposals, leaving it too vulnerable to attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said Labor needed to pare back its policies for the next election and he made the same point as Mr Marles that the policy agenda alienated the voters it was supposed to support.\n\n\"Lower-income earners who were the principle beneficiaries of Labor\u2019s program moved away from Labor, while the people who may have lost through our proposals held, or swung toward us,\" Mr Swan said.\n\n\"My view is that the size of our agenda was more decisive than its shape. Put simply, Labor had too many individual policies that, while fully funded, couldn\u2019t be effectively communicated to the electorate and that made it too easy for our conservative opponents to characterise our agenda as big spending and big taxing.\"", "description": "Acting Labor Leader Richard Mares has joined calls for the party to adopt an economic growth agenda and eschew handouts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2123%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_27/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4ad00ca999537557bed408845f66ee5e11669ea3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
