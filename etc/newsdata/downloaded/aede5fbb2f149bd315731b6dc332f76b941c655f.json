Photo: Jenny Anderson/Getty Images\n\nKatrina Lenk is no stranger to gender-bending Broadway. (If you haven\u2019t seen this excellent video of her performing \u201cIf I Were a Rich Man\u201d and accompanying herself on a damn violin, watch it now.) The Tony winner \u2014 she won for Best Lead Actress in a Musical for The Band\u2019s Visit in 2018 \u2014 will play Bobbie in a gender-swapped Company coming from London to Broadway in March 2020. Specifically, March 22, 2020 \u2026 composer Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 90th birthday. Bobbie, usually Robert, is a 35-year-old still trying to figure out her life as all her friends have settled comfortably into their own.\n\nLenk will be starring alongside Patti LuPone, who plays Bobbie\u2019s pal, Joanne. Vulture caught up with Lenk at the Broadway opening of Betrayal (in which Tom Hiddleston both acts and looks real good in a blue crewneck sweater) to chat about the role. \u201cIt feels both so exciting and like it\u2019s still so far away,\u201d Lenk said. \u201cIt feels like maybe it\u2019s a dream or it won\u2019t ever happen because we don\u2019t start till January.\u201d Rumors of Lenk\u2019s casting floated around Twitter and the theater world in the weeks and days prior to the official announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that it\u2019s out in the open,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting on the news for a while so it\u2019s nice to be able to confess.\u201d\n\nLenk said she did not see the London run, which starred Rosalie Craig in the role she\u2019ll be stepping into. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to the soundtrack and of course I knew of it, but it\u2019s a whole new thing,\u201d she said of the gender-swapped casting. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating. It really stimulates all of the synapses.\u201d The first time she sang the show\u2019s iconic finale, \u201cBeing Alive,\u201d Lenk said she felt, \u201cwhat you\u2019d imagine \u2026 freaking out and nervous and stressed and but loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple yet complex. It keeps building and building.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a little easy song,\u201d Lenk joked. \u201cThis little thing.\u201d\n\nAs for taking the stage alongside Patti thee LuPone, Lenk had a similar energy. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to work with her. I\u2019ve met her a couple of times just briefly and already I was enamored,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat things am I going to learn?\u201d What are we all going to learn, indeed. Only seven months till we find out.", "description": "Katrina Lenk, 2018 Tony winner for The Band\u2019s Visit, will play Bobbie in a gender-swapped version of Company coming to Broadway in 2020.
