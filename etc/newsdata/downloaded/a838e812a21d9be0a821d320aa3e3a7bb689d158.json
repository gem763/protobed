REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it opened a review to evaluate claims made in a defect petition about Tesla\u2019s handling of the software upgrade in 2,000 Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years.\n\nTech entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla has also been sued over updates to its battery charging software and this week faced complaints involving vehicles that crashed in parking lots while using a self-driving feature.\n\nThe 2,000 vehicles covered by the defect petition to NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. The petition was filed Sept. 17 by the offices lawyer Edward C. Chen on behalf of Tesla owners.\n\nIt said the software update was believed to have reduced the driving range of the affected vehicles by 25 miles or more per charge.\n\nTesla shares dropped about 2% from the session high on Friday but recovered slightly to close down 0.7% at $231.43.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn August, a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California on behalf of a Tesla owner by Chen claimed Tesla knew some vehicle batteries were defective and \u201cpushed out software updates despite knowing that the class vehicles would suffer from loss in range and performance.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleges Tesla\u2019s aim was \u201cto avoid providing warranty battery replacements to rightful customers.\u201d\n\nTesla told Reuters in August \u201ca very small percentage of owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles may have noticed a small reduction in range when charging to a maximum state of charge following a software update designed to improve battery longevity.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleges Tesla placed a software-induced limitation on battery charging and other changes that make batteries charge more slowly. It also cites more than a dozen reports of Tesla\u2019s vehicles catching fire over the past six years.\n\nTesla has not yet responded to the lawsuit in court.\n\nAfter a Model S caught fire in Hong Kong, Tesla said it was revising charge and thermal management settings on Model S and X vehicles via an over-the-air software update out of an \u201coverabundance\u201d of caution. The goal was \u201cto help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity,\u201d it said.\n\nIt later said it planned to improve the software update after some owners complained.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and NHTSA are investigating several battery fires in Tesla vehicles. NHTSA has previously investigated other battery and charging system issues with Tesla vehicles.", "description": "U.S. regulators said on Friday they were reviewing claims that Tesla Inc should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437098394&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931BL", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
