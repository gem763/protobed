Women\u2019s and girls\u2019 groups received just 1.6% of charitable dollars in 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, according to a new report by the Women\u2019s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University\u2019s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind report examined giving to organizations that serve women and girls primarily \u2014 as in Planned Parenthood or Girls, Inc. \u2014 as well as giving to collectives of women that have a philanthropic purpose, such as Junior League groups.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a national debate on gender equity in recent years, that reckoning doesn\u2019t appear to have had much of an effect on charitable donations, the researchers noted.\n\n\u201cNews stories about sexual assault and harassment, as well as various policy developments and current events, have brought issues impacting women and girls to the fore of societal conversations,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cDoes charitable giving also prioritize this population? This report shows that it has not.\u201d\n\nThe #MeToo factor hasn\u2019t been measured yet\n\nOne caveat to the findings: the data are from 2016, before Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election and before the #MeToo movement drew international attention to gender inequities, noted co-author Debra Mesch, professor of philanthropic studies at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. The authors didn\u2019t analyze why female-focused groups get such a small share of donations, but one factor could be the relatively small staff and budget sizes of nonprofits that serve women, which means they have fewer resources for fundraising, Mesch said.\n\nThere are 45,000 nonprofits focused on women and girls in the U.S., or 3.3% of all charitable organizations, the WPI report found. They received $6.3 billion \u2014 or 1.6% of all giving \u2014 in donations from individuals, foundations and corporations in 2016. The WPI report was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but its release the same week as Melinda Gates\u2019s announcement was a coincidence, the authors said.\n\n\u2018Actionable plans\u2019\n\nGates\u2019s $1 billion initiative will focus on three strategies: removing obstacles to women\u2019s professional advancement; advancing women in fields that have a significant influence on society, including technology, media and politics; and ramping up pressure that employees, consumers and shareholders put on companies and other institutions \u201cin need of reform,\u201d she wrote in a first-person piece for Time magazine.\n\nThough the IWP report found that only a sliver of giving goes to women\u2019s causes, Mesch sees positive trends in female-focused giving. Gates\u2019s $1 billion pledge is part of a larger movement to improve the lives of women and girls that\u2019s been led in part by female philanthropists, she said. It includes groups like Women Moving Millions, which launched in 2012. Its members pledge to donate $1 million to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 causes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re using their wealth through their philanthropy to create change, which is exactly what Melinda is talking about,\u201d Mesch said. \u201cShe\u2019s working on actionable plans and results, it\u2019s a tremendous step that will rise all boats in all sectors: the philanthropic, the private, as well as the government sector.\u201d\n\nSee also: Procter & Gamble donated $529K to help U.S. women\u2019s soccer win equal pay \u2014 while paying some of its U.K. female workers 28.5% less than men\n\nInvesting in startups and research\n\nMelinda Gates\u2019s $1 billion pledge will be distributed through Pivotal Ventures, an investment and \u201cincubation\u201d company she founded in 2015. (The business world has similar gender disparities to philanthropy: 2.2% of venture capital investment went to firms founded solely by women in 2017, according to PitchBook.)\n\nMelinda Gates will give out the money as a combination of philanthropic grants and investments, a spokeswoman said. Pivotal Ventures has previously invested in a female-led AI startup, funded a program at Northeastern University to get more women into tech, and helped fund a paid leave working group at the American Enterprise Institution and Brookings Institution.\n\nSee also: Who donates more time and money to charity \u2014 men or women? Here\u2019s your answer\n\nMelinda and Bill Gates, who is one of the richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of about $106 billion, also channel their philanthropy through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the biggest charitable foundation in the world, according to Forbes magazine. Gates has given away about $35.8 billion, or 25% of his net worth, to charity, Forbes reported.", "description": "She will give out the money as a combination of philanthropic grants and investments", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS805_melind_ZG_20191007153940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
