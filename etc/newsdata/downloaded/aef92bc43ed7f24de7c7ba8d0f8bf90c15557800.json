Filling for Chapter 7 forgives most debts, including:\n\nCredit card debt\n\nMedical bills\n\nPersonal loans\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy stays as a negative mark on your credit report for 10 years (from the date of filing). Filings also could cause your credit score to drop by as much as 200 points or more.\n\nAny debts that were wiped away by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy will be included on your credit report.\n\nTo qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you must first pass a \u201cmeans test\u201d that assesses your income and assets-to-debt ratio. Often, property, cars and other valuables might have to be liquidated in order to pay back as much of the debt as possible \u2014 but some day-to-day essentials that you own might be exempt under law, like your house or computers you use for work.\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy (unfortunately) doesn\u2019t apply to student loans, taxes, criminal fines, alimony or child support. There are some consequences you can't escape.\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcy\n\ndesigner491 | Shutterstock More\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcy, also known as \u201cwage earner\u2019s bankruptcy,\u201d is for people who earn too much to qualify for Chapter 7 but not enough to meet creditors' immediate payment requirements.\n\nAs with Chapter 7 bankruptcy, filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy will torpedo your credit score, and the filing will remain on your credit report \u2014 for seven years. If you need to apply for another loan during that time, you\u2019ll need to file a motion and obtain the court\u2019s permission first.\n\nUnder Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the court creates a payment plan for you to repay your debt over the span of three to five years.\n\nAfter that span of time, any remaining debts are wiped clean \u2014 meaning that your creditors may not get the full amount you owe them. Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to repay some of your debt while still holding on to your assets, including cars, jewelry and property.", "description": "Here's how long bankruptcy stays on your credit report and what you can do to rebuild credit afterward.", "authors": ["Sarah Cunnane"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KIi1RNn_Kfo4wCwyl83rhQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/3c67385ef9cf223c656c9a147905beac", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
