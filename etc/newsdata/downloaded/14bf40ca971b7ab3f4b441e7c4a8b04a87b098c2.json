Peter Braig\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team that always plays in front of a crowd that\u2019s barracking for someone else. The underdog, mongrel factor has actually helped drive that passion.\u201d\n\nTo get the club off the ground the AFL handed GWS generous concessions in the league\u2019s annual draft, allowing it to bring in the league\u2019s hottest young talent. GWS then recruited experienced stars around this nucleus, such as its co-captain and talisman, Phil Davis.\n\nBut some of its most important players have been picked off football\u2019s scrapheap.\n\nTake Matt de Boer, arguably the Giant\u2019s best player during the final series. The defensive midfielder \u2013 he\u2019s known in AFL circles as a tagger, he is sent to quell the opposition\u2019s best player \u2013 played in Fremantle\u2019s 2013 grand final side, but three years later was delisted by the club. GWS gave him another chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother example is ruckman Shane Mumford, who was lured out of retirement by the Giants this season for another tilt at premiership glory.\n\nBut defender Sam Reid is the most astounding story. He was delisted by the Giants twice \u2013 once in 2013 and again in 2017 \u2013 before re-joining the team last year via the rookie draft. He\u2019s played every game this season and has emerged as a vital cog in the GWS defence.\n\nGWS list manager Jason McCartney has developed a reputation as Buffett-type figure in AFL circles, having found similar unloved gems at the Western Bulldogs in their 2016 premiership.\n\nMcCartney tells Chanticleer that the AFL\u2019s salary cap means every club is forced to tweak their list every year. And at a strong side, where the best players generally take up a bit more of the salary cap each, year through their strong performances, finding a few value investments is crucial.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to find some role playing, cheaper options,\u201d he says.\n\nMajor League\u2019s Baseball\u2019s Moneyball movement \u2013 which is based on using data and analytics to find cheaper but highly effective players \u2013 has spread throughout world sports, including the AFL.\n\nMcCartney employs a consultant who helps assess the Giant\u2019s current playing list and potential recruits. But while he says the league\u2019s clubs are only starting to test the limits of how analytics can be used, good old fashioned gut instinct still has its place.\n\n\u201cDoes the data process throw up something occasional that is a bit of gold? Yes. But I think the validation is just as important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond will have its own value investment gem running out on Saturday: shock late inclusion Marlion Pickett, who was picked up the Tigers in this year\u2019s mid season draft. He will play his first ever game at AFL level on Saturday.\n\nBut analytics expert Ben Darwin, the co-founder of GAIN LINE Analytics and former Wallaby, says the Tigers\u2019 recent success \u2013 the club won its first premiership in more than three decades in 2017 \u2013 is down to another value investing strategy: buy and hold.\n\n\u201cRichmond\u2019s success has actually come through a lack of recruiting,\u201d he says. \u201cThe teams that trade the most tend to do the worst.\u201d\n\nDarwin\u2019s firm measures around 1000 pieces of data around AFL sides, but his focus in less on individual performance and more on the cohesion of the team.\n\nClubs that have stability in terms of their playing list, coaching staff and broad game style, tend to develop a level of coherence that is particularly in crucial in AFL.\n\nUnlike baseball, where players specialise in particular role have limited interaction with each other, AFL players can play in different roles, and rely much more on the performance of their team mates.\n\nDarwin\u2019s analysis shows in the AFL, player movements between clubs are around 30 per cent lower than in the NRL, and less than half of that they are in the English Premier League.\n\n\u201cIn order to win in the AFL, it actually requires far more patience than any other league in the world,\u201d he says, adding that the speed with which the Giants have made their first grand final is impressive.\n\nIt\u2019s all set up for a fascinating game. Richmond look deserved of favouritism, but after talking to Darwin, Chanticleer can\u2019t shake a feeling that picking a first-gamer for the grand final could threaten their coherence.\n\nAnd as every investor knows, momentum is important.
