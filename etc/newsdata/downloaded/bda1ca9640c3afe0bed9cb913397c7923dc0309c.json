But she had to give up exercise seven years ago when she developed a cyst under her kneecap and suffered inflammation in her hips.\n\nWithout being able to work out Emma, who hated vegetables, salad, pasta and rice, began piling on the pounds until she was 176 pounds and a size 16.\n\nPUBLIX EMPLOYEES TAKE ENGAGEMENT PHOTOS AT STORE WHERE THEY MET\n\nShe was determined to drop the weight before her big day with partner Ashley Roberts, 36, in May this year, however.\n\nIncredibly, in just four months the hairdresser shed more than 30 pounds to drop down to a weight of 144. Her waist was 10 inches smaller meaning she could fit into a stunning fit and flare dress in a size 10.\n\n\u201cWhen I gained weight, I didn\u2019t feel very good about myself,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI would only want pictures taken from my waist and above and on nights out I was no longer the fitter one wearing tight clothes, I\u2019d switched to wearing dark loose clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt got to a point where I made excuses to not go out with my friends because I felt so bad about myself,\u201d she dished. \u201cI even had a meltdown on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2018 because I couldn\u2019t find something to wear that I felt comfortable in. There\u2019s no way I wanted to stay that way for my wedding.\u201d\n\nAfter her electrician beau proposed in October 2017, the woman set herself the challenge to lose weight for her January 2019 New Year\u2019s resolution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nShe took herself out of her comfort zone by recording videos of herself and taking pictures to show her body transformation journey.\n\nOne of the contributing factors to her weight gain was the ibuprofen prescribed to help with her knee cyst, which made her stomach sensitive to foods containing aspartame such as low calorie fizzy drinks.\n\nAnd the fussy eater \u2013 who had previously binged on bread, chocolate and takeout \u2013 had another obstacle, she refused to eat any salad or vegetables whatsoever.\n\nInstead, the mum-of-one shed the weight by following a 600 calorie a day meal replacement plan - the 1:1 Diet from the Cambridge Weight Plan.\n\n\u201cI was in a constant battle with my stomach and would have to sleep the pain off most days, but I\u2019m the best I\u2019ve ever been since following [the plan,]\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBread and chocolate were my vices \u2013 I\u2019d use bread to bulk out my meals instead of vegetables, and after my meals I would always crave sugar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d either skip breakfast or have tea with two sugars and biscuits,\u201d she shared. \u201cFor lunch, I\u2019d have some chips, a breakfast sandwich or just take a packet of crisps and a bar of chocolate - anything that would let me stay an extra half an hour in bed so I didn\u2019t have to plan lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith dinner, I\u2019d just eat processed \u2018kid food\u2019 that was quick and simple, and I\u2019d have takeout about twice a week.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRoberts believes that drinking more water and being in a calorie deficit made her fuller quicker and was key to weight loss. If she ever had cravings or urges, she would go on clothes websites and add clothes she wanted to fit in to her basket as a distraction.\n\nAnd within four short months, she had shed the pounds, leaving her proud to show off her svelte new figure when she walked down the aisle.\n\n\u201c[Ashley] told me he\u2019d never realized how much weight I\u2019d gained during the seven years we\u2019ve been together, and he\u2019s really happy that he\u2019s seen my confidence grow,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019m now able to wear the clothes I used to wear when we first met.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends also understood that I had to cut back on nights out and put a hold on my social life. My bachelorette party was the first time I\u2019d been off my diet,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWhen I went for my final dress fitting, it was amazing to hear that they\u2019d taken 10 inches off my dress,\u201d the bride revealed. \u201cBut I feel so much better now.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared on The Sun.
