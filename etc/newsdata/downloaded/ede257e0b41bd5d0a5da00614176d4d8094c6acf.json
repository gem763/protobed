Workers planted flowers, repaired potholes and hung the Chinese president\u2019s portrait on electricity poles.\n\nThough Nepal has traditionally been close to India, in recent years, Chinese investors have pumped millions of dollars into the country, one of Asia\u2019s poorest and least-developed democracies. And under Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, leader of the Nepal Communist Party, Nepal has tried to diversify its trade agreements and move away from dependence on India.\n\nNepal, which borders Tibet and northern India, is the chief candidate for a new trans-boundary railway under China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative that would link China to the subcontinent.", "description": "The Chinese leader\u2019s visit is a further display of his ambitious aims \u2014 both economic and strategic \u2014 on India\u2019s doorstep.", "authors": ["Bhadra Sharma", "Kai Schultz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/world/13china-nepal/12china-nepal-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
