But other parts of training are a return to fundamentals that the gray-haired generals would find familiar \u2014 planning, executing and evaluating your own training.\n\nA group of current and retired senior Army aviators spoke Thursday at the Association of the US Army's Aviation Hot Topic meeting.\n\nWhile the conference covered ongoing deadlines for future aircraft and ways that top leaders will continue to sustain current and future operational tempo, the subject most Army aviators are already seeing or will soon see was the focus on how to prepare for large-scale combat operations in training.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nAdvances in synthetic training environments, or ways of using virtual battlefields, either entirely immersive or a combination of augmented reality with existing scenarios, is perhaps the only way to effectively drill what's needed to fight the big fight, said Brig. Gen. Stephen L.A. Michael, deputy commanding general of the Army's Combined Arms Center.\n\n\"The bottom line is that STE will give us the ability to replicate the challenges of large scale combat operations,\" Michael said.\n\nBut also, all of the work around training will also have to change.\n\nMichael said it's time for training to be treated like a commodity and \"returned to the commanders.\"\n\nHe noted that a lot of new lieutenants and captains in the aviation field have not had to access mission training plans and documents, a common practice just a few decades ago.\n\nThat's because due to high op tempo and aviation demands, most training during the Global War On Terror missions was focused on getting the pilot as ready as fast as possible so others handled the prep work.\n\nRetired Gen. James Thurman, former head of United Nations Command, Republic of Korea-US Combined Forces Command, noted that current commanders can't just abandon their counterinsurgency skill sets in favor of future scenarios.\n\nBoth have to be trained. Responding to an audience question on how that would happen, Thurman said that developing \"full spectrum scenarios\" for the training environment would have to start at home station training. That process then has to be managed all the way through and a set of standard operating procedures that tells commanders, whether they're aviation, armor, infantry, engineers or otherwise, what's expected of them.\n\nHe noted that every battalion task force in the past had to be able to move to contact, conduct hasty attack and hasty defense while also sustaining the formation and doing COIN work.\n\n\"Army aviation has to be fully integrated as part of combined arms,\" he said.\n\nUS Army pilots power down an AH-64 Apache helicopter in Afghanistan, May 18, 2016. US Army\n\nFor the Army National Guard, preparation for large-scale combat may be a major priority, but it can't be the only one. They still have their state duties and disaster response work to prepare for and execute, said Brig. Gen. Ray Davis, assistant director of aviation and safety for the Guard.\n\nPart of that preparation, though, will require a re-examination of how the Guard aviation units are dispersed across the country.\n\nDavis said an Army aviation task force is evaluating the challenges to how the service stations its units and looking to decrease dispersion.\n\nWith units spread from coast to coast, that challenges the ability for them to come together and train, he said.\n\nThe development of the Army's Future Vertical Lift, which will replace the Black Hawk, Chinook, Kiowa and Apache helicopters with at least two new platforms, also opens up training challenges. Those include both the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft.\n\nCol. John M. Ferrell, who heads simulations at the Army Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker, Alabama, said that current updates to platforms see major delays in those changes hitting training simulators.\n\nThat creates problems for keeping pilots up to date on the latest equipment upgrades.\n\nThe new goal is to have those run in parallel in under 90 days. That means that if a helicopter gets an upgrade the training software or module will receive the same upgrade within that time frame. It's still a delay that can pose problems but it's a more workable timeline.\n\nWhat simulations can do\n\nUS soldiers hook a Humvee to a CH-47 Chinook during a sling load training exercise in Germany, July 30, 2019.

Jeremiah Woods\n\nAnd as the Army adapts to a new way of warfare, the Multi-Domain Operations concept that's being developed across the force, the simulations that aviators use are helping but not fully solving those difficulties, he said.\n\nOn a weekly basis, Ferrell said, they're developing complex scenarios and changing instruction. But the simulations still cannot fully replicate all of the demands of the MDO environment, which will see pilots and ground units hit with a barrage of kinetic fires, electronic warfare jamming, spoofing and cyber-attacks on their networks.\n\n\"We've got to train our leaders on what tools are available,\" Ferrell said. That will help build competency as the systems evolve.\n\nThe colonel did stress that the training abilities do allow for them to deeply assess individual, team and unit-level performance. That helps feed back data to commanders to help meet their training and mission objectives.\n\nBut simulations can provide things that real-life training can't, he said.\n\nFor instance, helicopters can fly at much greater speed, practice long-range fires and work in environmental problems such as weather or chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack scenarios.\n\nLarge-scale combat\n\nUS Army\n\nCol. Kenneth E. Cole, who recently took over as deputy commander at the ACOE, relayed that in the operational force that he just left in Europe, pilots, air crews and maintenance crews are training as a single entity for large-scale combat.\n\nDuring recent exercises such as Saber Guardian and Swift Response, soldiers traversed more than 1,000 miles and as many as six countries to conduct their exercises.\n\n\"The takeaway there is that you can't just do that tonight,\" he said. \"You have to train to get there, build those blocks, protect training and emphasize fundamentals.\"\n\nNo longer can a commander or pilot show up at the National Training Center and start figuring out what they want to train while they're there, Thurman said.\n\nMichaels sees a clear goal \u2014 to have units arriving at their CTCs \"ready for war.\" That will take combined home station training and a mentality that has training embedded in all aspects of what pilots do throughout their jobs.\n\n\"Training staffs have to be able to plan, think at the speed of war,\" he said.", "description": "In order to balance current missions, future combat operations, and new aircraft, the Army is presenting its pilots with some tough challenges.", "authors": ["Todd South", "Army Times"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7685242e22af7685132b83-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
