I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s statement came in response to a firestorm of Democrat jeering and complaints about his reported demand for the alligator moat.\n\nThe report was published by the New York Times, which offered unattributed tales of Oval Office arguments about border policy \u2014 while hiding Trump\u2019s successful pressure on Mexico.\n\nIn March 2019, \u201cthe president\u2019s zeal to stop immigration had sent him lurching for solutions, one more extreme than the next,\u201d the New York Times reported October 1, and continued:\n\nPrivately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\n\nBut the newspaper actually shows how Trump repeatedly and relentlessly fought his own cautious or oppositional appointees to deliver on his promise to block illegal immigration:\n\nIn the Oval Office that March [2019] afternoon, a 30-minute meeting extended to more than two hours as Mr. Trump\u2019s team tried desperately to placate him. \u201cYou are making me look like an idiot!\u201d Mr. Trump shouted, adding in a profanity, as multiple officials in the room described it. \u201cI ran on this. It\u2019s my issue.\u201d \u2026 The president\u2019s advisers left the meeting in a near panic.\n\nIn the following months, Trump revamped his staff, fired top aides, fended off appeals from business lobbies, and then achieved his strategic success by threatening to impose tariffs on Mexico.\n\nSince then, the cross-border flow from Mexico has crashed from 133,000 in May down to 51,000 in September, according to federal data. Other actions \u2014 although fought by California judges \u2014 are expected to reduce the cross-border flow further.", "description": "President Donald Trump slammed the New York Times' suggestion that he wants an alligator-filled moat at the U.S. border.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-538883684-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
