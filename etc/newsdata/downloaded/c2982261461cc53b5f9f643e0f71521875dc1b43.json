The idea of an apartment property or office building drawing regular rent checks is appealing if you want a reliable stream of cash from your portfolio. However, there are plenty of other real estate investments that can produce a steady flow of money. These involve communications assets, health care facilities or even entertainment venues. These companies are structured as real estate investment trusts, or REITs, a special class of stock that must deliver 90% of its profits back to shareholders. This is a mandate for big dividends. Looking for more interesting ways to get income off the real estate sector? Consider these nine unconventional REITs.\n\nAmerican Tower Corp. (ticker: AMT)\n\nInvestors may not think of cell phone towers when they go looking for real estate assets. However, AMT is not just one of the largest telecom stocks but also one of the largest REITs on Wall Street. The stock boasts a market capitalization of more than $90 billion, and a portfolio of approximately 170,000 communications sites. There's not a lot of growth ahead for AMT, but that's not the appeal. Rather, the company generates consistent revenue by leasing sites on its towers to telecom operators -- and in turn, passes a share of that cash on to shareholders via steadily growing dividends.\n\nCurrent yield: 1.6%\n\nCyrusOne (CONE)\n\nIf you like the idea of generating income from an increasingly wired society, then consider CyrusOne. This stock focuses on \"carrier neutral\" data center properties -- meaning a warehouse of servers that offer communications technology infrastructure services for all manner of businesses. The firm boasts 1,000 clients across its various locations. Unlike entrenched tower operator AMT, CONE also has a decent potential for growth ahead as many businesses increasingly are moving to the cloud by offloading data storage, cybersecurity applications and other high tech needs to offsite firms like CyrusOne.\n\nCurrent yield: 2.7%\n\nCoreCivic (CXW)\n\nSpeaking of securely holding assets of a very different kind, CoreCivic is a corrections and detention management company that is enlisted by local governments to operate prisons or \"residential reentry centers\" to help assist with the safe reintegration of former criminals into society. CXW has been a partner on private prisons for more than 35 years, meaning relatively long term contracts and deep connections with governments that help lead to consistency in both revenue for the company and dividends for its shareholders.\n\nCurrent yield: 9.8%\n\nCousins Properties (CUZ)\n\nAn incredibly specialized REIT, Cousins is an Atlanta-based office tower operator that focuses only on \"high-growth Sun Belt markets\" such as Charlotte, North Carolina; Phoenix and Dallas. Founded in 1958, Cousins creates architecturally interesting high rises and fills them up with high quality office tenants in the middle of key urban areas. It's a very one dimensional approach, unlike other diversified investment trusts that tend to focus on wider geographies, a wider tenant base, or both. However, this targeted approach may appeal to those who see the obvious potential of these up-and-coming cities compared with all the other investment options.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.2%\n\nEssential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT)\n\nSpeaking of targeted real estate investments, EPRT is a real estate company that manages only \"single-tenant properties.\" These assets are exactly what they sound like: A building that only has a single business inside it. Think free standing restaurants, car washes, convenience stores, movie theaters, day cares or any other single use properties you pass every day around town. It's an interesting strategy because it's diversified across a wide array of business types, but the properties themselves are very much reliant on a single company's fate. Essential Properties must be doing something right, however, since shares are up a stunning 65% in the last two years alone.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.9%\n\nGaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI)\n\nGaming and Leisure Properties is a firm based on gambling -- but based on its strong presence in key markets from Massachusetts to Louisiana and Colorado to Ohio, this real estate operator seems like a pretty safe bet. That's because it is diversified across regions with little competition for gaming, and also because its properties operate under \"triple net lease\" arrangements where the tenant is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes. In other words, GLPI builds these casino sites then just collects rent checks afterwards. That makes for a reliable revenue stream that isn't dependent on the ups and downs of any economic trends. That adds up to steady dividends for investors in this REIT, too.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Look beyond the obvious for real estate income.
