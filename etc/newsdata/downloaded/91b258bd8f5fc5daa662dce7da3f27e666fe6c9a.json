But podcasts, which are prerecorded audio sessions usually set up as an interview or monologue, are another resource, and they\u2019ve gradually become yet another avenue to talk retirement.\n\nSome retirement podcasts share tips and secrets to save more for retirement, while others discuss how to live comfortably in retirement. A few academic podcasts emphasize the context around our current retirement system, and the ways in which legislators, financial firms and individuals can improve it.\n\nFinancial advisers, economists, professors and everyday people create podcasts, with the hopes of sparking conversations and providing insight into how, when and why to retire. \u201cThey hark back to the day of radio,\u201d said Angela Antonelli, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Retirement Initiative and host of \u201cThe State of Retirement\u201d podcast. \u201cPodcasts can be a really effective way to thoroughly listen and absorb ideas.\u201d Podcasts exist on every topic imaginable, there are now 750,000 podcasts and 30 million episodes, according to Podcast Insights, citing Nielson data.\n\nSee: The new math of saving for retirement may boil down to this one, absurdly simple rule\n\nNot all Americans are prepared for retirement, possibly because they don\u2019t think they can fit retirement saving into their budget right now or perhaps because they do not have the proper education around these complex financial products and strategies. Retirement can be overwhelming, and not everyone is mentally prepared to navigate through the thousands of online resources to find an adviser they trust, learn about the numerous accounts available or figure out what they want to do, and can afford to do, in retirement.\n\nRoger Whitney started his podcast \u201cRetirement Answer Man\u201d five and a half years ago \u2014 or 289 weekly episodes ago \u2014 he said. The podcast was a way for him to learn more about the subject matter, but also to host a discussion for other individuals who were unsure of how to retire well. \u201cSometimes we can get too caught up in the numbers, and numbers are important but what people ultimately care about is a great life,\u201d he said.\n\nPodcasts aren\u2019t just for those planning a retirement far off into the future. Benjamin Brandt, a financial adviser and host of \u201cRetirement Starts Today Radio,\u201d said 80% of his audience is over 50 years old, and 40% are over 60. He keeps his podcast actionable, for those who are starting to get more serious about their plans or heard about a friend or colleague who retired and now they want to get ready, too.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why you might want to take a gap year before you retire\n\nThese shows can act as a \u201ctrigger\u201d to retirement planning, said Harris Stratyner, a media psychologist. Listening to these podcasts gets retirement into the heads of their listeners, and inspires consumers to learn more about whatever strategy or tip they heard. \u201cPodcasts are becoming more and more influential, even with seniors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to influence you to do more research, and maybe go home and speak to your adviser.\u201d Of course, listeners tuning into a retirement podcast may already have retirement on the brain, and it\u2019s those who are preparing for that next chapter who will be more likely to act on what they hear, Stratyner added.\n\nBut this format also allows the host to explain exactly what he meant by what he said, in a conversational manner \u2014 cutting through the noise and distractions online. People speaking on podcasts put the inflection and emphasis where they want it, compared with when readers are consuming a blog post or book and might misinterpret the writer\u2019s intentions, Whitney said.\n\nAnd unlike blogs and books, podcasts are great for the multitasker \u2014 the person who wants to learn about a subject, but needs to divvy up her time exercising, commuting or running errands. Joe Casey, host of \u201cThe Retirement Conversation,\u201d used to listen to podcasts while training for a marathon. Now he runs one. \u201cThere are people we know who make it a part of their routine walking, running or driving,\u201d he said. \u201cThey find ways to plug into it regularly.\u201d\n\nMany of the podcast hosts complement their shows with newsletters. Whitney has a weekly newsletter called \u201c6-Shot Saturday,\u201d which summarizes six points about the week\u2019s episode and invites listeners to reply with questions and feedback. Steve Chen, host of \u201cThe NewRetirement Podcast,\u201d created a Facebook group to engage with listeners.\n\nAlso see: How to prepare for conversations you dread\n\nExperts aren\u2019t the only interviews on these shows. Listeners also hear from real people about their hopes and dreams in retirement, or the struggles they had getting there. Casey\u2019s podcast focuses on the nonfinancial side of retirement, such as how people found a new identity after retiring or started a business. Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and director of The New School\u2019s Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, interviews people about what they see and feel as they prepare for or live in retirement. She emphasizes that it is the system savers are in that needs to be fixed \u2014 not necessarily individuals\u2019 approaches and strategies.\n\nThose real stories let listeners know they\u2019re not alone in whatever challenges they face, and provides actionable advice to get started or better at planning, regardless where they are right now. Many people don\u2019t realize how dramatically their lives will change in retirement, and there can be very little preparation. \u201cRetirement is unlike so many other parts of life where there is a road map,\u201d Chen said. \u201cPeople always retired, but now people are living longer and that transition to retirement is changing.\u201d", "description": "They create a feeling of community \u2014 and are good for multi-taskers", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ148_runnin_ZG_20190826132619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
