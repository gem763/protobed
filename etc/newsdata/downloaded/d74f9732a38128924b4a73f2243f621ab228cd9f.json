When Kemper was in primary school, she had watched two of her classmates get ill. One had a brain tumour, the other contracted an infection in his gut. Both of them died.\n\nKemper was about 10 at the time, and knew she did not want to see another friend perish. She told her parents she wanted to do something that would prevent others dying. She wanted to be a doctor.\n\nBut training is hypercompetitive in the Netherlands, where Kemper grew up. She didn\u2019t quite have the grades. She liked chemistry, so chose a career in pharmacy instead. She studied for six years and did a residency for another four. She is now a highly respected hospital pharmacist based at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre, a cavernous building crafted out of concrete on the south-east fringe of the Dutch capital.\n\nTo understand what happened next, you have to understand several things about Kemper. Two of those things date back to her childhood. One was that early experience of losing friends to illness, which instilled in her an urge to do everything she can to make sick people better. The second is that, although she is highly accomplished, Kemper is self-admittedly hard-headed, and has always had a rebellious streak. Sometimes she likes to shock people.\n\nWhich leads into the third, more recently acquired trait: a steely determination to do right by her patients, whatever the cost. And the cost can be great. In 2017, when the price of a drug used to treat a rare genetic disorder skyrocketed, Kemper was not happy. The result was a dispute that is still going on today, and has spread beyond the walls of the UMC hospital. It has also spread beyond the city of Amsterdam, and beyond even the borders of the Netherlands.\n\nMost of us never have to worry about chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the two primary bile acids produced by the liver. But, for a tiny number of people, a rare genetic trait means they end up short. Having this gene variant prevents the body from creating sterol 27-hydroxylase, a liver enzyme. Without it, the liver won\u2019t convert enough cholesterol into CDCA. The result is an overabundance of other bile acids and substances, which are then pumped out of the liver and through the body, causing untold damage.\n\nThe illness that results is called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, or CTX. It can cause cataracts, dementia, neurological problems and seizures \u2013 but it can be treated. Since the 1970s, the pharma industry has been able to produce CDCA, and so people who need it can supplement their shortage. The system worked well; the drug was relatively cheap for such a niche illness. A year\u2019s treatment cost about \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) per patient \u2013 until suddenly it didn\u2019t.\n\nIn 2017, Leadiant Biosciences, which was supplying CDCA to these patients in the EU, raised the price of its version of the drug \u2013 known as CDCA Leadiant \u2013 to more than \u20ac150,000 per patient per year.\n\nThe price increase soon had an effect. The Netherlands has an insurance-based health system, and in April 2018, Dutch insurers, who had been paying for 50 or so patients across the country to receive the drug, balked at the increase and refused to pay. Patients who were unable to pay themselves would have gone without treatment, so Kemper \u2013 whose hospital was one of the treatment centres for CTX \u2013 stepped in. Amsterdam UMC would produce the medicine for these patients itself, at cost price.\n\nShe was upset, she admits. \u201cPatients have a medical need. If those patients with CTX don\u2019t get their medication, they get neurological implications, they get complications with their cholesterol and dementia, epilepsy \u2026 it is an essential medicine.\u201d\n\nAnyone wanting to manufacture a drug must get a marketing authorisation to do so. But Leadiant had become the only game in town, the owner of exclusive rights to manufacture CDCA commercially in the EU. Still, there was a solution. Under EU rules, pharmacies can make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients.\n\nSo Kemper began researching where she could find the ingredients to make CDCA. It was difficult: in the pursuit of better margins, vast numbers of manufacturing companies have closed their factories across the world and concentrated their efforts in China, where the costs of producing pharmaceutical ingredients are lower. Just one European company manufactures the ingredients to EU standards. ]\n\nKemper approached them and they declined to supply her the raw material. In the end, she found a Chinese manufacturer instead. She went to the hospital\u2019s executive board and gained approval to manufacture the drug. It cost the pharmacy \u20ac28,000 per patient, per year \u2013 pretty much exactly the same as the price of the drug beforehand.\n\nCDCA was not initially used to treat CTX. It was originally developed to treat gallstones. This main use of the drug \u2013 which, from the mid-70s, had been sold in the Netherlands as Chenofalk \u2013 became outmoded when the standard procedure to deal with troublesome gallstones became to simply cut out the gallbladder entirely.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Dutch doctors started using Chenofalk \u201coff-label\u201d (ie for a use different from that stated on its official licence) to treat CTX \u2013 a practice that carried on for several years. At this time, in the mid-2000s, a year\u2019s supply of Chenofalk cost less than \u20ac500.\n\nBut in 2008, Leadiant acquired the rights to Chenofalk, and developed its own version, known as CDCA Leadiant. Then, nine days before Christmas 2014, it succeeded in getting its version classified as an \u201corphan medicine\u201d for treating CTX. That classification gave Leadiant the exclusive right to manufacture its CDCA drug commercially in Europe for the next 10 years. In 2015, Leadiant took Chenofalk off the market. In 2017, the price of CDCA Leadiant \u2013 by now the only remaining CDCA option on the market \u2013 was increased from around \u20ac30,000 per patient per year to about \u20ac150,000.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Jake Hollings\n\nIntroduced by EU regulation in the year 2000, orphan drug classification is given to drugs that treat serious illnesses that affect fewer than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Its purpose is to help companies recoup the costs of developing treatments that would otherwise be unlikely to generate a profit. Without it, the pharma industry would not be incentivised to seek new drugs for the rarest diseases. But, in this case, CDCA was already known as a CTX treatment, with Chenofalk having been used off-label to treat it for years. Kemper believes that Leadiant is getting the financial benefits of orphan designation, but for a drug that had gone through development and been released to market long ago. \u201cThere were publications already in the 1980s,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no patents, nothing. It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d\n\nKemper is not the only one concerned about the price rise and CDCA\u2019s orphan drug status. In September 2018, a lobby group, the Dutch Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation, asked the Dutch competition authority to investigate the price increase. And this spring Test Achats, a nonprofit consumer-protection organisation in neighbouring Belgium, lodged a complaint against Leadiant with the Belgian Competition Authority.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that in 2005, the price for the treatment of a patient in one year was around \u20ac500. Now it\u2019s more than \u20ac150,000,\u201d explains Laura Marcus, legal counsel to Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the sick person but also for the Belgian health system, which is paying most of the [cost of the] treatment.\u201d\n\nWhen a drug company raises the price of its product, and a hospital pharmacy decides not to accept the increase but instead endeavours to compound its own version, undercutting the drug company\u2019s price, things tend to get interesting.\n\nIn June 2018, Kemper had a phone call from the Dutch health inspectorate. It had received a letter of concern \u2013 who it came from, Amsterdam UMC doesn\u2019t know, although the health inspectorate has said it was acting in response to an enforcement request from Leadiant \u2013 with a long list of things for the investigators to check.\n\nKemper took the news in her stride. She had expected a rocky road. \u201cAs a pharmacist, I am a professional and I know what I\u2019m doing, and we have standards for compounding,\u201d she explains. So she was not worried when, that summer, a team of four inspectorate monitors turned up at the door of her pharmacy in Amsterdam. Two were there to take samples of the raw materials she was using to compound CDCA, and to ensure that all the correct processes were being followed. They rifled through the reams of paperwork and procedures that Kemper had spent hours developing for her staff to follow, while the other two inspectors combed through coverage of the case to ensure that Kemper and her team were not advertising their work, which is prohibited for medicines that have not been given market authorisation.\n\nThe lab checked out: its processes were up to standard and the paperwork was all in order. But in July Kemper got a phone call that floored her: the inspectorate\u2019s analysis of the raw materials her pharmacy was using to compound the CDCA had discovered that they were not up to snuff. Two components found in it were above allowed limits.\n\n\u201cAs a professional you think: what did I miss? It was very emotional, a bit heavy,\u201d she says. In consultation with the board of directors at the hospital, Kemper decided to immediately withdraw the product from patients; the health insurers said they would step in and cover putting the patients back on the Leadiant version of the drug.\n\nKemper personally called the 50 or so patients she was providing with the drug. \u201cThe first one was hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI expected they\u2019d be angry or something like that. But no, no one [was]. The patients said: \u2018Well, please go on with this job.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Dutch inspectorate has said that Kemper can resume compounding CDCA provided she can find a raw material that does not contain impurities \u2013 something Kemper is keeping tight-lipped about.\n\nSo, if she can get the materials she needs, Kemper is hopeful to be able to continue compounding CDCA in the future.\n\nBut for now, it is back to square one \u2013 paying the full price for CDCA Leadiant.\n\nThese events have had wider consequences. What was initially a dispute inside the Netherlands has bled across borders, with Belgian patients with CTX now being affected. It started with a conversation between the Dutch and Belgian health ministers shortly after Kemper\u2019s production of CDCA was halted, says Thomas De Rijdt, head of pharmacy at University Hospitals Leuven. The Dutch minister wanted to know from his Belgian counterpart why Belgian hospitals were able to make the same drug without any issues.\n\n\u201cFor Belgium, we have about 10 patients,\u201d De Rijdt says. \u201cThey are helped with the preparations from our hospital and the University Hospital in Antwerp.\u201d\n\nThese hospitals had been compounding CDCA capsules for CTX patients for years. Leuven had sourced raw materials that had been tested and approved by a laboratory accredited by the Belgian government. But when the case in the Netherlands entered conversation at diplomats\u2019 dinners, the Belgian government wanted to double-check that its raw materials were OK.\n\nIt ran a second battery of tests \u2013 with a different accredited laboratory \u2013 which came back with a problem. A single impurity was found. The government ordered a quarantine of the raw material and recalled all the CDCA it had made.\n\n\u201cThe patients had to return all their medication,\u201d says De Rijdt. Recalling every capsule of the drug from Belgium, and freezing the work of the only two suppliers in the country, meant that people with CTX were suddenly left without any medicine.\n\nWhy do new medicines cost so much, and what can we do about it? Read more\n\n\u201cIf you know the disease, you know you can deteriorate very quickly,\u201d says De Rijdt. This was a problem. So, he says, the hospital pharmacists, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance, the health minister and the pharmaceutical inspectorate hit upon a solution. For a year, the Belgian government would reimburse the costs of Leadiant\u2019s drug, allowing those patients to still be treated. (Normally the government only reimburses a portion of a person\u2019s health costs, and the rest is paid for by the patient or insurance.) Over the course of that year, the relevant authorities would then work together to adapt the requirements a raw material must comply with \u2013 to allow versions of drugs with minor impurities, providing they pose no threat to the patient.\n\n\u201cWe have bought time to find a solution with the compounding, because we think by compounding we can save healthcare a lot of money for the same quality of therapy,\u201d says De Rijdt. He hopes to have a solution by the end of this year.\n\nBut in early September, things took another turn. Wouter Beke, the Belgian consumer affairs minister, used his price-regulation powers to bring down the price of CDCA Leadiant to just over \u20ac3,600 a month \u2013 roughly a quarter of the amount Leadiant was charging. If the drug becomes more cheaply available in Belgium, says De Rijdt, then it could end up being exported and available at a lower price elsewhere.\n\nBut exactly how this will pan out remains unclear. In the meantime, Beke has urged the Belgian Competition Authority to prioritise investigating Leadiant, following the complaint lodged by Test Achats.\n\nDebate over what constitutes a fair price for drugs is not anything new. Nor is it limited to Europe. Because of his willingness to play the bad guy in the press (and an odd moment when he bought a Wu-Tang Clan record), Martin Shkreli has attracted more criticism on drug pricing than perhaps anyone else. In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals, of which Shkreli was CEO, raised the price of its recently acquired antimalarial drug Daraprim, also used to treat Aids-related illnesses. A pill went from $13.50 to $750 overnight \u2013 a 55-fold increase.\n\nShkreli\u2019s capitalist tendencies were criticised by almost everyone. This was unlike the situation with CDCA Leadiant \u2013 there was no argument that the increase was to cover Daraprim\u2019s development costs \u2013 and Shkreli himself was unrepentant: \u201cIf there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don\u2019t think that that should be a crime,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nBut the Daraprim situation was just the highest-profile example of a contest that is going on constantly between big pharmaceutical companies seeking to profit from drugs, and medical staff on the frontline who worry that such profit-seeking does damage to patients needing treatment. (For what it\u2019s worth, a competitor to Turing Pharmaceuticals announced soon after that it would produce a compound drug containing the same active ingredient in Daraprim \u2013 pyrimethamine \u2013 for $1 a pill, rather than the $750 Shkreli wanted to charge.)\n\nOne front in this battle has recently opened up in the US. In May, more than 40 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against some of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of generic drugs, alleging that they have colluded to fix the price of more than 100 medicines over a number of years. When prices should go down after a drug\u2019s market exclusivity ended, the antitrust lawsuit claims that many prices have instead shot up \u2013 in some cases by more than 1,000%.\n\nBack in Europe, the consumer organisation Euroconsumers \u2013 of which Test Achats is part \u2013 is investigating the prices of other drugs beyond CDCA. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a few problems with a few other drugs,\u201d says Laura Marcus of Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s often about drugs that are able to cure or deal with rare diseases. For sure, it\u2019s not only CDCA.\u201d\n\nNo one doubts that developing drugs costs money. A 2016 paper in the Journal of Health Economics estimated that the average cost of developing a prescription drug to the point of reaching the market is nearly $2.6bn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Jake Hollings\n\nBut the lack of hard, openly available statistics on the cost of drug development is something that many people, including Marcus and Marleen Kemper, want to change. \u201cIn most of the cases, society is willing to pay some price,\u201d says Kemper, \u201cbut now the discussion is: what is an acceptable price?\u201d\n\nMarcus acknowledges that Leadiant has to cover its costs, but does not believe that can explain the price of CDCA rising to more than \u20ac150,000 \u2013 \u201cthe profit cannot be that high\u201d. When I ask her how much profit she thought Leadiant was making from the drug, she admits she doesn\u2019t know: \u201cThat\u2019s what the Belgian Competition Authority is opening an inquiry for \u2013 to know more about the costs the company has to bear.\u201d However, when the price for CDCA has surged so much, \u201cnothing justifies it, because there was no new research, no new nothing,\u201d she says.\n\nLeadiant rejects this. Although CDCA had been authorised in the past, the company says that \u201cthe active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as the manufacturing of the finished product needed to be upgraded\u201d to make sure that its version was compliant with current EU standards. These, Leadiant says, are more extensive and significantly more strict today than they were when earlier CDCA drugs were developed.\n\nLeadiant says that its CDCA \u201cis not a \u2018copy\u2019 of an old product\u201d. The very fact that it gained orphan drug status proves this, it argues. The company also says that \u201cthere was no robust evidence that CDCA was effective in CTX until Leadiant produced the data\u201d. Demonstrating this, it says, required \u201centirely new studies, creating new data sets\u201d \u2013 which make up \u201cthe largest ever collection of clinical data for CTX\u201d.\n\n\u201cCDCA Leadiant has been developed and brought to market at substantial cost,\u201d the company says. \u201cOur pricing is justified by our costs and investments.\u201d\n\nBut the problem is not just that Leadiant\u2019s drug is so expensive: potential alternatives have disappeared. Willemijn van der Wel, a lawyer working at the European law firm AKD, has written about Leadiant\u2019s connection to competitors who previously produced CDCA. After buying the marketing authorisations for other products that contained CDCA, he says, \u201cLeadiant began to withdraw these alternative CDCA products from the market, until only one CDCA medicinal product remained\u201d. Marcus has also queried what has happened to these products that might have been competitors to Leadiant\u2019s. But, she says, it is not clear what is behind their CDCA monopoly.\n\nLeadiant, though, says that it is willing to negotiate a lower price for its drug with the Dutch Ministry of Health and Dutch insurance companies. \u201cThe only reason an improvement has not been determined yet, is that the insurers have been uninterested or unwilling to enter into any substantive negotiations,\u201d it claims. (Leadiant did not respond to follow-up questions asking for more details of the negotiations, or what level of price reduction the company was offering.) It also emphasises that it has not taken legal action against the UMC hospital for seeking to compound its own CDCA, but that it is \u201cinvolved in a legal discussion with the Dutch Inspectorate about the interpretation of EU and Dutch medicines law\u201d.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of such discussions, something needs to be done. Having pharmacies self-compound medicines is not a sustainable model \u2013 it might reduce incentives for developing drugs for rare conditions.\n\nIt also exposes patients to risk, Leadiant argues. Pharmacies do not have to have their compounding processes checked by the European Medicines Agency or the national regulator. \u201cThere is no product control by any independent regulatory authority before or after compounding,\u201d Leadiant says.\n\nWhen it comes to market authorisation and orphan drugs, Leadiant says, \u201cit should not be about small or large scale, but safe scale\u201d.\n\nMarleen Kemper\u2019s husband warned her that taking on Leadiant would be difficult. \u201cHe said: \u2018With this initiative, don\u2019t be naive,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is very powerful, so you really have to have back-up from the [hospital] board\u201d \u2013 which she had. More than a year into her attempt to make her own version of the drug, she is recognising just how deeply dug in both sides are.\n\nShe is at pains to point out that she is not against the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cWhat people forget is that the industry is responsible for a lot of innovation.\u201d But if drug pricing means that patients potentially get left behind? \u201cThen I\u2019m getting angry,\u201d she says.\n\nBut righteous anger alone cannot sustain someone in a months-long case involving lawyers and regulators, not least when they are also raising a family, running part of a pharmacy that is actively studying hundreds of drugs, and doing their job keeping patients supplied with medicine. At times, Kemper has felt frustrated and worn down by the effort of taking on the price rise \u2013 but she vows to continue.\n\nBig Pharma\u2019s worst nightmare | Sarah Boseley Read more\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll stop and quit doing it because it\u2019s too much work, too emotionally draining.\u2019 But due to the support, I think we\u2019ll go on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be solved, for the patients.\u201d\n\nKemper is determined that she is going to provide affordable care for her patients by following the letter of the law. \u201cI\u2019m using the rules,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating.\u201d Leadiant, she accepts, has used the rules and followed them to serve its own purposes.
