Their recent pullback corresponds with the rising odds that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.)\u2014an avowed enemy of the industry\u2014will win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIndustry leader UnitedHealth Group (ticker: UNH) could be the best political indicator in the stock market. Its shares are off $4.34, or 2%, to $217.83 in Thursday trading and are approaching their April lows, when the introduction of a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill in the House of Representatives hit the entire health-insurance group. Barron\u2019s wrote favorably about the group in April.\n\nUnitedHealth rallied from a low of $207 in April to a July high of $266, when former Vice President Joe Biden was the clear leader in the Democratic field. UnitedHealth now is down 13% so far this year. Valuations in the health-insurance group have come down this year, with UnitedHealth trading for less than 15 times 2019 earnings and yielding about 2%.\n\nThe sinking performance of managed-care stocks\u2014another term for health insurers\u2014could also reflect investor concern about President Donald Trump\u2019s political prospects in the wake of the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry. He has had a relatively benign view of the industry.\n\nStrategas Group Washington political analyst Dan Clifton publishes a graph that shows a strong correlation between the combined odds of Medicare for All champions Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Ind., Vt.) winning the Democratic nomination and the relative performance of managed-care stocks versus the S&P 500 index.\n\nWarren has pulled ahead of Biden in some polls and she is the clear betting choice to win with 11-10 odds on Oddschecker, a U.K. betting service, versus 9-2 for Biden. The eventual Democratic nominee is a slight favorite to top the Republican candidate, likely Trump, in the 2020 election.\n\nWarren is a self-declared opponent of the managed-care industry and an advocate of Medicare for All, which in its most extreme form could do away with private insurers. \u201cThe insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health-care system,\u201d Warren said in June.\n\nAdoption of Medicare for All is viewed as a long shot because it would need the Democrats to win the House, Senate and the presidency next year. And even then, moderate Democrats may be loath to eliminate private insurance coverage for 150 million Americans.\n\nStill, a Warren presidency would put an enemy of health insurers in the White House and there could be initiatives to curb industry profitability.\n\nWarren has attacked banks, technology giants, and drug companies, but she goes after health insurers with particular relish.\n\nClifton noted Thursday that while the \u201cWarren effect\u201d is showing up in managed-care stock performance, it is not apparent in other industries that could be hurt if she wins the presidency, notably student lenders and private prison operators.\n\nElsewhere in the managed-care group Thursday, Anthem (ANTM) is off 1.4% to $240.69; Cigna (CI) is down 2.9% to $150.80; and Humana (HUM) is off 1.7% to $263.\n\nWrite to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com", "description": "The sinking performance of health insurers as a group could also reflect investor concern about President Donald Trump\u2019s political prospects in the wake of the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Andrew Bary"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111361/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
