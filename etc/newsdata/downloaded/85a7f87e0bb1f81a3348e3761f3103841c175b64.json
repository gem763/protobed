The drone attacks that knocked 5 percent of global oil production offline illustrate both the emerging texture of modern warfare and the externalities that test every American president.\n\nWorst of all for both American and global security, the attack exposes Trump\u2019s shit-tier leadership for what it has always been: weak, strategically unmoored, and capricious.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s dick-swinging tough-guy act has always had a demonstrable falsity to it, a gimcrack exterior of bluster and martial swagger that sells only to his credulous base of reality TV-addicted cultists. International crises are measured in the most stark and painful terms; in blood and treasure. There's no next-day Kellyanne Conway spin or safe-space crying pillow on Fox & Friends when the stakes are global stability and order\u2014particularly when the dancers at this hoedown will soon have nukes and human lives are at stake.", "description": "The mullahs know what they\u2019re seeing when they behold Trump: a buffoon and a bluffer who just might be dumb enough to start a war with nightmarish consequences.", "authors": ["Rick Wilson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568697476/190916-wilson-clown-tease_hughp1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
