There has not been a significant proposed change to Section 230 since then.\n\nBut the Energy and Commerce Committee has primary jurisdiction over Section 230, and over the past several months, top members of the panel have expressed interest in various proposals to hold platforms \"accountable\" for their content moderation decisions.\n\n\u201cThis hearing will explore whether online companies are appropriately using the tools they have \u2014 including protections Congress granted in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 to foster a healthier Internet,\" Pallone said in the statement with Reps.
