The locations include Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines and Sioux City.\n\nNineteen Democratic presidential candidates have agreed to participate in the forums. Each candidate will have 25 minutes on stage to answer questions from both moderators and the audience.\n\nThe forums will be moderated by Kathie Obradovich, Des Moines Register Opinion Editor, and Kay Henderson, Radio Iowa News Director. These are invitation-only events for AARP members, and the audience at each forum will consist of 200 to 250 Iowans.\n\n\u201cOlder voters turn out in force in every election, so any candidate who wants to win in 2020 needs to focus on soaring prescription drug prices and other issues they care about,\u201d said John Hishta, AARP Senior Vice President of Campaigns. \u201cThese forums will put candidates on the record, and older voters will be watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of the concerns of older Iowans, including health care, the economy and the quality of education for their children and grandchildren, are shared by voters of all ages,\" said Carol Hunter, executive editor of The Des Moines Register. \"The forums will allow Iowans to hear directly from the candidates about these important issues, whether by attending the forums or watching a livestream on their digital devices.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump will also be invited to share his views with AARP members ahead of the general election.\n\nAARP has a proud 33-year history of non-partisan voter engagement, providing voters with information on where the candidates stand on issues important to older voters and their families, so they can make their own decisions on Election Day. In addition to its work in Iowa, AARP will conduct a full-scale voter engagement campaign that includes polling, advertising, events, content, video voters\u2019 guides, and more.\n\nThe Des Moines Register is Iowa\u2019s premier source for news about the state\u2019s presidential caucuses. Since 1943, the Register has provided exclusive insights into the opinions of Iowans through its Iowa Poll, and since 1980, it has partnered with other organizations to host caucus debates and forums.\n\nThe forums will be livestreamed at www.DesMoinesRegister.com and open to credentialed media.
