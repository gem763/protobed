It doesn't need to look great (though that helps), but it should be big enough to hold all the essentials and small enough to fit in a pocket.\n\nThe Quinn Card Holder from Pixie Mood is slim, sleek, very affordable at $22, and made from cruelty-free materials.\n\nI've been using this wallet for almost a year now and I'm impressed with how much it can fit. It's definitely seen some wear and tear, but nothing unexpected and considering the price, it's held up pretty well.\n\nNote: The price will show up as $30 CAD on Pixie Mood's website, but should be processed in USD when the order is placed. The US equivalency is $22.32.\n\nI've been searching for the perfect wallet for what feels like forever.\n\nIt used to be that my bulky leather wallet housed almost every receipt and card I've ever had, but only made its way into the rotation when I was carrying a large purse. For days when I traveled with a small crossbody bag, I moved the important stuff into a coin purse. And, if I ever went bag-free, I'd just shove my most-used cards and a little bit of cash into the card holder on the back of my phone and call it a day.\n\nThe problem with constantly moving all of your important cards around \u2014 besides the fact that it's an annoyance \u2014 is that things can easily get misplaced, which isn't great news when it comes to difficult-to-replace ID cards and such.\n\nThat's why I thought it was time to finally make a change. Time to find a wallet compact enough to fit into my back pocket but with enough space for all of the cards I could need on any given day; one that would let me keep my most-used cards easily accessible. Durable materials and stylish designs would be a plus, but surely not what I was would base my choice on.\n\nSometime at the end of summer when my wallet search was kicking into high gear, the Pixie Mood Quinn Card Wallet landed on my desk.\n\nSince my coworker handed it to me for a team review of Pixie Mood's standout styles, I haven't switched my wallets once. There's hasn't been any reason to, frankly. It's stylish, made of durable material, and holds everything I need. Plus, it doesn't hurt that it's an affordable $22.\n\nThe Quinn in Black, Lavender, Muted Rose, and Grey. Pixie Mood\n\nThe specs\n\nPixie Mood makes vegan leather bags that are trendy, practical, and socially responsible all at once. Instead of real leather, Pixie Mood uses polyurethane for its wallets and bags, a synthetic form of leather which is actually more lightweight than the real deal. Since real leather is touted as a luxury material, the idea of a faux version can sometimes seem like a cheap imitation. In reality, all of Pixie Mood's bags and wallets are not only cute, but have a high-quality look that suggests they're much more expensive.\n\nTechnically, the Quinn is not really a wallet, but a card holder. It has a slim profile with five card slots on the front and a zip-around compartment that can hold coins, bills, and other small bits. At just over five inches long and three inches tall, this can fit in pretty much any bag or pocket. While it may seem too small to be a substantial wallet, it holds a surprising amount inside. At the moment, I have seven cards and six MetroCards (I know, I need to deal with that) scattered throughout the five card slots. Inside the zip compartment, I have some business cards, receipts, and a few stray coins.\n\nThe Quinn, despite being faux leather, has a nice pebbled leather feel. Mine is a pretty seafoam green color, and while I believe that was a special summer edition, you can still find plenty of other great colors. They have your classic neutrals, like black and grey, as well as jeweled tones like spruce green and even shiny metallics.\n\nIn my experience, most $20 wallets act like $20 wallets. The zippers frequently get jammed, seams burst too soon, and the materials look as cheap as they are. The Quinn, on the other hand, has a classic look and is particularly durable. Of course, after frequent use, light-colored materials will show wear, so if you're worried about that I'd recommend going for a darker color.\n\nA one-year update on how the wallet has fared\n\nMy wallet has seen some wear and tear. Remi Rosmarin/ Business Insider\n\nAfter almost a year, this wallet has definitely seen some wear and tear, but I still use it every day. The zipper has gotten a little finicky, which is understandable with use. The vegan leather has started to fade a little, particularly at the corners of the wallet, but it also has softened up the same way that real leather does, which was unexpected but a nice touch. The seams along the first slot in the card holder are pulling, but my cards still stay secure so it's not really an issue. Its definitely not as clean as it once was, but that was inevitable. I think if this were a darker color (maybe black or navy) the wear and tear wouldn't be so visible. At just about $20, I would say this is all expected. It's still fully functional and looks pretty nice, so I'll continue using it until that changes.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you're in the market for a new wallet, the Quinn from Pixie Mood is an easy choice. It's cute, durable, cruelty-free, and just over $20 \u2014 making it a choice that your style, values, and budget will all like. Personally, my litmus test for this wallet was to see how long I could go without switching my things to another wallet, even if just for the day. Considering this has been my only wallet for months now, things seem to be going pretty well and I don't see the need for a more expensive option.\n\nNote: The price will show up as $30 CAD on Pixie Mood's website, but should be processed in USD when the order is placed.
