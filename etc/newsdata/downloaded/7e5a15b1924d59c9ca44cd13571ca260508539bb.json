That is a dangerous recipe for success.\u201d\n\nA half dozen Tampa pitchers combined for a six-hitter as Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell came out of the bullpen for his first career relief appearance and held off Houston in the ninth inning to earn the save at Tropicana Field.\n\nAstros ace Verlander was not so fortunate. He was starting on just three days rest for the first time in his career after dominating the Rays in game one. But he looked shaky on the mound and was pulled in the fourth.\n\nThe veteran was charged with four runs on seven hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out five.\n\n\u201cI walked a couple of guys. They came up with some big hits when they needed to. It is not the way you script it, sucks,\u201d said Verlander.\n\nAdames clubbed a home run off Verlander and gunned down Jose Altuve at home plate in the fourth.\n\n\u201cWe never panicked,\u201d said Kiermaier. \u201cIt is even better now. We got a lot of momentum.\u201d\n\nThe Astros finally got on the board in the eighth when Robinson Chirinos hit a two-out, solo home run off Colin Poche to close the gap to 4-1.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Willy Adames and Tommy Pham belted homers and Tampa Bay chased Justin Verlander early as the Rays forced a deciding game five in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/c7886f_tommy-pham-tampa-bay-rays-singles-houston-astros-inning-in-game-american-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
