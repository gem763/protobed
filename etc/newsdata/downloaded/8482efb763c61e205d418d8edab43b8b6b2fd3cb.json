Got all the videos.\u2019\n\nExplaining why she was sharing the intimate pictures to Twitter, Bella wrote: \u2018Yesterday as u all know all my s*** was hacked. For the last 24 hours I have been threatened with my own nudes I feel gross, I feel watched, I feel someone has taken something from me that I only wanted one special person to see. He has sent me multiple nude photos of other celebs, he won\u2019t stop with me or them he will just keep going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For too long I let a man take advantage of me over and over and I\u2019m f***ing sick of it, I\u2019m putting this out because it\u2019s MY DECISION NOW U DON\u2019T GET TO TAKE YET ANOTHER THING FROM ME.\n\nFuck u and the power u think you have over me. I\u2019m gonna write about this in my next book\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 pic.twitter.com/0Ep0iXgW51 \u2014 BITCHIMBELLATHORNE (@bellathorne) June 15, 2019\n\n\u2018I can sleep tonight better knowing I took my power back. U can\u2019t control my life u never will.\u2019\n\nThe Midnight Sun star continued: \u2018Here\u2019s the photos he\u2019s been threatening me with, in other words here\u2019s my boobies. So here f*** u, and the last 24 hours I have been crying instead of celebrating my book while doing my book press. Oh yea, the FBI will be at your house shortly, so watch. Your. Mother. F***in. Back.\u2019\n\nWhile there were a number of crude replies to the pictures, many fans praised Bella for reclaiming the power in the awful situation.\n\nBella \u2013 who is currently at war with ex Mod Sun after they ended their two-year romance \u2013 later told The Hollywood Reporter that while she is furious with the hacker, she doesn\u2019t want to \u2018ruin\u2019 him as she believes he\u2019s a teenager.\n\nThe actress, who has just released a compilation of poetry and essays called The Life Of A Wannabe Mogul: Mental Disarray, said: \u2018This kid sounds like he\u2019s 17, as much as I\u2019m so angry and wanted to f*** him up over doing this to people I just wanted to teach him a lesson.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s still a kid and we make mistakes, this mistake is a bad one. But I don\u2019t want some 17 year old\u2019s whole life ruined because he wasn\u2019t thinking straight and being a dumbass.\u2019\n\nBella added: \u2018Plus, he\u2019s obviously smart so if he got on the right side of the tracks he could actually possibly help our community and be an alliance. You can\u2019t always tear someone down for their bad sides but more so build up their good sides.\u2019\n\nBefore the hacker taunted Bella with her intimate pictures, they targeted her Twitter account, posting tweets using racist language and changing her profile picture to that of a man.\n\nHer Twitter account has now been restored.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
