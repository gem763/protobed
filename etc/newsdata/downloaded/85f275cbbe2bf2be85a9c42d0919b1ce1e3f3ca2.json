And you know it,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday during a joint press conference with the president of Finland. Trump was referring to allegations that he pressed Ukraine's leader in a July phone call to investigate Biden, his son Hunter and their business dealings in that country.\n\nReferencing Hunter Biden's board seat with a Ukrainian firm despite a lack of experience, Trump said: \"His son walks out with millions of dollars. And the kid knows nothing.\"\n\nTRUMP BLASTS BIDEN AS 'STONE-COLD CROOKED' IN EXPLOSIVE PRESS CONFERENCE\n\nDuring a March for Our Lives conference, Biden reacted, saying there is \u201czero, zero, zero, zero evidence of any assertion being made.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\" Biden said, \"the issue is this president of the United States engaged in something ... which at minimum gives a lot of running room for the Russian and Ukraine. I think we should just focus on he's the issue.\n\n\"Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what\u2019s that fella\u2019s name, Rudy \u2018Hudy\u2019... Giuliani. That\u2019s it,\u201d Biden continued, referencing Trump's personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who like Trump has alleged Biden misdeeds in Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP SAYS SCHIFF 'HELPED WRITE' WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, AFTER HOUSE PANEL ADMITS ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBiden said he\u2019d like to get back to talking about guns and lethal gun violence in America, since Trump hasn\u2019t done \u201canything rational relating to guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he did have time for one meeting. [NRA head] Wayne LaPierre spent some time with him, in return, I suspect for help in his impeachment proceeding,\u201d Biden continued.\n\nA New York Times report on Friday alleged LaPierre promised financial support for the president\u2019s defense in upcoming political fights over impeachment if Trump would \u201cstop the games\u201d on gun control legislation. The NRA has denied its chief executive had any such conversation with the president.\n\nTrump has been accused of freezing military aid for Ukraine over the summer, then using the money as leverage to spark an investigation of the Bidens' business arrangements in that nation. A whistleblower complaint has kicked off a House impeachment inquiry, looking at whether the president might have, in this fashion, encouraged foreign meddling in the 2020 election to undermine the former vice president, a leading Trump rival.\n\nThe president has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the inquiry an effort by Dems, who control the House, to win 2020 via impeachment.\n\nFox News' Jeffrey Rubin contributed to this report.", "description": "Biden responded to President Trump calling him and his son Hunter \u201cstone-cold crooked\u201d by asserting there is no evidence he did anything wrong, and calling to re-center the focus on Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/Trump-Biden_AP.jpg"}
