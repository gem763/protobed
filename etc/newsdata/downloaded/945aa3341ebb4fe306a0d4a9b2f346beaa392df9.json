They block all the MTR stations, where the police have arrested [us] many times. The police also stop and search at the MTR stations.\u201d She wore a mask, cap and sunglasses to disguise her identity during the demonstration.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople they just stay around this area. When something happens they can still go home at night without being searched in the tunnel.\u201d\n\nThroughout Sunday small groups of protesters would spray many of these locations with graffiti, often smashing windows and doors, before quickly running away as police sirens blared.\n\nWhile vandalism was rife, petrol bombs were only seen in one district by Sunday evening while firelit barricades were also few in number. Once unthinkable on the streets of Hong Kong, such tactics have become the norm as protests push into their fifth month.\n\nPolice arrested dozens of people on Sunday, including bystanders heckling officers.\n\nDemonstrations began in early June against a legislative bill that would have allowed residents to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China. They have since evolved into a citywide movement against both the government and Beijing, with calls for democratic elections as well as a commission to investigate police violence.", "description": "\u2018Blossom everywhere\u2019 tactic is a reaction to politicisation of MTR subway system", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cac2ac2a3fe60929ed06bd26cf534ce09da0a8c/0_71_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b87335358a7dd57a1e498f156a4582e4", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
