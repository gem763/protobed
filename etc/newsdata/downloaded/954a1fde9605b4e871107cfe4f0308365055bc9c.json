With fast food chains such as Burger King, Chick-Fil-A, Taco Bell and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts now offering \u2018fake meat\u2019 versions of their main meal options, the vegan burger industry is booming, as consumers look beyond real meat products out of health and environmental concerns.\n\nMcDonald's on Thursday announced plans to test a plant-based burger using Beyond Meat patties in Canada.\n\nThe 12-week test will start Sept. 30 at 28 restaurants in Southwestern Ontario.\n\nThe item will appear on those menus as the P.L.T, which stands for plant, lettuce and tomato. The burger will sell for C$6.49 ($4.90), plus tax.\n\n\"This test allows us to learn more about real-world implications of serving the P.L.T., including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations,\" Ann Wahlgren, McDonald's vice president of global menu strategy, said in a statement.\n\nShares of Beyond Meat soared 12% in morning trading, while McDonald's shares inched up 1%. Since its May initial public offering, Beyond's stock has surged 517%. However, in the last two months, shares have tumbled 34% after a secondary stock offering, increased competition from Big Food rivals and concerns about its valuation.\n\nMeat substitutes from Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have soared in popularity this year, as more U.S. restaurant chains, like Dunkin' and Red Robin, add them to their menus. Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International, recently launched a version of its Whopper made with the Impossible burger nationwide.", "description": "McDonald's will test a new \"plant, lettuce and tomato\" sandwich using Beyond Meat's patties in 28 restaurants next week.", "authors": ["Amelia Lucas", "Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105974556-1560863923706gettyimages-1150123894.jpeg?v=1560863994", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
