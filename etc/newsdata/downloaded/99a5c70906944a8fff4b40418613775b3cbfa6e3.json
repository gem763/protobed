She needs to look at her new life from a very positive and balanced way. She also needs to do a lot of introspection about her relationship with her own identity, her future, and her goals \u2013 both as an individual as well as with her husband-to-be. She needs to be financially secure and stable herself,\u201d advice Sugwekar. The bride-to-be needs to have communicated with her fianc\u00e9 and his family about career, responsibilities, and any other important life decisions.\n\n\n\nSugwekar further notes, \u201cShe needs to have open communication with her husband-to-be and in-laws. Major problems arise when facts are not shared and discussed giving equal respect to all. Keeping her self-respect intact, she can deal with the presenting situation with a lot of understanding, empathy and problem-solving mindset. Sometimes it also can be very simple things which become triggers in the relationship \u2013 for example, too much of mobile usage at times when they are with each other, lack of cleanliness, tidiness in the bedroom by either of them, not preparing the right type of food. Everything is possible \u2013 just say it in a proper manner. Avoid using abusive language, harsh body language, ignoring your husband when he has something important to say. If the issues are with the in-laws, again communication is very vital. Talk to them freely and assertively, she needs to make her point in a manner in which it is understood \u2013 not because she thinks that way!\u201d Kanitkar adds, \u201cGive your relationship time!\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a new setting, and there could be many lifestyle changes. The couple needs to take cognizance of the fact that it is not going to be easy from the get-go. Compromising, supporting and trusting each other will help you in the long run.", "description": "If you\u2019ve come to that stage in your life where marriage is becoming important, you need to ask yourself this question, and some more!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/aug/sthlove1566978899.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
