It's like some sort of stop off, it's like a lay-by. It's like the Little Chef of the Galaxy.\n\n'The lady who lived next door - who was a very respectable lady and someone who wouldn't make up stories - told us that one morning she was in the kitchen which overlooked the back garden.\n\n'She said she was standing there making a coffee and a flying saucer came down and hovered over her back garden and then went.\n\n'Of course, you think that's nonsense but she was a very serious lady.'\n\nSheen continued by saying both he and his father had had similar close encounters.\n\nHe said: 'One day I was coming home from school. I got off the school bus and I was walking up my street.\n\n'I was just about to turn up the path to my house and coming round the mountain [near his house] was a formation of lights.\n\n'I stood there looking at it thinking, 'this is going to be some sort of weird reflection'.\n\n'There was a formation of some things coming round and going out across the sea then disappearing.'\n\nSheen said of Port Talbot (pictured): 'It's like some sort of stop off, it's like a lay-by.
