She was a project architect at Shive-Hattery in Bloomington.\n\nThe architect\u2019s office is responsible for the Illinois Capitol in Springfield and the several state buildings and grounds that surround it. Aggertt says she wants to finalize a master plan within the next year to study the complex\u2019s short- and long-term needs.\n\nThe State Journal-Register reports the capital bill Illinois lawmakers approved last spring includes $350 million for projects in the complex.
