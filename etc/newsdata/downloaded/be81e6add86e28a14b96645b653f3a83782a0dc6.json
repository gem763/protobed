REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\n\nThe measure is another sign of how U.S. sanctions are affecting the functioning of Venezuelan state institutions.\n\nBut the practical impact is limited because the bank is small and hyperinflation has reduced use of credit cards, whose credit limits rarely keep up with price increases.\n\n\u201cThe Bank of the Armed Forces denounces to its civilian and military clients ... the suspension of interbank services for its credit cards on the part of the American company Mastercard,\u201d the bank said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department in March told Visa, Mastercard and American Express that they could not continue doing business with Venezuelan state institutions after March 2020.\n\nThat was part of a broad set of sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s government that is meant to push Maduro from office and support opposition leader Juan Guaido, who in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency.\n\nCommerce in Venezuela\u2019s collapsing economy depends heavily on debit card transactions, which operate principally on a local platform, and increasingly on dollars and euros in cash.\n\nVenezuelan bank regulator Sudeban earlier this year asked local banks to design a new payment system, according to a financial sector source, who added the project has not been completed.\n\n\u201c#Mastercard should know that its arbitrary action will not intimidate us,\u201d Bank of the Armed Forces President Dario Baute wrote via Twitter. \u201cThe @BanFANB technology team is stronger than you think and our legal team will respond with the same force with which you attacked us.\u201d\n\nMastercard, Venezuela\u2019s Information Ministry and the Bank of the Armed Forces did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMastercard also halted services to state-run Agricultural Bank.
