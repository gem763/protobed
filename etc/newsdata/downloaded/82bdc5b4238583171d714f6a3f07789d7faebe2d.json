REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nErdogan, modern Turkey\u2019s longest serving leader, has already faced a series of setbacks this year including an economic recession which has eroded AK Party support and defeat for his candidates in mayoral elections in Ankara and Istanbul.\n\nThe June loss in Istanbul prompted ex-economy minister Ali Babacan to resign and call for a \u201cnew vision\u201d for Turkey. Ex-Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, once Erdogan\u2019s closest ally, also resigned from the party two weeks ago, saying it had lost the ability to solve the country\u2019s problems.\n\nThe defections pose a serious challenge to Erdogan\u2019s 16-year rule in Turkey, a NATO member bridging Europe and the Middle East which wields regional power despite the downturn that hit its $722 billion economy.\n\nThe AK Party already relies on an alliance with nationalists for its parliamentary majority, leaving it vulnerable if it loses even a small proportion of votes to new parties set up by either Babacan or Davutoglu.\n\nThree former party stalwarts who spoke to Reuters said the AKP would continue to lose members because it had lost touch with its base and its founding principles.\n\n\u201cVirtually every day colleagues who have taken roles in the party since the first day are choosing a new path,\u201d said a former senior official who resigned from the party. He declined to be identified.\n\n\u201cWe used to be a party where there was considerable consultation but there is not a trace of that left,\u201d he said. \u201cMany friends want to make a new start in Babacan\u2019s or Davutoglu\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nA senior official at AK Party headquarters, who asked not to be identified, played down the defections, saying figures like Babacan and Davutoglu did not enjoy the popular support which Erdogan still attracts.\n\n\u201cThe AK Party is a powerful party and will overcome this period,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not expect large-scale, mass resignations.\u201d\n\nFALLING MEMBERSHIP\n\nWhen the AKP was launched in 2001, it blended an Islamist-rooted outlook with a pro-Western, democratic and liberal market approach which enjoyed broad popular backing. Since then Erdogan has won sweeping powers under a new executive presidency, approved in a fiercely contested and polarizing referendum.\n\nWhile a series of former lawmakers have joined Davutoglu in resigning, the AK Party\u2019s representation in parliament has remained steady with 291 MPs in the 600-seat assembly.\n\nHowever, official data shows the huge membership of the party as a whole slid to 9.87 million by early September, from 10.72 million in August last year.\n\nIn a speech to party officials earlier this month, Erdogan played down the decline, saying that 95% of the fall was due to deaths of existing members and that membership was still more than 10 million.\n\nBut some commentators say the sliding membership reflects an underlying decline in support.\n\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s popularity over the last seven years...is generally on a declining trend, artificially boosted by one-off events, to the point where it looks irreversible,\u201d said Gareth Jenkins, of the Stockholm-based Institute for Security and Development Policy.\n\nAmong former lawmakers who have resigned and declared support for Davutoglu is Cuma Icten, who entered politics in the 1990s with the Islamist Welfare Party from which Erdogan himself emerged.\n\nIn a statement on his Facebook account last week, he said those leaving in the AK Party were now being labeled as traitors just as those forming it in 2001 were accused of betraying the Islamist movement.\n\n\u201cThe government has declared everyone who is not a member of its own party as a traitor and has marginalized everyone who does not think like it,\u201d Icten said in his statement.\n\nAnother former party member said he and other colleagues had resigned after feeling excluded.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses AK Party and Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) supporters during a rally for the upcoming local elections, in Istanbul, Turkey March 24, 2019. REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo\n\n\u201cNew resignations are coming constantly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that we will express ourselves better in new parties... There are many colleagues who want to follow us.\u201d\n\nJenkins said a party formed by Babacan would draw support away at a critical time, with Erdogan making policy \u201cmistakes and miscalculations\u201d in the absence of good advice.\n\n\u201cHe has become more disconnected from the expertise and competence within the AK Party, increasingly surrounded by \u2018yes\u2019 men,\u201d Jenkins added.", "description": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party faces more defections after losing 840,000 members in the last year, former loyalists say, compounding its difficulties after two founding members broke ranks aiming to set up rival parties.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434527608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0VD", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
