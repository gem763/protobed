The behaviour of 70 kittens was monitored throughout.\n\nThe results reveal that 64% of the animals appeared less stressed during the reunion with their owner than during the separation and, during the reunion, showed a balance of roaming around and being in contact with their owner \u2013 a response the team say is evidence of secure attachment.\n\nThe authors say the remaining 36% of kittens showed hallmarks of \u201cinsecure attachment\u201d \u2013 remaining stressed upon reunion, with the majority seeking cuddles and the others either avoiding contact or appearing conflicted about what to do.\n\nA similar split in secure versus insecure attachment style was seen in 38 adult cats, and the team say such a split has also been seen in previous research involving children and dogs with their caregivers.\n\nHow do you know your cat loves you?

The researchers say that suggests that while such measures might influence the development of an attachment style to start with, once established such styles are pretty well stable.\n\n\u201cThis may suggest that heritable factors, such as temperament, also influence attachment style and could contribute to its stability,\u201d they write.\n\nHowever, Prof Daniel Mills, an expert in veterinary behavioural medicine from the University of Lincoln who has previously studied human-cat relationships, said the research has flaws, including that the team did not explore other possible types of bonds and did not repeat their experiments with strangers. That, he said, means that the cats might have been responding more generally to social support from human presence, rather than showing attachment to a particular individual.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, as far as we can tell, responses around the owner that look like attachment are often largely the result of previous reinforcement,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Mills added that kittens show attachment to their mother, he said it remains unclear whether they form a similar attachment to their owners.\n\n\u201cI think cats do emotionally bond with their owners, I just don\u2019t think that at present we have any convincing evidence that this is a form of psychological attachment in the normal psychological sense,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Lauren Finka from Nottingham Trent University agreed.\n\n\u201cFor species that spend a large proportion of their time in proximity to specific humans, it can be very advantageous to form bonds with them,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, unlike children and potentially dogs, it is less probable that cats have an innate need to form strong, secure attachments to their caregiver, particularly as adults \u2013 hence signs of this are more likely rooted in factors like their personality, early socialisation and how we keep them.\u201d", "description": "Scientists say felines display similar \u2018attachment styles\u2019 with caregivers as dogs and children \u2013 but not everyone is convinced", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea1229b569d94f17ec91bc9098376b64eb85039/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2b512d342adb74be0cb6ecc7d05531e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
