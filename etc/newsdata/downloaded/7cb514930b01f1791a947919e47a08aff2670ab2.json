Rising from her seat on a literal different tier of the auditorium, she descended a small set of stairs and headed toward the stage. The walk took just long enough to give viewers a chance to think about how far she had to travel, and along the way TV cameras watched as she passed by rows of seemingly (though perhaps not genuinely) unmoved actors and directors applauding half-heartedly, if at all. Once on stage she gave a delightful speech, and then \u2014 naturally, inevitably \u2014 at the exact moment she began to wrap up with, \u201cI just want to say one quite serious thing \u2026\u201d, the music came in; she was being played off. A box was ticked, on to the next thing.\n\n(If you prefer your metaphors more on-the-nose, there\u2019s always Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs referring to Mr. Turner cinematographer Dick Pope as \u201cDick Poop.\u201d)\n\nYou could argue that at least the Oscars broadcast makes time for these craft categories, particularly since a subset of niche awards are given out on a different night altogether, at the Academy\u2019s annual Scientific and Technical Awards a couple weeks prior to the main event. Then again, the Academy\u2019s proposal earlier this year to relegate the presentation of four below-the-line categories to commercial breaks undermines such a position. That suggestion was swiftly snuffed out by a contingent of above-the-line stars and filmmakers, the people who know best how indispensable talented craftspeople are to the production of a good film or show. But the subtext remained; the spotlight wants who it wants.\n\nAs fall festival season continues and this year\u2019s Oscar race starts to take shape, Vulture wants to cut down on the distance remarkable craftspeople have to travel to get some love. In this post and the series of corresponding profession-specific stories we\u2019ve published, we\u2019re going to be giving proper credit to those people whose work truly brings entertainment to life. What you\u2019ll find below is just a starting point \u2014 it isn\u2019t a comprehensive look at every role involved in a movie, though we want it to expand it in that direction.

That was his entr\u00e9e into Foley art, or the live reproduction of sounds that are added to TV and film scenes after the fact, usually with a creative array of everyday objects. After 40 years in the field, he is nothing short of a veteran of cinematic reverberation, having distinguished himself by practically creating the kinds of sounds that would otherwise be left to sound designers or effects specialists to pluck from prerecorded archives. The layered booms of explosions, the delicate tinkling of shattered glass \u2014 Hecker creates them from scratch from his station at the backlot of Sony Pictures Post Productions, where he\u2019s been in residence for the past two decades. His work spans titles like Big Trouble in Little China, The Witches of Eastwick, The Hunger Games, and Justice League, but one of his most recent credits is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s ninth film has one of the wildest finale of the year, so Vulture asked him to break down the Foley elements of the ultraviolent climax involving Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), three members of the Manson Family, and a well-trained dog.\n\nPussycat (Margaret Qualley) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) before the Manson Family\u2019s attempted murder spree in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Photo-Illustration: Vulture and Photos by Columbia Pictures\n\nGary Hecker: That was an intense scene. I was working with Wylie Stateman, who is the sound supervisor, and he turned me loose on that just to do whatever I wanted. It started with the Manson gang getting out of the car and walking up that long street. Wylie wanted to hear their pants and jeans, that sound it makes when their legs move together. Then they were carrying knives and pulled out a gun. So, there were little nuances, all their feet and their cloth and jeans, and you see a little glimmer in the moonlight hit the blade. I made a little metallic \u201czshinng\u201d that you hear when they go by the camera. Then the guy was pulling the gun out, so I had to do all his gun movements.\n\nOnce they get up to the house, the first thing I had to do, which is crazy with Foley, was the sound [that turned] Brad Pitt\u2019s head [to notice the Manson Family members]. So, I had to nudge a door and jiggle a door knob, and it cued the dog\u2019s head to look over. That was the sound that kind of started everything and triggered a reaction. When they came in, some of the sounds I did were they pulled their knives out and stuff like that, which was a big thing with the \u201czshinng\u201d as those blades were coming out. There were a couple of different blades, so they all had to sound distinct, and the sound of the \u201czshinng\u201d were my fingers lightly striking the blade of a machete on its edge. It had to be done softly, delicately and tastefully, to make it sound real, because they really were not scraping against anything. It was just enough sound to make an \u201cessence\u201d of the blade shimmering in the moonlight.\n\nAt this point, the Manson Family members have entered Rick\u2019s house, where Cliff is in the kitchen tripping on acid. At first, he fails to properly process the danger he\u2019s in, even after the cultists brandish their weapons. But what the Mansons don\u2019t know about Cliff is that, in addition to being a stuntman, he\u2019s a war veteran trained in combat. The gang members threaten Cliff, but he and his faithful pitbull, Brandy, thwart their plans in extreme fashion.\n\nHecker: When Brad Pitt makes a little sound [with his mouth], click click, the dog takes off from the couch, so there are all the dog\u2019s footsteps, the dog\u2019s collar, and the dog just shredding that guy\u2019s pants. That\u2019s just tearing different pieces of jeans and thick pants, sweats \u2014 big tears and yanking on the cloth. Then the guy was getting bounced against the door, so I bounced against a door. When Brad Pitt is smashing that Manson cult member\u2019s head with a phone, I had to go in my prop room and find the right phone with a really ringy bell. Back in that era, in the late sixties, the phones had the bells in them, so using one of those old-style phones I smashed it into the middle of a wooden desk, just making it really thick and resonant and violent. Just pounding. They wanted everything violent.\n\nWhat\u2019s cool about Tarantino is he loves Foley and he loves sound, and he crosses the line. \u2014 Gary Hecker\n\nWhat was cool about that one is, Brad Pitt was hallucinating on LSD from that thing that he smoked, so I did that cue and I\u2019m pounding the phone, and you know how that ring echoes? The last hit, the bell would be just resonating out and this machine I was using happened to do some weird thing to that last ring and it made it into a weird flurry, like it wasn\u2019t real. We were actually laughing after, because that\u2019s how this might sound in Brad Pitt\u2019s mind. It was perfect.\n\nAfter he smashed her head into the phone, he hit her face into the cement mantle, which they played huge, almost comical. It\u2019s gross, but I had to come up with the sound for it. What I did was mic it super close and then I took the palms of my hands, the meaty part, and I smashed them on my stage on a cement slab surface that\u2019s a little hollow underneath for the thunk. I got those face hits so you could hear face and skin. He probably did it like four times or five times, so I did those, and it actually hurt to do it. Then for the skull crunches or teeth, I cracked celery for each one. Then of course there\u2019s the blood that you could see squirting out of her face. So, on another channel I used a shammy soaked with water. I also put water in my mouth to make it so I would squirt the blood out. When you played all those channels, it was out of control. It sounded killer.\n\nWhen the screaming girl blasted through that sliding glass door to where Leonardo DiCaprio was out in the pool, I blew up a pane of glass for her, which they played giant. Then there was all the glass debris coming out onto the wet patio, and they had closeups of her crawling in glass; I did all that stuff. She ends up landing in the pool and Leonardo is freaking out, so he gets off his little lounge chair and goes into the closet to get the flamethrower. The flame itself, we don\u2019t do fire on the stage. Once in a while we do fire effects, but I don\u2019t like to do it. The fire was done with sound effects. I just had to come up with this sound of him grabbing and moving this metallic flamethrower and the gun that shoots the flame. So, the Foley was the tanks, the movement of the gun, Leonardo\u2019s footsteps. And then sound effects had the flamethrower.\n\nWith a lot of the films you work on, the sound and the Foley is recorded at a good level, but then it\u2019s tucked down into the movie, because they\u2019re trying to tell a story. What\u2019s cool about Tarantino is he loves Foley and he loves sound, and he crosses the line. If you listen to all of his movies, they sound awesome. He\u2019s really into signature sounds, and that\u2019s what I do in Foley: try to create signature sounds. He really appreciates it, and he\u2019s really picky. Your sound can\u2019t just be average, ordinary sound. It\u2019s rewarding to me because if you know all that hard work is going to be under the magnifying glass, it\u2019s a challenge. Then I\u2019ve got to make it killer. I\u2019ve been lucky and done Tarantino\u2019s last three movies now \u2014 Django, Hateful Eight, Once Upon a Time \u2014 and hopefully his next film, whatever it is.\n\nCostume Designer When You Have Nine Hours to Create the Royal Wedding An SNL veteran on \u201cby far the biggest challenge I\u2019ve ever faced.\u201d What was the hardest costume Tom Broecker ever designed? Here, he recounts a particularly tough gig for Saturday Night Live\u2019s season 43. I\u2019ve been working [at SNL] long enough that you think it\u2019s all easy, and you can manage the whole thing. But a year and a half ago maybe, we did the royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. We had the read-through on Wednesday, before the wedding had taken place, and we read a sketch that was all about the wedding, with Prince Harry and William and Queen Elizabeth and Pippa and Kate Middleton, and a bunch of other people. You sort of go, Okay, the actual wedding hasn\u2019t happened yet, and it\u2019s not going to happen until Saturday. So there was no way to get any information until the day of. On TV the wedding started at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning New York time, and I think by 8:30 we saw the dress. We were able to finally see everything by 9 o\u2019clock Saturday morning and had to have costumes ready by 6 p.m., which is when we have dress rehearsal. That meant we had to make the queen\u2019s costume, Kate Middleton\u2019s costume, plus the hats, the accessories, everything: the two uniforms that Harry and William wore, the morning suit that Prince Charles wore. It was creating an entire wedding in nine hours. It was by far the biggest challenge I\u2019ve ever faced. A lot of places are closed on Saturday, so we had a milliner who worked with us on Saturday Night Live standing by to make six hats. We had nine principal costumes to copy, and we needed to get them exactly right. There were 12 other people in the sketch, like background people walking around and that kind of stuff. We were re-creating costumes that took people months and months to make in nine hours. That is sourcing fabric, sourcing hats, sourcing flowers, sourcing feathers, getting them back to the shop in time so that there could be people there ready to start cutting fabric, making it, sewing it, pinning it, and getting it on camera. It was stressful. By 5 \u2018o\u2019clock we were doing the fitting part, so that gave an hour and a half, two hours, before dress rehearsal to alter, and we were still working. We had to refit a couple of things between dress and air. We were still working right up until showtime because we wanted it to be as right as possible.

I t \u2019 s C o m p l i c a t e d . \u201c'No is not an option' is how we approach Ryan Murphy television.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a moment in the last episode of Pose season two, in which lead character Blanca lip-syncs Whitney Houston\u2019s peerless rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d \u2014 the one she delivered at the Super Bowl in 1991, practically inventing the words \u201cgleaming\u201d and \u201cramparts\u201d right there on a football field. Most people probably watched Blanca deliver that last \u201co\u2019er\u201d and thought, Wow, I\u2019m so glad this song is in the public domain. But most people would be wrong, as Pose music supervisor Amanda Krieg Thomas explained. The song might be in the public domain, but Houston\u2019s take on it isn\u2019t \u2014 and getting it into an episode of Ryan Murphy\u2019s FX series was easier said than done. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d Krieg Thomas says, \u201cyou need to clear the recording with Whitney Houston\u2019s label.\u201d And that\u2019s just the first step.\n\nIn the Pose season two finale, Blanca performs Whitney Houston\u2019s iconic rendition of the \u201cStar Spangled Banner.\u201d Photo: Vulture and FX\n\nOn its surface, the job of a music supervisor sounds like a dream: Who doesn\u2019t think highly of their own curated playlists, their ability to match an obscure song with a precise, emotional moment? But having great taste is far from the only requirements necessary in this line of work. When a producer or director wants something \u2014 like, say, the rights to include an iconic national anthem performance in a TV series \u2014 the music supervisor must begin the hunt, tracking down whoever owns the copyright, securing the approval to use the song in a particular scene, and negotiating the cost.\n\nWith a poison makeup, I\u2019m more concerned about the entire body. \u2014 Makeup artist Michelle Radow on mastering the art that made Sharp Objects feel real\n\n\u201cOur job is to give the showrunners, the directors, the producers what they want,\u201d says Robin Urdang, whose credits include The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Call Me by Your Name. \u201cEverything else doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s what they want. You may not think it\u2019s right, you may think it\u2019s brilliant \u2014 whatever it is, it\u2019s their vision and you need to show up and help them with their vision.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Whitney Houston anthem, which was featured in Pose\u2019s season two finale, Krieg Thomas had to sniff out who owned the copyright to the arrangement behind that \u201990s performance. It ended up being John Clayton, a well-known bassist, composer, and arranger in New York.\n\nAmanda Krieg Thomas: We were chasing him. I tried every email, every phone number we could find for his individual publishing company. A member of my team, my music coordinator, was Facebook friends with someone who knew him, so he reached out to this one person he hadn\u2019t talked to in many years. My coordinator\u2019s friend then connected us to a close friend of the arranger, who then connected us to the arranger, who was in the woods of Washington teaching a workshop. Meanwhile, his manager was on safari, and we found him through another mutual friend on Facebook and used WhatsApp to talk to him in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn situations like that, we send them a form with all the necessary information, the requested rights, a suggested fee. When it\u2019s down to the wire, especially if it\u2019s a song that we know will stay in the final cut, the key information is, \u2018We need you to confirm that you actually do control this and that you approve the use.\u2019 Once we finally got a hold of everybody, they were very excited to be a part of it. So that part was easy. We finally got it cleared the night before the scene was shot.\n\n\u201cIn the eleventh hour like that, you just try every possible connection and hope and hope that one of them comes through. \u2018No is not an option\u2019 is how we work on Ryan Murphy television. Fortunately, my team, we\u2019re all very good at our job so we haven\u2019t heard \u2018no\u2019 too much. But we do often have backup plans. In the shooting phase, we tell people to get \u2018coverage,\u2019 meaning filming them singing different songs. We make sure the set is prepared with different options \u2014 we\u2019ve had many situations where\u2019s it\u2019s been down to the wire and we\u2019ve had to clear five alternate songs urgently to make sure that, by the time the episode is done, there is an option that is ready to be in the final mix. In this case, it would have been another version of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner.\u2019 But watching the scene, it was so critical in every way to have Whitney\u2019s version. So thank God, we got it.\u201d\n\nVFX Artist J u s t F i x I t i n P o s t ! R i g h t ? \"At this point we can do so many things with visual effects that people just assume we can fix problems later.\"\n\nThe movie industry is undergoing an inexorable shift toward the spectacle, what with all its spandex-clad tentpoles and connected universes. Which means the work of VFX studios has never been in greater demand. But more demand breeds more intense competition, and as studios vie to land plum contracts with the likes of Disney and Netflix, they aspire to turn out state-of-the-art wonders faster, cheaper, and better than the next guy \u2014 a feat that only gets harder every year. Because, of course, the faster and cheaper a VFX studio can deliver incredible work, the faster and cheaper clients will expect to see the same caliber of work delivered to them next time.\n\nJohn Wick (Keanu Reeves) and a rubber knife in John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum. Photo: Lionsgate and Vulture\n\nIncreasingly, VFX studios are challenged both by multimillion-dollar franchise movies, with their long timelines and bigger budgets, and by ambitious indies and TV shows, which often wish for Hollywood-level effects even if they don\u2019t have the time or money for them. Situations that used to pose a production-delaying physical challenge can now be mitigated on a computer after the fact, at a fraction of the cost. The errant airplane or uncooperative crane in your shot, which otherwise might have steamrolled a full day\u2019s work, are no longer even minor issues. \u201cFix it in post!\u201d has become a refrain for all.\n\n\u201cVisual effects has evolved to the point where we can do so many different things, people just assume that we can fix it later,\u201d says Derek Spears, a VFX artist who has worked on The X-Files and The Walking Dead. \u201cIt takes a lot of [production] planning out of the equation. A lot of the consideration goes out the window, because you no longer need it.\u201d\n\nIn this brave new world of everyday CGI, it might surprise you just how many of the visual effects in a given film or TV show go unnoticed. \u201cI think people would be surprised how much of what they\u2019re viewing is digital. In a huge percentage of television \u2014 even normal, regular dramas, where you wouldn\u2019t think there would be effects \u2014 there are large sequences shot on green screen or tweaked in post,\u201d Spears explains. \u201cPeople miss the mass majority of visual effects because nobody is supposed to notice them.\u201d\n\nWhat are some of the more mundane effects you\u2019ve probably missed?\n\n1. The fake knives.\n\nRob Nederhorst, VFX supervisor: On set, we have what we call \u201crubbers\u201d \u2014 rubberized knives. The prop department takes a real knife, casts it in rubber, and make a mold of it. Those things are indistinguishable from the real thing. They\u2019re phenomenal. The problem is, if you take one of those and slash at someone, if you go fast enough, you\u2019re going to cut them. And we don\u2019t want that. Safety on set is the number one priority for everyone. You cannot stab someone or slash their throat with a rubberized knife.\n\nInstead, we make a handle, so the performer has something to grip on to. Then we match-move them on a computer and put a knife in there digitally. Ninety-five percent of the knives you see in John Wick 3 are digital. In the case of throwing knives, we won\u2019t even have a handle \u2014 people will mime out the throw, mime the catch, and mime someone getting hit. It\u2019s all mimed out and rehearsed meticulously. They practice this stuff so the timing feels correct. What they\u2019ll do is build up the set with cardboard boxes, and shoot rehearsals. It\u2019s not something the cast usually does, just the stunt guys, but in this case Keanu did that too. He\u2019s an unbelievably insane dude who went to the absolute max. The way we did it was like ballet.\n\nI\u2019m really fussy about data capture. In fact, I\u2019m a pain in everybody\u2019s ass about it. We scan all the performers and all the knives, and get complete, super-photogenic versions of every single person and prop, so we can re-create them digitally. If you want it to look real, you need real-world measurements. You need lighting measurements. You need to do the work.\n\n2. The substitute legs.\n\nDerek Spears, VFX supervisor, Pixomondo: In season six and season seven of Game of Thrones, we started putting Daenerys on top of the dragon. One of the things we learned, doing season five, was that when those dragons flew out of the arena, it looked a little bit too simple, because the cameras didn\u2019t move. We thought, well, next season we should move the cameras more, and move her more, too.\n\nThe production came up with a system of using moving cameras and putting Emilia Clarke on top of what\u2019s called a buck, which is a wooden form for the dragon. That would be moving, everything would be moving, and we planned out all these moves ahead of time, planned in motion control. We thought, okay, this will all line up, and it will be perfect, because we did so much planning. It\u2019ll look great.\n\nThe hardest thing in the world is having her stupid knees not slide on top of the dragon. \u2014 Derek Spears\n\nWhat we found out is that dragons aren\u2019t like solid pieces of wood. They move, and when they move, they flex, and their muscles move too. So we had the dragon flying and the muscles moving \u2014 but Dany\u2019s legs didn\u2019t react to any of it. So we had to replace her legs. We ended up replacing her legs on so many of the shots just to get it to follow the trap muscles on the back of the dragon. It was a nightmare. Everything else in those sequences was easy compared to trying to get her to sit on top of the stupid dragon with its stupid muscles. Some of the shots, we replaced her legs completely; others we mapped them on to a new piece of geometry and moved them around. Literally we had to deform the lower half of her body to make it fit.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those things: You look at the dragon sweeping over the ocean and there\u2019s fire and all these amazing things happening, and the hardest thing in the world is having her stupid knees not slide on top of the dragon. That one little detail was probably half the labor that went into those shots. Just getting her to sit down. The first time we did it, we had no idea how hard it would be. The second time, it didn\u2019t get any easier. It was just as hard.\n\n3. The dripping.\n\nMartin Pelletier, VFX supervisor, Rodeo FX: The Duffer brothers are full-on fans of \u201980s movies with old practical SFX \u2014 good old animatronics. If you want fake blood, you bring fake blood to the set, and if you want slime, you get real slime. Of course, this approach requires really long reset times, and it\u2019s not always convenient. The main reason they prefer it to CGI, though, is if you look at CGI creatures versus those in, say, The Thing or the original Hellraiser, the CGI monsters aren\u2019t dripping goo; it wasn\u2019t really possible to do that with CGI. So going into Stranger Things three, the number one thing they said was, if we are going to make a creature in CGI, it has to be insanely wet and slimy and stick. Everything has to drip.\n\nThe first creature we did was the first version of the Mind Flayer \u2014 this little creepy thing that forms after the rat explodes inside the cage in episode two. We refer to this creature internally as The Goop. It would be the first creature established as the materialization of the Mind Flayer, and it grows and evolves and becomes more agile and defined. We started with the idea of thousands of rats screaming in pain in a very dark basement. The Duffers wanted the rats to explode \u2014 or to be more precise, implode. That made it a little more interesting. You\u2019re not looking for guts and blood to splatter all over the place like a grenade effect. You want the rats to sort of flip inside out, instantly. It would splatter, but not separate into isolated chunks.\n\nThe problem was, as much as the Duffers loved gore, they said they would have a hard time getting it through Netflix if it was too descriptive \u2014 that is, once the rats start flipping inside out, we had to be careful not to make it too biological, where we can see the heart and the lungs and the eyeballs. It had to be something that looked nasty, but on that thin line between spooky-cool and outright gory. So we made a system using an animated rig rat asset and a recipe from the creature effect department. We could make it flip inside out and hide the fur instantly in a thick pile of nondescript guts and blood and mucus.\n\nWhat are the hardest effects SFX artists have pulled off?

And at one point we really got down to character, and not just how the story needs to unfold, but what people will feel when they\u2019re watching these characters.\u201d Shopmaker is a veteran in her field, having worked primarily in the independent world, casting everything from Party Monster and Shortbus to That Awkward Moment and First Reformed. Among her proudest achievements is the work she\u2019s done with Borderline Films, producers of Antonio Campos\u2019s Afterschool (which starred Ezra Miller) and Sean Durkin\u2019s Martha Marcy May Marlene (which starred Elizabeth Olsen). \u201cA young actor or actress comes in and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, this is a gem,\u2019 and then you have to make sure that gem gets seen in the best light,\u201d says Shopmaker. \u201cAnd sometimes it isn\u2019t for the project that you\u2019ve met them on, but for something down the line.\u201d She recalls a time when she worked on a television show and had an open call in downtown New York. \u201cThis blonde, wild, curly-haired girl showed up, and she didn\u2019t get to be in the TV show, but we had her come in for Martha Marcy May Marlene \u2014 and it was Julia Garner. And then of course Chris Abbott, who we met on some other movie and he didn\u2019t get to be in that movie, but we carried him on through these other projects, like Martha and James White.\u201d Casting also requires a tremendous amount of versatility. Shopmaker recalls one of her first jobs \u2014 back when she wasn\u2019t even technically a casting director, but working retail in New York \u2014 working for the Hungarian director P\u00e9ter Goth\u00e1r, who was shooting a movie in an abandoned East Village building and wanted all the residents to act in the film. (Remember, this was New York in the 1980s: Just because the building was abandoned didn\u2019t mean lots of people didn\u2019t live there.) Which meant that Shopmaker had to befriend all the people in the building. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember if the building had any stairs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a five-story building, back in the day when those buildings were, like, jerry-rigged. I walked in and climbed up and, \u2018Hey, is anyone here?\u2019\u201d She then spent the next few weeks becoming friends with the diverse cast of characters in the building, almost all of whom wound up in the final film. Goth\u00e1r\u2019s demand for realism also extended to the casting of a sex worker in the film. \u201cAny actress can play being a prostitute, but only a real one will have it in her eyes, so please go find me a real prostitute,\u201d Shopmaker remembers the director saying. \u201cSo I went out with a bunch of cash and started to ask women who clearly were working to have a coffee with me. I paid them for their time. And I found one, and she\u2019s in the movie.\u201d She pauses, then adds, \u201cMy career as a casting director has not been, by any stretch of imagination, any kind of normal trajectory.\u201d\n\nFood Stylists G i v e T h a t P l a t e o f C h e e s y L a s a g n a a n O s c a r When do you call in a food stylist? \"When the food itself seems to be performing.\"\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to Instagram an enticingly symmetrical plate of food only to be thwarted by bad restaurant lighting, you\u2019ll have some idea of how hard it can be to make even the most delicious food look good on camera. Erm, we take that back. You have no idea. Because in Hollywood, when the look of a dish really matters \u2014 when the tension in a scene hinges on a close-up of a charred leg of lamb, or the fluffy peak of whipped cream \u2014 the crew calls in an expert: a food stylist, whose job it is to make food seem just as appealing, and in most cases more appealing, than it is in real life.\n\nThe sherbert deserves a nomination, at least. Photo: Vulture and Netflix\n\nFood stylists work in tandem with prop masters, adjacent to the art and props departments. They tend to be specialists, brought in when the script calls for food in the foreground. \u201cProp masters have a team, and the team can handle scenes where, like, kids are eating hot dogs at a birthday party, or there happens to be a tray of lasagna on a table,\u201d explains Susan Spungen, who\u2019s done food on Julie and Julia and Eat, Pray, Love. But when it comes to the finer details of a dinner party or kitchen scene \u2014 involving \u201cfeature food,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the business \u2014 a food stylist is necessary.\n\nIt took three days to film the Once Upon a Time In Hollywood scene with the fried chicken. Leo took a bite out of more than 60 freshly cooked legs. \u2014 Chris Oliver, food stylist\n\nAs experts in everything from greasy-spoon breakfasts to inscrutable haute cuisine, food stylists have an advisory function on most TV and film sets, too. A screenwriter devising a scene in an upscale New York restaurant might not know whether one\u2019s likely to serve ricotta agnolotti before a course of provimi veal with swiss chard. Much in the way action thrillers hire former cops and weapons experts to nail the details, movies that care about cooking and dining rely on food stylists to get the details just right. The level of detail in a given script, too, varies wildly; where one might specify a nice plate of cacio e pepe, another might simply say \u201cthey eat Italian.\u201d It\u2019s the food stylist\u2019s job to determine with the filmmakers what kind of Italian will do.\n\nOne of the biggest changes in the field, over the last several decades, has been not aesthetic but dietary. The men and women actually performing these scenes, after all, often have to eat the stuff the food stylists make \u2014 and these days what people are and are not willing to eat can be a major headache, especially in trend-crazy Hollywood. \u201cYou can have three actors sharing a meal in a scene, and one doesn\u2019t eat gluten, one doesn\u2019t eat dairy, and one doesn\u2019t eat rice,\u201d says Reynolds. If an actor refuses to eat whatever the script calls for, the food stylist has to fake a passable version of it to fit their diet. \u201cI\u2019ve made more fake oysters than just about anything else,\u201d says McSorley, \u201cbecause actors never want to eat them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s when the food itself seems to be performing,\u201d says Melissa McSorley, food stylist on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Nocturnal Animals, and True Blood. To hear the pros describe it, food stylists are experts for hire, rung up when productions are in crisis. Food stylist Tamara Reynolds remembers being sought for Law & Order: Special Victims Unit: \u201cSomeone says, \u2018Oh my god, we need some cheesy lasagna!\u2019 And a prop master says, \u2018Oh, call Tamara.\u2019\u201d They might come on set for one day, maybe less; they might not get a call back after that. But it\u2019s crucial work. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like the low man on the totem pole,\u201d Spungen explains. \u201cI get to be pretty high up there. I\u2019m part of the creative process.\u201d\n\nFood stylists on their most memorable work:\n\nMad Men, \u201cFar Away Places\u201d (2012), Howard Johnson\u2019s sherbet\n\nMelissa McSorley: When you\u2019re working on something that\u2019s set in the 1960s, your food needs to sell the fact that this is the 1960s. On Mad Men, there was a scene where they went to the Howard Johnson\u2019s, and they had ice cream. But at the time, Howard Johnson\u2019s ice cream had a very specific look, served in a conical shape, because they had these very specific ice-cream scoops that basically nobody else uses. It was an iconic shape, and anybody who grew up going to Howard Johnson\u2019s is going to remember what the ice cream looked like \u2014 if I\u2019m using a regular round ice-cream scoop, it\u2019s just not going to fly. We needed to get that shape exactly right.\n\nOur prop master was very diligent and was able to find two of these old scoops online, on eBay. Of course, they were rusted and falling apart, so we had to rebuild them and replate them to make them usable. The scoop looks like a cone and has a spinning knob on top like a nut that you would turn, and you would scoop the ice cream and turn it and it had two blades on the side to release the scoop. I had to very, very gingerly scoop the ice cream, to protect these old scoops. One of them fell apart during shooting, and we had to soften the ice cream a bit for the other.\n\nIce cream is one of the biggest things I normally fake, because it melts too easily. But in this case they wanted to see it melt on screen, so we used the real stuff. People always assume my fake ice cream is mashed potatoes, but mashed potatoes don\u2019t take color very well. Mine is made of butter, powdered sugar, a little bit of meringue powder, and whatever coloring and flavoring needs to go in.\n\nManiac (2018), futuristic food cubes\n\nTamara Reynolds: We\u2019re working more and more with Pinterest, finding inspiration. It makes my life easier and more difficult at the same time. For Maniac, me and the prop master were searching Pinterest using certain parameters \u2014 \u201880s food, futuristic food, Japanese food. And we both found the same photo separately, a picture of these vegetables that are cubed. They looked so cool. They were cubed in a way that you could tell what meats and vegetables they were, but you could see the inside parts too. It was incredible.\n\nWell, the director loved it \u2014 and then we had to actually do it. I had never cried doing food-styling before, but I cried when trying to do this. It was so, so hard. It was so frustrating. The thing about a photo is, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done: It could be photoshopped. We think whoever made the picture must have either froze the food and cut it with a band saw, or hired the best sushi chef in history. The edges were so tight and so geometric, and the amount of food waste was insane \u2014 you\u2019d cut open a pepper but only use two little bits of it because the rest wasn\u2019t correct. It was impossible to replicate.\n\nWe did four different versions. We froze it. We did it raw. We did it cooked. We tried everything \u2014 it was like the puzzle that would not let me sleep. The director was unhappy with all of them. In the end, one of the prop kids, he was super diligent, and he took it home on the weekend and did it all with an X-Acto knife. It was insane.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), Cliff Booth\u2019s mac and cheese\n\nChris Oliver: People liked the mac and cheese? That\u2019s so weird. I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet. The mac and cheese was my daughter Evan\u2019s vegan recipe. They were concerned that Brad had to eat so much and they didn\u2019t want him to get sick or, worse, his mouth to turn orange. For the T-bone steak he feeds his dog, my team and I went through 12 giant steaks to give them enough for retakes.\n\nIt was great working with Quentin \u2014 I filled in for my friend and worked with him on Pulp Fiction, that whole diner scene. On Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it took three days to film the scene with the fried chicken. Leo took a bite out of more than 60 freshly cooked chicken legs. The big flamb\u00e9 we made with a red-hot pan and gasoline, Quentin kept wanting the flame bigger and bigger and bigger, so we\u2019d get it super hot and we\u2019d throw the gasoline on to give it that effect. We did a million things. I\u2019ll have to see what they ended up doing with it.\n\nWater for Elephants (2011), Robert Pattinson\u2019s lion food\n\nChris Oliver: I\u2019ve done lots of memorable food. I did Friends and Seinfeld \u2014 the Soup Nazi, top of the muffin, when they did the turkey on his head. Tons of stuff like that. But the littlest thing can turn into a nightmare in this job, and not always what you\u2019d expect.\n\nWe went through about 90 branzinos in two or three days. \u2014 Food stylist Jack White on that awkward Amazing Spider-Man dinner\n\nIn Water for Elephants, there\u2019s a wonderful scene where Robert Pattison has to feed the lions, and he feeds them a bucket of slime. We had real lions for that. We made this big fake bucket of slime stuff, but the lion just wasn\u2019t going to have it. The lion simply was not fooled. It\u2019s like, are you kidding me? So I had to go get livers and bones and all this stuff. Stuff the lion would actually eat. On top of that, we had the PETA people out there. They were making sure the flies and the larva we were adding to the bucket were being treated properly. Honestly. I was covered in guts in front of a real lion, and these people were worried about the safety of the flies. I mean, really?\n\nBut we got the shot. And that was not digital. That was freaking real.\n\nLabor Day (2013), a pie\n\nSusan Spungen: When the producers reached out to me about doing Labor Day, I hadn\u2019t read the book it was based on, but I was familiar with it and I knew who Joyce Maynard was. She is a big pie person, apparently. It wasn\u2019t a great movie, and not a lot of people saw it, but I loved the scene in the end. My job was to make the piece [of pie] look bad, which was really hard. When your job is usually to make things look good, it\u2019s really hard to make them look bad, on purpose. There was a scene in Julie and Julia where there\u2019s supposed to be a beef bourguignon that got left on the stove overnight and looked burnt and horrible, for example \u2014 it\u2019s a typical movie thing, having something look awful, for the drama of the scene. But it\u2019s hard for me to make something look really awful.\n\nWe were filming in an abandoned house, a big empty house, in the woods in Massachusetts. Josh Brolin has kidnapped Kate Winslet, and at one point they bake a pie together. They wanted the pie to look really, really, really super messy. I couldn\u2019t make it messy enough \u2014 they kept saying, \u201cit looks too good!\u201d They wanted it to look completely slapped together. They had crazy expectations of the food. A pie can only look so messy, you know what I mean? Most people would not make such a messy pie, period. There was tons of repetition, and we did the same thing over and over again, so eventually we got the method down, with the raw pie and the dough. By the time we made the finished pie \u2014 we did that later in L.A. in a studio instead of on location \u2014 we had gotten very good at it.\n\nLocation Scout 4 G o o d D a y s i n t h e L i f e o f a L o c a t i o n S c o u t \u201cEverywhere we go, we are visitors.\u201d\n\nA location manager is constantly putting out fires before anyone even smells the smoke. \u201cIf I\u2019ve done my job properly, I\u2019ll have an answer to everyone\u2019s questions,\u201d says Morgan Patterson (Top Gun: Maverick, Ford v Ferrari, Star Trek: Picard). \u201cCrew and neighborhood included.\u201d\n\nHow does a location scout gain access to several naval bases for Top Gun: Maverick shoots? Photo: Paramount Pictures and Vulture\n\nA good way of describing the job: It\u2019s a bridge between a film or TV production and the world that they\u2019re entering. A scout does everything from suggesting a shooting location based on a script to managing the practicalities of transforming a corner of the real world into a set. In short: permits. \u201cOnce we find the locations, we then are responsible for all of the logistics that are needed to facilitate a 150-person crew to film at all the locations,\u201d Mark Logan (Goodwill Hunting, John Q, Fringe) says. \u201cSo we start in a creative phase, and as the production moves forward, we then become the point person for making it happen \u2014 camera positions on rooftops, helicopters landing on downtown streets, all the way down to where the toilets are parked. Parking is the bane of our existence.\u201d\n\nOnly when she brought it to my attention did I notice the two dozen or so three- to four-foot-tall horses. \u2014 Tom Lounsbury\n\nAs Andrew Poppoon (The Affair, Flight of the Conchords, It\u2019s Complicated) says, \u201cEverywhere we go, we are visitors.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s easy to be a visitor, but it can also be a downright dangerous job. \u201cI\u2019ve been called everything you can be called in every different language living in New York for 12 years.\u201d Location management is yet another one of those Hollywood professions that\u2019s arguably at its most effective when no one notices it. When a production can come into a neighborhood and get exactly what it needs without upsetting any of the locals \u2014 or getting disrupted by them. \u201cIf we\u2019re on set and we don\u2019t get called on the walkie, then it\u2019s a good day for us,\u201d Poppoon says.\n\nHere are four examples of days, both good and bad, in the life of a scout:\n\nTop Gun: Maverick (2020), naval base access\n\nMorgan Patterson: One of the most challenging tasks I have ever undertaken was on the set of Top Gun: Maverick. We shot on several naval bases, and wouldn\u2019t you know it? You have to be in the Navy to have access to the bases! One of my many jobs was to compile a list of over 1,000 names to hand over to the Navy in order for them to give the crew civilian access to their bases on a daily basis. The amount of time and paperwork to get it done was astounding, and not surprisingly, there were several people who didn\u2019t get cleared. There is no one person I could call to push a name through to get that person onto the base. It took 24 to 48 hours on the short end. Mostly, it was a 7- to 14-day turnaround. I completely understood, as it\u2019s a matter of national security, and the fact that civilians would be working in and around highly classified areas of our Navy. It was the best!\n\nJohn Q (2002), a fake hospital and a real pregnancy\n\nMark Logan: [For John Q] we built a huge hospital emergency fa\u00e7ade opposite an existing hospital\u2019s emergency entrance. We were filming in the middle of the night and suddenly a police escort drove right into the middle of the scene followed by a car, and out poured an anxious husband and a very pregnant wife who suddenly were standing in front of Denzel Washington and Robert Duvall. The distraught couple staggered past them and we managed to help them across the street in the nick of time. Healthy baby ensued.\n\n16 Blocks (2006): A Chinatown shoot\n\nAndrew Poppoon: There\u2019s a movie called 16 Blocks with Mos Def and Bruce Willis. The majority filmed in Toronto, and then 17 days straight of filming in New York. We were in Chinatown filming. The street was very, very tight. One lane, but there\u2019s a bunch of shops. That day we had 300 extras, a bunch of cars, crane, stuff like that. We were the sixth production in like six months to come through and shut it down. So the locals were, rightfully so, not too receptive to another production shutting down their street. We showed up and the entire block had their music blaring and they were banging pots and pans. We eventually did get it squared away. We had translators that we started sending out to talk to people. Our location manager met with the head of the neighborhood there. It took a while and we were talking to everyone and compensating them. So, I\u2019m there running the set and there\u2019s a driving scene where the car is going to come around the corner and we have about 30 seconds to go before the camera saw the main set. They yell action and one individual comes back out and is banging pots and pans again and playing music. I ran over there real quick and I\u2019m trying to talk to this person and this person kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t understand English,\u201d and playing music. All of a sudden, out of the corner of my eye I see someone dancing, and it\u2019s Bruce Willis. I didn\u2019t realize it had been like two minutes and they had called cut. It confused the person who was playing the music. And the funny thing was that two days later in the Chinatown newspaper there\u2019s a picture of me, the person, and Bruce Willis dancing.\n\nAn unnamed production: Roughly two dozen three-to-four-foot-tall horses\n\nTom Lounsbury: On one of the first projects I was location manager, I was working in rural Illinois outside of Champaign. The director was looking for a farmhouse with \u201ccharacter\u201d that wouldn\u2019t have any neighbors in sight. We were looking at the surrounding area on Google Maps satellite view where there was a house just outside of the town we were working in that seemed to have a few structures on the property, which the director thought would be perfect. So I drove out to the remote farmhouse, which resembled more of a trailer, surrounded by different sheds of varying degrees of upkeep. When I got out of the car, there were a couple of chicken-wire fences keeping me from the front door of the house about 50 feet away. I began to move the first gate and the moment after I heard a woman shout from the house, \u2018Hey! What the fuck are you fucking doing at my gate? What the hell are you doing here? Get away from that!\u2019 I put the gate back and stood on the outside of it shouting back sorrys and explaining what brought me to her home. After a minute or two of me apologizing profusely and her cursing me up and down, she eventually calmed and approached. She didn\u2019t apologize for her aggression, which made a certain amount of sense when she explained that her farm was strictly a miniature-horse breeding farm. Only when she brought it to my attention did I notice the two dozen or so three- to four-foot-tall horses on her farm, some in barns and some casually grazing on the acre of fenced-in land. She told me that there were folks always trying to sneak onto her property and steal her miniature horses, which she bred almost exclusively for herself but had given a few away to close friends. We talked for a bit longer about her trade, and by the end, she politely declined to be involved in the film.\n\nProp Master From Trash Mountain to Pub Levine: A Very Brief Story About Prop Trucks The rolling offices are a staple on movie sets. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a rolling office and fabrication place,\u201d says veteran prop master Robin L. Miller of the 50-foot semi-trailer that houses all of the props and prop materials he uses on a daily basis. Every prop master has one. The Blacklist\u2019s prop master, Courtney Schmidt, affectionately calls hers \u201cTrash Mountain.\u201d In Miller\u2019s truck are \u201cdrawers of different styles of knives from different periods,\u201d among many, many other things. But on the Miami Beach set of Cocoon 2: The Return, prop master Steven Levine\u2019s truck housed something else entirely: a pub. \u201cNot to be outdone by the grip department,\u201d which had turned their truck into what they affectionately referred to as Club Duz, Levine tells Vulture, \u201cmy Prop crew opened up our own \u2018watering hole.\u2019\u201d Below are photos of both establishments.

If \u201cthe director of the film is the boss \u2014 in the hierarchy of authority, you work for them.\u201d But it\u2019s \u201ca collaborative job,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou talk with a director about how best to shoot the story. You\u2019re looking to be able to be yourself and speak openly, and you hope that what you\u2019ve said is helpful so that your director goes with it.\u201d Guillermo del Toro\u2019s regular right-hand man Guillermo Navarro suggests that these professional bonds can vary in intimacy: \u201cThere are many instances where this relationship is fluid or confused. There\u2019s no strict border between director and cinematographer; the divide is defined individually in each pair.\u201d\n\nDanny DeVito as the Penguin on the set of Batman Returns. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nThe director and cinematographer have to agree on the three main parts of photography: composition, mood, and movement. And once an aesthetic has been jointly agreed upon, the cinematographer \u2014 also referred to as the director of photography \u2014 has to relay the stylistic decisions to a squadron of camera operators, focus-pullers, gaffers, key grips, and assistants, who then get to work bringing what\u2019s been imagined to life. The size and responsibilities of that team vary with the scale of the operation; on smaller indie jobs, a cinematographer may set their own lights or personally operate the camera during each take. Macat, for one, relishes the opportunity to work with his hands. \u201cWhenever I can operate the camera myself, I do. It\u2019s the best job on a film set, this white-gloved person who comes in and executes the shot set up for them. It\u2019s fun and immersive.\u201d\n\nThe hottest-button issue in the industry currently concerns the schism between shooting on physical filmstrips and recording using digital video. Thirty-five millimeter film offers a gorgeous, lived-in look that tape can only imitate, though the logistics of workflow grow more complicated. \u201cOn film, you have to call cut more, whereas you can keep rolling and rolling when shooting on digital,\u201d explains Sundance award winner Amy Vincent. \u201cI love to shoot film, there\u2019s nothing like it. It\u2019s an indescribable sensation. There\u2019s an alchemy to photochemistry that gives a cinematographer a feeling of power, as if you have a secret knowledge nobody else does.\u201d\n\nCzapsky knows the feeling well. \u201cWhen it comes out even better than it looked in your imagination, there\u2019s a rush you get. I\u2019ve heard jazz musicians feel the same thing. You get off on it.\u201d What\u2019s the biggest rush he\u2019s ever experienced?:\n\nThe monkey freaks out, shrieks, and attacks Danny right in his balls. \u2014 Stefan Czapsky\n\n\u201cOn Batman Returns, in the Penguin\u2019s lair. It was all pre-digital. I think there\u2019s something like 120 visual-effects shots in the entire thing. We used stages at Warner Bros. mostly, but this set required water and tall ceilings and space enough for a half-million-gallon pool, so we went to Universal. Oh, and the whole thing had to be refrigerated because it was filled with real penguins. My job was to light this space, and I\u2019ve never been a big planner. I don\u2019t make diagrams. In this case, we couldn\u2019t hang lights because they\u2019d be in the shot. [Burton] wanted 360-degree shots getting the high ceilings. So we had to install lights in the pool, and deal with the safety issues of running electricity through water. The sheer scale was like nothing I\u2019d ever done before. It was a studio operation.\n\n\u201cFunny story: While we were on that set, the Penguin\u2019s supposed to receive an [RSVP note from Batman], and a monkey had been trained to hand it to him. It was a formerly dangerous monkey, and even sitting on your shoulder, it could rip your face off. It was all a matter of familiarizing him with Danny DeVito. We\u2019re rolling, and the monkey\u2019s not handing him the note, so Danny reaches for it, which was not the blocking during training. The monkey freaks out, shrieks, and attacks Danny right in his balls. Luckily, he had enough padding as the Penguin that he wasn\u2019t hurt, so he just takes his umbrella and starts beating on the monkey to get off him. It was just a protection instinct, the monkey didn\u2019t get hurt, but it was a great take.\u201d\n\nOn-set Animal Trainer F r o m H o l l y w o o d t o B r o a d w a y , H o w O n e T r a i n e r L i t e r a l l y T e a c h e s O l d D o g s N e w T r i c k s \"At 20, I became a world-famous animal trainer.\"\n\nBill Berloni owes his career in animal training to Little Orphan Annie. He had just graduated high school and was trying to make it as an actor when he took an internship at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut. Goodspeed was working on what would be the world premiere of Annie, and a proper animal trainer for Annie\u2019s dog, Sandy, wasn\u2019t in the budget. Enter Berloni, who, in exchange for a bit part in one of the company\u2019s other musicals, became an overnight dog trainer. \u201cI went to the pound, found the original Sandy, trained him as I had my own pets, and a year later the show opened on Broadway,\u201d Berloni told Vulture. \u201cAt 20, I became a world-famous animal trainer.\u201d That was in 1977. He\u2019s been in the business ever since, training, with Dorothy, his wife and business partner, animals for stages and screens, big and small. Vulture caught up with Berloni to find out what exactly being an animal trainer is all about, from selecting the right rescues to traveling across the country to Seattle to borrow a family\u2019s pseudo-wolf for a Broadway play. (The dog went straight for Berloni\u2019s face!)\n\nBill Berloni and his dog, Bowdie. Photo: Vulture and William Berloni/Instagram\n\nHow are you doing today, Bill?\n\nPretty good. I went into the city, did a dog shoot, and then after that had a rat audition.\n\nWhat does a rat audition entail?\n\nAn HBO show wants a rat for one of their characters, and I went to make sure that the rats are friendly.\n\nWhere do you begin when you\u2019re training a new animal or you\u2019re working with an animal for the first time?\n\nAll the animals I\u2019ve ever trained in the last 40 years have been rescues. It starts with getting a part, going to the shelter, finding the right dog or cat, rehabilitating it, and preparing it for the role. I [also] screen other trainers who train humanely, and then represent them and their animals on [film] sets. I have 30 dogs, but they don\u2019t always get the job.\n\nOther than dogs, what sorts of animals do you work with?\n\nI don\u2019t do wild animals; I only work with domesticated animals. I have a series of horse people and raptor people I\u2019ll work with. Farmers who specialize in goats, or sheep, or cows. A call will come in, like somebody looking to cast a rat for an HBO show. I\u2019ll ask what color and provide pictures. They pick the one they want and I\u2019ll do a \u201cgo see\u201d to prove that the animal that they\u2019ve chosen exists and can do the behaviors. If it passes that step, you\u2019re booked to shoot the day.\n\nThe Greatest Showman is among your credits. What was that job like?\n\nBefore I even accepted the job, I said to them, \u201cI have to ask you, are you using circus animals?\u201d And they said, \u201cNo, all the animals are CGI.\u201d\n\nWhy was it important to you to make sure that there were going to be no circus animals involved in the shoot?\n\nWhen I was starting to do research 40 years ago about how you train those animals \u2026 I find that the methods used to train wild animals are very harsh and inhumane. Domesticated animals have been bred and sort of reprogrammed to deal with man. I\u2019m so happy CGI has come along.\n\nOkay, so what animals did they need from you?\n\nThe call went out for a dog to replicate Queen Victoria\u2019s King Charles Spaniel. The scene calls for the dog being able to bark at Tom Thumb. The exact look was the hardest thing to find. We found a breeder who lives in Manhattan and loves doing movie work. She agreed to let us take one of her boys, who looked like that dog, and train it. So we took Skipper home and we worked with him and taught him how to bark. Four months later we show up to the set.\n\nThe first thing I educate directors to is that dogs don\u2019t act. \u2014 Bill Berloni\n\nDuring those months with Skipper, how did you two prepare?\n\nStep one is getting the dog to like you. Whether it\u2019s a rescue or you\u2019re borrowing someone\u2019s pet, there\u2019s a transition period. It all starts with basic obedience training, which is teaching your dog how to listen. People think that to teach dogs means you train them to do things. Well, I know how to do a lot of things, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I wanna do them for people unless I like them. Our training method is one of positive reinforcement. Once they realize that (a) you\u2019re nice and (b) there\u2019s some fun to be had doing it, then you can start teaching them whatever the behaviors are that you want for the show or film.\n\nIn this case, how to bark.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple reasons why dogs bark: to defend, to get attention. So we\u2019ll line up three or four dogs who know how to bark, make them speak, and sit the other dog next to them. That dog will sort of look in amazement, like, Why are they getting cookies? Then they\u2019ll sort of bark out of frustration. You capture that moment, put a command to it, and then you\u2019ve got the behavior. So that\u2019s what we did. Taught Skipper how to sit and stay, and then taught him how to bark on a hand signal.\n\nAre there precautions taken when teaching an animal to do something that, under normal circumstances, you would never want that animal to do?\n\nThe first thing I educate directors to is that dogs don\u2019t act. They don\u2019t act happy; they don\u2019t act sad; they don\u2019t act angry. They\u2019re in real time.\n\nWhat about the aggressive stuff?\n\nYou always get these calls for biting dogs. There\u2019s a type of attack-dog training that is actually very humane, in which the animal has been taught to bite for fun. I\u2019m fortunate enough that the woman who trains dogs for the New York City Police Department lives in Connecticut, her name is Meredith Vallillo. She\u2019s got all these brilliant shepherds that are the sweetest dogs you can imagine. So whenever we get an aggression-type shot you know I\u2019ll call Meredith.\n\nWhat is the most challenging project you\u2019ve ever trained an animal for, on stage or screen?\n\nA couple years ago, there was a production of The Crucible on Broadway directed by Ivo van Hove. About two months before the show was gonna start rehearsals, the producers called me and said, \u201cBill, our director wants a wolf to walk across the stage.\u201d\n\nOh, is that all?\n\nWolves and wolf-hybrids are illegal to own. So my wife and I did some research and we found a rare breed of dog called a Tamaskan. About 25 years ago, a bunch of people got together to start breeding dogs to look like wolves. That\u2019s the sole purpose of a Tamaskan. The dogs are actually used in Game of Thrones as the direwolves. Dorothy and I started calling some breeders \u2014 there was one person in Romania and there was one person in Seattle, Washington, who\u2019d loan us their dog. I went out to Seattle and met this family\u2019s pet Tamaskan, Luchta. They said he was really friendly, but I came into their home and Luchta, an 85-pound dog, sort of went for my face.\n\nAfter the show ended you sent Luchta back to his family?\n\nI had him for a total of eight months. I drove him back and kissed him good-bye. They ended up being compensated for the use of their dog, and then he was much better trained and more socialized than he was before.\n\nWhat do you think people would be surprised to learn about animal training?\n\nThere are no laws protecting animals on sets.\n\nReally, none? I just assumed the \u201cno animals were harmed\u201d spiel meant some sort of laws were in place.\n\nThe American Humane association is a third-party observer. And they\u2019re paid by the producer to be there. They can say, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should do that; we\u2019re not going to give you the seal,\u201d but they don\u2019t have any law-enforcement protection. They sign a nondisclosure agreement, so they can\u2019t even call law enforcement if they witness something that\u2019s been wrong. I love when the reps are there because then it\u2019s not just me saying no, but the American Humane association\u2019s probably only on 5 percent of the sets that are being shot on a day here in America. Trainers have to really self-police.\n\nCraft Services A Craft Services Professional Shares Her Best Recipe View this post on Instagram Taco Tuesday #filmphotography #catering #craftservices A post shared by Catherine Olazabal (@best_crafty_ever) on Sep 14, 2019 at 10:06am PDT Behind every good movie is a great kitchen (unless you\u2019re Nancy Meyers, in which case it\u2019s the focal point). For all of the extras, stunt coordinators, prop masters, DPs, best-boys-slash-grips-slash-boom-operators, there are craft-service workers, chefs, and cooks who start working \u201cup to three hours\u201d before a day\u2019s shoot begins to make sure that the entire crew is properly fed. \u201cCraft service started out as almost like a courtesy for crews that would be shooting in a remote location,\u201d says Stacy Adler of Y-Cats Craft Service. \u201cThey could be working, say, overnight. Say, somewhere in Brooklyn by the water, in February. It\u2019s freezing cold. So instead of, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s have somebody run out and get a pot of coffee,\u2019 it became somebody\u2019s job.\u201d For Adler, even the toughest shoots can be ameliorated by a freshly baked cookie, like the kind she provides each day she\u2019s working. Sometimes, it\u2019s more than a cookie, though: white flowers for Mariah Carey, or guava water for Sarah Silverman, a custom cake for Krysten Ritter. Anna Terlikowska of Chef Ania Production Catering and Craft Service said that Dom P\u00e9rignon is a frequent request on sets. Catherine Olazabal of Crafty Cathy, who\u2019s provided services for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade production and 12 seasons of The Bachelor, recently had to obtain \u201cBlake Shelton\u2019s vodka,\u201d which you can\u2019t necessarily purchase from its website. \u201cMatthew McConaughey got me hooked on kombucha,\u201d she says of her time on the set of Martha and Snoop\u2019s Potluck Dinner Party, \u201cthe ginger-lemonade one.\u201d But, when given the opportunity to choose, what does Olazabal make for a hungry, dietarily complex cast and crew? Vegan 7 Layer Dip. Here\u2019s her recipe: Ingredients 2 large avocados\n\n2 tsp. hot sauce\n\n1/2 lime, juiced\n\nA pinch of salt\n\n1 16-oz. can refried beans\n\n1 cup fresh salsa\n\n3/4 cup vegan sour cream\n\n1/2 cup vegan shredded cheese\n\n3 green onions, sliced\n\n1/4 cup whole black olives\n\n1/4 cup chopped cilantro Preparation Mash avocados with hot sauce, lime juice, and salt. In a glass casserole dish, spread refried beans followed by mashed avocado, salsa, and sour cream. Top with green onions, olives, and cilantro. Serve cold with chips and veggies to dip.\n\nStunt Performer W h a t S t u n t P e o p l e D r e a m A b o u t \"A pirate sword fight that turns into a fall off the ship into the ocean, and then we continue the fight in the water.\"\n\nAsk a stunt person about the hardest cinematic sequence they\u2019ve ever pulled off \u2014 be it on two wheels or in midair \u2014 and they\u2019ll dutifully recount the choreography, the fear, the botched rehearsals and failed takes behind some of the most memorable movie action scenes. It\u2019s their job, to perform such death-defying moves safely and with as much forethought as is celestially possible. And so they can almost be rote in describing the grueling details of their profession. How do you get a stunt person really talking? Ask them about the one stunt they haven\u2019t yet performed \u2014 the one they\u2019ve been dreaming about but haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity or chutzpah to make real.\n\nIn short: a lot of car tricks. Photo: Vulture and Paramount Pictures\n\nHere are six veteran stunt performers on what they fantasize about:\n\nThe Aquatic Fencer\n\n\u201cA pirate sword fight that turns into a fall off the ship into the ocean, and then we continue the fight in the water.\u201d \u2014PeiPei Alena Yuan (Star Trek, Lucifer, Legion)\n\nThe Turducken\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done pretty much every stunt there is to do, like burns and car jumps. I suppose it would be pretty cool to jump a car out of an aircraft carrier, and then leave the car and parachute down. No, wait, a motorcycle stunt. You know, on a motorcycle, it would be even better, right? You\u2019d ride out the back of an aircraft.\u201d \u2014Melissa Stubbs (Inception, Salt, Suicide Squad)\n\nThe Reverse Turducken\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve always wanted to do was to have a guy run a motorcycle off a cliff and land on the outside of an airplane that\u2019s cruising underneath the cliff. Like, he runs a motorcycle off a cliff at like 120 mph with people chasing him, and he flies off the cliff, and then you see him pop into a wingsuit and then land right in the back of the airplane as these people are watching him, hoping he\u2019s going to die, and the airplane comes in and he lands right in the back of it.\u201d \ufeff\u2014Jack Gill (The Dukes of Hazzard, Gone in 60 Seconds, The Fate of the Furious)\n\nI love car chases! I love everything that goes fast and close to the ground. It\u2019s where I can be like myself. \u2014 Fred North, the helicopter influencer behind the Fast & Furious franchise\n\nThe Speeding Ticket\n\n\u201cThere are some things that I\u2019d like to do if it would be record setting. Something like averaging 200 miles an hour for a certain distance on a public road. We would have to refuel while we\u2019re doing it. Stuff like that that would make a big splash on the news.\u201d \u2014Paul Dallenbach (The Watcher, Fast & Furious, Need for Speed)\n\nThe Traffic Stop\n\n\u201cI really like to do things in a sequence, like not just one car slide \u2014 a whole rhythm. Something that requires a couple of different beats in it, like do a fight scene that would end up in traffic, miss being hit, then pull a guy out of the car, hop in the car and take off, then throw a 180.\u201d \u2014David Barrett (John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, The Matrix Reloaded, Jurassic Park III)\n\nThe Lunch Break\n\n\u201cOh, I would like to set some records on two wheels. I\u2019d like to do the fastest and the longest distance. You know, pack a lunch and just get up there on two wheels, and just drive around until I set the record.\u201d \u2014James Smith (Transformers, The Man in the High Castle, Finding Steve McQueen)", "description": "Animal wranglers, prop masters, stunt performers, food stylists, costume designers, Foley artists, and more explain how they run Hollywood below the line.", "authors": ["Jen Chaney", "Bilge Ebiri", "Zach Schonfeld", "Rebecca Alter", "Jordan Crucchiola", "Dan Reilly", "Calum Marsh", "Brian Tallerico", "Charles Bramesco", "Madison Malone Kircher"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/how-it-works/09-how-it-works-opener.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
