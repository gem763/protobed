His ability to promote a fight is undisputable.\n\nBut what will happen once the two fighters finally step into the Octagon at UFC 243?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for Izzy selling the fight,\u201d said Whittaker, the UFC Middleweight Champion. \u201cThat takes work off my plate.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhittaker is pitted against Adesanya in a Middleweight title unification fight this Saturday at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia. On paper, it appears that Whittaker, with advantages in his wrestling and elite striking, is well-positioned to put away interim champ Adesanya.\n\nThe undefeated Adesanya (17-0) has received quite a bit of the \u201cIzzy\u2019s great, but it\u2019s too much too soon\u201d treatment, especially over the past month. Adesanya has been compared to Darren Till, someone UFC president Dana White gets excited about and rushes into a title fight despite not being ready for the challenge. A win for Adesanya on Saturday would shoot him into another stratosphere, but Whittaker (20-4), who has won his last nine UFC fights, gives reason to doubt whether that will happen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better than he is across the board,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in there and do me. I\u2019m going to hit and feel where the fight goes.\n\n\u201cBest case, we touch gloves, I put one on his chin, and we go home early.\u201d\n\nAdesanya has won each of 17 fights, but only six of those wins were earned in the UFC. Whittaker admitted that the prospect of knocking off, and knocking out, the undefeated, outspoken Adesanya has a certain appeal.\n\n\u201cI love derailing hype trains,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201cI\u2019ve done it a bunch of times. That\u2019s going to make me very happy.\u201d\n\nLiving in nearby Sydney, Whittaker holds a rare home field advantage in this fight.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more comfortable,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201cI can stay with my family longer, I can play with my kids longer. I don\u2019t need to leave until later, I get home earlier. So my training changes because I don\u2019t need to fly out sooner. I can just do me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stoked. This fight is going to be the biggest fight for this part of the world. It\u2019s only going to bring more light to the sport and the athletes.\u201d\n\nThe pre-fight narrative and media attention is slightly skewed because of Adesanya\u2019s skillfulness at promoting the fight. He understands how the system works, using it to its fullest advantage. Adesanya has spoken about how he is the draw, that he is earning more money in the fight, and talked his way into people believing that he should be the favorite.\n\nWhittaker is much more hesitant with the media. While the fight world has witnessed a lot more star-building surrounding Adesanya, the chatter about the actual fight should be centered around Whittaker.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a dull fight in my entire career, and it\u2019s not going to start this Saturday,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201cAs for everything else, I can only be me.\u201d\n\nJustin Barrasso can be reached at JBarrasso@gmail.com.
