REUTERS/Toby Melville.\n\nThe offer is the first significant move by chief executive Bob van Dijk since Prosus went public last month, creating a European tech firm with a market cap of $120 billion, largely due to its 31% stake in Chinese internet and gaming giant Tencent.\n\nVan Dijk said the all-cash offer was worth \u00a34.9 billion, a 20% premium to Takeaway\u2019s offer of 594 pence based on its closing share price as of Monday, but at 710p still below the 731p original value of the Takeaway bid.\n\nTakeaway shares have fallen 15% since its agreed offer was announced in July.\n\nThe Prosus CEO said he had been unable to reach an agreement during talks with Just Eat\u2019s board, so was making the announcement to give its shareholders the opportunity to consider a higher bid.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going hostile,\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to agree on a proposal, but we believe that shareholders will find this offer attractive.\u201d\n\nHe said that the companies have some overlap in Brazil, and Prosus has the greater financial resources needed to invest and grow Just Eat\u2019s business.\n\nJust Eat said the Prosus bid \u201csignificantly undervalues\u201d the company and had been unanimously rejected by the board. It said it stood by the deal it agreed with Takeaway, saying that was based on \u201ccompelling strategic rationale\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, the British company said it had engaged with Prosus and rejected several lower offers from the firm before it announced its unsolicited bid.\n\nAnalysts said a bidding war for Just Eat between the two Dutch-based suitors now looms.\n\nThat was \u201calways a strong possibility, given the increasingly low-ball offer from Takeaway.com\u201d, Neil Wilson of Markets.com said. \u201cA bidding war is now on. You may need more like 750p to sort this out.\u201d\n\nTakeaway shares rebounded 4.4% to 74.05 euros on Tuesday, while Just Eat shares soared 24.3% to 733 pence, above Prosus\u2019s offer price.\n\n\u201cThe Prosus offer is in many ways very cheeky and even more low-ball \u2013 it\u2019s still under the 731p initial offer from Takeaway.com, and... could force Takeaway.com into raising its offer as it looks in a weakened position due to the stock\u2019s decline,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nSeveral top ten Just Eat shareholders, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and Eminence Capital, have said they oppose Takeaway\u2019s offer.\n\nOn Tuesday Cat Rock, which has significant holdings in both Just Eat and Takeaway.com, also rejected the Prosus offer as less attractive than that of Takeaway.\n\nProsus, the huge technology portfolio company which was spun off from South Africa\u2019s Naspers (NPNJn.J) last month, traded just 0.4% higher on the news.\n\nThe firm already owns stakes in various food delivery services globally, including Delivery Hero (DHER.DE), Latin America\u2019s iFood and India\u2019s Swiggy.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A logo of Prosus is diplayed at Amsterdam's stock exchange building as Prosus begins trading on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam, Netherlands, September 11, 2019. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nTakeaway.com and Just Eat have little overlap in their global footprints, and a combined group would have leadership positions in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.\n\nJust Eat\u2019s earnings momentum has slowed as it has boosted investment in an increasingly competitive market, causing shareholders including Cat Rock to push for the company to combine with a rival.\n\nThe firm said on Monday third-quarter revenues grew 25% to \u00a3248 million and forecast 2019 adjusted underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around \u00a3195 million, excluding an underlying loss in Latin America.", "description": "Dutch internet conglomerate Prosus made an unsolicited $6.3 billion (\u00a34.9 billion) cash bid to buy British food delivery firm Just Eat Plc on Tuesday, using its superior financial firepower to try to scupper an all-share offer from Dutch rival Takeaway.com .", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443699484&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0VN", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
