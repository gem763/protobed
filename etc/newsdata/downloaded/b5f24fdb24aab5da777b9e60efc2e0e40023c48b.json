Senate Seat", "language": "en", "text": "A Republican attorney who represents Wall Street whistleblowers is jumping into New Jersey\u2019s 2020 Senate race, seeking to replace U.S. Sen. Cory Booker.\n\nStuart Meissner, who worked in the New York Attorney General\u2019s office under Eliot Spitzer, will formally enter the race Monday in what will be an uphill contest in deep-blue New Jersey.\n\nThe last time a Republican candidate won a Senate race in the state was in 1972.\n\nIn the most recent election, New Jersey Republicans fumbled one of their best chances in years to notch a U.S. Senate win. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez easily beat Republican Bob Hugin to win reelection in 2018, despite negative attention from a federal corruption trial that ended in a mistrial in 2017.\n\nMr. Meissner, who also worked in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, has never held public office. He said his experience as a prosecutor and attorney for whistleblowers sets him apart from previous Republican candidates. In 2016, he represented a former executive at Monsanto Co. who collected a nearly $22.5 million reward for alerting the Securities and Exchange Commission to alleged accounting violations.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think are Stuart Meissner\u2019s chances of beating Cory Booker in his district? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Meissner said Mr. Booker has ignored his New Jersey constituents as he attempts to climb the political ladder. Mr. Booker, who is currently pursuing the Democratic nomination for president, can simultaneously seek reelection for his Senate seat under state law, but he hasn\u2019t launched a Senate campaign yet.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey needs someone who will actually represent their interests day to day,\u201d said Mr. Meissner.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Booker didn\u2019t immediately comment.\n\nRepublicans Tricia Flanagan, who worked in the pharmaceutical industry and ran for Senate in 2018 as an independent, and Hirsh Singh, an engineer and former gubernatorial candidate, are also seeking the GOP nomination for the Senate race. The New Jersey primary is in June.\n\nSen. Cory Booker is pursuing the Democratic nomination for president.

About 45% of registered New Jersey voters approve of Mr. Booker\u2019s job performance, down from 54% in April 2018, according to a Monmouth University poll released last week.\n\nMr. Meissner, who ran for Senate as an independent in the 2013 special election, was a Democrat for most of his life but changed his party affiliation in 2016 after becoming fed up with what he said was the party\u2019s drift to the left. He describes himself as a Trump Republican and was an early volunteer for President Trump\u2019s campaign, he said.\n\nWhile he agrees with the president on most policy issues, Mr. Meissner said he opposes the $10,000 deduction cap on state and local taxes that filers can claim on their federal tax returns, which was a component of the federal tax bill signed into law by Mr. Trump.\n\nHe wants that cap lifted and said sending a New Jersey Republican to join the Senate majority can make that happen.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have no voice because we don\u2019t have any Republican senators there,\u201d said Mr. Meissner. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for New Jersey to have a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "description": "Stuart Meissner, a Republican attorney who represents Wall Street whistleblowers, is jumping into New Jersey\u2019s 2020 Senate race, seeking to replace Sen.
