Telecom investments in the country will total 40 billion pesos ($2.08 billion) per year, Slim said.\n\nSlim's telecoms giant, America Movil (MX: ), has also been in touch with the governments of Guatemala and El Salvador about boosting investment there, the businessman said.\n\nSlim also offered a glimpse of investments in other parts of his business portfolio, saying he plans to spend 20 billion pesos per year on energy and 12 billion pesos per year on real estate. Infrastructure investments will total more than 100 billion pesos if the company is awarded contracts on the administration's major projects, he added.\n\nHe singled out the planned Mayan Train, which would connect tourist hotspots in southeastern Mexico, as one attractive target.\n\n\"We will compete, but we don't know what we will win and what we will lose,\" Slim said.\n\nAlthough he predicted that the Mexican economy would not grow this year, Slim was bullish on the investment climate in his home country, predicting that gains in the minimum wage and social aid programs would boost consumption.\n\n\"There is no slowdown, not just for us but for the market,\" he said. \"There's lots of projects and lots of money.\"\n\nDespite his supportive words for Lopez Obrador, the 79-year-old magnate demurred when asked what grade he would give the politician for the start of his administration.\n\n\"I'm not a rater of presidents,\" he quipped.", "description": "Mexican billionaire Slim vows to invest in Mexico, touting economic prospects", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F20T_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
