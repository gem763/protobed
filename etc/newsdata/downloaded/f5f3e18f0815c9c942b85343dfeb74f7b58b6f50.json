The samples were collected between 2003 and 2015.\n\nThe area has a large human population on the coast and significant environmental problems. \u201cThey include septic tanks, runoff from the land, freshwater discharge from canals, to name a few,\u201d said Adam Schaefer of Florida Atlantic University, the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nBacteria developing new ways to resist antibiotics, doctors warn Read more\n\nOf the 733 samples from 171 dolphins analysed, 88% contained a pathogen resistant to at least one antibiotic. The antibiotic to which the pathogens were most commonly resistant was erythromycin, which is commonly used to treat chest infections, acne and sexually transmitted infections including chlamydia and syphilis.\n\nResistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin among E coli pathogens more than doubled over the period studied, mirroring trends in human infections.\n\n\u201cAntibiotic resistance is one of the most significant risks to public health,\u201d said Gregory Bossart, the chief veterinary officer at Georgia Aquarium and a co-author of the study. \u201cAs resistance increases, the probability of successfully treating infections caused by common pathogens decreases.\u201d At least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection in the US each year, and at least 23,000 people die as a result.\n\n\u201cIn 2009, we reported a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance in wild dolphins, which was unexpected,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cSince then, we have been tracking changes over time and have found a significant increase in antibiotic resistance in isolates from these animals.\n\n\u201cThis trend mirrors reports from human healthcare settings. Based on our findings, it is likely that these isolates from dolphins originated from a source where antibiotics were regularly used.\u201d\n\nSchaefer said the resistant bacteria enter the lagoon from terrestrial sources including sewage discharge. \u201cOnce in the lagoon, the antibiotics create selective pressure on the normal bacteria that are present.\n\n\u201cThe bacteria that are not resistant die, and resistant bacteria remain and proliferate, essentially creating a population of resistant pathogens that dolphins are exposed to.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the journal Aquatic Mammals.", "description": "Research in Florida finds 88% of samples have pathogen that resists at least one antibiotic", "authors": ["Gregory Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05b542f366d942d7d29f45116c5c03f5f3c512f/472_931_4202_2522/master/4202.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e0a5f3c13d3f5b348fc14a0d08c75b3", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
