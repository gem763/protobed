Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s troubles might be just beginning.\n\nRevelations of how far Zelenskiy\u2019s administration appeared willing to go to please U.S. President Donald Trump are depleting diplomatic capital he needs to end a deadly conflict with Russia , repair the Ukrainian economy and to improve his country\u2019s corrupt reputation.\n\n\u201cKyiv clearly didn\u2019t win any points from this situation,\u201d Penta Center analyst Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Ukrainian think tank, said. Ukraine \u201cnow has to worry about how not to become a toxic partner that Western leaders turn away from.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially important as Zelenskiy prepares for a summit with the leaders of Russia, France and Germany this month to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, where 13,000 people have died in five years of fighting between pro-Moscow separatists and Ukrainian troops.\n\n\u201cToxic\u201d is a word few Ukrainians would have used a year ago for Zelenskiy, 41, who before he became president was an actor known for a political sitcom, romantic comedies and self-deprecating charm. The political neophyte renewed hope in long-struggling Ukraine and overwhelmingly won an April election.\n\nZelenskiy has been in a different spotlight since Trump pressured him to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate hoping to challenge Trump next year. A July 25 phone conversation between the two leaders helped trigger a congressional impeachment inquiry.\n\nZelenskiy has spent the last week denying he caved in to Trump\u2019s request and working to claw back international legitimacy, while also trying to remain in the good graces of the United States.\n\nUkraine\u2019s chief prosecutor on Friday made what looked like a gesture to satisfy Trump by announcing a review of past cases involving the founder of a gas firm where Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, served on the board.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s careful explanation: He was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s decision and any future investigations will be \u201ctransparent.\u201d Analysts think the Ukrainian leader is trying to keep his options open.\n\nUkraine depends on international loans to stay solvent and Russian energy to keep warm as autumn winds blow through Kyiv. The country\u2019s weakness explains in part why Zelenskiy seemed eager to please Trump during the summer phone call\n\nZelenskiy has said he thought only part of their conversation would be made public. But the damage was done.\n\nAnd Thursday things took a new downward turn.\n\nText messages released by Congress showed Zelenskiy\u2019s diplomatic aide, Andriy Yermak, promising to announce Ukraine would open the investigations Trump wanted in exchange simply for an official White House meeting.\n\nNo wrongdoing by the Bidens has been found so far. Democrats in Congress have said they think Trump held up military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskiy into digging up dirt on a political rival, which Trump denied.\n\nZelenskiy had one bright spot this week: a visit from Tom Cruise, who\u2019s considering Kyiv as a film shoot location. The Ukrainian leader showered flattery on the Hollywood star, too.\n\nBut what looked like Zelenskiy\u2019s expressed willingness to do Trump\u2019s bidding has provoked criticism at home.\n\nSome Ukrainian politicians voiced concern the president would destroy the good will the country built with both Democrats and Republicans and still needs regardless of who wins the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s irresponsible, childish statements throw U.S. bipartisan support into doubt, including both economic and military assistance,\u201d said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, a former Ukrainian government minister who oversaw efforts to integrate with the West.\n\nZelenskiy remains popular in Ukraine, but some worry attention from the impeachment inquiry could put their head of state on the back foot with Russia, forcing him to cede too much in the upcoming eastern Ukraine peace talks.\n\nThe phone call also could come back to haunt Zelenskiy with the summit\u2019s mediators, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nHe suggested Merkel and Macron were softening on the sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and actions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy later tried to mend matters by saying he was grateful to Merkel and Macron for their help and the conversation with Trump took place during a \u201cdifficult period.\u201d\n\nOpposition lawmaker Klympush-Tsintsadze alleged that Russia was responsible for the embarrassment that was \u201ca sad result\u201d of the U.S.-Ukraine scandal.\n\n\u201cIt is in Russia\u2019s interests to turn Ukraine into \u2026 a country that does not deserve support, and this in turn creates favorable conditions for lifting sanctions,\u201d she said.\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin, who also will be at this month\u2019s peace summit, said this week the Kremlin has nothing to do with the call or anything after that led to the inquiry, saying Moscow is only an observer.\n\nAnother Ukrainian analyst, Mykhaylo Pashkov of the Razumkov Center public policy think tank, said either way, \u201cThere is only one beneficiary from this scandal \u2013 Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny crack in relations between Ukraine and the United States is both tactically and strategically extremely beneficial for the Kremlin, which is trying to cut Kyiv off of Washington,\u201d Pashkov said.", "description": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 First the obsequious phone call, now the embarrassing text messages.
