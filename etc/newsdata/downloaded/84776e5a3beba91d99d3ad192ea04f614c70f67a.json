Today, Manuel Orrego-Zavala was sentenced to 43-months in federal prison for illegal re-entry into the country. At the time of the crash, he fled the scene.\n\n\u201cMr. Orrego-Zavala re-entered the country illegally for the second time before he put the public safety of Indianapolis at risk and took the lives of two innocent men on Feb. 4, 2018,\u201d U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler released in a statement. \u201cThis prosecution represents our office\u2019s commitment to charging aliens that illegally re-enter the country, especially if they are a risk to public safety or there is a criminal history present.\u201d\n\nPrior to his first deportation in 2007, Orrego-Zavala committed two felonies in California. After re-entering the United States illegally a second time, he was deported again in 2009. He again re-entered illegally before killing Jackson and Monroe, who Orrego-Zavala hit with his car while they were pulled to the side of the road. In addition to the federal sentence of 42-months, Orrego-Zavala will serve 16 years in state prison for deaths of Jackson and Monroe while driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\u201cThis individual\u2019s criminal and immigration histories clearly demonstrate a total disregard for U.S. law,\u201d Special Agent in Charge James Gibbons said in a statement. \u201cLet this sentence serve as a reminder that Homeland Security Investigations prioritizes the prosecution of those who are intent on disrespecting our laws and putting the community at risk.\u201d\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts released the following statement at the time of Jackson's death:", "description": ".09/17/2019 19:24:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/35/73652ece-2da2-4d5d-b52d-fbb71f168fed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
