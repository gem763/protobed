For example, it can be exploited via the Joomla CMS' login form and can allow attackers to execute code on the site's underlying server.\n\nSimilar to an older 2015 Joomla zero-day\n\nGroppo said the vulnerability is similar to CVE-2015-8562, another PHP object injection that can lead to remote code execution, although they are not related.\n\nCVE-2015-8562 is a well-known Joomla exploit that's being abused even to this day. When it was discovered in December 2015, the vulnerability was a zero-day, and hackers were abusing it in the wild to take over sites.\n\nThe difference between Groppo's discovery and the 2015 vulnerability is that the newer one impacts a smaller number of Joomla sites, only Joomla 3.x versions, while CVE-2015-8562 impacted all Joomla versions available at the time -- 1.5.x, 2.x, and 3.x branches.\n\nHowever, despite affecting a smaller number of sites, Groppo's vulnerability has a wider impact, as it's \"completely independent from the [server] environment,\" compared to the older release, which only worked against servers running a PHP version before 5.4.45, 5.5.29 or 5.6.13.\n\nThe good news is that Joomla developers appear to have fixed the issue at the core of Groppo's zero-day a release after they fixed CVE-2015-8562.\n\nMany website owners run outdated CMS versions due to plugin and theme incompatibilities that can lead to site breakage; however, they don't need to update all the way to the latest release to be protected -- albeit that would be a much better solution.\n\nUpdating to any Joomla version of 3.4.7 or later will prevent attacks. The current Joomla version is 3.9.12.\n\nGroppo's zero-day doesn't yet have a CVE identifier. A demo showing the zero-day in action is embedded below. A technical explanation is available on Groppo's blog, while proof-of-concept code was uploaded on Exploit-DB last week.", "description": "Proof-of-concept code available online; trivial to exploit.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/517d8158-c50f-4642-88e0-e0ab9605b623/thumbnail/770x578/79fb4af486f13281a3c9fbbef2539613/joomla.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
