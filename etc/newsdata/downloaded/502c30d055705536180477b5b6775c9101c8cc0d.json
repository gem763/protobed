It declared independence after the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia but has not been recognized by the international community as a sovereign state, nor has it joined the UN.\n\nIt is therefore not bound by UN sanctions.\n\n\"Around 400 North Koreans... have been relocated to this subtropical strip of land,\" the daily said, They are \"sending home $500 million each year in remittance, according to U.S. estimates. But it is Moscow's way of keeping a lifeline open for Pyongyang.\"\n\n", "description": "N.Korean Slave Laborers Toil in Russian-Controlled Abkhazia", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
