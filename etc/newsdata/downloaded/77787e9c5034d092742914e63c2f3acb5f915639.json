Thursday is normal. It's okay,\" said French player Benjamin Hebert.\n\nDefending champion Alex Noren is the highest-ranked player in the field at 53rd and the only man who also featured in the Ryder Cup, so organisers will be relieved that the event will be returning to its regular slot next year, albeit reportedly in southern France rather than the Paris suburbs.\n\nThe 33-year-old Coetzee played the front nine in five-under, while a bogey on the penultimate green was his only blemish.\n\nCoetzee has managed only one top-five finish so far this season -- when he was tied-second behind compatriot Justin Harding at the Qatar Masters in March -- but thinks he is starting to find the form which helped him climb to a career-high 41st in the rankings in 2013.\n\nHe has since slipped to his current mark of 289.\n\n\"It's nice to be in the mix again. It's been kind of a hard, long year, but feels like the game is coming along nicely,\" the four-time European Tour winner said, after taking advantage of the early conditions, despite the morning gloom.\n\n\"It was weird. It was weird playing in the dark. I felt if I was a cricketer, they would have called it off.\n\n\"The course is in amazing nick. Dark and light doesn't really make a difference when the course is as good as it is.\"\n\nIt was a strong day for the home contingent as they look for a first French winner of the event since Thomas Levet in 2011.\n\nHebert carded a fine five-under 66, capped off with a birdie at the last, to sit tied-third alongside Scotland's Richie Ramsay and in-form American Kurt Kitayama, with French number one Victor Perez one stroke further back.\n\n\"I feel good support from the French public. We have only one tournament a year, so it's very important for us to represent (France) this week,\" said Hebert.\n\nRomain Langasque, who carried the scoreboard during one of Tiger Woods' matches at the Ryder Cup last year to get a taste of the action, signed for a 68.\n\nMeanwhile, Noren's title defence got off to a slow start with a one-over 72.\n\nLeading and selected first-round scores from the European Tour's French Open at Le Golf National on Thursday (par 71/GBR & IRL unless stated):\n\n65 - George Coetzee (RSA), Ryan Fox (NZL)\n\n66 - Richie Ramsay, Benjamin Hebert (FRA), Kurt Kitayama (USA)\n\n67 - Nicolas Colsearts (BEL), Darren Fichardt (RSA), Nicolai Hojgaard (DEN), Justin Walters (RSA), Victor Perez (FRA), Kalle Samooja (FIN), Jaco van Zyl (RSA)\n\n68 - Kristoffer Reitan (NOR), Deyen Lawson (AUS), Hugo Leon (CHI), Gavin Moynihan, Romain Langasque (FRA), Martin Kaymer (GER), Joachim B.
