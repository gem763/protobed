It is believed to have been located in a prominent spot on the night Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0 to secure their sixth European Cup, raising the question why it was not removed during the most high-profile game in the European calendar but was during a relatively low-key group game in midweek.\n\nThe banner was taken down just before the players came out to warm up at the Luminues Arena with Liverpool pledging soon after to act against whoever brought it into the away section. Uefa may also take action against the European champions and current Premier League leaders given the banner\u2019s obvious racial implications.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Origi banner amid other Liverpool ones during the Champions League final.

We will look to identify those responsible for bringing it into the stadium and act accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe Liverpool supporters\u2019 union, Spirit of Shankly, has also condemend the banner. A statement read: \u201cSpirit of Shankly oppose all forms of racism. The club took swift action in the removal of the offensive banner that perpetuates racial stereotyping.\n\n\u201cFootball isn\u2019t separate from society, it is part of it and we all have a responsibility in ensuring people understand there is no room for racism. Simply banning people is not the answer. Education and reaffirming there is no place for discrimination in society has to form part of the solution.\u201d", "description": "The \u2018highly offensive and inappropriate\u2019 banner of Divock Origi that was removed from the Liverpool section before the team\u2019s 4-1 victory in Genk on Wednesday was also displayed during June\u2019s Champions League final in Madrid", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce6032826e266a191acdfcedabb0834eb8810791/0_1968_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29d4148b079b7d2b636575ad02fa7f7d", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
