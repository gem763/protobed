I'm glad he's free and he doesn't have to look at those four walls anymore. He's innocent.'\n\nShipsey said the family opted not to have a funeral due to a high risk of 'outside interference'.\n\n'We're going to have him cremated so there's no outside interference, and take his ashes somewhere.'\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported detectives visited Milat on his deathbed and showed him images of victims and played recorded interviews with bereaved relatives in an attempt to swindle a confession.\n\nBut he maintained his innocence.\n\nMilat's nephew Alistair Shipsey (pictured) always maintained his uncle's innocence\n\nShipsey said Milat (pictured) was doped up on morphine in the hours before he died\n\nOfficers said Milat would only interact with female detectives and refused to speak with any males attempting to ask him questions.\n\n'He was cold hearted to the end. Even when the videos were shown there was no emotion, no empathy, just nothing,' one officer said.\n\nAnother senior police source added: 'Different approaches were made and different people used to try and get him to make admissions.\n\n'He talked about some things, but not any confessions.'\n\nThe revelation came as Milat's brother Bill complained family was notified of the death at 6.50am - after the media had been told - and Mr Shipsey continued to insist the killer was framed.\n\n'I'm glad that he is out of pain for something he didn't do, he'd been victimised with lies and with no proof,' Mr Shipsey said.\n\nPolice officers tried numerous times to elicit a confession from the suspected killer (pictured)\n\nJoanne Walters, 22, (right) was stabbed to death by Ivan Milat. Her friend Caroline Clarke, 21, (left) was shot 10 times as if she was target practice. The pair disappeared in April, 1992\n\nOnly one member of the Milat family, Ivan's brother Boris, has criticised the backpacker killer.\n\n'He was dead to me a long time ago,' Boris told Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.\n\n'This man is just an evil serial killer right to the last bone of him.'\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the Milat investigation in the mid-1990s, told The Project why he never believed the man would confess.\n\n'I never thought he would, from the moment he was arrested, confess to anything,' Mr Small said.\n\n'Milat's personality, on my assessment, was such that he thought he was the boss.\n\n'He was in charge of everything he wanted to do or wanted to be in charge of, and the way he kept that position was by keeping information to himself or keeping info he knew other people would be interested in.'\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the Milat investigation in the mid-1990s, explained why he never believed the man would confess (pictured: Milat smiling after attending court)\n\nMr Small went on to explain the nation's most notorious serial killer believed that as long as he was withholding information others wanted, despite receiving seven consecutive life sentences for murder in 1996, he was in control.\n\nMilat was hospitalised in May and again earlier this month for stomach and throat cancer before being returned to the hospital wing of the jail on Tuesday.\n\nHis death was slow and painful as the cancer spread to his liver, lungs, bones and lymph nodes and he developed fluid on his heart.\n\nMilat's body will be transferred to the New South Wales State Coroner who will decide, after consultation with his family, how it will be disposed.\n\nThere will be an inquest into his death, as is the case with all deaths in custody.\n\nMr Small also said there are at least three unsolved murders with good reasons to suspect Milat.\n\n'We looked at literally hundreds of other unsolved murders and disappearances ... There were three other murders that were unsolved where I think you could strongly point your finger at Ivan.\n\n'In one case I've got no doubt about it because the fire arm used in the killing of the backpackers was also used in this particular killing that was unsolved.'\n\nA detective revealed there are at least three unsolved murders with good reasons to suspect Milat (pictured)\n\nAnja Habschied (left), 20, was decapitated by Milat. Deborah Everist (left), 19, died after being stabbed multiple times\n\nMr Small said there was a male victim and two female victims with serious similarities.\n\n'That killing related to a male person - the other two killings related to females. The three of them actually had similarities to the backpackers even though the incidents occurred decades apart.'\n\nThe former road worker was sentenced in 1996 for murdering the seven young backpackers whose mutilated bodies were found in makeshift graves in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, between 1989 and 1992.\n\nCorrections Minister Anthony Roberts on Sunday said Milat 'was sentenced to die in jail and he was going to die in jail'.\n\n'Both the Commissioner and I were of the same opinion that he shouldn't be taking up a precious public hospital bed,' Mr Roberts said in a statement.\n\n'As soon as he could be removed from the public hospital and sent back to Long Bay Prison, he was.'\n\n'He can rot in hell. He showed no remorse.'\n\nMilat passed away at 4.07am on Sunday morning in the hospital section (pictured) of Sydney's Long Bay jail\n\nPictured is a room in the hospital section of Long Bay prison where Milat died on Sunday\n\nMilat was arrested in May 1994, following two months of surveillance.\n\nPolice were aided by an identification of Milat by British man Paul Onions, who had accepted a ride from him while hitchhiking out of Sydney in 1990 and managed to escape the car, running down the road while Milat shot at him.\n\nHis victims were English backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters 22; Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19; and German backpackers Simone Schmidl, 20, Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20.\n\nHe stabbed most, decapitated one whose head has never been found and shot another 10 times in the head as if using her for target practice.\n\nMany were knifed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.\n\nWhile cancer took the elderly prisoner's life, his victims were slaughtered in the prime of youth.", "description": "Milat never confessed to any crimes and died of throat cancer on Sunday in Sydney's Long Bay jail.
