Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles has received the request but has not yet responded.\n\nOur thought bubble, per Axios' Stef Kight: Trump's administration has made multiple attempts to penalize immigrants who use or are likely to use certain public benefit programs.

The Census count officially begins on the next day, April 1.\n\nGo deeper: Judge blocks Trump plan to penalize immigrants likely to use public benefits", "description": "Civil rights advocates fear the request will discourage immigration participation in the 2020 Census.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/QNErGXcnqFKdejzCqXr7gEBBRkk=/0x296:5085x3156/1920x1080/2019/10/14/1571064266211.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
