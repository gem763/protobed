This would be a move to show support for his EU withdrawal agreement before MPs have the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments that could be problematic for the government.\n\nHe is thought to be very close to securing a majority for approving his deal, having the support of around eight Labour MPs and a handful of independents, along with most former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip.\n\nBut Labour party sources said they expect the Speaker, John Bercow, to prevent Johnson holding another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the deal on Monday, because the prime minister tried and failed to do so on Saturday.\n\nJohnson was thwarted in his efforts to pass a meaningful vote on Saturday, because Oliver Letwin, the former Tory MP, managed to amend the motion so that parliament withholds support until MPs are able to pass the full Brexit legislation and properly scrutinise the deal. The amendment forced Johnson to send a letter to the EU requesting a three-month extension to article 50, which Brussels is now considering.\n\nMPs are now suspicious that Johnson is trying again to hold a meaningful vote so that he can withdraw the letter requesting an extension if it passes.\n\nOn Sunday, Starmer accused the prime minister of \u201cbeing childlike\u201d for sending his letter to the EU along with a further letter saying the government did not want an extension after all.\n\nStarmer said his party would work hard with other parties to make Johnson\u2019s deal better, telling the DUP: \u201cI say to any MP, but particularly the DUP, if you want to work with us to make this situation better, our door is open.\u201d The DUP rejected Johnson\u2019s deal because it entails a border in the Irish Sea, but a UK-wide customs union could solve that problem.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, dismissed the idea of supporting a second referendum, but hinted that it could be open to working with parliament to get changes to Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\n\u201cDUP MPs supported the Letwin amendment as the only avenue available to properly scrutinise the deal on offer and attempt to secure changes that could address some of the concerns we have. It was a situation that could have been easily avoided had the prime minister kept to words he penned to Jean-Claude Juncker just a matter of two weeks ago,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe DUP does not seek a second referendum; merely implementation of the first.\u201d\n\nAny attempt to get a customs union added to Johnson\u2019s deal would probably need to involve former Tory MPs as well as the DUP. A source close to the group of 21 former Tories suggested they might be more interested in the deal being amended to make sure the UK does not crash out on no-deal terms. Most in the group are also keen to make a deal work rather than opt for a second referendum.\n\nHowever, speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Starmer said he believes a second referendum was still possible. He also suggested Labour could vote for Johnson\u2019s deal if a second referendum was added to the withdrawal agreement bill, despite the party\u2019s fundamental objections to the terms of the UK\u2019s proposed departure from the EU.\n\nThis went much further than his party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has previously said that Labour could not vote for Johnson\u2019s deal even with a second referendum attached.\n\n\u201cWe will see what that looks like, but it makes sense to say that by whatever means we get that referendum. The spirit of this is clear. We offered this to Theresa May. We said, \u2018We don\u2019t think your deal is very good, but if it\u2019s up against the safeguard of being able to remain then we will allow it to proceed in that way.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe position we have adopted is whatever the outcome, whether it\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s bad deal or a better one which could be secured, it has got to go to a referendum up against remain.\u201d\n\nStarmer said Labour would have to look at the specific circumstances before deciding how to vote and the party would try to amend Johnson\u2019s deal to prevent a no-deal departure and allow the UK to have a closer relationship with the EU in future.\n\n\u201cWe will put down amendments to make sure the future destination is a close economic relationship with the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been arguing for a very long time for a customs union with the EU and single market alignment.\n\n\u201cThere are other amendments that are important because there is a trapdoor to no deal at the end of 2020 that we need to deal with and close and we can do that in the legislation. And of course we need an amendment saying whatever deal gets through should be subject to a referendum.\u201d\n\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was optimistic that Johnson had enough support to get his deal passed. \u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons. Why hasn\u2019t parliament pushed this through? That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do this week,\u201d he told the Marr show. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal. Why would we have a second referendum?\u201d\n\nMichael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, insisted that the UK would be leaving on 31 October that and an extension would not be necessary.", "description": "Labour approaches Tory rebels and DUP in bid to force through amendments to PM\u2019s deal", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63db87b3a7c3d5b0fc571411ca92e868eb1f2a47/0_210_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ccdf14335186433edcc0e618d82037fd", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
