In the 2019 edition of its annual Small Business Credit Survey, the Federal Reserve found that a lender\u2019s speed of decision-making and business owners\u2019 perception that their funding requests would be met were far-and-away the top reasons driving applications for financing to online lenders.\n\nFintech companies that cater to small businesses have taken note of these priorities. Just this week, small business lender Credibly announced a partnership with Wirecard (OTCMKTS: WCAGY), a leading issuer of payout cards, aimed at further improving the speed at which applicants can be approved for and receive financing.\n\nAccording to data from Credibly, average time to fulfillment through a bank wire service or automated clearing house (ACH) was already extremely quick, with funds arriving the next business morning after approval The newly announced partnership with a Wirecard promises to further decrease the time to funding for the 10,000 applications Credibly processes in an average month so those funds can be accessed almost instantaneously.\n\nIn a press release announcing the new relationship, Credibly founder and co-CEO Ryan Rosett said, \u201cWe are wholeheartedly focused on the customer experience. Providing customers with the option to obtain and utilize their funds almost instantly is a major benefit of partnering with Wirecard.\u201d\n\nCritical in this equation are the reasons underlying these applications, most of which are for amounts less than $100,000. In a survey conducted among the company\u2019s clients, 50 percent cited the need for working capital as the primary reason they sought funding.\n\nMaking this speed increase possible is Wirecard\u2019s digital payment platform, which has an extensive pedigree of global partnerships across the fintech landscape, working with the likes of Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) to add digital payments to the company\u2019s WeChat app and the UK-based peer-2-peer lending service Funding Circle.\n\nThe digitization of Credibly\u2019s financing products via Wirecard's digital platform now allows small business owners to manage their funds while also coordinating payments to suppliers, contractors or employees.\n\nThe option for receiving funds through payout cards also serves to benefit the technology underlying Credibly\u2019s underwriting processes. Jeffrey Bumbales, director of marketing & strategic partnerships at Credibly explained, \u201cThe enhanced data and reporting functionality will also bolster our models and risk analytics, in turn improving our ability to meet the financing needs of SMEs.\u201d\n\nCredibly is a content partner of Benzinga.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
