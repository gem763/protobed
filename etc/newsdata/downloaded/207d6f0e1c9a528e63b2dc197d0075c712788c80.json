Edward, an accomplished cook, rarely wrote down any instructions for, say, his oysters Rockefeller or chicken paillard. While the food we ate was certainly important, the book was not meant to be a cookbook, but instead a memoir about the nature of friendship.\n\nIn this pursuit, I was inspired by a rich literature of culinary writing in which food is a central motif, but is held together by the story of its preparation and the fellowship that comes from sharing a meal. So many writers \u2013 from MFK Fisher, who wrote lyrically about the pleasures of dining alone, to New York chef Gabrielle Hamilton, who documented her hardscrabble upbringing through family meals \u2013 use food as a catalyst for memories and loving nostalgia.\n\nWhile I\u2019m still a big fan of a good recipe book \u2013 anything by Jamie Oliver, Yotam Ottolenghi and Julia Child \u2013 it\u2019s the stories in beautifully rendered memoirs that stay with me longer than any recipe. It\u2019s Nigel Slater using burnt toast as a metaphor for his mother\u2019s love, and Anne Fadiman getting drunk as a teenager when she tries to please her vintage-wine-obsessed father. Below, are what I consider some of the best culinary memoirs.\n\n1. The Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter: A Memoir by Anne Fadiman\n\nFadiman\u2019s most recent book about her father, the American author and radio personality Clifton Fadiman, is a deftly written memoir \u2013 a coming-of-age story written around her father\u2019s oenophilia. He was \u201ca lousy driver and a two-finger typist\u201d, she writes, \u201cbut he could open a wine bottle as deftly as any swain ever undressed his lover\u201d.\n\n2. The Gastronomical Me by MFK Fisher\n\nMary Frances Kennedy Fisher was ahead of her time. After spending \u201ctwo shaking and making years in my life\u201d with her new husband in Dijon, she returned to California in the early 1940s where she became a serious food writer. The Gastronomical Me recounts some of her very poetic encounters with food. Here was a woman who loved nothing more than dining alone in a restaurant \u201cas if I were a guest of myself, to be treated with infinite courtesy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest MFK Fisher at home in 1971.

Blood, Bones and Butter: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef by Gabrielle Hamilton\n\nHamilton runs Prune, a jewel of a restaurant in New York\u2019s East Village. She is also a gifted writer who takes you on a journey from her difficult adolescence in rural Pennsylvania to New York\u2019s aptly named neighbourhood Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where she moves after high school before opening her restaurant.\n\n4. Home Cooking: A Writer in the Kitchen by Laurie Colwin\n\nThe New Yorker writer and Gourmet magazine columnist\u2019s memoir is about the joys of cooking at home. From her tiny Greenwich Village kitchen, she writes about meals shared with friends and family. \u201cI love to eat out, but even more, I love to eat in,\u201d she says. I fell for the ordinary extraordinariness of her stories, the reliance on available resources and implements to create something wonderful. This is what I tried so hard to capture in my own book.\n\n5. Consider the Oyster by MFK Fisher\n\nWH Auden called Fisher \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest writer\u201d, which is my excuse for choosing a second book by her. It\u2019s easy to see why the poet so admired her, in this slim 1941 volume \u2013 an ode to the gastronome\u2019s prize treat. \u201cAn oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life,\u201d she begins. Fisher tells you everything you ever wanted to know about this bivalve mollusc and writes brilliantly about such unfamiliar ingredients as Herbsaint.\n\n6. My Life in France by Julia Child, with Alex Prud\u2019homme\n\nA great account of the Childs\u2019 life in Paris after the second world war. Working with her grandnephew Alex Prud\u2019homme, the great chef reminisces about meeting her husband Paul in what was still Ceylon while both were working for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. When Paul took a job in Paris, Julia immersed herself in French cooking. Her description of eating sole meuni\u00e8re for the first time at a restaurant in Rouen is mouth-watering: \u201cIt arrived whole: a large, flat Dover sole that was perfectly browned in a sputtering butter sauce with a sprinkling of chopped parsley on top.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Julia Child in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Cooking for Mr Latte: A Food Lover\u2019s Courtship With Recipes by Amanda Hesser\n\nThe \u201cMr Latte\u201d of the title is the author\u2019s boyfriend, a writer for the highbrow New Yorker who has rather lowbrow tastes in food. Although affable and intelligent, he ends each exquisite meal they share with the fine-dining faux pas of a latte. First told in instalments for the New York Times where Hesser worked as a food writer, this is as much a love letter to New York and food as it is to the man Hesser ends up marrying.\n\n8. More Home Cooking: A Writer Returns to the Kitchen by Laurie Colwin\n\nSince the subject here concerns appetite, I\u2019m going to recommend a second helping of Colwin. I feel a real kinship to her because I share her obsession with what people eat at home. Written the year Colwin died aged just 50, this is a treatise on the importance of the family dinner \u2013 no matter who you consider to be family. \u201cWe know that without food we would die,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout fellowship life is not worth living.\u201d\n\n9. Talking With My Mouth Full: My Life as a Professional Eater by Gail Simmons\n\nSimmons is a presenter/judge on Bravo\u2019s Top Chef, but she\u2019s also a fellow Canadian who found herself struggling to make it in a tough industry in New York. In this memoir, she writes about growing up in Toronto with a mother who wrote food columns and conducted cooking classes in their suburban home. Simmons\u2019s trial-by-fire in some of the toughest high-end restaurant kitchens in New York City makes for a great read.\n\nTop 10 books about self-reinvention Read more\n\n10. Toast: The Story of a Boy\u2019s Hunger by Nigel Slater\n\nSlater tells the story of his childhood through a catalogue of British sweets \u2013 fairy drops and Bluebird milk chocolate toffees \u2013 and the culinary failures of his mother. Burnt toast was her specialty. \u201cMy mother burns the toast as surely as the sun rises each morning,\u201d writes Slater, who nevertheless longs for blackened bread after she dies and his father marries a woman who is the perfect housewife but very much the evil stepmother.\n\n\u2022 Dinner With Edward: A Story of an Unexpected Friendship by Isabel Vincent is published by Pushkin.
