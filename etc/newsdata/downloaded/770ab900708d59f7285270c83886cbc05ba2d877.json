She knew that by taking her power back and deciding to leave him that would cause him to retaliate in an aggressive and dangerous manner,' Ms Leed told the court.\n\nShe said Ms Fraser told her he threatened to kill her, their children and himself, the Herald Sun reported.\n\nThe court heard Ms Fraser feared her husband Adrian Basham - who has been charged with her murder - secretly set up surveillance cameras around her house\n\nAccording to Ms Leed, Ms Fraser told her: 'Adrian doesn't love us. He just thinks we are his possessions.'\n\nThe court heard Ms Fraser feared her husband had secretly set up surveillance cameras around her house and bugged her phone.\n\nIn 2017, she was given a police-issued phone and changed the locks to her house.\n\nMs Fraser's mother Janine told the court her daughter had to account for all her spending.\n\n'I would hear her say things like Adrian is going to be really mad at me for buying this,' she said.\n\nHer mother told the court the accused murderer tried to 'bully' Ms Fraser into getting one of their children tested for disabilities before they were born as he didn't want an 'abnormal' baby.\n\nThe court also heard that Ms Fraser would become panicked in the lead up to Mr Basham returning home to Phillip Island from his fly-in fly-out job in Western Australia.\n\nThe body of Samantha Frasier, a 38-year-old psychologist, was found in her home's garage on Phillip Island, south of Melbourne, on July 23 last year\n\nMs Leed said her friend would clean the house immaculately before he arrived home, and even made sure the jars in the kitchen cupboard were facing the right way so the labels could be seen.\n\n'If she had gone to the supermarket and bought the wrong groceries or wrong crackers or didn't get the cheese he liked then that wouldn't be okay,' Ms Leed said.\n\nMs Leed said Ms Fraser wrote down every appointment she went to and who she spoke to in a diary. She believed this was Mr Basham's idea more than Ms Fraser's.\n\nMs Fraser's brother in law, Luke Henderson, told the court she confided in him that Mr Basham backed her into a corner and intimidated her.\n\nMr Henderson said he noticed Ms Fraser had lost a dramatic amount of weight, and was becoming broken down mentally.\n\nHe called Mr Basham 'controlling and manipulative,' and said everything in his home needed to be a particular way.\n\nThe committal hearing continues.\n\nMs Leed said Ms Fraser (pictured) would clean the house immaculately before he arrived home, and even made sure the jars in the kitchen cupboard were facing the right way so the labels could be seen\n\n\n\n", "description": "Adrian Basham, 42, is charged with the murder of his 38-year-old wife, whose body was found in her home's garage on Phillip Island, south of Melbourne, on July 23 last year.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19985550-0-image-a-33_1571654534867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
