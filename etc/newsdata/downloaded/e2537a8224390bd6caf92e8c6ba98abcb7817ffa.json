I love Houston,\" Rendon said, according to The Associated Press. \"We were going to try to just steal one game and we just happened to steal two, and we've got to take care of business at home.\"\n\nThe Astros came back in the bottom of the first frame with two runs off of Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg on a home run by third baseman Alex Bregman after left fielder Michael Brantley had singled.\n\nBoth starters \u2014 Verlander and Strasburg \u2014 settled into a groove after the first inning, each allowing no runs for five innings.\n\nBut the wheels came off for the Astros in the top of the seventh inning starting with a solo homer by catcher Kurt Suzuki. They walked three batters, including the Astros' first deliberate walk of the season, of the young star Juan Soto, loading the bases with two outs.\n\nBut that was followed by three singles and defensive lapses by the Astros which produced six runs that stunned the Houston crowd. As the seventh inning ended, many in the crowd began heading for the exits.\n\nThe Nationals added two more runs in the top of the eighth inning on a homer by right fielder Adam Eaton and another run in the ninth on a solo shot by center fielder Michael Taylor.\n\nThe Astros scored one run in the bottom of the ninth on a solo homer by catcher Mart\u00edn Maldonado. But by then the game was all but over.\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch made no excuses.\n\n\"We have a really good team,\" Hinch said, according to the AP. \"Clearly, the Nats have outplayed us - bottom line. They came into our building and played two really good games. We're going to have to try to sleep off the latter third of this game.\"\n\nBy taking two games in Houston, the Nationals managed to do something few would have predicted: they beat the Astros' two aces \u2014 Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander \u2014 on consecutive nights.\n\nThe Nationals now lead the best-of-seven series 2-0 as the series heads for Washington, D.C. Friday night. Nationals Park will host the first World Series game to be played in the nation's capital since 1933.", "description": "The Washington Nationals, playing on the road, took two games from the heavily favored Astros by beating Houston's pitching aces Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander on consecutive nights.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales", "Mark Katkov"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/24/ap_19297153020198_wide-e0f94bf57649d1779ddc4fc1f471736ca3015c67.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
