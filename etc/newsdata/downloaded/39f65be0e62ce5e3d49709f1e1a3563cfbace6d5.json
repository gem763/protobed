She didn\u2019t know if that someone was another dog walker or someone following her.\n\n\u201cAs she walked on she heard the footsteps behind her more quickly as he was getting closer to her.\n\n\u201cShe turned around and asked the man: \u2018What do you want?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe replied: \u2018I want you\u2019\u201d.\n\nMs Lewis told Newport Crown Court that Carling punched the woman to the floor and dragged her into a field in Roath, Cardiff, to rape her over twenty to 25 25 minutes.\n\nShe handed in her clothes to police - but officers were unable to trace Carling until the case was reopened years later.\n\n(Image: South Wales police)\n\nThe court heard that in 2013 Carling provided a DNA swab over another matter and eventually officers were able to link him to a semen stain found on the woman\u2019s coat in 1991.\n\nIn a victim impact statement the woman said she has been \u201cfit and healthy\u201d before the attack and held down two jobs - but Carling\u2019s rape \u201cended\u201d her life.\n\nShe said: \"This horrendous offence destroyed my life. They say life begins at 40 but my life ended at that age.\u201d\n\nThe court heard she had to quit her office job and had seven back operations for injuries she believes she sustained during the attack.\n\n\u201cI am now always looking behind me,\u201d she said.\n\nCarling, of Barry, South Wales, initially denied the attack saying his DNA couldn\u2019t have been traced as he had undergone a vasectomy.\n\nHowever he later pleaded guilty to rape and attempted rape.\n\n(Image: South Wales police)\n\nThe court heard he had previously been jailed in 1989 for following a woman down a lane and indecently assaulting her.\n\nSue Ferrier, defending, said: \u201cHe has genuine remorse.\u201d\n\nJudge Daniel Williams said the rape happened within a year of Carling being released from prison for the earlier attack.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou were out looking for your next victim but determined this time to do even greater harm than before.\u201d\n\nJudge Williams said Carling was \u201cdefiant and arrogant\u201d and was only caught \u201cdue to an advance in DNA profiling technology\u201d.\n\n(Image: South Wales police)\n\n\"Your victim has described the ruinous effect that your crime has had upon her. Her work and her security ended as did her health physically and mentally.\"\n\nAfter his arrest, Detective Chief Inspector Mark O\u2019Shea, head of the South Wales Police Specialist Crime Review Unit, said: \"We remain committed to investigating undetected serious crimes and often re-look at cases as forensic science develops.\n\n\"Help and support is available for all victims of sexual violence and I would encourage any victims; no matter how long ago the offence was perpetrated, to come forward.\"", "description": "Anthony Carling, 64, was finally convicted after new technology allowed detectives to re-examine DNA evidence from the rape ordeal in 1991", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "South Wales Police"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725745.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RIP-The-brutal-rape-the-28-year-mystery-and-how-the-man-who-did-it-was-finally-caught.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
