It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.\n\nThis is good one to have in your back pocket when you\u2019re cooking burgers and dogs on the grill; it\u2019s a no-recipe version of a dish that I first learned of from the Brooklyn restaurateur Joe Carroll. Toss broccoli florets in equal parts soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, a generous dash of maple syrup and a splash of neutral oil, then grill (or broil) until they\u2019re soft and crunchy. Serve them under a scattering of red-pepper flakes and sesame seeds, or use furikake, a Japanese seasoning blend that contains, in addition to sesame, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt and, occasionally, monosodium glutamate. Never mind hot dogs or anything else, actually. I could go for that broccoli on white rice and call it dinner, full stop.\n\nSam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. Sign up to receive it.
