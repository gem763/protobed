When deputies entered Kolts\u2019 room, they found dozens of weapons including 24 pipe bombs, smokeless pistol powder, fuse materials, 23 knives, two hatches, two BB-type riffles, six BB-type handguns, nunchucks and \u201cdozens of books and DVDs about murder, mass killing, domestic terrorism and bomb-making,\u201d according to Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister.\n\n\u201cIf used, these bombs could have caused catastrophic damage to hundreds even thousands of people,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what she intended to do, Chronister said a press conference Friday.\n\nHillsborough County Sheriffs Office\n\nTo make matters worse, the sheriff said many of the bombs contained nails and metallic pellets or a combination of both. \u201cShe made the devices and she planned to use them to hurt people,\u201d he said.\n\nKolts was arrested Thursday night without incident at her job. Chronister said Kolts\u2019 parents are heroes for calling 911 to report their daughter. He said it's hard to know how many lives were saved had the parents not \"found the courage\" to call the sheriff's office and seek help.\n\nShe is being held in the Hillsborough County Jail on $180,000 bond. At this time, the sheriff's office said they do not know if she has retained any counsel. Kolts' first court appearance is on Saturday morning, the sheriff's office told ABC News.\n\nHillsborough County Sheriffs Office\n\nIn August 2018, Chronister said authorities were called to Kolts' home. An online printing company called authorities last year, saying it was suspicious that she ordered several manifestos, books about anarchists and books about bomb-making. They said she was consumed with Columbine and the Oklahoma City killings, but Kolts wasn't diagnosed with any type of mental health issue, and deputies believed her intentions were not to harm, Chronister said.\n\nHe said Kolts was on their radar, but until yesterday was never perceived as a real threat to the Tampa Bay community.\n\nHillsborough County Sheriffs Office\n\n\u201cIt's because of these parents that a catastrophic event didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Chronister said. \u201cI stand here proud that something tremendous was prevented.\u201d", "description": "Authorities said they found 24 pipe bombs and dozens of weapons inside Michelle Kolts' room.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/recovered-ht-ml-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
