I believe it to be one of the most beautiful regions in the world, and after travelling extensively, have made it my home,\u201d says Wiese. \u201cI am very proud to have been asked to be brand ambassador for the Grand Roche and Viande, and look forward to making people more aware of this \u2018jewel\u2019 in the Boland. The setting alone is breathtaking and worth a visit.\u201d\n\nGoffe-Wood says that both he and the owners of Grande Roche, Hansie and Theresa Britz, are thrilled to have Kobus on board as the hotel\u2019s brand ambassador. \u201cIt is hugely exciting for us to have such a recognisable South African in our corner. As an avid rugby fan, I have followed Kobus\u2019s career since he first started playing for South Africa in 1993, and I think many people will agree that when our rugby team brought home the World Cup, every player in that team was hailed as a National hero \u2013 so to collaborate with Kobus is a wonderful personal and professional highlight,\u201d says Hansie.\n\n\n\nViande is open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and makes for a grand yet easygoing rest stop and dining experience when exploring the Paarl wine region.
