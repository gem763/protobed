Wasp, an aircraft carrier holding 71 planes, 2,247 sailors and a journalist, sailed from San Diego to the western Pacific to join the battle against the Japanese. On board was a naval officer named Lt. Cmdr. John Joseph Shea. Two days before he left San Diego, Shea wrote his 5-year-old son a letter.\n\nDear Jackie,\n\nThis is the first letter I have ever written directly to my little son and I am thrilled to know that you can read it all by yourself. If you miss some of the words, I am sure it will be because I do not write very plainly. Mother will help you in that case I am sure.\n\nI was certainly glad to hear your voice over the long-distance telephone. It sounded as though I were right in the living room with you. You sounded as though you missed your daddy very much. I miss you too, more than anyone will ever know. It is too bad this war could not have been delayed a few more years so that I could grow up again with you and do with you all the things I planned to do when you were old enough to go to school.\n\nI thought how nice it would be for me to come home early in the afternoon and play ball with you, and go mountain-climbing and see the trees, and brooks, and learn all about woodcraft, hunting, fishing, swimming and things like that. I suppose we must be brave and put these things off for a little while.\n\nWhen you are a little bigger you will know why your daddy is not home so much any more. You know we have a big country and we have ideals as to how people should live and enjoy the riches of it and how each is born with equal rights to life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, there are some countries in the world where they don\u2019t have these ideals, where a boy cannot grow up to be what he wants to be with no limits on his opportunities to be a great man, such as a great priest, statesman, doctor, soldier, business man etc.\n\nBecause there are people and countries who want to change our nation, its ideals, forms of government and way of life, we must leave our homes and families to fight. Fighting for the defense of our country, ideals, homes and honor is an honor and a duty which your daddy has to do before he can come home to settle down with you and Mother. When it is done, he is coming home to be with you always and forever. So wait just a little while longer. I am afraid it will be more than the two weeks you told me on the phone.\n\nIn the meantime, take good care of Mother. Be a good boy and grow up to be a good young man. Study hard when you go to school. Be a leader in everything good in life. Be a good Catholic, and you can\u2019t help being a good American. Play fair always. Strive to win but if you must lose, lose like a gentleman and a good sportsman. Don\u2019t ever be a quitter either in sports or in your business or profession when you grow up. Get all the education you can. Stay close to Mother and follow her advice. Obey her in everything, no matter how you may at times disagree. She knows what is best and will never let you down or lead you away from the right and honorable things in life. If I don\u2019t get back, you will have to be Mother\u2019s protector because you will be the only one she has. You must grow up to take my place as well as your own in her life and heart. Don\u2019t let her brood over me nor waste herself on anyone not worthy of her or you.\n\nLove your grandmother and granddad as long as they live. They, too, will never let you down. Love your aunts and see them as often as you can. Last of all, don\u2019t ever forget your daddy. Pray for him to come back and if it is God\u2019s will that he does not, be the kind of a boy and man your daddy wants you to be.\n\nThanks for the nice sweater and handkerchiefs and particularly for the note and card. Write me very often and tell me everything.\n\nKiss Mother for me every night.\n\nGoodbye for now.\n\nWith all my love and devotion for Mother and you,\n\nYour daddy", "description": "In 1942, a volley of torpedoes sent the U.S.S. Wasp to the bottom of the Pacific. For decades, the families of the dead wondered where in the lightless depths of the ocean the ship could possibly be. Earlier this year, a team of wreck hunters set out to find it.", "authors": ["Ed Caesar"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/17/magazine/17mag-usswasp-slide-YPBU/17mag-usswasp-slide-YPBU-facebookJumbo-v2.png", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
