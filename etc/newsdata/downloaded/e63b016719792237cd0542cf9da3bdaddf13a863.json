USA TODAY\n\nOhio State remains No. 1 in the USA TODAY Sports NCAA Re-Rank 1-130 while two fellow Big Ten contenders, Wisconsin and Michigan, tumbled in the Top 25.\n\nThe Badgers are down eight spots to No. 14 after losing 24-23 at Illinois. Michigan is down six to No. 24 after a competitive loss on Saturday day to No. 6 Penn State, which moved up one spot in making a case to join the previously established top group of the Buckeyes, No. 2 Alabama, No. 3 Clemson, No. 4 LSU and No. 5 Oklahoma.\n\nLosses by Wisconsin and Michigan wouldn't have a profound impact on Ohio State's chase for the College Football Playoff, for example. The Buckeyes are in the national semifinals by running the table, an event that seems increasingly likely \u2014 though the Nittany Lions may have something to say about that.\n\nOhio State running back J.K.

With only one loss, to No. 8 Auburn, and a strong chance to cement its place as the top team in the Pac-12, Oregon will be in position to take advantage of a spot that may open should one of the perceived conference front-runners \u2014 Ohio State, Clemson in the ACC, Oklahoma in the Big 12 and Alabama or LSU in the SEC \u2014 stumble between now and the end of the regular season.\n\nNew to the Top 25: No. 22 Wake Forest, No. 25 Memphis\n\nOut of the Top 25: No. 26 Arizona State, No. 37 Missouri", "description": "There's another change at the top of  NCAA Re-rank with Ohio State - after beating Michigan State - moving past Alabama for the No. 1 spot.", "authors": ["Paul Myerberg", "Published A.M.
