Vehicle exports came to R12.1 billion, and vegetables to the value of R5.2 billion were exported.\n\nNo other industry had exported more than R2 billion of goods to the UK; the category of \"prepared foodstuffs\" came closest at R1.9 billion.\n\nThe losers: paper and machinery\n\nImports from the UK to South Africa are relatively small; while exports between January and August came to R42.7 billion, imports had reached only R26.7 billion.\n\nThe biggest import by a considerable margin so far this year has been in paper and wood pulp, which has been worth R8.1 billion. The next biggest import has been machinery worth R4.6 billion.\n\nAt number three on the list is vehicles and vessels \u2013 the same industry that ranks high on exports \u2013 thanks to car parts brought to South African factories for assembly.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Mines, carmakers, and vegetable farmers will see their exports increase in value right away, but paper and machinery is about to get more expensive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2567/a7918de22f244256a4228014da88d6dc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
