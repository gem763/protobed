Lawmakers there have yet to ratify it.\n\nImmigrant advocates denounced the deal.\n\n\"If this agreement goes into effect, the U.S. will be forcing the most vulnerable communities to seek safety in a country that is not equipped to protect its own citizens or provide economic opportunity,\" said Oscar Chacon, executive director of Alianza Americas, a network of immigrant-led organizations.\n\nA 2018 State Department report on human rights in El Salvador cites allegations of unlawful killings and torture by security forces, as well as forced disappearances by military personnel. The report describes a \"lack of government respect for judicial independence\" and \"widespread government corruption.\"\n\n\"Impunity persisted despite government steps to dismiss and prosecute some in the security forces, executive branch, and justice system who committed abuses,\" the report added.\n\nIt is not clear whether El Salvador's cooperation on asylum is tied to other bi-lateral issues, most prominently, the status of some 200,000 Salvadorans living in the Unites States under temporary protected status. The administration sought to end that program for Salvadorans and citizens of three other countries, but a federal judge has intervened. The temporary protections are due to end in January 2020.", "description": "The agreement furthers the administration's goal of requiring migrants to seek asylum in so-called \"third countries\" through which they traveled en route to the U.S.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/20/ap_19263740550433_wide-ec4efc8af0cd7bd829c60571a2108a2f70cdaedc.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
