The lead attorney for the Ukraine whistleblower is a supporter of Joe Biden. Joe Schoffstall of the Washington Free Beacon found this gem. It all connects to this nonsensical impeachment push House Democrats have decided to embark on in the last 24 hours. You see, President Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and supposedly shook him down to investigate the son of the former vice president, Hunter. Quid pro quo and ties to foreign aid were also allegations that were lobbed by Democrats regarding this conversation. Trump was said to have withheld aid regarding this investigation, but the transcript was released this morning. And it was another underwhelming development in this ongoing war the media has waged against the Trump White House. No one read the transcript and the House Democrats were off to the races for impeachment. Trump was asking the Ukrainians for help in the Department of Justice\u2019s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation, it was the Ukrainians that brought up Biden first, and there was no quid pro quo, no aid ties either. So, this was straight trash\u2026again.\n\nThis all stems from a whistleblower complaint where the person, who didn\u2019t listen in on the call, alleged all of this stuff. It was a second-hand account. And now the lead counsel for this person is a Biden donor? In fact, this so-called whistleblower\u2019s legal allies are all left-wing operatives (via Free Beacon):\n\nWho here would be Shocked to find out that the attorney for the \"whistleblower\" was\n\n\n\nA) A Joe Biden Donor!\n\nB) Worked for Crooked H & Cryin Chuck\n\nC) Works in a firm run by a Top Clinton donor!\n\n\n\nOdd that all the coverage of this totally apolitical investigation leaves that out. \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 25, 2019\n\nThe lead counsel representing the Ukraine whistleblower donated to Joe Biden's presidential campaign earlier this year, records show. Andrew Bakaj, founder and managing partner of D.C.-based law firm Compass Rose Legal Group, is the lead counsel working on behalf of the Ukraine whistleblower. Bakaj earmarked a $100 donation on April 26 through ActBlue, a fundraising nonprofit that helps facilitate contributions for Democrats, to Biden's presidential campaign, the Federal Election Commission's website shows. Biden appears to be the only recipient of campaign cash from Bakaj this year. The whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown, approached the intelligence community's inspector general about President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. The IG in turn approached House Democrats, who announced an impeachment inquiry. Trump acknowledged discussing Biden's potential links to corruption in Ukraine during the conversation, but denied pressuring Zelensky. Attorney Mark Zaid is acting as co-counsel for the whistleblower. Zaid and Bakaj are both involved with Whistleblower Aid, a nonpartisan legal nonprofit launched in 2017 to help federal employees coming forward with information about wrongdoing navigate legal avenues. John Tye, a former government whistleblower at the U.S. Department of State, cofounded Whistleblower Aid and is listed as its governor in D.C. incorporation papers. Tye previously worked at the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center, known for its \"hate group\" designations, and Avaaz, a liberal organization that pushes global activism on climate change.\n\nWow! \u201cUkraine Whistleblower\u2019s lead attorney donated to Biden.\u201d @FreeBeacon \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nAnd this point wasn\u2019t lost with President Trump either. These guys want to kick Trump out and are going to extraordinary lengths to do it, even going as far as chipping away at the integrity of our institutions. Oh, and about this clown who created this impeachment storm. Well, shocker, he\u2019s a political partisan that was against the president (via Fox News):\n\nA senior Trump administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower who leveled an explosive accusation against President Trump concerning his talks with Ukraine had \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of \u201ca rival candidate\u201d of the president. The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate. Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible. The news came just hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry by alleging that the administration was hiding the complaint. Other top Democrats had previously said such an inquiry was already underway. The senior administration official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, and that the White House's general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general.\n\nThis is the Democrat-media complex at work, folks. Trying to undo the results of the 2016 election. Nothing more.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:24:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/24a026cb-4146-43a0-9d68-155428ebe069.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
