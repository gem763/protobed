It did not identify these competitors and noted that these talks did not necessarily mean a full-blown investigation was underway.\n\nRead more: Big tech warned by top regulator: We will break you up if we have to\n\nExperts told Bloomberg, however, that its findings suggested the FTC could indeed be in the early stages of an official investigation, given the duration of the interviews and the resources devoted to the operation.\n\n\"Early in an investigation, that's a sign of staff doing a serious job,\" a former FTC official named Michael Kades said. \"They're spending lots of time with witnesses and trying to really understand what they're saying.\" The Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie said the questioning had the hallmarks of the \"background phase\" of an investigation.\n\nBoth Amazon and the FTC declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg, and neither were immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nAmazon is far from the only tech company to be put under an antitrust microscope.\n\nThe FTC opened an investigation into Facebook in June, and earlier this week 50 state attorneys general announced an investigation into Google. Amazon is also already the subject of an antitrust investigation by the European Union, officially announced in July.", "description": "Government officials have been asking small businesses how much of their revenue Amazon sales make up, three merchants told Bloomberg.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d35bfbe454a3947d07d4166-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
