His autobiography, Apologia Pro Vita Sua, written in 1864 to explain the evolution of his religious thinking, is still in print and widely read today.\n\nBoth conservatives and progressives in the Catholic Church today have enlisted Newman's writings to back their positions. The conservatives say his giving precedence to conscience over obedience shows it is proper to criticise the current pope, Francis.\n\nThe progressives say loyalty to Rome was central to his faith and that was a key reason he left the Church of England.\n\nThe pope also canonised three nuns: Giuseppina Vannini (1859-1911), an Italian who founded a religious order; Mariam Thresia Chiramel Mankidiyn (1876-1926), an Indian who helped the poor; and Dulce Lopes Pontes 1914-1992), a Brazilian who dedicated much of her life to educating workers.\n\nHe also canonised Marguerite Bays (1815-1879) a Swiss lay woman who was said to have the stigmata, the five wounds of the crucified Jesus.\n\nAll five of the new saints were attributed with interceding with God to perform miracles.\n\nThe Church teaches that only God performs miracles but that saints who are believed to be with God in heaven intercede on behalf of people who pray to them. A miracle is usually the medically inexplicable healing of a person.", "description": "Pope canonises British Catholic luminary John Henry Newman, four others", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0A8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
