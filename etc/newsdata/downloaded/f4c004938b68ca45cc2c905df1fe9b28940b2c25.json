We need to take their opinions seriously, and I share them,\u201d Koike said. Temperatures in Tokyo during July and August, when the city hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games, commonly exceed 30 degrees Celsius, with high humidity adding to the discomfort. The IOC said temperatures in Sapporo, which will also host some soccer games, are as much as five to six degrees centigrade cooler during the day.\n\nThe IOC Coordination Commission is holding a regular meeting in Tokyo next week and the city\u2019s representatives have repeatedly said they hoped to discuss the marathon decision then.\n\nWhen Tokyo hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964, they were held in October \u2013 an option no longer possible due to international sports schedules.
