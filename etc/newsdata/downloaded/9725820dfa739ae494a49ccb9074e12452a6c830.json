This bijou island of fewer than 5,000 inhabitants is much more low-key than the larger and more populated Caribbean islands, suiting cruise ship passengers seeking a more laidback experience.\n\nCruise port location\n\nThe US$50 million Grand Turk Cruise Center, the only cruise port in the Turks and Caicos, is a purpose-built wonder, stretching across 18 acres on the island\u2019s southern end. It boasts not only shops and restaurants, but also a white-sand beach and swimming pool. This is the departure point for excursions too.\n\nCan I walk to any places of interest?\n\nAs both the island airport and a military facility interrupt the three-mile walk north to the island capital of Cockburn Town, walking there is not recommended. The excellent Grand Turk Cruise Center lies right down the gangplank. There is a beach there, but a better and less crowded stretch of sand lies to the north within walking distance, or a short taxi ride away, at Governor\u2019s Beach.\n\nGetting around\n\nGrand Turk is a tiny island, seven miles long by just over a mile wide, so walking around works. Taxis also await at the Grand Turk Cruise Center, with car hire available here too. Booking a car in advance is recommended as they can be in short supply.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\n\"Lotus eating\" or taking it easy is the main pastime and some passengers never make it beyond the Grand Turk Cruise Center. Push further and good beaches await, as well as the old world historic charms of the laidback island capital of Cockburn Town. A fun way of exploring is to engage a local taxi driver for a highly personal and colourful tour.\n\nWhat can I do in four hours or less?\n\nGiven the island\u2019s bijou size you really don\u2019t need an excursion on a short visit. The Grand Turk Cruise Center easily swallows up a half day with its myriad facilities. You can swim, sunbathe, hire a cabana, dine, shop in a 45,000 sq ft shopping centre, sip cocktails and even surf in the state-of-the-art FlowRider pool.\n\nIf you are seeking more peace and quiet break off to Governor\u2019s Beach to the north or Boaby Rock Point Beach to the south, which offers excellent shore-based snorkelling. On a self-guided tour of Cockburn Town savour the old Bermudan architecture \u2013 Bermudans first settled Grand Turk \u2013 on the bougainvillea-kissed Duke Street and Front Street.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos National Museum is the place to learn about how the isles came to be inhabited by Bermudans and the relationships with the European colonial powers and the USA. As by far the most regular visitor to Grand Turk, Carnival offers myriad excursions, from island tours through to adrenaline-pumping ATV trips. A two-hour Coast to Coast Grand Turk Safari covers the island\u2019s highlights on an off-road adventure in an open-top truck. Cockburn Town is covered, as is Salinas with its salt industry history. There is time for a relaxed stroll through the mangroves before culminating with the Friendship Capsule, a replica of the capsule that in 1962 splashed down off Grand Turk with famous astronaut John Glenn aboard.\n\nThe wreck of Mega One Triton on Governor's Beach, washed ashore during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 Credit: ISTOCK More\n\nWhat can I do in eight hours or less?\n\nStory continues", "description": "The local tourist office gushes about the \u2018Paradise Effect\u2019 and Grand Turk certainly boasts paradisiacal qualities with its epic sunsets, sandy beaches and turquoise waters.
