The complaint prompted NBC News to fire Lauer on November 29th, 2017. In a letter obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Lauer admits to an extramarital affair with Nevils but claims their relationship was consensual.\n\n\u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations,\u201d Lauer writes. \u201cThe story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual,\u201d he continued. The account differs drastically from Nevils\u2019 version, where she only says Lauer forcibly kissed her, pushed her onto a bed, flipped her over, and anally penetrated her, though she said \u201cno\u201d multiple times.\n\nLauer makes several statements of fact that could be denied or corroborated by his NBC colleagues:\n\nBrooke now says that she was terrified about the control I had over her career and felt pressure to agree to our encounters after Sochi. But at no time during our relationship did Brooke work for me, the Today Show, or NBC News. She worked for Meredith Vieira (who had not worked for the Today Show in several years) in a completely different part of the network, and I had no role in reviewing Brooke\u2019s work. \u2026 She admitted to NBC at the time she filed her complaint that she called me late at night while I was home with my family in an effort to rekindle the affair. \u2026 It was not until I was called in to speak to an NBC attorney on November 28, 2017 that I first learned Brooke had any complaint. I answered all questions openly and honestly for more than an hour. At that meeting I was never told that Brooke claimed our encounter in Sochi was non-consensual. Had I been, I would have defended myself immediately.\n\nHe then goes on to deny \u201cerroneous reports\u201d that he had button installed in his NBC office desk to remotely lock his door, stating: \u201c[T]here was not a button in my office that could lock the door from the inside. There was no such locking mechanism. It didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nNevils\u2019 attorney have yet to comment on Lauer\u2019s denial.\n\nNBC News issued a statement regarding Variety\u2019s report, calling Lauer\u2019s conduct \u201cappalling, horrific and reprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d said the network.", "description": "Matt Lauer responded to explosive allegations in reporter Ronan Farrow's 'Catch and Kill' book, denying a claim of violent rape.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-467241645-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
