However, with bonuses, his total pay is just over $720,000. (Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe head of the agency that manages Dulles International and Reagan National and oversees the multibillion-dollar Silver Line rail project, received more than $246,500 in salary increases and bonuses last year, further solidifying his ranking as one of the highest-paid airport executives in the country.\n\nJohn E. \u201cJack\u201d Potter, a former postmaster general who took the job as head of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority in 2011, has a base salary of $488,595. However, with bonuses, his total pay is just over $720,000.\n\nIn November, the MWAA board voted to give Potter a 3 percent raise and a 30 percent bonus \u2014 more than $142,300 \u2014 for his work in 2018. Under the terms of his contract, he also received a $90,000 retention bonus, which he remains eligible for as long as he remains in the job.\n\n[Head of National and Dulles makes more than leaders of all but one of nation\u2019s 10 busiest airports]\n\nIn comparison, the Washington region\u2019s other top transportation official, Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld, makes $456,000 a year.\n\nThe terms of Potter\u2019s 2018 pay package were outlined in a document posted on the board of director\u2019s section of the MWAA website under \u201cReference Materials.\u201d\n\n\n\nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority board chairman Warner Session as said that Potter\u2019s salary is justified because his job is far more complex than that of most airport CEOs. (Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nMWAA officials had previously declined to release information beyond Potter\u2019s base salary to The Washington Post, citing privacy concerns. However, after a story about the authority\u2019s refusal appeared in the newspaper last year, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) demanded that the MWAA make the information public.\n\n\u201cThere is no case to be made for withholding from the American public basic information on how MWAA compensated its executives,\u201d Norton wrote in a letter to the authority last June.\n\n[Metro\u2019s IG finds new problems with Silver Line construction]\n\nAs head of MWAA, Potter oversees a workforce of about 1,700 employees and a budget of nearly $2 billion.\n\nPotter\u2019s salary is not paid for by taxpayers. Dulles and National, like most U.S. airports, are self-supporting \u2014 funded through landing fees, rent and concessions, including parking and food and beverage sales.\n\nHowever, the airports authority does receive federal funding as part of its management of construction of the $5.8 billion Silver Line rail extension. The project received a $900 million federal grant to fund its first phase and nearly $2 billion in federal loans to pay for the second, which is scheduled to open for passenger service next year.\n\nThe project has been plagued with construction problems and on Friday, Metro Inspector General Geoffrey A. Cherrington issued management alerts detailing more issues. He said the problems could create significant cost and operational issues and is urging Metro not to accept control of the line until the issues are resolved.\n\nThe project, one of the largest rail lines under construction in the United States, is more than a year behind schedule.\n\nWhy the second phase of the Silver Line is so troubled\n\nWhile the MWAA is managing construction of the rail line, Metro will manage and operate it once that is completed.\n\nThe airports authority also has received support from Virginia. In 2015, then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) announced a plan to give the authority $50 million \u2014 payable in two installments \u2014 to help make Dulles Airport more competitive.\n\nDulles and National rank 25th and 26th, respectively, among the nation\u2019s airports in terms of passenger traffic. But an analysis by The Washington Post found that pay for airport executives varies across the country and doesn\u2019t necessarily track with the size or number of operations of an airport.\n\n[After a years-long slump, Dulles International Airport bounces back]\n\nFor example, Sean Donohue, chief executive of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the fourth-busiest in the United States, receives a base salary of $512,000 and is eligible for a 40 percent performance bonus as part of a five-year contract approved this year, making him the highest paid. Joe Lopano, who runs Tampa International Airport, the 28th busiest in the country, makes $508,830 a year.\n\nJohn Selden, head of the world\u2019s busiest airport, Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International, earns $280,000 a year. And Ricky Smith, head of the Washington region\u2019s busiest airport, Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport, makes $310,743 a year. BWI ranks 22nd in terms of passenger traffic among U.S. airports.\n\n[Airports authority releases details of CEO Jack Potter\u2019s contract]\n\nThe MWAA board\u2019s chairman, Warner Session, did not return requests for comment on Potter\u2019s pay package. Potter did not return requests for comment either.\n\nHowever, board documents included a letter Session sent to the MWAA\u2019s vice president for human resources, Anthony Vegliante, that outlined the panel\u2019s decision to give Potter a raise and a bonus.\n\nAccording to the document, a compensation consultant told members of the board\u2019s executive and governance committee that even at his current level of pay, Potter\u2019s total compensation still lags behind that of other CEOs in a selection of key industries. The document did not identify the CEOs with whom Potter was compared.\n\nIn the past, Session has said that Potter\u2019s salary is justified because his job is far more complex than that of most airport CEOs and includes not just oversight of two airports but of the Silver Line project. The first phase of the rail project opened in July 2014.\n\nPotter took over as head of the MWAA in 2011 as the agency was grappling with myriad scandals and pledged that the authority would be transparent in its dealings. That\u2019s part of the reason some lawmakers and open-government advocates were leery of its initial refusal to release details of Potter\u2019s contract.\n\nPotter\u2019s deal also includes a provision for a $5,000 executive physical, a company car and cellphone. The authority also agreed to pay any tax liability connected with the car, a Chevy Impala. As part of his 2011 contract, Potter also received a $25,000 signing bonus.\n\nRead more:\n\nDulles Airport struggles to find its footing\n\nAirports authority expected to pick former postmaster general as new CEO", "description": "Jack Potter, who makes more than $730,000 a year, received a 30 percent performance bonus in 2018.", "authors": ["Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r-lQFL5BltQ5HsNOn-QKqWHXx_Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G7KD3MDP6II6RP4GUI2RWXWOTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
