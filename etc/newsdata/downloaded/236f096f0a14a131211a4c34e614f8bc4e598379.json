She came home raving about the experience, so, in 2008, Farber \u2014 who at the time was living in Evanston, Ill., just outside Chicago, and selling cars \u2014 took his first trip there.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise to me \u2014 bumpy roads, dogs barking in the streets,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t enamored at first.\u201d\n\nBut as his daughter began traveling there more and eventually moved there for a year, he took additional trips to Costa Rica. It quickly grew on him \u2014 in particular, the people. \u201cThe Costa Rican people are warm, open and friendly. I felt less invisible in a strange country in a strange town where I didn\u2019t speak the language than I did in Evanston.\u201d\n\nAnd the more time he spent there, the more it impacted him: \u201cOn one of my trips there, I thought: My daughter\u2019s life makes more sense than mine,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with my life, but I felt that my life was out of context with who I\u2019d become. \u2026 I would have bills and make money to pay them, but that had ceased to be satisfying,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI knew I needed to change my life \u2014 there was no more joy in what I was doing.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, when he\u2019d return from his Costa Rica trips, people noticed. \u201cI would come back, and my friends and therapist would say: You seem better after you go,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nMartin Farber A view from the hot springs near Martin Farber\u2019s home in Costa Rica.\n\nSo in 2014, he packed up and moved to Orosi \u2014 a picturesque, lush small town with waterfalls and hot springs a little over an hour\u2019s drive from San Jose \u2014 promising himself he\u2019d stay for two years. It\u2019s been five, and he now plans to stay in Costa Rica indefinitely. (Though Farber notes that, to him, \u201cit\u2019s not a retirement; it\u2019s a chance to lead a new and different life.\u201d)\n\nHere\u2019s what his life is like, from costs to health care to residency to everyday life:\n\nThe cost: While many expats spend way more living in Costa Rica, Farber says: \u201cI could live on my Social Security and still save money.\u201d He says \u201ca person can live on $1,200 per month, two people on $2,000.\u201d The key, he says, is to live more like he does and as the Costa Ricans do \u2014 in a modest home, eating local food and purchasing local goods.\n\nIndeed, Farber himself spends just $300 a month for rent (he rents a home from a friend who moved recently and gave him a good deal), roughly $225 a month on groceries and just $50 a month total on water and electricity (the temperate climate in Orosi means you rarely need heat or air conditioning). The veteran Volkswagen VOW, -0.90% VLKAF, -2.85% salesman saves money by not owning a car (those over 65 ride municipal buses for free), which can be a significant expense in Costa Rica; for his cellphone, \u201cI pay as I go \u2026 roughly $10 may last me a couple weeks or more,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cmany people handle there their cellphones this way. You can get them recharged anywhere.\u201d\n\nHis major expense is travel: He goes back to the U.S. to visit his mother in Florida several times a year and lately has spent part of the summer in Chicago helping out a friend with a dealership there. He also spends a good amount of money on health care. He says that while flights can be had for as little as $350 roundtrip during offseasons, the cost can be much higher the rest of the year.\n\nMartin Farber In the saddle.\n\nHealth care: Farber, who has permanent resident status in Costa Rica, says he pays about $90 per month to participate in the country\u2019s health-care system \u2014 adding that the health care he\u2019s received has been very good. (A 2018 study of health-care quality and access in more than 190 nations ranked Costa Rica No. 62.)\n\nWhen he developed a detached retina, though, he paid for the procedure out of pocket so that he didn\u2019t have to wait for the required surgery, he says \u2014 adding that the entire procedure cost him about $5,000. \u201cI would have had to have waited four days,\u201d he says, if he had not paid to expedite matters. \u201cThat might have been fine, but it might not.\u201d And he adds that the quality of care depends on where you get it in the country.\n\nLifestyle: Though Farber says that he \u201cmoved here with no goals and no agenda,\u201d he\u2019s found plenty to do. \u201cI take Spanish lessons two days a week for two hours a day. It\u2019s been great. I never thought I would acquire a usable language in my 60s,\u201d he says. He also rides his bike all around the area, does some writing and belongs to a community group that undertakes projects to improve the area.\n\nAnd he often simply takes in nature, which he says has been an essential part of why he feels calmer and more relaxed in Costa Rica than in the U.S. \u201cI live at 3,000 feet but in a valley surrounded by coffee fields and lime trees and water. At night, if I open the windows, I can hear the river rushing by,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is very calming \u2026 hundreds of trees everywhere \u2026 you know the Earth is alive.\u201d\n\niStock The historic Iglesia de San Jos\u00e9 de Orosi.\n\nCons: \u201cI don\u2019t want to overglorify. It\u2019s not without its problems,\u201d Farber says of Costa Rica. \u201cThere are social problems and downsides.\u201d He notes that crime and petty theft can be a problem (\u201cI am cautious,\u201d he says of his approach) and seem to have increased since he moved there, and adds that he misses out on some cultural things because of where he lives. And, he says with a laugh, \u201cI can\u2019t order Thai food at 9 at night.\u201d But, he adds: \u201cThese are trade-offs \u2014 in the afternoon, I get to walk in the coffee fields and see flocks of parrots.\u201d\n\nResidency: To qualify for Costa Rica\u2019s pensionado visa, expats must prove that they have a pension of at least $1,000 coming in each month. (Here are the details of that program.) Once you have lived in Costa Rica for three years, you can apply for permanent residency. Farber used a lawyer to help him figure out the ins and outs of residency options; his entire path to permanent residency took about a year, he says.\n\nThe bottom line: \u201cAfter five years I am still amazed and surprised that I made the decision to lead a life I never thought I would,\u201d he says. And while he may not stay in Orosi forever \u2014 \u201cthe town doesn\u2019t have an ambulance, [and] I don\u2019t know what it will be like to be 80 there,\u201d he says \u2014 he does plan to stay in Costa Rica in no small part because of the people and sense of community. \u201cI have the feeling that life is good here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes, but we are all in it together.\u201d", "description": "But he says it\u2019s important not to \u2018over-glorify\u2019 Costa Rica, as it is \u2018not without its problems.\u2019", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR556_martin_ZG_20190918141938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
