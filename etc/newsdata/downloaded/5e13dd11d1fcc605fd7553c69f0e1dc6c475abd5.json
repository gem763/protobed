He did take issue with fellow candidate Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s crowd-pleasing vow at an LGBTQ Democratic town hall to strip churches of their tax exemptions if they refuse to marry same-sex couples.\n\nMr. Buttigieg gently informed Mr. O\u2019Rourke that his plan to bring in the Brute Squads to terrify worshipers might mean \u201cgoing to war not only with churches, but I would think with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles that I do, but also because of the separation of church and state are acknowledged as nonprofits.\u201d\n\nWell, we don\u2019t want to go to war with mosques, so perhaps the churches will be safe from Beto, who also wants Brute Squads to seize guns that he doesn\u2019t like. But let\u2019s not get complacent.\n\nThis is only for now. Progressivism\u2019s driving philosophy, grounded in Darwinian atheism, is that we\u2019re relentlessly evolving toward a more \u201cequal\u201d society where differences will disappear and we\u2019ll all be singing Kumbaya around a fake campfire (avoiding carbon emissions).\n\nMr. Buttigieg talks a good game, but still offers clues to his real feelings. He began his rebuke of Beto by saying, \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven\u2019t found their way toward blessing same-sex marriage \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he understood the implications\u2026\u201d\n\nThe key phrase here is \u201chaven\u2019t found their way toward blessing same-sex marriage.\u201d The unsaid word is yet. He means it\u2019s only a matter of time before all churches abandon biblical morality and embrace sexual anarchy, with or without coercion. Why threaten them openly? It might wake up clueless Christians who still vote for Democrats, thinking that this abortion-loving, open borders, Bible-hating, confiscatory cabal is the party of JFK and Hubert Humphrey.\n\nOr even of Bill Clinton. The entire current Democratic leadership is radically socialist, from the presidential candidates on down to the freshmen Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY), Rashida Tlaib (MI), Ilhan Omar (MN) and Ayanna Pressley (MA).\n\nThey all support Marxist policies, such as Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All, a government takeover of health care. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar have endorsed Bernie for president, and Tlaib may soon join them.\n\nStruggling to carve out a \u201cmoderate\u201d middle lane, Mr. Buttigieg and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota question how the government will pay for socialist medicine. But they love the idea in principle.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who seems to be overtaking Joe (\u201cUkraine, I Kraine, We all Kraine\u201d) Biden as the frontrunner, continues to move further left in every way. Asked how she would pay for her version of a government healthcare takeover, ending private insurance for 140 million Americans and costing $32 trillion over 10 years, she answered \u201cthe wealthy\u201d and \u201cbig corporations.\u201d\n\nAh, the hated 1 percent, the club in which she and carbon-spewing jetsetter Al Gore are members. Meanwhile, she repeatedly insists that, \u201ccosts will go down for hard-working, middle class families.\u201d If you believe that, I have a Great Society to sell you that will cost a pittance.\n\nEven Bernie Sanders, the most candid communist among the many roaming Capitol Hill, admits taxes will have to be raised on the middle class. That\u2019s where the money is.\n\nEconomics aside, the most frightening aspect of the progressive takeover of the Democratic Party is its open hostility to actual Judeo-Christian beliefs and those who espouse them.\n\nThis past week, Attorney General William Barr belled the cat in a speech at Notre Dame, saying, \u201cthe problem is not that religion is being forced on others, the problem is that irreligion is being forced\u2014secular values are being forced on people of faith.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is not decay. This is organized destruction. Secular forces and their allies have marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia, in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\u201d\n\nThe only thing worse than its direct attack is the Left\u2019s subversion of churches to bend to its worldview. It\u2019s part of an overall campaign to \u201ccapture the culture,\u201d as Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci famously put it. It\u2019s why so many churches are silent or complicit.\n\nBy the way, Mayor Pete\u2019s father, Joseph A. Buttigieg, a Notre Dame professor who died in January, was president and a founding member of the International Gramsci Society.\n\nGramsci\u2019s dream was to turn the West communist by taking over its value-transmitting institutions.\n\nWe\u2019re in the end game now, unless liberty-loving Americans wake up and fight for freedom like we mean it.\n\nRobert Knight is a Townhall contributor.", "description": "Things have come to a pretty pass when the most .10/22/2019 9:20:37AM EST.", "authors": ["Robert Knight", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/20f05fd6-fa97-4271-9eec-934f4e88f5eb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
