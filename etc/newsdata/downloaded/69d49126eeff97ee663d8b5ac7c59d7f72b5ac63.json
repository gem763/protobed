And we will make the decision in January.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"If I want to leave Chelsea? Not necessarily. But if I need to make a choice... I have some beautiful years in front of me. I'm 33, I still have legs and a good healthy lifestyle and I feel good physically.\"\n\nGiroud joined Chelsea from Arsenal in January 2018, and said he wouldn't be afraid to move again.\n\n\"I want to have fun and want to play more games. Chelsea is my priority, but if in the end I'm forced to make a choice, I will do it as when I left Arsenal,\" he said.\n\n(Image: REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes)\n\n\"[Lampard] will almost certainly watch the matches. In any case, I am going back to Chelsea pumped up.\"\n\nGiroud scored France's winner from the penalty spot in their 1-0 win over Iceland on Friday, before coming off the bench to head them into the lead on Monday night.\n\nAnd a move could be good for his future international prospects, according to France boss Didier Deschamps, who said after the game he is concerned over Giroud's lack of game time so far this season.\n\n(Image: Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\n\"Olivier suffers because of his situation. Before January, nothing will move,\" Deschamps said.\n\n\"After, it will be up to him to see. I hope he will have more playing time.\n\n\"But we cannot take away his goals, his good performances. He scores, he makes others play well.\n\n\"He knows he is under pressure, but he always responds.\"", "description": "French striker vowed to fight for his place but knows he may have decision to make when transfer window opens", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters Gonzalo Fuentes", "Chelsea Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588412.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EURO-2020-FRA-TUR-QUALIFIER.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
