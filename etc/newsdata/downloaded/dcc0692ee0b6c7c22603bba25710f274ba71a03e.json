To maintain its reputation as a reliable supplier, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter is looking to buy crude oil from at least one of its neighbors and additional oil products from the global market, oil traders said.\n\nMuch of what Saudi Arabia exports is unrefined crude oil. It keeps some of the oil it pumps out of the ground and refines it into products including diesel, gasoline and fuel oil, used mainly for domestic electricity generation and transport fuel. Saudi Arabia isn\u2019t normally an importer of crude and is ordinarily a net exporter of refined oil products.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack on a Saudi oil facility could have long-lasting repercussions. Heard on the Street editor Spencer Jakab explains how it could impact the global markets. Photo: Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters\n\nState-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco, said Tuesday that it would meet its obligations to supply customers while it repairs damage from the attacks. Saudi officials earlier this week said they would use reserves to return production to normal levels within weeks and had restored 50% of lost output.\n\nShortly after Saturday\u2019s attacks, Aramco was in the market seeking products including diesel, gasoline and fuel oil for domestic use, according to traders. To preserve its own crude for exports, Saudi Arabia needs to reduce the amount of domestic crude it refines to make those products.\n\nLast year on average Saudi Arabia produced 10.3 million barrels of crude oil a day and exported 7.4 million barrels a day, along with an additional 2 million barrels a day of refined products, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, they started inquiring around for the purchase of oil products, probably with the aim of maximizing crude exports,\u201d said Dario Scaffardi, chief executive of Italian refiner Saras SpA.\n\nThe kingdom sometimes imports extra diesel during the summer, when air conditioning puts higher demands on the power grid, but the quantities it has sought this week far exceed its regular demand, traders said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also asked Iraq\u2019s national oil company, the State Organization for Marketing of Oil, or SOMO, for as much as 20 million barrels of crude to supply Saudi\u2019s domestic refineries, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAramco declined to comment, and SOMO\u2019s deputy head of crude sales, Ali Nazar Shatar, said there is no contract between SOMO and Aramco.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How can other countries effectively help in the crisis after the attack on Saudi Arabia? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe attack on the Abqaiq oil processing plant is expected to cut activity at domestic refineries by up to 1.4 million barrels of crude a day, reducing the supply of products for domestic consumption and exports, said Iman Nasseri, managing director Middle East at consulting firm Facts Global Energy.\n\n\u201cThey are prioritizing the international market and exports for crude,\u201d Mr. Nasseri said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what Aramco\u2019s product exports will be in September, traders said. This week Aramco was seeking to import an additional 300,000 barrels a day of oil products, they added.\n\nTo keep its customers supplied, Saudi Arabia has also had to make adjustments to the crude grades it offers customers. Aramco has told Indian refiners that it can\u2019t deliver the premium-grade Arab Light crude they ordered. Instead, the company will send heavy, lower-grade crude, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.\n\nAramco replaced five cargoes of Arab Light\u2014including two destined to China\u2014with heavy crude from the Ras Tanura terminal in Saudi\u2019s eastern province this week, said Samah Ahmed, a crude-oil analyst at maritime data company Kpler.\n\nOne Norwegian supertanker that was set to load at Ras Tanura on Wednesday was diverted away, Ms. Ahmed said.\n\nReduced supplies of Saudi\u2019s Arab Light product have prompted at least two rival producers, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, to offer alternatives to international buyers, according to traders.\n\nThe U.S. could also fill any gap in light grades of crude, as two new pipelines connecting the shale-rich Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico to Gulf Coast ports have recently come online, boosting the country\u2019s export capacity in recent weeks.\n\nU.S. reliance on Saudi Arabian oil has dwindled in recent years, with domestic refiners getting about 3% of their oil from the country, down from 6% three years ago, according to Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Fuel makers on the West Coast take in the largest share of that oil.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. , which is among the top U.S. buyers of Saudi oil, said it doesn\u2019t anticipate any disruptions in its crude supply from the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThroughout our 16-refinery system, and with our robust logistics network, we have tremendous flexibility regarding our crude oil sourcing,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\n\u2014Rebecca Elliott contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com, Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "description": "After attacks on the country\u2019s largest oil facilities, Saudi Arabia is reaching out to foreign producers for crude and other petroleum products.", "authors": ["Sarah Mcfarlane", "Benoit Faucon In London", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Benoit Faucon", "Summer Said", "Sarah.Mcfarlane Wsj.Com", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108476/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
