Weather reports indicate that the temperature in Aurora at that time was 16 degrees, though the wind chill made it feel like zero degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\u2018In that situation, where there's nowhere for him to go, it could be very problematic,\u2019 Tasky said.\n\nTasky said that the breed of dog appears to be an Alaskan Malamute, an arctic breed that is believed to be able to withstand freezing temperatures.\n\n'[The driver] [b]etter have been cited,' tweeted one angry Twitter user\n\nTheresa M. Janson tweeted: 'The dog should be driving and his owner in the back to see how he likes it.'\n\n'Dog is bred to thrive and work in below zero weather,' tweeted Jimmy Foster. 'Not an issue'\n\nFrank Wolf tweeted: 'I don't think the dog cares. It's not a big deal. Why are we not as concerned about the treatment of human lives? Why is abortion ok but this dog situation causes an uproar?'\n\nBut the driver of the pickup truck could be in trouble regardless of the weather.\n\nAccording to local animal rights groups, it is illegal to transport an animal without adequate shelter.\n\nAurora Animal Services says it received multiple 911 calls from concerned citizens on Thursday.\n\nOne of the individuals who called 911 reported the driver\u2019s license plate, enabling police to track him down.\n\nAnthony Youngblood, an Animal Services Officer, said the driver was apologetic and forthcoming.\n\nThe driver told officers he had two animals in the back of the truck and that both were secured with harnesses.\n\nOfficers gave the man a warning.\n\nOn social media, opinion was divided as to whether the dog was tortured.\n\n'[The driver] [b]etter have been cited,' tweeted one angry Twitter user.\n\nTheresa M. Janson tweeted: 'The dog should be driving and his owner in the back to see how he likes it.'\n\nOthers, however, said the breed of dog in this case could handle the freezing cold.\n\n'Dog is bred to thrive and work in below zero weather,' tweeted Jimmy Foster. 'Not an issue.'\n\nFrank Wolf tweeted: 'I don't think the dog cares. It's not a big deal. Why are we not as concerned about the treatment of human lives?
