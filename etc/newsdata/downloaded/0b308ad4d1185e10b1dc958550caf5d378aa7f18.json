Many cleansing-cloth devotees believe you can. The idea is that a specific fine weave of microfibre, when soaked in plain water and wrung out, can remove even waterproof mascara, long-wear foundation, dirt and oil, without the aid of cleanser or face wash. I\u2019ll meet them halfway and concede that if you can stand the feel of microfibre, the cloths are great as a first step, lifting the worst of it before knuckling down to the real business of cleansing, much how you\u2019d use a micellar water or wipe. It\u2019s where I deploy the brilliantly useful Face Halo microfibre makeup remover pad (\u00a37.50) after a photoshoot or event that requires heavy makeup. Think of the microfibre step, if you will, as shedding your clothes before a shower.\n\nThe most famous in the field is MakeUp Eraser (\u00a317). This well\u2011made, pleasingly large cloth is available in heaps of designs and colours, including solid black to hide any gross makeup stains (I confess I prefer a white cloth so I can see what I\u2019m removing in all its deliciously mucky glory, but I\u2019m also someone who watches hours of surgical blackhead popping for entertainment, so your mileage may vary). Each side is different in texture \u2013 the fine nap is for cleansing, while the longer nap on the reverse is for exfoliation (I still strongly believe a flannel makes a better job of this, so if you\u2019re already a hot-cloth-cleansing fan, don\u2019t switch).\n\nThe best aluminium-free deodorants Read more\n\nWhat I prefer about the Cleanse Off Mitt (\u20ac5.95), but shippable worldwide) is its honest messaging. Irish skincare guru Jennifer Rock invented this blue microfibre mitt, not because she believes it\u2019s as effective as proper cleansing, but because she knows it\u2019s a damn sight better than using environmentally unsound cleansing wipes; her goal is to lure their devotees towards something more efficacious and ethical. Microfibre itself is not an environmentally friendly fabric, but it is reusable for up to five years or 1,000 machine washes, eliminating the need for countless disposable, and less effective, cotton wool discs and wipes, as well as packaged cleansing products. And so, like everything these days, it\u2019s a question of compromise over whatabouttery. Even for the cleansing wipe averse, Rock\u2019s tactile mitt, made from thinner fabric than the others I tried, makes a fast pre-cleanse for removing the bulk of makeup, giving a relatively clear canvas for a true deep cleanse with balm.\n\n\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
