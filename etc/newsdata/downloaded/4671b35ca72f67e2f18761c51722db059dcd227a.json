In the time since they have both moved on to their own paths.\u201d\n\nDEMI MOORE\u2019S SPLIT FROM ASHTON KUTCHER WAS 'A NIGHTMARE' AND 'TOOK HER YEARS TO GET OVER': REPORT\n\nAccording to Renee\u2019s blog, It\u2019s Not a Rumour, Freddy, who was born Frederick George Moore, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s at age 60.\n\n\u201cRick is, like too many others, struggling with the horrors of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d she explained. \u201cOur thoughts and efforts are focused on his care. Before the disease progressed he did write his story, and at some point that will be shared in his own book. We see this as his, much as I\u2019m sure Demi sees her book as her own.\u201d\n\nDEMI MOORE SAYS SHE 'LOST' HERSELF AFTER ASHTON KUTCHER BREAKUP: 'I BLINDED MYSELF'\n\nThrough the blog, Renee has been raising awareness of the devastating disease that impairs memory and has encouraged readers to reach out about how it has impacted their own families.\n\n\u201cI married the love of my life,\u201d wrote Renee in a post dated February of this year. \u201cHe was brilliant, a genius in fact, handsome, and so loving and giving, the sweetest person you could ever meet. He was an amazing songwriter, musician and singer. We would have conversations until the early hours of the morning and being together was heavenly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 35 years of loving each other and marriage, we got the horrible news that Rick had Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 60,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut 60? It is such a young age 60. Men even have kids at 60, my dad did. People don\u2019t retire until 65. Getting this news was the saddest day of my life.\u201d\n\nFreddy and Moore tied the knot when she was just 18 in 1980. The couple called it quits in 1985.\n\nWhen The Daily Mail caught up with the musician on Wednesday, he made \"crazy\" gestures when asked about the tales in the book, the outlet said, but added that he was going to \"read it as fast as [he] can.\"\n\nIn her memoir, now a bestseller, Moore looks at why she cheated on her husband before the wedding.\n\nDEMI MOORE'S DAUGHTER RUMER WILLIS RESPONDS TO MOM'S BOMBSHELL MEMOIR 'INSIDE OUT'\n\n\u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I go and see the man I was committing to spend the rest of my life with to express my doubts. Because I couldn\u2019t face the fact that I was getting married to distract myself from grieving the death of my father. Because I felt there was no room to question what I\u2019d already put in motion. I couldn\u2019t get out of the marriage, but I could sabotage it.\u201d\n\nThe Brat Pack star went on to marry actor Bruce Willis in 1987. The two stars share three daughters: Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah Belle, 25. The couple divorced in 2000.\n\nMoore began dating Ashton Kutcher in 2003, a relationship she described to the New York Times earlier this month as \u201ca do-over.\u201d\n\nDEMI MOORE SAYS SHE SPOKE WITH EX ASHTON KUTCHER BEFORE RELEASE OF HER TELL-ALL MEMOIR\n\n\u201cLike I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him \u2014 much more so than I\u2019d ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my 20s,\u201d said Moore about their 15-year age difference.\n\nThe paper said Moore became pregnant after she and Kutcher began dating. She lost the child, a girl she would have named Chaplin Ray, six months into the pregnancy.\n\nAfter the couple married in 2005, Moore and Kutcher reportedly sought out fertility treatments. However, Moore relapsed and began drinking and abusing Vicodin. Moore claimed Kutcher had cheated on her. The couple separated in 2011 and divorced two years later.\n\nMoore told the Times she wasn\u2019t concerned that anything she wrote in her memoir would impact her Hollywood career.\n\nJON CRYER DENIES DEMI MOORE\u2019S CLAIM THAT SHE TOOK HIS VIRGINITY\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I have to protect,\u201d she explained. \u201cReally. I\u2019m definitely not interested in blaming anyone. It\u2019s a waste of energy. I hope that everyone that\u2019s in the book feels like it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I hope they feel. Good, not bad.\u201d\n\nJon Cryer recently responded to Moore\u2019s claim that she took his virginity during their time together on the set of their 1984 movie \u201cNo Small Affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI played a young nightclub singer, and Jon Cryer played the 19-year-old photographer who falls in love with her, in his first movie role,\u201d Moore wrote, according to People. \u201cJon fell for me in real life, too, and lost his virginity to me while we were making that movie.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt pains me to think of how callous I was with his feelings \u2014 that I stole what could have been such an important and beautiful moment from him.\u201d\n\nDEMI MOORE'S NUDE PREGNANCY PHOTO WAS MEANT TO BE PRIVATE\n\nOn Tuesday, Cryer, 54, longtime star of the sitcom \"Two and a Half Men,\" addressed an article about the excerpt on Twitter, writing: \"Well, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my ... skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school,\" he clarified.\n\n\"But she\u2019s right the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life,\" he added. \"I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Mariah Haas and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Freddy Moore\u2019s wife Renee Moore is coming forward after Demi Moore admitted she cheated on the musician in her shocking tell-all \u201cInside Out.\u201d", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/demi-moore-freddy-morre-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
