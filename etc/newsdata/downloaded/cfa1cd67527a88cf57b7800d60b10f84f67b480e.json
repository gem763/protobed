He was a lifelong \u201cbetter off outer\u201d, they said, who tempered his views during the referendum but then prevented Labour from opposing Brexit \u2013 thus ceding ground and millions of votes to the Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists.\n\nThis is probably too simple. It seems more likely that Corbyn was always most interested in gaining power, but had a different view of the right way to go about it. Immediately after the referendum, for example, most Labour people thought it was right to accept the result and to press for a soft Brexit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd in the 2017 election, Labour\u2019s policy of a \u201cjobs-first Brexit\u201d, combined with opposition to a no-deal exit, was no obstacle to a stunning electoral performance that deprived Theresa May of her majority.\n\nIt was only last year \u2013 when The Independent started to campaign for a Final Say referendum \u2013 that Corbyn\u2019s attempt to straddle Leave and Remain started to cause strains in the party.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

PA\n\nEven so, as rival groups argued at today\u2019s shadow cabinet, the evidence is mixed. Labour did badly in the European elections, and yet managed to hold Peterborough in the by-election against a strong Brexit Party challenge.\n\nThe New Statesman reports that one analysis prepared for the shadow cabinet suggested that Labour is losing votes in a 2:1:1 ratio to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Brexit Party. In other words, for every one it loses to the Brexit Party, it loses three to the Remain parties.\n\nThis suggests that Labour should take up a more explicitly Remain position \u2013 which is what Corbyn is now cautiously doing, although his Remainer critics will say it is too little, too late, and still allows the Lib Dems and the Greens to outflank the party on the pro-EU side.\n\nBut Corbyn\u2019s Leaver critics \u2013 the 26 MPs who signed a letter to him today opposing a new referendum \u2013 say that he risks the worst of both worlds: losing Leave voters on one side while failing to win Remain voters back on the other.\n\nThis split is represented at the top of the party, with Ian Lavery, the party chair, posting an angry tweet this morning \u2013 which was presumably meant to be a private message \u2013 saying that the position of the shadow cabinet supporters of a referendum \u201creally is to head for revoking Article 50\u201d.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She continued to press her case at the shadow cabinet meeting today.\n\nWhat is interesting is that Keir Starmer, assumed to be the leading organiser of Labour\u2019s shift of position, has been less outspoken. Yet he has been drafting and redrafting the words of the policy as it has gradually evolved.\n\nThe most important force behind the shift has been the views of party members. They are overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum, and of staying in the EU. They were fended off with a complicated policy at the party\u2019s annual conference last year \u2013 the compromise once again drafted by Starmer.\n\nAnd the pressure from many of the trade unions \u2013 not including Unite, led by Corbyn\u2019s ally Len McCluskey \u2013 has added to the feeling that the line could not be held.\n\nIn the end, the decisive voice will probably be that of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. He has consistently struck a tone more favourable to a second referendum than Corbyn\u2019s, and he spoke at today\u2019s shadow cabinet to say that opposition from members to the existing policy had become so great that it was time to change the party\u2019s position.\n\nDespite briefing from the party\u2019s spokespeople that Corbyn\u2019s words to the shadow cabinet do not represent a change in policy, it seems there is no doubt that a policy shift is now under way.", "description": "The ambiguous shuffle by the shadow cabinet towards backing a Final Say referendum on any Brexit deal is a significant moment on a long road from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s acceptance, on the day after the 2016 vote, that Labour would respect the decision to leave the EU.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/19/19/Jeremy-Corbyn-home.jpg"}
