They got on the front foot and were more physical and they got their reward.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa have been triumphant in their two previous World Cup finals, memorably beating New Zealand on home soil in 1995 before defeating England in Paris in 2007.\n\nVictory in Yokohama on Saturday would continue their sequence of being crowned world champions at 12-year intervals but it would also mean the Springboks having to make history of a different kind as well.\n\nEvery team that has so far lifted the Webb Ellis Cup has gone through the tournament unbeaten.\n\nSouth Africa, however, lost their first match at Japan 2019, going down 23-13 to arch-rivals New Zealand in Yokohama last month.\n\nBut Mtawarira, a veteran of 116 Tests who is set to retire from the game after the tournament, knows that history will mean little when the teams line up.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened in the past doesn\u2019t really count. We know we\u2019ll have to play out of our skins to win it on Saturday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe last time the finalists met, England edged out the Springboks 12-11 at Twickenham in November 2018, with home captain Owen Farrell fortunate not to concede a penalty when, with 80 minutes on the clock, he escaped censure for an illegal \u2018no arms\u2019 tackle.\n\n\u201cEvery time we play against each other it\u2019s always a physical onslaught and I don\u2019t think it will be any different next Saturday,\u201d explained Mtawarira, who said he was \u201cexcited\u201d by the prospect of facing England props Mako Vunipola and Kyle Sinckler.\n\nThe 1995 World Cup remains a landmark in South African history, with the sight of Nelson Mandela presenting the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar providing an iconic image of the \u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019 but Mtawarira was only 10 years old and it passed him by.\n\n\u201cI was just a primary school kid in Zimbabwe back then, I didn\u2019t watch rugby then, I was playing soccer,\u201d said the 34-year-old Mtawarira.\n\nThe second win under the captaincy of John Smit in 2007 \u2014 which took place a year before Beast\u2019s Test debut \u2014 made far more of a lasting impression.\n\n\u201cIn 2007 I did watch and it was amazing, inspirational stuff and to be part of a World Cup final is a dream come true for me.\n\n\u201cI have worked hard throughout my career to get here and I want to make it count,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Inspirational Kolisi\u2019 \u2013\n\nVictory for South Africa in the final would, as was the case 24 years ago, have a resonance beyond rugby given flanker Siya Kolisi is the first non-white captain of the Springboks.\n\n\u201cIt would be extra special,\u201d said Mtawarira, who was granted South African citizenship in 2010.\n\n\u201cSiya is an inspirational leader, in the way South Africa has got behind him.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to unite the country. He has been exemplary. It would be amazing to win this World Cup with him as captain.\u201d\n\nAnd it would be an amazing way for Beast to bring down the curtain on a memorable international career.", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 South Africa\u2019s Tendai \u2018Beast\u2019 Mtawarira believes the Springboks will have to \u201cplay out of our", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/d35de2_tendai-mtawarira-springboks-play-out-our-skin-beat-england-in-world-cup-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
