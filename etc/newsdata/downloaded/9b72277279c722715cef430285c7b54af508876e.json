The real obscenity, by these lights, is routine mass shootings and the paralytic response they engender from the governing class, to which O\u2019Rourke\u2019s incredulity is a powerfully authentic rejoinder.\n\nCon: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s profanity is risible, a perfect summary of a campaign that even before was mocked for its alleged preening and Wayne\u2019s World affect. Even if the first time he dropped the F-bomb came as a genuine outburst, his repetition on Twitter and now official campaign T-shirts reveals calculation and contrivance\u2014making his vulgarities the opposite of the authenticity they supposedly convey.\n\nEither way, the Texan\u2019s coarse language is a frivolous dimension of a serious question for Democrats: Should progressive leaders confront the rawness and norm-shattering nature of President Donald Trump\u2019s political style with something similar? Or should they stand for a return to standards that used to be assumed for any presidential contender\u2014including language reflecting the gravity of the office, or at a minimum was G-rated?", "description": "", "authors": ["Harris", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
