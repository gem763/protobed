Daniel Hudson labored through the ninth, loading the bases with two outs before striking out Corey Seager for the save. The tense final inning also included a twisting, falling grab by third baseman Anthony Rendon on Cody Bellinger's pop fly in shallow left field, as well as a gutsy intentional walk by manager Dave Martinez that brought the winning run to bat.\n\nBUEHLER, MUNCY LEAD DODGERS PAST NATS 6-0 IN NLDS OPENER\n\nGame 3 is back in Washington on Sunday night, where Scherzer was expected to face major league ERA leader Hyun-Jin Ryu.\n\n\"I'm going to see how he feels tomorrow,\" said Martinez, adding Anibal S\u00e1nchez would start Sunday if Scherzer doesn't.\n\nPitching on the shortest rest of his career, Strasburg took a perfect game into the fifth inning while outdueling Clayton Kershaw. Strasburg pitched one-run ball for six innings and struck out 10, lowering his career postseason ERA to 0.64 \u2014 the best in history for players with at least four starts. He edged out Dodgers great Sandy Koufax (0.95 ERA), who watched from the front row.\n\nRookie Will Smith broke up Strasburg's perfect bid with a two-out single. The three-time All-Star allowed his first earned run in 23 consecutive postseason innings dating to the 2014 NLDS against San Francisco and limited Los Angeles to three hits and no walks.\n\nScherzer came on for the eighth and punched out Gavin Lux, Chris Taylor and Joc Pederson on 14 pitches. The 35-year-old right-hander threw 77 pitches in the NL wild-card game Tuesday, yet he topped out at 99 mph in his fourth career playoff relief appearance.\n\n\"We weren't expecting that,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nJustin Turner led off the ninth with a ground-rule double off Hudson, spurring hope from a chanting, clapping sellout crowd of 53,086. A.J. Pollock struck out, and then Bellinger popped up to shallow left. Rendon misjudged the ball but recovered and made the catch while he tumbled over. The goateed All-Star smiled wide as he stood.\n\n\"The ball kept going and I kept thinking, 'Where the hell is our left fielder at?'\" Rendon said. \"He didn't call it so I knew I had to catch it.\"\n\nMartinez intentionally walked Max Muncy, who hit a solo shot off Sean Doolittle in the seventh, before Hudson walked Will Smith to load the bases. Seager fouled off four fastballs before Hudson got him to swing over a slider.\n\nLos Angeles struck out 17 times.\n\nStrasburg was making the first start of his 10-year career on three days' rest. The right-hander tossed three shutout innings with two hits Tuesday night in a dramatic wild-card victory over Milwaukee, the first relief appearance of his career.\n\nThe Nationals took a 4-2 lead in the top of the eighth on Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera's pinch-hit RBI single.\n\nLos Angeles finally scored in the sixth on Turner's sacrifice fly after Matt Beaty's pinch-hit single and Pederson's double. With the tying run at the plate, Pollock lined out to Strasburg to end the inning.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MLB POSTSEASON COVERAGE\n\nUntil Smith broke through, the Dodgers' closest attempt at a hit came in the third when Kershaw's sinking line drive was grabbed by diving left fielder Juan Soto.\n\nKershaw ran into immediate trouble, with Trea Turner doubling on his first pitch of the game. After Adam Eaton popped out to third, Kershaw walked Rendon and hit Soto to load the bases. Howie Kendrick, who had two errors in a Game 1 defeat, followed with a run-scoring single.\n\nThe Nationals tacked on a pair of two-out runs in the second for a 3-0 lead. Kershaw hit Victor Robles leading off, and Robles got sacrificed to second by Strasburg. Eaton singled in Robles and Rendon followed with a double off the wall in center.\n\nAfter the early damage, Kershaw settled down and gave up two hits over his final four innings.\n\nThe three-time NL Cy Young Award winner allowed three runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked one.\n\nDUMPSTER DIVING\n\nLux's pinch-hit homer in Game 1 ended up in a right field trash can in the eighth inning.\n\nThe man who retrieved the ball told Lux how his first postseason homer bounced into the garbage.\n\n\"I'm like, 'You went dumpster diving for it? I guess I appreciate you doing that,'\" Lux said. \"Twenty years from now I can tell my kids, 'Hey, this ball was in the trash can.'\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nScherzer has now pitched in consecutive playoff wins after his teams endured seven straight postseason losses with him on the mound. The three-time Cy Young Award winner was slowed by a back injury this season but brought a live arm Friday. He is 4-5 with a 3.83 ERA in 14 postseason starts and 17 appearances.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nRyu led the majors with a 2.32 ERA, earning his first All-Star nod. He was the NL starter in the game. The South Korean is 2-2 with a 4.11 ERA in seven career postseason starts. Los Angeles elected to start him on the road (4-4, 2.72 ERA in 15 starts) even though he was much better at home (10-1, 1.93 ERA).", "description": "Stephen Strasburg turned in another dominant playoff outing, Max Scherzer overpowered Los Angeles for an inning out of the bullpen and the Washington Nationals held off the Dodgers 4-2 Friday night to even their NL Division Series at a game apiece.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/nationals-pitcher.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
