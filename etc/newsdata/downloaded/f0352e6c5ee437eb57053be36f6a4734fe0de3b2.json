Many women told the BBC that they too like to shop for clothes and even get their grocery shopping orders done late at night.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Women are more likely to make purchases late at night online\n\n\"My brain is buzzing at that time of day, so I'm often buying house decor, clothes, food - anything my brain has in its to-do list,\" Hampshire-based marketing director Kerri Watts told the BBC.\n\nThis ties in with the John Lewis research, which found that night-time spending is predominantly done by women. However, men are likely to spend more late at night than women do.\n\nThe top five most popular items being bought on John Lewis in the early hours of the morning are:\n\nduvet covers\n\ntelevisions\n\nlaptops\n\nmobile phones\n\nfreezers\n\nLuke, 27, told the BBC that he and his partner work 45-50 hour weeks, and they use online shopping as a way to get things done so that they can spend more time on their relationship at the weekend.\n\nHowever, Mr Field says that purchases made online at night are actually part of a \"shopping journey\" that begins much earlier in the day.\n\nRetailers say that many purchases are not made impulsively. Usually the consumer has looked at the item at least once previously, perhaps on a desktop computer, before later deciding to take the plunge and buy the item on a mobile device.\n\nImage copyright SOPA Images Image caption Consumers told the BBC that late at night is sometimes the only time they have to shop\n\nThis ties in with the experience of electrocardiogram technician Taia Johnstone. She told the BBC: \"I sit there and save items in my basket and then online shop late at night, not sure why, but the most horrendous outfits suddenly look wearable around 11:47pm on the model.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Field, this nocturnal shopping phenomenon has grown over the last two years, and shoppers are not just buying items at unusual times of the day, but also initiating returns at different times as well.\n\nNow, retailers are having to consider whether they need to extend the hours that they employ staff, especially as the online shopping market becomes even more competitive, he adds.\n\nPlus the costs of operating an online ecommerce website are now about equal to the costs of running a bricks-and-mortar shop, research from retail consultancy AlixPartners has shown.\n\n\"Retailers are trying to understand whether they will need to have some kind of night shift at their contact centres, so there are at least a handful of people available to help with orders or answer questions,\" he says.", "description": "Retailers are seeing a spike in British consumers shopping online for products from 22:00 to 02:00.", "authors": ["Mary-Ann Russon", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E873/production/_108670595_online-shopping-bed-woman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
