Still, Mnuchin threatened devastating actions in the wake of Turkish strikes that the U.S. has condemned.\n\n\"These are very powerful sanctions. We hope we don't have to use them. But we can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\" the Treasury chief told reporters.\n\nNumerous members of Congress, including some of Trump's top Republican allies, have criticized the Turkish offensive that started earlier this week, saying it will lead to the slaughter of U.S.-allied Kurdish forces. The strikes followed the president's decision to pull troops out of northern Syria.", "description": "Trump signed an order clearing the way for sanctions, though the U.S. will not move yet to punish Turkey after the country's offensive in northern Syria.", "authors": ["Jacob Pramuk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106177482-1570817247034mnuchin.jpg?v=1570817261", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
