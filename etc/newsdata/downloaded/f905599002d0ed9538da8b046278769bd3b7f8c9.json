They each led their teams to the College Football Playoff. Mariotta\u2019s Oregon Ducks actually beat Winston\u2019s Florida State Seminoles in the semifinals, but the year prior, it was Winston who led FSU to the national title. Each had big arms and a world of potential.\n\nThere were questions, of course, everything from throwing motions, accuracy and off-field issues. Those were brushed aside.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs the draft approached the talk was basically which order were they going atop the draft. It turned out Tampa Bay took Winston at No. 1, while Tennessee pounced on Mariota at No. 2.\n\nNearly four-and-a-half seasons later, hindsight isn\u2019t on which one should have gone ahead of the other, but how far down the draft order either would be selected if there was a redo.\n\nQuarterbacks Jameis Winston (R) and Marcus Mariota went 1-2 in the 2015 NFL draft. (AP)\n\nThe top two picks are at career crossroads after dual disasters on Sunday highlighted their lack of development as this begins to look like a historic draft failure.\n\nWinston threw five interceptions, was sacked seven times and lost a fumble in a 37-26 loss to Carolina. Mariota followed that up by going just 7-of-18 for 63 yards and two picks in a 16-0 loss to Denver. His play was so bad, he was benched in the second half and there is a groundswell of opinion he should be replaced by Ryan Tannehill.\n\nNeither is completing over 60 percent of their passes. Both the Bucs and Titans are 2-4.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nStory continues\n\nCertainly, neither is approaching all-time bust categories \u2013 the NFL has seen far worse from even No. 1 picks. Yet they entered the league together and were named immediate starters \u2013 and famously played each other on Week 1 \u2013 only to do little to inspire across the years. Maybe Mariota has been better than Winston at times, but neither has been good enough.\n\nTampa hasn\u2019t made the playoffs. Tennessee has, and even won a postseason game in the 2017 season, but Mariota has never led them to better than 9-7. Each is in the team-option year of their rookie deal, with no certainty as to whether they\u2019ll return.\n\nIt isn\u2019t what everyone expected.\n\n\u201cThings happen for a reason,\u201d Mariota said after the Denver game. \u201cI truly believe that. I can learn from this. I\u2019m going to grow from this and I\u2019ll become a better player.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll need to, quickly \u2026 if he even has the opportunity. Tannehill had plenty of struggles during his six seasons in Miami, but he\u2019s more than capable to take the starting job on a potentially good Titan team and never give it back. That would be an inglorious and unexpectedly fast end to the Mariota era in Nashville, where he was once hailed as a savior.\n\n\u201cEvery decision we make, we try and do in the best interest of the football team at every position,\u201d Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel said.\n\nWinston, meanwhile, isn\u2019t in jeopardy of seeing the bench, but mainly because backup Ryan Griffin is 29 but has never taken a single NFL snap. He\u2019s the only option. For now.\n\nJust seven times in the Super Bowl era have quarterbacks been selected 1-2 in the draft and never before have both selections failed to pan out.\n\nIn 2016, Jared Goff (Los Angeles Rams) and Carson Wentz (Philadelphia) topped the draft and started strong.\n\nIn 2012, it was Andrew Luck (Indianapolis) and Robert Griffin III (Washington). Injuries shortening and greatly impacting both careers, although Luck had a much longer run as an elite player.\n\nIn 1999, Tim Couch (Cleveland), Donovan McNabb (Philadelphia) and Akili Smith (Cincinnati) went 1-2-3. McNabb became a star. The other two faded quickly.\n\nIn 1998, Peyton Manning went first to Indianapolis and became an all-time great while San Diego took Ryan Leaf No. 2 only to see his career implode via poor play and substance-abuse issues.\n\nIn 1993, Drew Bledsoe (New England) went first and enjoyed an excellent career. Rick Mirer (Seattle) followed and was generally mediocre at best on a few bad teams.\n\nIn 1971, two strong individual careers were launched when Jim Plunkett went first to New England and Archie Manning second to New Orleans.\n\nWhich leaves Winston and Mariota, the crown jewels of a 2015 quarterback class that is on the brink of cratering. None of the guys picked behind them (Garrett Grayson, Sean Mannion, Bryce Petty, Brett Hundley, Trevor Siemian) has done much of anything, either.\n\nWinston and Mariota have had plenty of chances, multiple coaches and lots of development time to show something. Thus far, not so much. Can that change, on the fly, in the middle of the season? Or is this pretty much it?\n\n\u201cI see the preparation,\u201d Tampa coach Bruce Arians said of Winston. \u201cI see what he\u2019s trying to do.\u201d\n\nYet it isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cThe fumbles, we have to get rid of the fumbles,\u201d Arians said of Winston\u2019s performance Sunday. \u201cWe have to start throwing balls away and we don\u2019t need to take those sacks. You don\u2019t take those hits, either. The interceptions, I have to go back and look at the film.\u201d\n\nThis is all stuff the top NFL picks and future stars should have worked out by now. For whatever reason, Winston hasn\u2019t. Neither has Mariota.\n\nThe top of that 2015 draft is in trouble, with few signs of better days to come.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Neither is approaching all-time bust categories.
