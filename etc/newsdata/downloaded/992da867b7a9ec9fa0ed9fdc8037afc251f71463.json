The teenager from Caldicot, south Wales, kept returning on one condition: that the instructor would take her down to the local boxing gym in Newport when she turned 16.\n\n\u201cI saved up and bought a moped. I\u2019d go to bed in my clothes, wake up and sneak out the back door and ride to Newport to box, which was 40 minutes away,\u201d said Eccles.\n\n\u201cIt was freezing. I\u2019d box, ride back, go to sleep for ten minutes and then get up and go to school. I was completely hooked. I did it for a good few months before I got caught.\u201d\n\nDespite previous warnings, it was her father who discovered Eccles and her Yamaha moped were missing one fateful morning after an impromptu 4am visit at the house where she lived with her mother. A subsequent \u2018ban\u2019 ensued, but by then the damage was done and the pair now laugh whenever the subject is brought up.\n\n\u201cSince I was a kid, my goal was literally to go to the Olympics, I just never knew it would be boxing. \u201d said Eccles. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal because it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever been to that. When I was a kid in that boxercise class, I knew that\u2019s what I wanted to do, it sounds cheesy, but it did genuinely feel that way.\u201d", "description": "From the very first moment she set foot in a boxercise class as a 15-year-old, Rosie Eccles knew she was destined for a career in the ring.", "authors": ["Fiona Tomas", "Gareth A Davies"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000210909795-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq14eNwzJLvYQJbXrcyyarlDlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
