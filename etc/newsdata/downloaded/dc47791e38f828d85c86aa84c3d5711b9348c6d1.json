The two had met at a conference in May last year and were planning their lives together.\n\nThe Turkish doctoral student said goodbye to him at the gates of the consulate. \u201cSee you soon. Wait for me here,\u201d he told her. She waited outside for hours, and even returned the next day. But she would never see him again.\n\nIn the days after his disappearance, Saudi officials would deny any knowledge of his whereabouts. The official story shifted as new information was released by Turkish investigators, until eventually the Saudi government claimed the murder was carried out by rogue agents acting independently.\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments would later come to the conclusion that the crown prince had personally ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Bin Salman has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nEleven people are currently on trial for the killing in Saudi Arabia, but his body has never been found.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I had wanted only to be Jamal\u2019s wife, and his companion.\u201d\n\nTo this day, Cengiz doesn\u2019t fully understand why the decision was taken to murder her fianc\u00e9e.\n\n\u201cJamal was not in complete opposition to them, he was from that country and he worked close to them. But he disagreed with them on certain issues, and this angered them; he wrote for an American paper and his voice had a lot of reach. He was a patriotic person and loved his country. He was optimistic about his future,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHe was not only a journalist, he was a great man, and not only to me. I lost my partner, and Muslims and the world lost a great man.\u201d\n\nIn an interview broadcast this weekend, Mohammad bin Salman told CBS's 60 Minutes that he ultimately bore \"full responsibility\" for the killing a year ago, but he denied ordering it.\n\nDespite Western intelligence agencies linking Bin Salman to Khashoggi\u2019s death, there has been little appetite for any meaningful break in ties with Saudi Arabia. US President Donald Trump described it as the \"worst cover-up in history\", but he has insisted Washington\u2019s relationship with the kingdom was too lucrative to dismiss.\n\nMBS will welcome world leaders to Riyadh next year for the G20 summit, an event that will be used by the Saudi government to repair the crown prince\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cIt seems that these bilateral, economic relations have taken precedence over humanitarian ones,\u201d says Cengiz.\n\nIn her pursuit of justice for her partner\u2019s killing, Cengiz has travelled the world to meet with politicians and policy makers, and spoken at the UN and the US congress.\n\n\u201cWe want justice for Jamal, meaning that we want to hold those responsible to account. We are not talking about the whole country, we only want to hold those who were responsible to account. There should be political pressure to find out more about it,\u201d she stresses.\n\n\u201cAccording to what was said, [the crown prince] was responsible, and he should have to explain what happened. Questions must be put to him, and he has to respond to these questions.\n\nAlthough Cengiz confesses to being pessimistic, she refuses to give up trying.\n\n\u201cJustice has to be served. Western values, among them human rights, are still alive. These values have to be defended.\"", "description": "The fianc\u00e9e of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has called for the international community to hold his killers accountable, one year on from his death.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/12/Hatice-Cengiz.jpg"}
