We're going from bad to worse,\" Ma'azir Yas, who had wrapped herself in an Iraqi flag, told Reuters news agency. \"This protest is peaceful and the young men only ask for their rights: jobs and services.\"\n\nNearly three-fifths of Iraq's 40 million people live on less than six dollars a day, World Bank figures show, despite the country housing the world's fifth-largest proven reserves of oil.\n\nMPs resign\n\nIraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service said on Sunday it had deployed in the streets of Baghdad to protect important state buildings \"from undisciplined elements\".\n\nRenewed protests also flooded the streets of Najaf, Hilla, Karbala and Diwaniyah in the south.\n\nIn the oil-rich port city of Basra, police enforced a strict curfew and said it arrested \"saboteurs\" who had infiltrated the protesters.\n\nOn Sunday, Iraqi President Barham Saleh met with the United Nations' top representative in the country Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert to discuss electoral reform and amendments to the constitution, which dates back to 2005.\n\n191024072246529\n\nAbdel Mahdi has also proposed a laundry list of reforms including hiring drives, increased pensions and promises to root out corruption.\n\nBeyond the street, Abdel Mahdi also faces new pressure from parliament, with four MPs resigning and the largest bloc holding an open-ended sit-in since Saturday night.\n\nParliament's only two Communist MPs and two lawmakers linked to former prime minister Haider al-Abadi announced they were stepping down late on Sunday.\n\n\"We are resigning because of the protests and the way they were repressed,\" Communist lawmaker Raed Fahmy told AFP news agency.\n\nThe Iraqi Communist Party had allied with Moqtada al-Sadr in the 2018 elections to form Saeroon, which on Saturday began a sit-in to back protests.\n\nThe move has left Abdel Mahdi more squeezed than ever, as Saeroon was one of the two main sponsors of his government.", "description": "Nationwide demonstrations continue after scores of Iraqis were killed in clashes with security forces over two days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/aa3cf1fcc9904f22b7099efb7ae7eafd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
