(Reuters)\n\nTalking point: The meeting comes a week after Apple removed HKmap.live, which tracked police and protestors in Hong Kong, from its App Store. The decision, which followed condemnation from the state-run People\u2019s Daily, placed the company in the middle of the political dispute between China and Hong Kong. Though Cook defended the move, saying the app was being used for violence, it has led to widespread criticism of the company\u2014including, on Friday, from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers such as Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Apple\u2019s market share in China has fallen to 5.8 per cent in the quarter that ended in June, down from 6.4 per cent the same period a year before, according to research firm Canalys.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
