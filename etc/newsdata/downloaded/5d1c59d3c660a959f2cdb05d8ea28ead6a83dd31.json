REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina/File Photo\n\nThe high-profile Taliban delegation was arriving as the top U.S. diplomat involved in talks with the militants, Zalmay Khalilzad, also met government officials in Islamabad.\n\nIt was not clear if the Taliban would meet Khalilzad, though one senior Pakistani government official said that might happen.\n\nThe Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the group\u2019s founders, was due to discuss \u201cimportant issues\u201d with Pakistani officials, spokesman Suhail Shaheen said.\n\nThe visit, the latest stop on a tour of regional powers including Russia, China and Iran by Taliban officials, comes after efforts by the militants and the United States to reach a deal allowing for the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces broke down last month.\n\n\u201cThe visit would provide the opportunity to review the progress made under U.S.-Taliban peace talks so far, and discuss the possibilities of resuming the paused political settlement process in Afghanistan,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. It said a meeting between the insurgents and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was being finalised.\n\nKhalilzad, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Special Representative for Afghanistan, has been meeting Pakistani officials in Islamabad following discussions between Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in the United States.\n\n\u201cThese consultations follow discussions held between the United States and Pakistan during the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week,\u201d said a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad via email.\n\nThe spokesman did not say if Khalilzad was still in Pakistan on Wednesday or if he planned to meet the Taliban officials. A top Pakistan government official told Reuters that the Taliban would likely meet Khan, and that, \u201cwe\u2019re trying that we will convince the Taliban that the delegation also meets Zalmay Khalilzad\u201d.\n\nThe official said the meetings would focus on attempting to convince the Taliban to include the Afghan government in the peace talks. The insurgents have previously refused to negotiate with what they call an illegitimate \u201cpuppet\u201d regime in Kabul.\n\nSediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, said on Twitter that the Afghan government should be involved in any peace process.\n\n\u201cNo progress will be imminent if a peace process is not owned and led by the Afghan government,\u201d he said.\n\nPROGRESS ON PEACE?\n\nThe United States has long considered Pakistani cooperation crucial to efforts to end the war in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump last month halted the talks with the Taliban, aimed at striking a deal allowing U.S. and other foreign troops to withdraw in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, following the death of a U.S. solder and 11 others in a Taliban bomb attack in Kabul.\n\nThe Taliban delegation would inform Pakistan\u2019s leadership of the factors that derailed the talks, said a Taliban official who declined to be identified. The Taliban also planned to follow up on Khan\u2019s recent comment that he would try to convince Trump to resume the talks, the Taliban official said.\n\nBaradar, the head of the delegation, was making his first known visit to Pakistan since he was released from a Pakistani jail a year ago.\n\nPreviously the coordinator of the group\u2019s military operations in southern Afghanistan, he was arrested in 2010 by a team from Pakistani and U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThe U.S. and Taliban said last month, shortly before talks broke off, that they were close to reaching a deal, despite concerns among some U.S. security officials and within the Afghan government that a U.S. withdrawal could plunge the country into even more conflict and open the way for a resurgence of Islamist militant factions.", "description": "Afghan Taliban officials were due in Islamabad on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of reviving talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan, Pakistan's foreign ministry and the insurgent group said.", "authors": ["Asif Shahzad", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436121605&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910A2"}
