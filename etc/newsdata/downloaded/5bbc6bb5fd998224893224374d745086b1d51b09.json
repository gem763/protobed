(Gallo Images)\n\nThe State intends bringing charges against rape-accused televangelist Timothy Omotoso involving alleged offences that took place across the borders of South Africa.\n\nOmotoso and his co-accused, Lusanda Lusani and Zukiswa Sitho, appeared in the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth on Friday for what was meant to be the first day of his retrial before Judge Irma Schoeman.\n\nDefence advocate Peter Daubermann attempted to have some of the charges dropped, arguing that jurisdiction was an issue if the alleged offences did not occur in the country.\n\nWitnesses were expected to give evidence on alleged rapes that took place while they were escorting Omotoso on international trips.\n\nDaubermann said he would not allow the reopening of those international matters, as it would lead to another postponement, which would not be \"fair or favourable\" to his client.\n\nALSO READ: Omotoso rape trial ordered to go ahead after bid for more charge details fails\n\nThe matter was postponed to Monday for the State to get a new authorisation certificate to centralise all the charges, which must then be read before the court.\n\nThe three accused are facing 97 charges, including rape, human trafficking and racketeering, with the State now hoping to add additional charges.\n\nOn Thursday, Schoeman ordered that the trial go ahead as scheduled after denying an application by the defence that the State give them more details on the charges.\n\nIt was a bad day for Omotoso on Thursday, as the Department of Home Affairs official also paid him a visit in court to deliver some bad news.\n\nREAD MORE: Double blow for Omotoso as Home Affairs official surprises him with bad news in court\n\nThe official informed him that his application to lift his prohibition as an illegal resident in South Africa had been unsuccessful.\n\nHis supporters demanded the official speak through Daubermann.\n\nDaubermann, however, declined and said: \"I only represent you on this [trial] matter.\"\n\nOmotoso then left the courtroom, with his supporters shouting: \"My Pappa, My Daddy! We love you Daddy.\"\n\n* This story has been amended after publication.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
