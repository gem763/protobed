That is followed by Spain with seven, Germany with six and Netherlands, Italy and France with five apiece. England has only two coaches involved.\n\nAjax Amsterdam were the most prolific scoring team with 3.5 goals per game in winning the Eredivisie, and Shakhtar Donetsk had the stingiest defence with just 0.34 goals conceded per game.\n\nAround Europe, English Premier League champions Manchester City were the fourth-most dominant team in their own league last season with 2.58 per points per game.\n\nThe mantle of the most dominant team of all, however, went to the mighty guns of HB Torshavn of the Faroe Islands league, who averaged 2.70 points per game with their domestic record of 24 wins, one draw and two defeats last season.", "description": "The clubs involved in this season's Champions League and Europa League group stages invested more than half of their transfer spending in the last window on players aged 24 and under, a report by European soccer body UEFA said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429034687&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0SH", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
