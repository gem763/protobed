Giuliani has said he undertook those efforts, which are now at the heart of congressional impeachment inquiries, in his capacity as a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Trump was emphatic late Thursday that he did not know either man, dismissing a picture of him with the men as irrelevant \u201cbecause I have a picture with everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know what they do. I don't know. Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You\u2019d have to ask Rudy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI just don't know.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some of the charges against Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, stem from alleged activities related to their work with Giuliani, including a successful effort to have the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed from her post.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas and Fruman agitated for her removal at the behest of an unnamed Ukrainian government official, and hid the source of political donations they made in order to further that goal.\n\nAhead of her May dismissal, Giuliani had complained about Yovanovitch to Trump. At the time, Giuliani was working with the Ukraine-born Parnas and the Belarus-born Fruman to dig up dirt on Biden, whose son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In May, the former New Yorker mayor described Parnas and Fruman as his clients.\n\nMeanwhile, House investigators on Thursday also subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman over their work with Giuliani as part of the ongoing impeachment probe. Lawmakers are seeking documents related to their efforts to remove Yovanovitch, as well as materials related to any role they played in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani on Thursday declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas and Fruman made contributions to political action committees and to an unnamed \u201cCongressman-1\u201d in order to enhance their political influence. The document says that after making the maximum allowable contribution to Congressman-1, Fruman donated again to the congressman, but illegally made the gift under Parnas\u2019s name.\n\nThe congressman appears to be former Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions, who, according to campaign finance disclosures, received maximum donations from Parnas and Fruman last June.\n\nHouse investigators are looking into efforts by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to have the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed from her post. More\n\nIn May 2018, Sessions wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raising concerns about Yovanovitch. Sessions, who lost reelection by 7 points last year to Democrat Colin Allred, would not confirm in a statement Thursday evening that he was the lawmaker in question.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI will vigorously defend myself against any allegations of wrongdoing.\u201d He noted that the indictment alleges Parnas and Fruman \u201cconcealed the scheme from the candidates, campaigns and federal regulators.\u201d\n\nHe also denied taking any action after taking a meeting from Parnas and Fruman, where he said the group discussed Ukrainian energy independence.", "description": "Two foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani were indicted on campaign finance charges made public on Thursday over alleged schemes to buy political influence on behalf of a Ukrainian government official and a Russian businessman.
