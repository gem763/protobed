Earlier Friday, House Democrats requested that Vice President Mike Pence produce documents on Trump's phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, any government communication about the conversations, and information on plans for providing foreign aid based on political meddling. The letter also warned that failure to comply with the request for documents by Oct. 15 would be considered evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry. [Fox News, CNN]\n\n2.\n\nThe White House issued a proclamation Friday saying it would soon require immigrants applying for a U.S. visa to prove that they either have health insurance or can afford to cover their own health care costs before entering the country starting Nov. 3. President Trump said the White House wants to \"protect the availability of health care benefits for Americans\" as \"taxpayers bear substantial cost\" in paying for medical expenses of people who lack health insurance. \"Immigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our health care system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs,\" Trump said. The proclamation would affect many immigrants, including those with family ties in the country, but it does not include non-citizen children of U.S. citizens or those who have been granted asylum. The proclamation is expected to face legal challenges. [The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post]\n\n3.\n\nA second intelligence official is considering filing another whistleblower complaint and testifying to Congress about President Trump's communications with Ukraine's government, The New York Times reports. The official reportedly has more direct information than the first whistleblower, whose complaint that Trump was using the office of the presidency to pressure Kyiv to investigate his political rivals spurred a congressional impeachment inquiry. The second official was reportedly interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the first official's account. In related news, Trump reportedly has ordered reductions to the staff of the National Security Council. The first whistleblower alleged NSC officials had tried to keep Trump's controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky under wraps, though sources said the cuts are meant to increase efficiency during a leadership transition. [The New York Times, Bloomberg]\n\n4.\n\nThe Treasury Department's inspector general will investigate whether Trump administration officials have improperly blocked Democrats from accessing President Trump's tax returns, officials confirmed Friday. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has requested six years of Trump's taxes, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has so far refused to comply. Trump has said his taxes are under audit and thus cannot be released. A whistleblower, revealed Thursday to be an IRS official, said a Treasury Department appointee may have tried to \"improperly interfere\" with an audit, which the White House disputed. Neal requested the Treasury investigation, saying he wants assurance \"no one is endeavoring to intimidate or impede government officials and employees carrying out their duties.\" [The Washington Post]\n\n5.\n\nThe United States re-engaged on two geopolitical fronts. U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad met with the Taliban in Islamabad, Pakistan on Friday for the first time since President Trump declared peace negotiations to end the conflict in Afghanistan \"dead\" in September. Few details have been released about the meeting, but there reportedly has not yet been a resumption of peace talks. Meanwhile, Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde confirmed Saturday that U.S. and North Korean officials are in Sweden to hold talks about Pyongyang's denuclearization process after the negotiations between the two sides broke down in February. North Korea had announced earlier this week they were ready to resume talks.
