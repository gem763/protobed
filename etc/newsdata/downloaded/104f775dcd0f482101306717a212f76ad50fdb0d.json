Although they live in Havana, they opted to give birth\u2014as well as, nine months earlier, undergo the process of IVF\u2014in the U.S. They couldn\u2019t do it at home: The Cuban government still doesn\u2019t recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nA year ago, most LGBTQ Cubans would have been eagerly anticipating the expected legalization of same-sex marriage. In July 2018, the Cuban National Assembly proposed a new constitution that included amended language (Article 68) that would make same-sex marriage legal. But that December, the government withdrew the amendment from the draft, largely because of strong backlash from evangelical churches. This means, along with marriage, that assisted reproduction is still only available to heterosexual couples in Cuba; single women are excluded as well.\n\nSo, if both Vald\u00e9s Moreno and her wife wanted to be legally recognized on their child\u2019s birth certificate, they had no choice but to give birth in the states. Once they return to Havana later this year, however, they\u2019ll be faced with another dilemma: Because Hope, the child\u2019s biological mother (whose last name has been withheld for privacy), is not a Cuban citizen, the couple will have to convince the government to recognize Vald\u00e9s Moreno as the baby\u2019s second mother in order for him to be eligible for Cuban citizenship.\n\n\u201cThe issue of citizenship for a hetero couple is very easy because you can obtain Cuban citizenship being born in Cuba or being a child of Cubans.\u201d But Vald\u00e9s Moreno fears that it won\u2019t be so easy for them: \u201cThey automatically expect mother and father, and our birth certificate says that Hope is the mother and I am a parent.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, discrimination against LGBTQ people in Cuba has been waning and there have been tangible gains in the area of LGBTQ rights, led largely by Mariela Castro, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s daughter and longtime director of CENESEX (the National Center for Sex Education). In 2008, the government made gender confirmation surgery free under the national healthcare system, and in 2013, it banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. But that was before the recent uptick in evangelism in Cuba, partly aided by financial and ideological support from the U.S.\n\n\u201cThose were, at least for me, frightening months, because I never could have seen this final result coming.\"\n\nCuba\u2019s shift from officially atheist to secular\u2014which indicates more tolerance of organized religion\u2014has also given rise to a growing evangelicalism on the island spurred on by American churches, whose ideologies have long been spreading throughout the Americas. In fact, millions of dollars from American evangelical organizations funneled into Cuba\u2019s conservative, religious communities are funding a groundswell of action meant to dial back a decade of progress made by LGBTQ Cubans.\n\n\u201cBoth the moral and financial support of U.S. Evangelical denominations and agencies has been crucial to backing Cuban Evangelicals in their campaign to oppose gay marriage on the island,\u201d said Andrew Chesnut, Professor of Religious Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. Cuban evangelical churches have also received funding from religious groups in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil.\n\nThe most prominent example to date has been the backlash to Article 68, in which evangelical churches effectively pressured the Cuban government to revoke it from the draft constitution. Methodist, Baptist, and Pentecostal churches organized a petition against it that gathered 178,000 signatures. The campaign not only involved organizing among the church communities, but outreach in the form of posters and door-to-door visits in which members of church groups would, as Havana-based social psychologist and LGBTQ rights pioneer Norma Guillard Limonta experienced it, argue that \u201cthe world would end if marriage were redefined as not between a man and a woman and for the purposes of procreation.\u201d Vald\u00e9s Moreno saw it for herself: In community meetings leading up to the vote to approve the new constitution, she said she was taken aback by the level of preparation by evangelical Christians, who seemed to have coordinated messaging against same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThose were, at least for me, frightening months, because I never could have seen this final result coming; it really shocked and saddened me,\u201d said Vald\u00e9s Moreno. \u201cWhat scares me the most is the organizing capacity that [they] have and the fact that suddenly in a country like Cuba the Church could be a force of political pressure that could threaten to vote no to the referendum, to sabotage the [constitutional] project.\u201d\n\nFollowing their successful effort to have Article 68 removed, evangelical churches set their sights on the Conga Against Homophobia and Transphobia\u2014Cuba\u2019s version of a pride parade. In May, the 12th annual conga was cancelled by the government, citing \u201cinternational and regional tensions.\u201d One of the organizers of the event told el Nuevo Herald that the celebration was actually cancelled \u201cto avoid confrontations with Christian groups,\u201d who organizers feared would counter-protest and start a street riot. In response, activists held a non-sponsored march on May 11 and several were arrested after being warned by government officials not to carry it out.\n\nWhile Cuba has never been a majority-Protestant country, many Cubans consider themselves to be creyentes (\u201cbelievers\u201d). Before the 1959 Revolution, the country was predominantly Catholic, with a substantial portion of the Black and mixed-race population practicing one or more Afro-Cuban religions. But once Fidel Castro aligned himself with Soviet-style communism in the early 1960s, Cuba officially became atheist. Religious practice was marginalized\u2014even criminalized\u2014and members of the Cuban Communist Party were forced to renounce their faith.\n\n\u201cThat money comes with ideological conditions.\u201d\n\nWhen the Soviet Union, which had been subsidizing Cuba\u2019s economy, fell in the early 1990s, many Cubans turned to faith for refuge from the devastating economic crisis. This coincided with a shift in the Castro regime\u2019s stance on religion: the wording was changed in the 1992 constitution from an \u201catheist\u201d to a \u201csecular\u201d country, indicating more official tolerance.\n\nToday, religions of all types are booming in Cuba. An estimated seven to 10 percent of Cubans are Protestant or evangelical. The recent surge in evangelicalism coincides with the threat of another economic crisis, as Cuba's fortunes are tied to those of Venezuela.\n\nBut while many Cubans are suffering from the economic downturn, churches are often less vulnerable: Most Cuban evangelical churches have a \u201csister church\u201d in the U.S. that supports them financially and, as Cuban LGBTQ rights activist and Baptist seminary student Adiel Gonz\u00e1lez Maim\u00f3 emphasized, \u201cThat money comes with ideological conditions.\u201d\n\nAnd, while homophobia is nothing new in Cuba, the organized opposition to LGBTQ rights and pressure on the Cuban government to roll them back in the past year echoes methods of fundamentalist groups in the U.S. that are uncommon in Cuba, where public space is tightly controlled\u2014and perhaps even more effective there because of it.\n\nRecently, journalist Tracey Eaton's Cuba Money Project published a list of the Cuba-related projects that have received the most government funding since Trump took office. Number five on the list is Evangelical Christian Humanitarian Outreach for Cuba (ECHO Cuba), with just over $1 million. This group received roughly $2.3 million from the U.S. government from 2009 to 2017. ECHO Cuba leads missionary trips to Cuba, provides resources and training to Cuban churches, and \u201cfights biblical poverty\u201d on the island.\n\nBut the group may not only be exporting religious ideology. Its founder, Miami-based Teo Bab\u00fan comes from a family of Cuban exiles and, according to an article published in Granma (Cuba\u2019s state newspaper), supported the anti-communist Bay of Pigs invasion in 1971. \u201cAs a good mercenary, Teo Bab\u00fan today has extended his activity via a few Protestant denominations,\u201d reads the Granma article, \u201cwhich complement Trump\u2019s goals, outlined in June of 2018, to perfect the subversive U.S. policy toward Cuba and the manipulation of Protestant denominations with a view toward a \u2018transition\u2019 in Cuba.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptimism went out the window for me with Article 68.\u201d\n\nIn another move that signals an organized evangelical opposition to the status quo, just a month ago, a group of seven evangelical churches broke off from the Cuban Council of Churches (CIC) and established their own splinter group, the Alliance of Cuban Evangelical Churches. Leaders of the new group maintain that the CIC doesn\u2019t represent their beliefs, which include a \u201cdefense of Biblical values\u201d and the view that marriage should be defined as a union between a man and a woman.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this Alliance fosters a space of unity, from which the whole economic, spiritual, religious, and political force of the Christian fundamentalist churches will be deployed,\u201d wrote Elaine Saralegui Caraballo, a lesbian pastor and founder of a Cuban division of the Metropolitan Community Church, following the news. She added that the Alliance\u2019s goal was to promote \u201cChristian supremacy\u201d with the guidance of the U.S. far right, in a similar manner as has occurred in other Latin American countries.\n\nThe new evangelical alliance is gearing up for a renewed fight against marriage equality: In 2020, the government will reconsider the \u201cFamily Code\u201d within the constitution. Gonz\u00e1lez Maim\u00f3 feels confident that marriage equality will be a reality by 2021, when the Family Code would go into effect. He based his hunch on a 2016 survey that found 49 percent of the Cuban population was in favor of marriage equality, and on his belief that the political will of the government leans toward extending this right to LGBTQ people. But he also stressed that fundamentalist churches are cognizant of these facts\u2014and are organizing against it.\n\nVald\u00e9s Moreno was notably more worried about the looming \u201cvery ugly war\u201d over the Family Code and the future of her family\u2019s rights. \u201cOptimism went out the window for me with Article 68,\u201d she said. She felt that by removing it from the recent constitution, after being the one to propose it in the first place, the Cuban state was saying to conservative religious groups: \u201cYou were right.\u201d If evangelical groups were able to organize so well in only a few months against Article 68, she added, they have two whole years to do the same thing with the Family Code. And if same-sex marriage isn\u2019t legalized soon in Cuba, the future for Vald\u00e9s Moreno and her family remains fraught and unclear.\n\n\u201cThat battle cannot be lost,\u201d said Vald\u00e9s Moreno, \u201cbecause if the Family Code is rewritten without [marriage equality], we will go 30 or 50 years before the issue is revisited.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "The Evangelical church has gained a huge amount of political power in Cuba, and LGBTQ people are dealing with the consequences.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d5bff279d054100086a08d0/lede/1566313886309-GettyImages-682734454-1.jpeg?crop=0.7973xw:0.8092xh;0.11xw,0.0524xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-08-20"}
