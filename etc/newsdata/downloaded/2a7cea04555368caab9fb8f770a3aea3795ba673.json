REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nWidodo inaugurated ministers in his second-term cabinet on Wednesday, half of whom are technocrats, while the other half have links to political parties.\n\nHosting his first cabinet meeting, Widodo said ministers should work as a team to identify central and regional government regulations that overlap and are overly complicated.\n\n\u201cAnything that hampers our services to the people, hampers investment by the business community, identify them within a month,\u201d Widodo said, ordering such regulations be reviewed or removed.\n\n\u201cOur biggest goal .. is to create jobs. This is needed and wanted by the people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also reminded ministers not to disagree in public, saying they were free to debate things within government meetings.\n\nDespite Widodo\u2019s efforts since coming to power in 2014 to make it easier to start a business, investors still found it difficult to enter some sectors, he said in May.\n\nOn Wednesday, after swearing in the ministers, he ordered them to revise 74 laws by applying \u201comnibus laws\u201d, or legislation that encompasses diverse and unrelated issues.\n\nForeign direct investment into Indonesia has been sluggish in recent years because of factors such as regulatory uncertainty and weak commodity prices. Widodo has complained the country has not attracted as much investment from manufacturers trying to move out of China compared with other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nWidodo kept several economic ministers from his first term in the new team, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and longtime ally Luhut Pandjaitan, who oversees maritime affairs, natural resources and investment.\n\nOther appointments include the co-founder of startup Gojek, Nadiem Makarim, as education minister and politician Airlangga Hartarto as chief economic affairs minister.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday ordered his new cabinet members to simplify the country's regulatory framework within their first month in office, stressing the new administration's priority is to create jobs in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444377254&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0BN", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
