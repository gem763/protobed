Sanlam and Standard Bank are big role players and the risk of them getting off the project would be a huge dilemma for us.\n\n\"Meetings with them have reconfirmed that they are on board and the project has moved in.\n\n\n\n\"The main thing is that we draw a line in the sand and move forward.\n\n\"The project is for prosperity and for the future.\n\n\"A number of us knew that there would be a lot of pain to get this to where it is today and I sense that a lot of that pain has passed. We will still have pain, but when we get to the end of January 2021 when everything is up then we will all benefit.\"", "description": "Newlands will still host the 2020 New Year's Test between the Proteas and England despite the WPCA having been placed under administration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8340/452b73223119467097343ed834987b9f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
