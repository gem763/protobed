If we win we\u2019ll celebrate with dangdut!\u201d Achid, a team leader who goes by one name, said in reference to a popular genre of Indonesian dance music with infectious beats. His nine teammates chuckled in response and pulled harder on the 86-tonne train with gloved hands.\n\nThe crowd cheered them on as they went head-to-head with another team in the competition's second round.\n\ncompeted against another team. Both sides managed to jostle the trains, which slowly inched forward in the qualifying finals.\n\nThe train-pulling competition hosted by the Yogyakarta, Indonesia Region IV Train Service took place in August at their local locomotive depot that houses trains while not in use.\n\nThat particular day, two diesel electric trains were prepared to test the strength of the participants. Eko Budiyanto, head of the Division VI Train Service, said this was the third time his office hosted such an event.\n\nThis year, 14 teams from both inside and outside the train industry took part. Some of them are part of the Yogya train enthusiasts community, who call themselves \u201crailfans.\"\n\nA TEAM\u2019S PREPARATION FOR THE COMPETITION.\n\nAchid and his team work as porters at the Tugu Station, transporting passenger luggage on and off trains. They\u2019ve been a crowd favourite since the competition\u2019s inception in 2017. They\u2019re good competition, considering they make a living lifting heavy objects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic, but the competition is tough, especially them,\u201d Achid said, motioning towards a group of men in blue uniforms who work at the Locomotive Depot.\n\nWhile Achid\u2019s team consists mostly of middle-aged men clad in traditional batik button-downs, the Locomotive Depot team looks considerably more sinister with their muscular physiques and popped collars.\n\nThe rules are simple. Two teams, each consisting of ten people, race to pull an 86-ton train ten meters forward to the finish line. A layer of oil on the tracks lubricates the trains\u2019 wheels, making them easier to pull. It usually takes less than a minute for each team to complete a round. Two referees stand at the finish line to determine which team reaches it first.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really much strategy, the only important thing is to remember to eat breakfast so we have strength,\u201d Achid told VICE.\n\nThis race was held in remembrance of Indonesia\u2019s independence day, but Achid and his team say they also hold these races to educate the public about trains. \u201cThe body of a train is extremely heavy and can really hurt you if there\u2019s an accident. It\u2019s especially dangerous to those who take selfies on the tracks or bridges,\u201d Eko said.\n\nEko\u2019s argument has some merit. Just two days before the competition, a middle school student died while taking a selfie on the train tracks at Solo station not too far away.\n\nIn Indonesia and across the world, extreme selfies have resulted in countless deaths, with the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care reporting 257 selfie-related deaths between 2011 and 2017. Death by selfie even has its own name now: selfiecide.\n\n\u201cWe have almost zero train accidents, but most accidents happen on the tracks or surrounding areas,\u201d Eko continued.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason the tournament was expanded to allow outsiders to join. Most of the public participants consisted of around 20 teenaged railfans willing to put their strength to the test.\n\nParticipants pulling an 86-tonne train\n\n\u201cDamn, it\u2019s so heavy, I just tried it! Us railfans usually just look for photo ops when it comes to trains,\u201d Vino, a high school senior and train fanatic who also goes by one name, told VICE. Vino and his community hope to contribute to educating the public on trains.\n\nThe cash prize was an undisclosed amount, but that didn\u2019t make a difference to the participants. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re after, we just want to have fun. I heard it was cash, but I\u2019m not too sure. Hopefully it\u2019s enough to buy our team dinner,\u201d Surono, a coordinator on the Locomotive Depot team from district VI said.\n\nCommittee members lubricate the tracks with oil.\n\nSadly, Achid and his comrades lost in the second round against the Tugu Station Construction team. In the final round, the time difference between the two competing teams was only a few seconds. Team Bangdis was awarded second place, while the Locomotive Depot Team took gold, as Achid had initially worried.\n\n\u201cI guess we won\u2019t be celebrating with dangdut,\u201d Achud chuckled. In the end, he said, he prefers lugging passenger cargo.", "description": "Railroad workers, porters, and construction workers measure their strength in this colossal showdown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6cc0cf45d6360009361eff/lede/1567408571071-tim-siswa-magang-di-PT-KAI-sedang-berlomba.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.843xh;0xw,0.1232xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
