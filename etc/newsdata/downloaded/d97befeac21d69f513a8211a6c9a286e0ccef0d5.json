The Santa Clause (1994) When Tim Allen\u2019s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first \u2013 but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It\u2019s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it\u2019s enjoyable to watch. Buena Vista Pictures 2/20 19. The Apartment (1960) When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend\u2019s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: \u201cWhat about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?\u201d The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong. Rex 3/20 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994) Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey. 20th Century Fox 4/20 17. The Holiday (2006) Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it\u2019s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian. Universal Pictures 5/20 16. Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010) A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he\u2019s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement. To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun. Kinology 6/20 15. Happy Christmas (2014) This low-budget, entirely improvised film from \u201cmumblecore\u201d actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film\u2019s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie Lynskey Magnolia Pictures 7/20 14. White Christmas (1954) Featuring a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out. Rex 8/20 13. Die Hard (1988) Whatever side you\u2019re on in the infernal debate over whether it\u2019s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it's hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, \u201cNow I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho\u201d, makes it ideal holiday viewing too \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re a little sick of festive slush. Moviestore/Rex 9/20 12. The Bishop\u2019s Wife (1947) Based on Robert Nathan\u2019s 1928 novel, The Bishop\u2019s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant\u2019s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He\u2019s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve. Rex 10/20 11. A Christmas Carol (1999) There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens\u2019s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best \u2013 thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant. RHI Entertainment 11/20 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour \u2013 she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. \u201cIt was some years later before I really knew what she\u2019d been going through,\u201d her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland\u2019s struggles with mental health issues and addiction \u2013 but you\u2019d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It\u2019s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d. Rex 12/20 9. Home Alone 2 Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long \u2013 but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it\u2019s hard to complain. If you\u2019re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump\u2019s brief cameo. 20th Century Fox 13/20 8. Carol (2015) When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance \u2013 but it\u2019s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that \u201cColin goes to America\u201d abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes\u2019s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity. StudioCanal 14/20 7. Love Actually (2003) We\u2019ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off \u2013 namely Emma Thompson\u2019s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman. Rex 15/20 6. Gremlins (1984) There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don\u2019t expose it to the light, don\u2019t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing. Warner Bros 16/20 5. The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992) Who\u2019s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens\u2019s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act \u201clike I\u2019m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company\u201d, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked. Buena Vista Pictures 17/20 4. The Snowman (1982) Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK \u2013 it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since \u2013 it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone\u2019s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England\u2019s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of \u201cWalking in the Air\". Channel 4 18/20 3. Elf (2003) This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa\u2019s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he\u2019s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren\u2019t for Ferrell\u2019s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical. Rex 19/20 2. Home Alone (1990) After revelling for a while in every child\u2019s ill-thought-out fantasy \u2013 \u201cI made my family disappear,\u201d says Macaulay Culkin\u2019s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him \u2013 Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you\u2019ve ever seen. 20th Century Fox 20/20 1. It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (1946) Admittedly, for about 120 of this film\u2019s 130-minute running time, it\u2019s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it\u2019s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic. National Telefilm Associates 1/20 20. The Santa Clause (1994) When Tim Allen\u2019s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.
