(NES, 1985)\n\nPlatforming is widely seen as reaching a new peak with this game\u2019s fluid, side-scrolling worlds featuring snapping plants, warp pipes and magic mushrooms.\n\nBacked by memorable music and underscored by precise jumping mechanics, the game shifted more than 40 million copies and turned Mario into a pop-culture icon.\n\nSUPER MARIO KART (SNES, 1992)\n\nMario expanded his repertoire in the first installment of this long-running series in a formula that has remained largely unchanged at its core. Franchise characters including Mario\u2019s brother Luigi and adversary Bowser race their karts while dropping bananas and collecting coins.\n\nSUPER MARIO 64 (Nintendo 64, 1996)\n\nMario took full advantage of the Nintendo 64\u2019s enhanced processing power and made the jump to 3D graphics, re-imagining the platform genre by giving players the freedom to roam an open world where Mario explores a sunken ship and races a penguin down an icy mountain.\n\nSUPER MARIO GALAXY (Wii, 2007)\n\nNintendo took 3D gaming to a new level of playfulness as Mario goes galactic, with players employing the motion-sensing Wii Remote, flinging the plumber between planetoids and exploring new worlds amid shifting gravity effects.\n\nMARIO KART 8 DELUXE (Switch, 2017)\n\nA retooled version of the tried-and-true kart formula, the game features the ability to race while defying gravity. It has become the Switch\u2019s top selling game, moving more than 17 million copies and demonstrating the ongoing appeal of the karting series.", "description": "The launch of Nintendo Co Ltd's <7974.T> Mario Kart Tour on Wednesday marks the latest game to feature moustachioed Italian plumber Mario who for nearly four decades has gripped gamers as he dodges flying turtles, jumps chasms and rescues Princess Peach.", "authors": ["Sam Nussey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433240338&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0FD", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
