However, there is little more cheering in the dark, murky days of winter than eating a few cold, rain-washed leaves, fresh from the soil. So the tomatoes are out, and winter greens are in.\n\nWhen it comes to sowing, I veer more towards the creative, rather than scientific, approach. I've learned the hard way from trying to fit most of a packet of seeds into a couple of (small) containers, but still prefer to take the \"one for the air, one for the birds, one for the soil\" approach and sow generously in grooves made in the soil straight into the containers.\n\nOn my sheltered London balcony the soil is still warm enough at this time of year to encourage germination, as long as it's not let to dry out. But if you have enough windowsill space to sow indoors, and are in chillier climes, then do - just make sure to harden off seedlings when they get more established before shoving them out into the elements.\n\nThis winter, I\u2019m growing salad leaves. They\u2019re my favourite edible to grow in the summer, too, for the simple reason that they are what I eat the most of. I have learned the hard way that growing chard is futile - especially so in a small space - because it transpires I don\u2019t have much of an appetite for chard.\n\nPlus, winter leaves are peppery, dark little things that pack a lot of nutrition. They thrive in small spaces, are easy to germinate (I\u2019m still finding errant mustard cropping up in unexpected places two years after I originally sowed some) and are fuss-free. If you\u2019re impatient, you can eat them when they\u2019re small, and they\u2019ll come back again, forgivingly, within a few weeks.", "description": "There is a kilo of green tomatoes on my kitchen worktop.", "authors": ["Alice Vincent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2017/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000125685392-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oNfgDDmpqORuNWAz3-G8oxQ.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-04-13"}
