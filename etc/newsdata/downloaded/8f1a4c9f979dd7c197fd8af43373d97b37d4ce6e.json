Mr. S\u00e1nchez first became prime minister in June 2018, but he has been only an acting premier for much of this year. Spain\u2019s constitution requires a majority of lawmakers to approve a premier\u2019s appointment. Mr. S\u00e1nchez struggled to win support from far-left and centrist lawmakers. Throughout Europe, traditionally dominant center-left and center-right parties have lost many voters to upstart challengers, ranging from the anticapitalist far-left to the nativist far-right. Economic and migration crises of recent years have accelerated the trend. In Spain, the existence of strong regional nationalist parties further complicates the formation of parliamentary majorities. Since 2011, no national election in Spain has produced a conclusive result. There is little expectation that new elections will break the deadlock, roughly six months after previous votes produced a hung Parliament. Mr. S\u00e1nchez tried to form a government with the far-left party Unidas Podemos, but he wasn\u2019t willing to give the party as much influence as it wanted. The latest opinion polls suggest the Socialists and their traditional rival, the center-right People\u2019s Party, could both do somewhat better in new elections than they did in April, when they won 29% and 17% of votes, respectively. \u201cIt seems that the result will be very similar to the one of April\u2019s election, although it\u2019s difficult to make forecasts as a lot will depend on turnout,\u201d said Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Madrid\u2019s Carlos III University. Spain\u2019s economy has continued to grow solidly and recover from the eurozone financial crisis. Gross domestic product is projected to grow 2.1% this year, according to the European Union, higher than overall eurozone growth of 1.2%. However, the lack of a fully empowered government could take a toll eventually. \u201cIn the shorter term, I don\u2019t think it will have any impact. This is not to say that political inaction won\u2019t have a price,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, an economist at Oxford Economics. Spain needs to overhaul its pension system, labor market, education system and other areas, he said.
