It also accused the university of engaging in \"racial balancing\" in its process of admitting prospective students.\n\nThe suit argued that the admissions process' \"personal\" rating system favored African American, white and Latino applicants over Asian Americans.\n\nEdward Blum, a conservative lawyer with Students for Fair Admission who had led the challenge, said in a statement that the group would appeal the court's decision.\n\n\"We believe that the documents, emails, data analysis and depositions SFFA presented at trial compellingly revealed Harvard's systematic discrimination against Asian American applicants,\" Blum said. \"SFFA will appeal this decision to the First Court of Appeals and, if necessary, to the U.S Supreme Court.\"\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions had argued that Asian American applicants to Harvard were less likely to be admitted to the university than other minority groups despite scoring higher on several objective measures, Bloomberg News noted.\n\nHarvard has repeatedly denied the allegations , stating that it has not discriminated against applicants of any race or imposed racial quotas. The school has also asserted that Students for Fair Admissions was a \"litigation vehicle designed to further the ideological objectives of its founder, Edward Blum.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which filed an amicus brief supporting Harvard in the case, praised the decision.\n\n\"We are glad the court recognized this lawsuit for what it is: a vehicle for an anti-affirmative action agenda, not a righteous fight for equality,\u201d ReNika Moore, director of the ACLU's Racial Justice Project, said in a statement. \u201cHarvard's right to set its own institutional goals and consider all aspects of a prospective student's background \u2013 including race \u2013 is Constitutional and critical to becoming a more inclusive society. We stand with the court in embracing the right to advocate the value of your unique background, heritage, and perspective.\"", "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday handed Harvard University a major legal victory after ruling against a group of Asian American applicants who had sued the institution over claims they had been discriminated\u00a0against in the admissions process.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/harvard2_083018getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
