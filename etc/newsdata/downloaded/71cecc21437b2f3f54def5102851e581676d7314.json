Four years ago he won an accommodation to wear his turban and a beard while patrolling.\n\nFriends said Dhaliwal (DAH\u2019-lee-wahl), 42, was an example of how love-inspired service to others can tear down walls of distrust and misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cHe was just a gem of a person. He was a beautiful soul,\u201d Simran Jeet Singh said Saturday. \u201cEveryone who knew him admired him greatly.\u201d\n\nA 47-year-old man with an extensive criminal history has been charged with capital murder in his death. Robert Solis (soh-LEES\u2019) was denied bond at a hearing early Saturday.\n\nAuthorities have not said what might have been his motive and there has been no suggestion that it was a hate crime. Solis was wanted on a warrant for violating parole.\n\nThe killing came at a time when the U.S. has seen a string a mass shootings, including in El Paso and Odessa and Midland, Texas, prompting a fierce debate over easy access to guns.\n\nThe country also is riven over President Donald Trump\u2019s push for restrictions on immigration and efforts to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico.\n\nSome friends of Dhaliwal said his life showed how the presence of multiple cultures and faiths can enrich the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful message to send to the community that a man in a turban and beard is just as much American as you,\u201d said Singh, a senior religion fellow at the New York-based Sikh Coalition.\n\nEven so, Dhaliwal\u2019s primary motivation was the ability to live his faith, said his friend Manpreet Kaur Singh.\n\n\u201cWhen you wear your articles of faith, you\u2019re telling the world \u2018I stand up for injustice, for people and for the greater good,\u2019\u201d said Manpreet, an attorney and Sikh Coalition board member.\n\nSikhism, a monotheistic faith, was founded more than 500 years ago in the Indian region of Punjab and has roughly 27 million followers worldwide, most of them in India.\n\nThere are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the U.S. Male followers often cover their heads with turbans, which are considered sacred, and refrain from shaving their beards.\n\nSome were targets of anti-Islam violence following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though Sikhism is unrelated to Islam.\n\nAbout 7,000 to 10,000 live in the Gulf Coast Region of the U.S., according to the Houston Chronicle. More than a half-dozen Sikh temples can be found in the region.\n\nDhaliwal was a member of the Sikh National Center in Houston, said its chair, Hardam Azad.\n\nAzad said Dhaliwal often would speak with young people at the center, showing his sheriff\u2019s badge. A widely-shared video of Dhaliwal posted on the Facebook page of the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office showed him laughing as he allowed a boy to handcuff him and then unlock the handcuffs with the key.\n\n\u201cEver since 9/11 happened, a lot of hate crimes have occurred against the Sikhs,\u201d Azad said. \u201cThe way to counter that was exactly the kind of service Sandeep Dhaliwal provided to the larger community.\u201d\n\nPrior to Dhaliwal\u2019s hiring, Azad said the center had been in conversations with then-Sheriff Adrian Garcia to bring a Sikh onto the force.\n\nDhaliwal stepped up, he added.\n\n\u201cHis passion for public service was obvious to us all,\u201d Azad said. \u201cThere are some people who live angry lives. He was anything but angry.\u201d\n\nDhaliwal\u2019s father was a police officer in India before moving his family to the United States. The deputy said in a 2015 interview that \u201cserving in the police force is natural\u201d to Sikhs who value service.\n\n\u201cSikhs have been in this country for more than 100 years (but) we\u2019ve been absent from the national conversation,\u201d Singh said. \u201cOne of the values of serving in uniform gives us a sense as a community that we are being seen and are being understood.\u201d\n\nWhen Hurricane Harvey ravaged Houston, Dhaliwal joined others in the Sikh community to help feed those left homeless. Then when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, he traveled there to help.\n\n\u201cThere are just those people who come out passionate in the world, and you don\u2019t know what drives them,\u201d said his friend Manpreet. \u201cHe wanted to make sure he helped people. I had no idea what made him sacrifice his time.\u201d\n\nManpreet said Dhaliwal didn\u2019t fear being targeted because of his appearance but he did help ensure that Sikh places of worship were protected on Sundays by off-duty officers.\n\nShe said he also was deeply affected by the 2015 slaying of another deputy, Darren Goforth, who was shot and killed at a gas station while fueling his car. Dhaliwal \u201creally jumped in and helped with the vigil, helped put together the memorial,\u201d Manpreet said.\n\nDhaliwal leaves a wife and three children, as well as his father and sisters, Manpreet said. She said his mother died last year.\n\nShe said she has a picture of him taken the day the policy change allowed him to wear his turban.\n\n\u201cHe was so excited. I never had the foresight to see the possibility of him dying in the line of duty.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWilliams reported from Detroit and Webber from Chicago.
