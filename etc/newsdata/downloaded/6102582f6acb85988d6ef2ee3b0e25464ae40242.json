Despite some shakiness in the last five days, the index which contains 30 American blue chip stocks, has been outpacing the NASDAQ in the last month. The Dow has climbed 4% compared to the NASDAQ\u2019s 2% gain over the same time period.\n\nBearing this in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison tool to see how 3 of the index\u2019s tech stocks stack up against each other based on analyst consensus and upside potential.\n\nLet\u2019s get started.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nEven with Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT- Get Report) already impressive 35% year-to-date gain, some analysts believe the company is just getting started.\n\nIts Azure cloud gives MSFT the advantage over its competitors as it\u2019s the only cloud that extends to the edge, spanning identity, management and security. Azure is also the most open cloud, with the company expanding its partnerships with VMware (VMW), Oracle (ORCL) and Red Hat during Q4 2019.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Keith Weiss believes MSFT can achieve \u201cdurable double digit growth based on the expansive Azure opportunity\u201d. The five-star analyst also deems the company as the \u201cbest positioned name in tech for the emerging Hybrid Cloud architectures\u201d. This is evidenced by the commercial cloud segment\u2019s gross margin expansion to 63% in the most recent quarter.\n\nAdding to the good news, the company announced on September 19 that it was increasing its dividend by 11% to $0.51 per share and agreed to a maximum of $40 billion of buybacks. Its dividend yield is now at 1.48%.\n\nBased on all of the above factors, Weiss maintains his bullish thesis. On September 23, he reiterated his Buy rating and $155 price target, indicating 13% upside potential.\n\nThe rest of Wall Street mirrors the analyst\u2019s sentiment. With 22 Buy ratings compared to 1 Hold and 1 Sell, the word on the Street is that MSFT is a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019. Its $153 average price target suggests 12% upside potential.\n\nApple Inc.\n\nSome investors have expressed concerns that 5G won\u2019t be enough to revive Apple\u2019s (AAPL- Get Report) declining iPhone sales. However, several analysts believe that 5G as well as its new services are capable of driving even more gains on top of its 38% year-to-date growth.\n\nWhile iPhones aren\u2019t expected to be equipped with 5G capabilities until 2020, the new technology could drive substantial upside for AAPL. According to the consensus estimate, 5G iPhone sales could reach 190 million in 2021. That being said, Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy believes this figure should be much higher with his estimates putting sales at 208 million units. This prompted him to initiate coverage with a Buy and set a $260 price target on September 24. He thinks that shares could surge 19% in the next twelve months.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s recent gain has Wall Street taking notice.
