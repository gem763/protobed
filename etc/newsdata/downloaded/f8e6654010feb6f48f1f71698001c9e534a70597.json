And that could be a big problem for the London mayor.\n\nWhile ULEZ might be effectively increasing the health benefits of central London, the success is set to cost TfL \u00a326million in lost revenue\n\nA revised forecast sent to London mayor Sadiq Khan from operators said TfL income from ULEZ for 2019/20 is expected drop from \u00a377million to \u00a351million\n\nThere were 23,054 non-compliant vehicles and 60,844 compliant vehicles per day in July during Congestion Charge hours, compared with 35,578 and 55,457 respectively in March.\n\nThis meant that the overall number of vehicles detected each day in the zone fell from 91,035 to 83,899.\n\nThe early success of ULEZ is now set to translate to millions of pounds in lost income than was originally projected by TfL ahead of the zone being introduced.\n\nPredicted income from ULEZ for the financial year has been cut by \u00a326million ,or 34 per cent, according to a report issued to the TfL board.\n\nULEZ was launched on 1 April 2019 and charges polluting vehicles \u00a312.50 a day for entering into the existing Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ)\n\nMr Khan said: \u2018The figures prove that the ULEZ continues to have a significant impact with 12,500 fewer older, polluting vehicles now coming into the zone compared with March.\n\n\u2018These older vehicles send harmful emissions into our air and lungs and I will continue to take bold action to protect Londoners from this invisible killer.\n\n'It is highly encouraging to see that so many motorists and businesses are helping reduce pollution by driving cleaner vehicles into the zone.\u2019\n\nTory mayoral rival Shaun Bailey said the proceeds from ULEZ earnings should be 'ring fenced for air quality schemes' that benefit Londoners.\n\nMr Bailey added that he would use the revenue to fund a new all-electric bus fleet out of the proceeds.\n\n'The best way to clean up our capital\u2019s air quality is to remove the dirty diesel buses emitting their fumes all over the city,' he said.", "description": "ULEZ has\u00a0reduced the number of polluting vehicles in central London by a third - but as a direct result projected income from the scheme could fall by as much, down from \u00a377m to \u00a351m for the year.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
