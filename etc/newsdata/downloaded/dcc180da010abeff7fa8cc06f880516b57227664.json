Chris Murphy. He claimed that Ukrainian president Zelensky personally told him Trump pressured him to investigate Biden.\n\nThis per the Free Beacon.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), who traveled to Ukraine in early September, told reporters this week that he had heard \u201cdirectly\u201d from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that Zelensky felt pressured by Trump to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with Ukrainian gas giant Burisma\u2026 \u2026The senator said Monday that the \u201centire new Ukrainian administration\u201d including Zelensky told him they believed the United States withheld aid due to his \u201cunwillingness to investigate the Bidens.\u201d \u201cOnce I got on the ground there, I heard about how confused the entire new Ukrainian administration was about the nature of these demands they were getting from the Trump administration to conduct this political investigation, and that they worry that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens,\u201d Murphy said, adding that the concern was relayed to him \u201cfrom the president directly.\u201d\n\nThis was bandied about early this week as proof that Trump had broken the law and applied immense pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. Eventually, we\u2019d get the transcript and learn that it was a completely mundane conversation with no pressure or threats applied. Actually, it was surprising just how nonchalant Trump was about Biden. He didn\u2019t press the issue at all and Ukraine wasn\u2019t even aware of any holdup with the military aid.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth nothing that Murphy\u2019s claims of what Zelensky told him were back-filled, as in they only appeared later. He originally made no mention of any such conversation with Zelensky about aid and Biden. Instead, he only took to the press to make his claims after the whistle-blower story broke. It was way, way too convenient. Then the Beacon got a hold of the Sept. 11th audio, where Murphy is shown to have not mentioned any of this.\n\nNow, apparently realizing he\u2019s been caught in a lie, Murphy is running to change his story.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy: \"In my meeting\u2026Zelensky did not make any connection between the aid that had been cut off & the requests that he was getting from Giuliani but the Ukrainian govt certainly thru multiple channels was expressing their confusion about who they should listen to.\" pic.twitter.com/Wa2eLo8UXR \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) September 27, 2019\n\nOops. That\u2019s pretty for removed from \u201cthey thought aid was being withheld because of Biden\u201d isn\u2019t it? Far removed might be an understatement. It\u2019s not even close to the same thing.\n\nAnd just like that, another plank in all this nonsense collapses. Will any media outlet call out Murphy for lying? Of course they won\u2019t, but I\u2019m not sure it matters anymore. There are plenty of alternative forms of media that are doing great work on this story and the news is getting out there. CNN and The New York Times can keep playing patty cake.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
