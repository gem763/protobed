One group called on police to start cracking down against such behavior.\n\nThe Asian news outlet Coconuts reported that several posts expressed concern over a viral trend in which men wear a hijab (veil) and niqab (face cover) to conceal their identity as they enter areas and situations typically reserved for Muslim women, including female bathrooms and women\u2019s section at mosques.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem at all with the cross-dressers as long as they\u2019re not from my family,\u201d wrote on Twitter user. \u201cBut if they enter women-only locations, especially in the mosque, if the real women touch the cross-dresser then their wudhu (Islamic prayer) becomes invalid and they won\u2019t even know it. Do what you please but not at the expense of others.\u201d\n\nThe General Secretariat of Muhammadiyah, Indonesia\u2019s largest non-governmental Islamic organization, told reporters yesterday that such men should be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cIf there is a deliberate attempt to cause public unrest, then they can be processed legally,\u201d Muhammadiyah General Secretary Abdul Mu\u2019ti told reporters yesterday.\n\n\u201cIf they are a group suffering from psychological deviation, then they must be counseled. If they are men who deliberately dress like women with face veils, then that is unacceptable,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the solution remains that they must be given religious counseling.\u201d\n\nLast week, the feminist publication Magdalene published a feature article with various \u201ccrosshijabers\u201d in Indonesia to help gain an insight into their motivations. The article, titled, \u201cCrosshijaber: I\u2019m a man, I\u2019m heterosexual, and I wear the hijab,\u201d features one interviewee who explained that he appreciates the loose-fitting garment\u2019s design of the hijab, which allows him to more easily conceal his masculine traits.\n\nIn a range of interviews, the men also detail the various online communities and chat groups used by \u201ccrosshijabers,\u201d who share the mutual challenges they face, as well as the potential criminal and social ramifications of their behavior.\n\nDespite being officially pluralist, Indonesia is home to 225 million Muslims, making it the largest Islamic country in the world. The country\u2019s government also broadly adheres to Islamic law, leading to increasingly stringent blasphemy laws, with a rapidly growing trend towards strict interpretation and the violation of other people\u2019s religious freedoms.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com", "description": "Islamic organizations in Indonesia voiced their concern this weekend over a group of cross-dressing Muslim men wearing female attire.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1157211476-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
