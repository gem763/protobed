There\u2019s a big difference between commentators and news and we have blended those so that there is no difference anymore and we\u2019ve got to go back where those are separate.\u201d Huckabee Sanders then admitted that her current focus is on helping Trump win reelection in 2020.\n\nCheck out the segment here:\n\nTwitter users reminded Huckabee Sanders of her own flaky relationship with the truth. They also suggested that, without opinion, there would be no Fox News, given how the widely watched network\u2019s prime time hosts including Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson regularly use their shows to stump for the Trump administration.\n\nWho\u2019s gonna tell her? \u2014 Betty Nataro (@bnataro) September 18, 2019\n\nFox is literally sate run tv that lies daily which is even worse than biased news. \u2014 Will (@willy_mcdilly) September 18, 2019\n\nWell, she\u2019s out of a job \u2014 Natalie (@njdqb) September 18, 2019\n\nWe all do, but coming from her is ironic, hypocritical hogwash. \u2014 WomenRisingStrong (@drekatnbee) September 18, 2019\n\nGreat idea. But you do know, dontcha Sarah, that THAT would be a big old chokehold on YOUR current employer...\n\n\n\nDidja realize that, dear? pic.twitter.com/hnRffHFQWJ \u2014 Almost Jane \ud83c\udd98\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc3e (@almost_jane) September 18, 2019\n\nFox would collapse \u2014 C.

Let\u2019s take opinions out of the news and along with it, let\u2019s take out all lying as well.\n\nIf that would happen Sarah, you wouldn\u2019t have a job! \u2014 Linda Beckermann (@BeckermannLinda) September 19, 2019\n\nThere goes Fox News then. They admit they're opinion shows.\n\n\n\nAlternative news is opinion. \u2014 Things of Beauty \ud83d\udd2e (@DracoThings) September 19, 2019", "description": "The irony of the former White House press secretary\u2019s demand did not go unnoticed.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8341e02400002e2a7e24e2.jpeg?cache=4idujn1fbz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
