Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., actually entered not just the non-secure anteroom and hallways of the Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF), but the secure room where Cooper was to be deposed.\n\nThat\u2019s where members are not supposed to have electronic devices. Members are asked to agree to an oath that they will not do so. The facility was swept for electronic devices after member gave up their devices.\n\nIt appeared one member didn't surrender their device, prompting a deeper scrub that took around two hours.\n\nThe standoff occurred after lawmakers held a news conference accusing Democrats of lacking transparency and specifically calling out Schiff, who is leading the impeachment investigation into President Trump.\n\nFrom there, the House Republicans stormed in the room where Cooper, who has overseen Ukraine policy at the Pentagon, was set to testify.\n\nREPUBLICAN 2020 CANDIDATE SLAMS 'OUT OF CONTROL' TRUMP AFTER HIS ATTACK ON GOP CRITICS\n\nThere was never any threat of arrest, but a source said some members asked to be arrested, citing the optics of being marched out of the SCIF in handcuffs in front of throngs of reporters and news cameras. That would have surely supported a running GOP narrative that Democrats have run amok with the impeachment process.\n\nThe Republicans in the room were not rowdy, though their presence in a secure facility, in the middle of House panel business of which they are not members, still ruffled some feathers.\n\nHowever, there wasn't much security officials could do, one congressional source told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re members. They\u2019re expected to adhere to the rules. There\u2019s no real punishment for breaking the rules,\u201d said the source.\n\nSchiff decided to wait the Republicans out, knowing there was a mid-afternoon vote on the House floor. The Republicans left and the deposition finished around 3:15 p.m.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., sent a letter to Irving, raising \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the security of SCIF\u2019s. He asked Irving to \u201ctake action with respect to the Members involved in the breach.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe members who violated the rules of the SCIF could be referred to the House Ethics Committee, one source told Fox News.\n\n\u201cWe made our point,\u201d said one Republican who asked not to be identified.", "description": "Fox News has put together a tic-toc of how things went down today in the House Intelligence Committee when 25-30 House Republicans barged in to attend the closed-door deposition of Pentagon official Laura Cooper.", "authors": ["Chad Pergram"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19296659642403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
