Harris is founding editor of POLITICO and author of \"The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House.\"\n\nSo it looks like this might really be about to happen\u2026.\n\nA week ago, the idea of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump was something that the most hotly combative Democrats wanted but the most coolly calculating Democrats did not. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, previously the lead voice of the skeptics, on Tuesday announced her about-face.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPelosi's appraisal is partly about new facts relating to Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, partly about understanding the shifting politics of her own caucus, partly about her own gag-reflex and just how much of Trump\u2019s defiance of Congress she can tolerate.\n\nPelosi, who had already been in Congress for 11 years at the time of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment, well knows the nature of the process. For all the constitutional trappings, it is a political exercise, not a criminal one. Facts, and law, are important but secondary questions. Inevitably another question is primary: Which side are you on?\n\nFundamentally, Pelosi's calculations, and those of other Democratic leaders, are about a reading of history: an assessment that, when it comes to choosing up sides on the question of Trump\u2019s fitness for office, the country right now is more like 1974 than 1998.\n\nIn the first instance, Democrats used the threat of inevitable impeachment to force a Republican president from office, reaping large political rewards for doing so. By the end of the Watergate scandal even GOP partisans were excoriating Richard Nixon\u2019s abuses of power.\n\nIn the second instance, Republicans 21 years ago calculated that the solemn ritual of the impeachment process would create its own momentum to force Clinton from office, even though a clear majority of the public did not want this. As it happened, the primary sponsor of the Republican strategy, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, was soon forced out; a president who two years earlier did not break 50 percent in his re-election was easily acquitted in a Senate trial while enjoying approval ratings in the low 70s.\n\nThis is not 1974. The tribal instincts that drive which-side-are-you-on politics were in their nascent stages in the 1990s, and now shadow virtually every interaction of contemporary politics.\n\nThis speaker can not possibly believe that a careful and judicious impeachment inquiry exposing wrongdoing by Trump is going to cause many House Republicans, or Senate Republicans if a successful impeachment leads to a trial, to say: Hate to say it, but the evidence here is pretty convincing.\n\nIt is at least conceivable that a parade of new evidence, or newly packaged evidence, could finally force self-protective Republicans in the midst of an election year to speak to this most transactional president in language he would not appreciate but would understand: Sorry, man, just business, but either you go on your own or we will push you. This was what happened in 1974, when in the end it was a delegation of Senate Republicans visiting the Oval Office that led Nixon to walk the plank.\n\nMore likely (at the moment, much more likely) is that a mostly party-line impeachment vote in the House would be followed by a party-line vote in the Senate, in which Republicans would have to carry their defense of what Democrats call indefensible into an election year.\n\nBy these lights, the allegation that Trump was using the presidency and the leverage of military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate the activities of Joe Biden\u2019s son represents such a clear abuse of office that GOP candidates will pay a terrible price for letting the Republican Party become indistinguishable from the pro-Trump party.\n\nEven when Republican loyalists eventually abandoned Nixon, the party was drubbed a few months after his August resignation in the 1974 elections\u2014sending a wave of young liberals to positions of power that in some cases they occupied for a generation. The backlash was strong enough to help lift Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford in 1976.\n\nBut, as Pelosi well knows, the politics of which-side-are-you-on are not always predictable. Gingrich in 1998 calculated that once the public was confronted with the seamy details of Clinton\u2019s affair with young White House aide Monica S. Lewinsky, and the lies he told to the public and in judicial testimony to conceal his behavior, a wave of public revulsion would swell. In support of this goal, he pushed for a full public release of prosecutor Kenneth Starr\u2019s report on his investigation, filled with pornographic detail on cigars and Oval Office fellatio.\n\nRevulsion did indeed swell, but it was against Gingrich and Republicans. Unwittingly, they had helped Clinton and his defense team frame the which-side-are-you-on question. The central issue was no longer whether people approved of a presidential affair or misleading people about it, but whether voters found Clinton or Gingrich the more appealing figure. Jay Leno joked that Clinton was doing so well in the polls \u201che is already planning his next sex scandal.\u201d\n\nIt was precisely this fear of backlash\u2014that an attempt to oust Trump by a constitutional process might actually end up making him stronger, and enhance his chances for re-election in 2020\u2014that was previously causing Pelosi and like-minded allies to go slow on impeachment.\n\nThe Trump scandals, of course, are different in kind than the Clinton scandals in critical ways. Most importantly, the allegations Pelosi is most intent in pursuing involve official duties, including allegedly mixing foreign policy with his own political interests. What\u2019s more, Clinton\u2019s standing with the public varied widely depending on the circumstances. Reflecting the tribal nature of his appeal, the ceiling and the floor on Trump\u2019s support are rarely more than a few percentage points apart.\n\nEven so, there is some continuity. The very foundation of Trump\u2019s support, which carried him to power and has remained constant with supporters from such controversies as the \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d tape in October 2016 to a parade of resignations and indictments of top aides ensnared in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, revolves around his ability to prosper by posing the old, familiar question to his most loyal supporters: Which side are you on?", "description": "Nancy Pelosi cast aside her caution and went for the I-word on Tuesday.
