If you don't eat pork, ground chicken or turkey will work well in its place. Making the toasted rice powder is a little fussy, but it gives the dish an authentic nutty flavor and crunch. That said, if you skip it, it will still be delicious. If you have the time, top this dish with crispy shallots: It takes the whole thing to the next level, as does a flurry of chive blossoms when in season. Serve this spicy dish with sticky rice, and grilled or roasted wedges of cabbage squeezed with lime, but for a low-key weeknight, plain white rice and lettuce leaves work just as well.", "description": "In this take on the classic Thai dish larb moo, ground pork is pan-cooked, then stirred together with a combination of funky fish sauce, fresh and dried chiles, shallots, lime juice and an abundance of fresh herbs for brightness If you don't eat pork, ground chicken or turkey will work well in its place Making the toasted rice powder is a little fussy, but it gives the dish an authentic nutty flavor and crunch", "authors": ["Colu Henry", "Mark Bittman", "Julia Moskin", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Samin Nosrat", "Sam Sifton", "Clare De Boer", "David Tanis", "Alison Roman", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/pork-larb-horizontal/pork-larb-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-11"}
