Manchester City pipped Liverpool by two points to win their second Premier League title and Liverpool went on the slide, finishing sixth the following season.\n\nRodgers was sacked in Oct 2015 and a few days later Klopp arrived to begin a journey that, while yet to deliver the Holy Grail of a Premier League title, took Liverpool to last season\u2019s Champions League title, beating Tottenham Hotspur in the final.\n\nRodgers, meanwhile, mopped up two Scottish Premiership (SPL) titles and numerous other silverware at Celtic \u2014 a feat some might suggest was no more challenging than shooting fish in a bath tub.\n\nIn February this year, with a third SPL title almost in the bag, Rodgers quit to take over at Leicester in the wake of Claude Puel\u2019s sacking and they have thrived ever since.\n\nSince his first weekend in charge in March, Leicester have amassed 31 Premier League points \u2014 a total beaten only by Liverpool (49) and Manchester City (46).\n\nLiverpool have won their opening seven league games of the season but there has been the odd blemish of late.\n\nKlopp\u2019s side were forced to hang on for a 1-0 win over Sheffield United last weekend and in midweek surrendered a 3-0 lead at home to Salzburg in the Champions League before winning 4-3.\n\nAfter a 5-0 hammering of Newcastle United last weekend, a vibrant Leicester side look the most likely to gatecrash the top four and will potentially offer Liverpool their toughest test of the domestic season so far.\n\nWinger Marc Albrighton, part of the Leicester fairytale in 2016 when they won the Premier League under Claudio Ranieri, believes the current side is better than that one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a different team now, we\u2019ve got different qualities, but we\u2019re a force going forward, we\u2019re exciting to watch and it\u2019s great to be a part of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBack then, we had one way of playing, that\u2019s all we knew.\u201d\n\nThere will be plenty of attention also on sixth-placed Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday when they travel to Brighton and Hove Albion still reeling from a 7-2 hammering by Bayern Munich on Tuesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Football - Liverpool v Aston Villa - Barclays Premier League - Anfield\n\nIt was manager Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s worst result in charge of Tottenham and added weight to the argument that the Argentine\u2019s project in north London may have stalled.\n\nHe has faced some massive games in his five seasons in charge but, after a club-record home defeat, none have felt bigger than Saturday\u2019s tricky trip to the Sussex coast.\n\nManchester United, currently 10th, are at Newcastle on Sunday while Chelsea travel to Southampton and fourth-placed Arsenal welcome Bournemouth.", "description": "But for a Steven Gerrard stumble five-and-a-half-years ago against Chelsea, Brendan Rodgers might well be idolised by the Liverpool faithful and Juergen Klopp's love affair with an adoring Kop may have never got started.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436603487&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920R6"}
