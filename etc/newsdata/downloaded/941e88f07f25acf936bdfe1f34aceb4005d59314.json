That\u2019s the nature of me, that\u2019s who I am.\n\nJason Roy was also given a Test chance on the back of white-ball form (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I want to work hard in the time that I\u2019ve got and hopefully impress enough to be in contention come South Africa.\u2019\n\nDespite revealing his disappointment at being dropped, Bairstow says the time away from England\u2019s Test squad presents him with a chance to work on his game.\n\nHe added: \u2018I\u2019ve got an opportunity to go away and just work on a few things which, with the scheduling and playing all three formats over the last four or five years, has been pretty tough to do.\n\nBairstow is determined to reclaim his place in the Test side (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I think the last time I got the chance to do that was probably 2015. To refresh and refocus, I think, is an important thing to be able to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m excited about being able to have a little period of time to be able to work on my own things and not necessarily think about it being watched on telly or have it being stripped down to say he\u2019s doing this or that.\n\n\u2018We all know it\u2019s quite easy to stop recordings in certain frames in order to say it\u2019s X, Y or Z. I know what I need to do and I\u2019m excited about what I need to work on.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t mind [whether I keep or play as a specialist batsman]. I just want to return to the squad to try and get back in the side.\n\n\u2018Hopefully an opportunity arises and hopefully I\u2019ll be able to take that when it does.\u2019\n\nEngland\u2019s first T20 match against New Zealand takes place in Christchurch on November 1.
