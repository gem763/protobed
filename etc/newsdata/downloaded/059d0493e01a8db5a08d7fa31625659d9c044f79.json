Last year, Richard Eyre urged for more funds to be pumped into this crucial part of the theatre industry. A few months ago, David Greig \u2013 artistic director of the Lyceum, Edinburgh \u2013 told me the sector was on a knife-edge.\n\nTake a step back, though and, despite the evident cause for concern, there are remarkable grounds for celebration. In artistic terms, the decade is ending on a high. Whether it\u2019s at Bristol, Chichester, Northampton, Nottingham, Manchester or Sheffield, exceptional work is being routinely done: the former\u2019s Touching the Void transfers to the West End next month; the latter\u2019s spellbinding The Life of Pi will do so next year. But there\u2019s also an abundance of shows that warrant a trip to see them in situ.\n\nWhat was once the West Yorkshire Playhouse \u2013 and got rebranded Leeds Playhouse last year \u2013 has now just fully reopened following a \u00a315.8m capital redevelopment, enabling it to join the regional premier league after a decade of fitful achievement.\n\nThe name-change says a lot \u2013 it often felt as though the identity of the WYP was too blurredly regional; and the ambitious architectural rejig brings home who the place is for.
