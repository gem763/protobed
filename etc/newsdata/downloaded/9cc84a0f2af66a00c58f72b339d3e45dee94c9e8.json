Trump called their conversation \"perfect.\"\n\nStarr, who was on \"Cavuto Live,\" predicted that the impeachment inquiry is doomed to fail given what we know.\n\n\"This will not result in a conviction, so why are we on the impeachment train, we should be on the oversight train and quit calling it impeachment,\" he said.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTwo decades ago, Starr presented a report to Congress that that led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment by the House on accusations the former president lied under oath and obstructed justice. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Ken Starr, the former independent counsel who spearheaded the 1990s investigation into President Clinton, told Fox News on Saturday that he was troubled by President Trump's alleged use of the word \u201creciprocity\u201d in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
