She said he made sexual advances towards her and asked her and another female actor to kiss, among other disturbing allegations.\n\nWeinstein will face trial early next year on two charges of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act and two counts of rape.\n\nDelevingne has been open about her sexuality since at least 2015. Following her prolific career in the fashion industry, she broke into acting, and rose to Hollywood stardom in 2016 with her role in the blockbuster superhero film \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201d\n\nIn the Porter interview, Delevingne also opened up about her current relationship with \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d actor Ashley Benson, saying it was the first time she\u2019d \u201ctruly\u201d let someone in. \u201cShe\u2019s the first person that has said: \u2018You can\u2019t push me away. I\u2019m going to be nice to you, I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe two endured a long-distance relationship while Delevingne spent seven months in Prague shooting for her newest role starring alongside Orlando Bloom in the Amazon Prime series \u201cCarnival Row,\u201d which premiered in August.\n\nDespite, undoubtedly, enjoying the satisfaction of proving Weinstein wrong about her career, the actor said her acting career has, if anything, made her realize \u201cthat I really have no idea who the fuck I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to so many dinners where people are like, \u2018So, what are you? L, G, B, T, Q?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Guys, really? This is what we\u2019re talking about?\u2019 I change every day,\u201d she said.", "description": "The model-turned-actor said the disgraced Hollywood mogul told her she'd \"never make it\" in Hollywood as a gay woman.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ed9a93b0000039fd45909.jpeg?cache=eahihg9gma&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
