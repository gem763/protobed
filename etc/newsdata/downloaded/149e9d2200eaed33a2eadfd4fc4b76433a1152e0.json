The announcement comes just a couple of days after Polygon reported that Ghibli films weren\u2019t going to be made available on any streaming platform. GKids, the company that distributes Studio Ghibli movies in North America, noted that Studio Ghibli \u201cdoes not make their films available digitally, whether for download or streaming, anywhere in the world.\u201d Prior to today\u2019s announcement, Studio Ghibli movies were only available to purchase on DVD or Blu-ray, or through periodic theatrical revivals.\n\n\u201cThey continue to believe that presentation is vital and particularly appreciate opportunities for audiences to experience the films together in a theatrical setting,\u201d a representative told Polygon.\n\nThat\u2019s obviously changed. Koji Hoshino, chairman of Studio Ghibli, said in a press release that HBO Max is an \u201cideal home for our films\u201d because it\u2019s a home for premium content.\n\n\u201cUpon launch of the service this spring, existing Ghibli fans will be able enjoy their favorites and delve deeper into the library, while whole new audiences will be able to discover our films for the first time,\u201d Hoshino said.\n\nSecuring the rights to Studio Ghibli films is a massive deal for HBO Max. WarnerMedia has spent a substantial amount on securing the rights to other important properties, including Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and The West Wing. Having some of the most adored anime titles on its streaming service, and being the only place for fans to stream the films, is also important for building its roster of family-friendly content. HBO Max is also the exclusive home for new Sesame Street episodes (which will still eventually end up on PBS through a previous deal).\n\nAside from some major content deals, not much else is known about HBO Max. There\u2019s currently no price or launch date confirmed, although rumors suggest it will be priced between $15 and $17 a month. That makes it one of the most expensive streaming services, especially compared to Disney+ at $6.99 a month and Apple TV Plus at $4.99 a month. Asking for $16 or $17 a month is a lot, which makes exclusivity deals like this key to building perceived value. HBO Max is expected to launch in April 2020.\n\nThe entire list of Ghibli movies coming to HBO Max includes:\n\nCastle in the Sky\n\nThe Cat Returns\n\nFrom Up On Poppy Hill\n\nHowl\u2019s Moving Castle\n\nKiki\u2019s Delivery Service\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro\n\nMy Neighbors the Yamadas\n\nNausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\n\nOcean Waves\n\nOnly Yesterday\n\nPom Poko\n\nPonyo\n\nPorco Rosso\n\nPrincess Mononoke\n\nThe Secret World of Arrietty\n\nSpirited Away\n\nThe Tale of The Princess Kaguya\n\nTales From Earthsea\n\nWhen Marnie Was There\n\nWhisper of the Heart\n\nThe Wind Rises", "description": "The entire Studio Ghibli catalog, including award-winning and beloved titles like My Neighbor Totoro, Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service, and Spirited Away will stream exclusively on HBO Max beginning in 2020.
