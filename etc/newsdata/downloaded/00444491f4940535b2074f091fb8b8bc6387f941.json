(Reuters) - A Chinese national arrested for bluffing her way onto U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort went on trial acting as her own attorney on Monday, telling jurors in her brief opening statement, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago club, where U.S. President Donald Trump is spending Easter weekend, in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 21, 2019. REUTERS/Al Drago\n\nThe defendant, Yujing Zhang, 33, appeared before U.S. District Judge Roy Altman and a 12-member jury in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom on charges of making false statements to a federal officer and trespassing on restricted property.\n\nZhang - whose arrest at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach in March while carrying multiple electronic devices sparked a probe as to whether she posed an intelligence threat - faces up to six years in federal prison if convicted.\n\nHer unorthodox decision to serve as her own trial lawyer, while a public defender stood by only to advise her, clearly rankled the judge and slowed the pace of the proceedings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here ... I think the trial has been canceled,\u201d Zhang said at one point through her translator, prompting a sharp retort from Altman.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re unprepared,\u201d the judge answered. \u201cThe trial is going to get very sophisticated very quickly ... I strongly recommend (the public defender) step in as your lawyer today.\u201d\n\nWhen the time came for opening statements, Zhang rose from her seat and said simply: \u201cGood afternoon, judge ... jury. What I want to say is I don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong and I want to say thank you.\u201d\n\n\u2018EXTREMELY SAVVY\u2019\n\nIn his own opening, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin offered no motive or explanation for Zhang\u2019s Mar-a-Lago visit, but told jurors she had lied to gain entry to the resort.\n\n\u201cShe is very proficient in English. She is extremely educated, very sharp, and extremely savvy,\u201d Sherwin told jurors, adding that the club\u2019s receptionist remembered her as being \u201cextremely calm, cool and collected.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sherwin and testimony by two U.S. Secret Service agents, Zhang got through an initial Secret Service checkpoint by letting club security personnel believe she was related to an actual club member of the same name.\n\nOnce on the grounds, her behavior, including the taking of a lot of photographs, aroused suspicion, and she was taken into custody, Sherwin and prosecution witnesses said.\n\nDuring jury selection earlier in the day, the urged potential panelists to set aside their politics from the facts of the case.\n\n\u201cWhether you like President Trump or don\u2019t like President Trump, whether you like Mar-a-Lago or think it should be blown up, or something in between\u201d has nothing to do with the trial, Altman said.\n\nAt the time of Zhang\u2019s arrest, in an incident that raised concerns about resort security, investigators found in Zhang\u2019s possession four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive device and a thumb drive, the Secret Service said in a court filing. Initial examination of the thumb drive determined it contained \u201cmalicious malware,\u201d the Secret Service said.\n\nAfter the trove of electronics was found on Zhang, a search of her Palm Beach hotel room reportedly uncovered a device meant to detect hidden cameras and nearly $8,000 in cash.", "description": "A Chinese national arrested for bluffing her way onto U.S. President Donald Trump's Florida resort went on trial acting as her own attorney on Monday, telling jurors in her brief opening statement, \"I don't believe I did anything wrong.\"", "authors": ["Erik Bojnansky", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428145326&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8811O", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
