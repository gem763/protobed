Dan Bishop, an ally of President Trump, over Democrat Dan McCready, an entrepreneur who narrowly lost the 2018 vote in the district that was later thrown out over allegations of voter fraud by the GOP campaign. Mr. Bishop, who didn\u2019t run in 2018, won 51% of the vote in the do-over race, according to unofficial results from the state elections board.\n\nAs Democrats prepare to defend the House majority they wrested from Republicans last year, the special election offered a potential preview of the 2020 race for control of Congress and the White House. Mr. McCready, who positioned himself as a political moderate, racked up big margins in Charlotte and its suburbs, while Mr. Bishop aligned himself with Mr. Trump and turned out voters in the rest of the district.\n\nTrump campaign officials dismissed the suggestion that the narrow victory spelled trouble for the president in 2020, and said their strategy of tying Mr. McCready to socialism turned voters against him.\n\nStill, the tight race in a district that both Mr. Trump and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried by 12 points is a sign that winning a net 18 seats to take the House majority could be difficult for Republicans next year.\n\nIn addition, there are 35 GOP-held House seats that are less favorable to Republicans than the North Carolina district that voted Tuesday, said David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nBut there were troubling signs for Democrats, too. Republicans have continued to coalesce support in rural and exurban areas. Mr. Bishop outperformed 2018 GOP candidate Mark Harris in every county except Mecklenburg, where Charlotte is located, according to an analysis of unofficial results by the Bishop campaign.\n\nMr. McCready\u2019s margin of victory in rural Robeson County, which has a large black and Native American population and more registered Democrats than Republicans, fell from 15.3% in 2018 to 1.1% on Tuesday. Democrats will need to turn out minority voters in 2020 in order to keep House districts and win the presidential race.\n\nStill, turnout is often low in special elections, so they aren\u2019t always predictive of what will happen in a presidential-election year. And Mr. Bishop may have performed well in Robeson County because of his support as a state lawmaker for programs and initiatives for the Lumbee tribe, members of whom are concentrated in the area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely confident that you will see an intense level of turnout among African-Americans in 2020 with Donald Trump at the top of the ballot,\u201d said Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.).\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s campaign on Wednesday took credit for Mr. Bishop\u2019s win, citing the president\u2019s involvement, including a rally Monday in Fayetteville at which he brought the candidate on stage, as well as fundraising efforts and mobilization of Republican National Committee staff. Vice President Mike Pence also campaigned in the district on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that he is the congressman-elect this morning because of the personal efforts of President Trump,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a conference call with reporters.\n\n\u2014Valerie Bauerlein and Alex Leary contributed to this article.", "description": "Both political parties found something to brag about after North Carolina\u2019s special election, as Republicans celebrated victory in a longtime GOP district and Democrats took the tight race as a sign they could hold the House in 2020.", "authors": ["Natalie Andrews", "Natalie.Andrews Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106327/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
