Then he found a bullet in his leg.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nJacob Mitich was shot in August of 2018 while competing at a Madden NFL tournament. Two other competitors were killed in the shooting. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)\n\nFinally, eight months after the tragedy and trauma, Jacob Mitich had cobbled together something close to a normal college life. Then he felt a sharp pain.\n\nHe was walking around Towson University\u2019s campus in April when it happened. He went to the hospital and a nurse became startled as she looked at his X-rays. There was a bullet in his leg.\n\n\u201cThat brought all the memories back,\u201d Mitich said. \u201cAll of it.\u201d\n\nOn August 26, 2018, Mitich was among a dozen wounded when David Katz, 24, opened fire after losing a Madden NFL tournament game in Jacksonville, Fla. Two tournament contestants were killed: Eli Clayton, 22, and Taylor Robertson, 28 \u2014 with whom Mitich had gone out the night before. Katz, who had psychiatric issues since childhood yet purchased the gun legally, killed himself.\n\nA year later, time has healed in some ways but stung in many others. There have been more mass shootings, more national mourning, and even politicians who have blamed video games for the seemingly relentless evil.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing Madden,\u201d said Mitich, 24. \u201cIt\u2019s a sports game. How is tackling someone on a virtual field leading to shooting people?\u201d\n\n[From 2018: \u2018He was just very quiet\u2019: Gamers say the Jacksonville gunman stood apart from their tightknit crowd]\n\nYet the shooting has caused a fissure between Mitich and the pursuit he once loved.\n\n\u201cSince August 26 of last year, I haven\u2019t picked up a controller,\u201d he said. \u201cFor my mental state, and my well-being, I need to focus on my senior year in school.\n\n\"When I look at the Xbox or the controller, I can\u2019t play. The day I got back [from Jacksonville], I turned the Xbox on, and just the loading screen, the sight of \u2018EA Sports\u2019 \u2014 I turned it off.\u201d\n\nTurning off the lingering hurt and anger is not as easy, and Mitich clearly recalls the details of the day everything changed.\n\n\n\nMitich is focused on completing his degree at Towson University, commuting from his home in Fallston where he lives with his dad and step-mom. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)\n\nTravis Scott\u2019s new album was playing in his headphones when his life nearly ended. It was a Saturday afternoon \u2014 the second day of a Madden NFL tournament at a place in Jacksonville called Chicago Pizza. Mitich won his first game and his second opponent had just turned the ball over. That\u2019s when he heard what he thought was a balloon popping.\n\n\u201cI run out,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I was shot. I thought my side was cramping. Some kid from the tournament \u2014 I don\u2019t remember his name \u2014 says, \u2018Dude, you\u2019re shot.\u2019\u201d\n\nMitich remembers how Katz wore sunglasses that day, and he still gets anxious when he sees anyone wearing sunglasses indoors. He also locates the exit as he enters a movie theater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sense of being paranoid all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cSounds ridiculous.\u201d\n\n[From February: With tighter security, Madden scene looks to move on from Jacksonville]\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound ridiculous at all to his dad, Jim, who has tried to lend support whenever memories of the shooting return.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t get it out of his mind,\u201d Jim said. \u201cHe has extreme survivor\u2019s guilt regarding his friend Taylor, who had so much to live for with a new baby. He seems very sad and down a considerable portion of his days and nights.\u201d\n\nJacob has considered therapy but hasn\u2019t gone.\n\n\u201cI have the personality where I hold it all in,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day every two or three months, I\u2019ll say something to my dad or my brother. There\u2019s a mass shooting every other day. I\u2019m not going to a therapist, having someone tell me how I should feel when they don\u2019t know. For me personally \u2026 it\u2019s hard for me.\u201d\n\nMitich is among the shooting victims who are suing EA Sports for damages. He believes there were many steps the company didn\u2019t take, including alerting the city of Jacksonville about the tournament, and only hiring one security guard for the event. Katz carried the gun into the game room in a backpack.\n\nThe suit not only asks for a jury to award Mitich compensation, but also seeks an injunction against Electronic Arts, ordering the company to revisit its policies and ensure stronger security is in place place at future tournaments. Mitich is demanding Electronic Arts be ordered to \u201ccoordinate with local law enforcement during tournaments\u201d and \u201cfully vet and inspect the venues in which it hosts tournaments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent in the belief in my mind,\u201d Mitich said, \u201cthat if they cared enough about us, this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nEA, which contributed $1 million to the victims, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMitich has no issue with friends who still compete. He texts them when they play well. He shares their joy. But he doesn\u2019t miss it.Ma\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s in my best interest not to play,\u201d he says. \u201cThe company [EA] is still taking advantage of us \u2014 everyone who is playing. Thirty-five thousand dollars in prize money seems like a lot of money, until you realize the company generates hundreds of millions a year. I don\u2019t have it in me to support that.\u201d\n\n[Cardinals Coach Kliff Kingsbury says Madden made him look like a 'Walking Dead' character]\n\nMitich will be 25 in February \u2014 the prime of his life. He just isn\u2019t sure exactly how to spend it.\n\n\u201cI would play [video games] 5-6 hours a day; now I watch baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cOr sports in general. Or hang out with family. Even that\u2019s tough, though. I\u2019m 24. I get annoyed sometimes.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a communications major at Towson and he\u2019s added a political science minor. He says maybe he\u2019ll turn that into a vocation. Maybe he can use all this for good.\n\n\u201cClearly something has to be done with gun laws,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what side you\u2019re on, something has to be done. There\u2019s no way that kid should have been allowed to get a gun.\u201d\n\nHis mind often goes back to a conversation he had with Robertson shortly before he died.\n\n\u201cTaylor told me keep going in school,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in the back of your mind. And knowing that my dad always wanted it. I haven\u2019t always been that close to my dad. I realized I couldn\u2019t play video games forever.\u201d\n\nHe just didn\u2019t expect to stop so soon, in a moment of terror, in the middle of a Travis Scott song.\n\nRead more from The Washington Post:\n\nMeet the queer, non-binary, pansexual characters of Borderlands 3\n\n\u2018Gears 5\u2019: The definition of a great action game\n\n\u2018Control\u2019: A space-warping science fiction game with much to like but not a lot to love\n\n\u2018Telling Lies\u2019: One of the most best video games of the year\n\n\u2018Observation\u2019: A brilliant science fiction game that puts the player in an unfamiliar situation", "description": "In an attempt to heal his mind, Jacob Mitich has not picked up his game controller since being shot in Jacksonville, but news cycles filled with mass shootings keep dredging up the pain.", "authors": ["Eric Adelson", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b5nQOTqzvMQ014fa__XyeqhxiLQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XEWDKIWZLAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
