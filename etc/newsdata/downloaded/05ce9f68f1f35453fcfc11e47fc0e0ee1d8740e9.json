REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nThe Springboks need a bonus-point win to make sure of their place in the knockout stages, though a victory of any kind would do the trick unless Italy produce the shock of the tournament and down New Zealand in their final pool match on Saturday.\n\nBok coach Rassie Erasmus, however, has warned that any players failing to produce the required intensity during the game against Canada will quickly find themselves on the sidelines.\n\nErasmus has continued his rotation policy and made 13 changes from the side that overwhelmed Italy 49-3 in Fukuroi City on Friday, though he has kept captain Siya Kolisi in the starting XV as the flanker continues his return to full match sharpness after a serious knee injury.\n\n\u201cHe played a full 80 minutes (against Italy) and was wonderful. I think it was his best game since he has been back from injury,\u201d Erasmus told reporters in Kobe on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe plan was always just to get him to the World Cup, to make sure the knee holds up.\n\n\u201cAfter that, we wanted to get him to play a full 80 minutes. He can do that now and his form is back to where it was, so to take him off the pitch would be like starting the process all over again. The more game-time he gets the better.\u201d\n\nErasmus said he would demand the same commitment and intensity that his side showed against the Italians.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s make-up is a bit different but we expect the same intensity in all four of our next games (if they make the final). One thing that will be vital going into the knockout stages is intensity and big moments.\n\n\u201cIf these players don\u2019t step up then they will fail to stay in the team. They know that and it will be one of the challenges for them.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand head Pool B with 14 points from three games, with South Africa and Italy both on 10. Canada and Namibia have yet to claim a point.\n\nDamian Willemse will start at full-back after flying in as an injury replacement for Jesse Kriel, while Elton Jantjies gets another run at fly-half after his poor showing in the 57-3 win over Namibia.\n\nCanada have made six changes from the side that lost 63-0 to New Zealand last time out, with an all-new front-row in props Hubert Buydens and Jake Ilnicki either side of hooker Andrew Quattrin, and the inclusion of lock Kyle Baillie, scrum-half Phil Mack and full-back Andrew Coe.\n\nWing DTH van der Merwe will make a Canadian record 15th World Cup appearance when he lines up against his native country.\n\n\u201cWe are hugely respectful of the South African team. They and the All Blacks are probably the two best sides at the tournament,\u201d Canada assistant coach Huw Wiltshire said.\n\n\u201cTwo things you can\u2019t defend against in rugby are speed and power, and both those countries have got it across their teams, across the park and across their whole squads.\u201d\n\nThe Boks and Canada have met twice before, including at the 1995 World Cup in what later became famously known as the \u2018Battle of Boet Erasmus\u2019.\n\nCanadians Gareth Rees and Rod Snow, as well as South African James Dalton, were sent-off after a mass brawl as the Boks won 20-0 on their way to lifting the trophy.", "description": "South Africa face one final hurdle in their bid for a Rugby World Cup quarter-final place but seem certain to brush aside the challenge of minnows Canada when the teams meet in a Pool B encounter at the Kobe Stadium on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437706285&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950C8", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
