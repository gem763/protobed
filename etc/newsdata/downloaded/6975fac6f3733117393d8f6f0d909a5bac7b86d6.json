All residents who had previously been under an evacuation warning have now been ordered to flee.\n\nThe wind continues to plague firefighters who are trying to beat back the raging blaze. Winds gusting higher than 80 miles an hour are sending embers up to a mile away, leading to spot fires that can quickly grow if they are not extinguished, especially in extremely dry conditions, officials said. A gust was clocked at 93 m.p.h. in Sonoma County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got rates of spread that are extremely dangerous at this point, with erratic fire behavior,\u201d said Capt. Stephen Volmer, a fire behavior analyst at Cal Fire, the state firefighting and fire prevention agency.\n\nThe possibility that the fire could jump across U.S. Highway 101 and rapidly move west is a growing fear for firefighters, given that there is more fuel and less recent experience with wildfires on that side of the highway, making the fire\u2019s course more difficult to predict.\n\n\u201cThat area hasn\u2019t seen any fire history since the 1940s,\u201d Captain Volmer said, adding that the vegetation in that area is extremely dense, old and dry.", "description": "Driven by gusty winds, the Kincade fire north of San Francisco was still growing on Sunday, and power was shut off to millions of customers to prevent more outbreaks.", "authors": ["Lauren Hepler", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/us/27fires-01sub/27fires-01sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
