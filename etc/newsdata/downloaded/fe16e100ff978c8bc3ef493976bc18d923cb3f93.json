The case against Pavelich was suspended as authorities petition to have him committed.\n\nPavelich's sister, Jean Gevik, said her brother's personality has been altered by a degenerative brain disease.\n\n'He's been an amazing brother. Fun. Loving,' she said. 'This has been a total change.'\n\n'He never hurt anybody, not even in the NHL,' she said, adding, 'Even when he'd get battered around, he'd never retaliate.'\n\nHerb Brooks (seated), Pavelich's former coach with Team USA and the New York Rangers, once told Pavelich's sister that he 'had one very bad head injury,' adding that he was 'surprised Mark lived through [it].' At just 5-foot-8, Pavelich (right) was not known as a physical player\n\nWHAT IS CTE? Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease that is caused by repeated hits to the head. Over time, these hard impacts result in confusion, depression and eventually dementia. There has been several retired football players who have come forward with brain diseases. They are attributing their condition to playing football and the hits they took. More than 1,800 former athletes and military veterans have pledged to donate their brains to the Concussion Legacy Foundation for CTE research. CTE was usually associated with boxing before former NFL players began revealing their conditions. Several notable players who have committed suicide were posthumously diagnosed with the disease, such as Junior Seau and Aaron Hernandez.\n\nGevik suggested CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, could be a factor.\n\nCTE, which can be diagnosed only after death, has been found in several former NHL players, more than 100 former NFL players and in dozens more athletes and members of the military who have been exposed to repetitive head trauma.\n\nThe disease can lead to memory loss, depression and even suicide.\n\nPavelich has struggled with 'anger issues [and] damaging property,' Gevik explained.\n\nGevik said she was told by Herb Brooks, Pavelich's former coach with Team USA and the New York Rangers, that her brother 'had one very bad head injury that he was surprised Mark lived through.'\n\nAfter speaking with a CTE expert who has worked with several former NFL players, Gevik said she believes her brother is suffering from the brain disease.\n\n'All the research is out there about CTE,' Gevik said. 'This should not be a surprise here.'\n\nJack O'Callahan, left, and Mark Pavelich of the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team talk during a 'Relive the Miracle' reunion at Herb Brooks Arena in 2015\n\nThe NHL has long denied there is a conclusive link between repeated blows to the head and CTE however it did settle a concussion lawsuit with more than 100 former players who are experiencing the long-term effects of head injuries, although the league did not admit any guilt and the payout was reportedly far less than the $1 billion settlement the NFL made with its former players.\n\nMark Pavelich pictured during an exhibition against the Soviets at Madison Square Garden in 1980. The US lost 10-3, but went on to stun the USSR in the Olympic semifinals with a 4-3 upset. The Americans went on to beat Finland to win the Olympic gold medal\n\nThe NHL paid out just $19 million. Each player can receive $22,000 with the potential for another $75,000 for medical treatment.\n\nPavelich was not a part of that lawsuit and has not made a claim, according to Gevik.\n\nPavelich, who starred at Minnesota-Duluth, assisted on the winning goal in a stunning 4-3 upset of the Soviet Union in the 1980 Olympic hockey tournament semifinals, a triumph that has long been referred to as the 'Miracle on Ice.'\n\nTeam USA went on to defeat Finland in the gold medal game. Pavelich later played for the five seasons with the New York Rangers and parts of one season each with the Minnesota North Stars and San Jose Sharks, potting 137 goals and dishing out 192 assists in his 355 NHL games. He also played professionally in Europe.\n\nPavelich was charged with second- and third-degree assault this summer after he was accused of attacking his friend in Lutsen following a day of fishing. Pavelich accused him of spiking his beer, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nJim Miller, Pavelich's neighbor for 20 years, suffered cracked ribs, a bruised kidney and a fracture to one of his vertebrae, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nPavelich was booked into the Cook County Jail on August 15.", "description": "Mark Pavelich of the 'Miracle on Ice' US Olympic team charged in August with assault for allegedly beating a neighbor with a metal pole. has been found mentally deficient to stand trial.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/19/20342518-0-image-a-105_1572376091632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
