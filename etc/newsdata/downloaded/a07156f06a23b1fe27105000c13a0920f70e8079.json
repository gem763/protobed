And that makes sense: you need to get an edge,\" managing director John de Bree said.\n\nMr de Bree said that if there was a skill shortage, it would have a greater effect on Judo Bank, whose average loans were valued at $1.7 million. Capify averaged $40,000 per loan and processed most lending decisions within an hour.\n\n\"[Judo Bank] will need experienced people. Those skills aren't that easy,\" Mr de Bree said.", "description": "Chief risk officer for neobank 86400 said the finding was \"more of an indictment of the interview process\" used by Judo Bank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3246%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d9be053dbf02c67ac7f9aa1cabccb131bcf43d8f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
