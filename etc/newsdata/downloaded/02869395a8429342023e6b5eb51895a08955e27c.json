Goodenough of the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nThe 2019 #NobelPrize in Chemistry has been awarded to John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino \u201cfor the development of lithium-ion batteries.\u201d pic.twitter.com/LUKTeFhUbg \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 9, 2019\n\nGoran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the prize was about \u201ca rechargeable world.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the committee said lithium-ion batteries \u201chave revolutionized our lives\u201d \u2014 and the laureates \u201claid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel committee said the lithium-ion battery has its roots in the oil crisis in the 1970s, when Whittingham was working to develop methods aimed at leading to fossil fuel-free energy technologies.\n\nThe prizes come with a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma that are conferred on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896 \u2014 in Stockholm and in Oslo, Norway.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have revolutionised our lives and are used in everything from mobile phones to laptops and electric vehicles. Through their work, this year\u2019s Chemistry Laureates have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.#NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/KXVfXlUT4B \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 9, 2019\n\nPrize founder Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-born James Peebles won the Physics Prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who were honored for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a solar-type star.\n\nAmericans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\u201d\n\nTwo literature laureates are to be announced Thursday, because last year\u2019s award was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.", "description": "Through their work, the laureates laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d86e0210000c307342908.jpeg?cache=9dzxvcqaxt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
