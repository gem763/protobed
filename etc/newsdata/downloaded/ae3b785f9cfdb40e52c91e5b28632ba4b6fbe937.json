From clothing to furniture to tools and more, the credibility of the story depends on these details. And that's where production designers come in.\n\nDuring the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, DGC Ontario and CBC Arts staged a full day of panel discussions featuring industry professionals who work behind the scenes to bring some of the hottest tickets to life. Johanna Schneller, co-host of The Filmmakers, dove into the world of production design when she moderated a panel with some of the festival's top creators.\n\nCraig Lathrop \u2014 who earned recognition from both the Chicago Film Critics Association and the Directors Guild of Canada for his work on the 2015 period horror The Witch \u2014 spoke to Schneller about building the world of the psychological thriller The Lighthouse.\n\nSometimes you just need to hire trained seagulls\n\nThe Lighthouse's Craig Lathrop tells the strange story of how it being illegal to train seagulls started a strange series of events. 2:03\n\nIn addition to all the research Lathrop did to achieve the right look and feel of the 1890s New England island where The Lighthouse was set, he also found himself in a very unusual position.\n\nThe film, which follows two men sequestered on a remote and mysterious isle, required the good work of trained seagulls. The problem: it's illegal to train seagulls. Upon discovering this unexpected hitch, Lathrop had to do some creative problem solving.\n\n\"There was a gentleman in London who had five seagulls who had been grandfathered in because they were already trained when the law changed.\" So the production designer took his team to London to shoot with the five qualified birds there.\n\nBut it wasn't smooth sailing just yet.\n\nRobert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse. (A24)\n\nThat's not just an expression \u2014 the team had to transport a gigantic rock from Nova Scotia to London to complete the shoot, but the ship's crane broke. 60 containers didn't make it off the ship...and it was on its way to Germany.\n\nHow did they recover from this debacle? Well, you'll just have to watch and find out.\n\nWatch the entire panel here:", "description": "The wild production design ride of Nova Scotia-shot The Lighthouse was hardly smooth sailing.", "authors": ["Cbc Arts"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324583.1571330852!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-lighthouse.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
