Morris told John Catsimatidis on 'The Cats Roundtable' Sunday, a spooky thought for many Democrats at the beginning of Halloween week. 'She wants to. She feels entitled to do it. She feels compelled to do it. She feels that God put her on the Earth to do it.'\n\nMorris - who went from adviser to enemy of the Clintons - floated that Hillary Clinton was holding back because 'she realized the timing is bad' because the #MeToo movement is still prominently in the news.\n\nHillary Clinton could still get in the race, says Dick Morris, a GOP political strategist who gave advice to President Clinton during his impeachment. Morris suggested Hillary Clinton hasn't jumped in because she's worried about fallout from #MeToo\n\nDick Morris, a GOP political strategist who advised President Clinton during his impeachment, said Hillary Clinton 'believes she was put on earth to be president' and thinks Clinton could still jump in\n\nHillary Clinton (left) has been in the news recently having embarked on a book tour with her daughter Chelsea (right)\n\n'In the whole issue of sexual harassment, the focus has shifted from the perpetrator - the offender - to the victim,' Morris noted. 'We're increasingly looking at the women who were victimized and the agony they went through: Weinstein's victims. Epstein's victims. Clinton's victims.'\n\nMorris explained that Hillary Clinton becomes ensnared in her husband's past problems when Americans are looking at what happened through the victims' eyes.\n\n'When she had private detectives digging up dirt on the women her husband has victimized to keep them silent, that is squarely her scandal,' Morris said. 'So she is scared to death that the #MeToo movement will turn on her because she has now committed a major offense.'\n\nRonan Farrow's new book 'Catch and Kill,' which came out last week, exposes some of the tactics used by Weinstein and other high-profile predators to silence their female victims.\n\nMorris also said that Clinton couldn't get in until 'Biden drops out.'\n\n'If he goes away, there is an opening for her - because at that point all the Democrats are going to say, \"Oh my God, are we going to nominate Elizabeth Warren and be left with only a left-wing, crazy, George McGovern-like candidate?\" ... We're going to get clobbered,' Morris said.\n\nIn this scenario, Clinton marches in.\n\n'And Hillary will dust off her credentials and say, \"I'm the moderate,\"' Morris said. 'But to do so she will have to escape withering fire about her role as the persecutor of the victims in sexual harassment scandals.'\n\n'But make no mistake, she wants it, she's planning on it. She'll do everything she can to achieve it,' Morris offered.\n\nMorris was fanning the flames of a Hillary 3.0 campaign last week as well.\n\nDuring an October 22 appearance on the same show Morris said, 'I think it's always possible that Hillary runs.'\n\n'There's a test you can do at home. Just put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she's going to run,' he said.\n\nThe same day, the Washington Post reported that Clinton hadn't ruled out running, according to two unnamed sources close to the former secretary of state.\n\nClinton has kept herself in the news as of late, out on a book tour with daughter Chelsea.\n\nShe also inserted herself in the 2020 presidential race by telling David Plouffe's podcast that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, vying for the nomination, was being groomed to be a Russian asset, with the aim to have the Hawaii congresswoman play spoiler and launch a third-party bid.\n\nGabbard lashed out and dared Clinton to enter the race.\n\n'It's now clear that this primary is between you and me,' Gabbard tweeted. 'Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.'", "description": "Hillary Clinton could try for the White House a third time suggested Dick Morris, the GOP political consultant who advised President Clinton when he was facing impeachment.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20288478-0-image-a-2_1572281665383.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
