I Bumped Up Two Weight Classes & I\u2019ll Do It Again. \u2026 You Wanna Play Chess I\u2019ll Be Your Huckleberry. Got You In 2 Neanderthal, Talked To Your Pops He Knows Who\u2019s Champ. # Anklepick # DavidVSGoliath,\u201d Ferguson tweeted early Tuesday morning.\n\nAD\n\nJones seemed confused by the tweet and responded with a message of his own that referenced Ferguson\u2019s mental health issues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWait, when did this beef start?!? I thought we were cool!! You over there feeling suicidal Tony?\u201d Jones wrote in a tweet that he deleted about 30 minutes later after it was met from criticism by fans (the tweet was captured as a screengrab before it was deleted).\n\nIn March, Ferguson\u2019s wife, Christina, filed a restraining order against him in California because of \u201cparanoid and delusional\u201d behavior that included \u201cthrowing holy water\u201d at her and ripping out their home\u2019s fireplace because he believed \u201csomeone was inside his walls.\u201d She also accused her husband of taking their son from her parents\u2019 home and not letting her see him for five days.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to documents obtained by MMA Junkie, five incident reports had been filed by the Santa Ana Police Department since January 2018, including three in the month that preceded the restraining order. In one of the reports, officers spoke to an unidentified female who said Ferguson had \u201cnot slept for three days and was tearing apart the home\u201d and \u201cbelieved someone placed a [computer] chip in his leg.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement to reporters after filing the order, Christina Ferguson described Tony Ferguson as \u201ca good husband and good father to our son\u201d and wrote that she asked for protection in an effort to get her husband \u201cthe help necessary to continue being the best possible, as well as to pursue his passion and career as a UFC champion.\u201d She let the restraining order expire in April, and Ferguson was not arrested or charged with a crime. In June, UFC President Dana White said Tony Ferguson had \u201cdone all the right things\u201d in receiving treatment and that doctors had cleared his returned to the octagon. At UFC 238 on June 8, Ferguson stopped Donald Cerrone by TKO in the second round.\n\nJones apologized for his \u201csuicidal\u201d tweet as well as deleting it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDefinitely should\u2019ve used a better choice of words, deleted that last tweet. My fault, I\u2019m sorry guys,\u201d Jones wrote.\n\nAD\n\nJones also deleted a tweet in which he apologized again after saying he \u201cknew nothing about my guy having mental health issues, I do know though.\u201d In a deleted response to a fan, Jones said he doesn\u2019t \u201creally sit around and read other fighters articles.\u201d\n\nBoth Ferguson and Jones wrestled at Midwestern colleges at around the same time earlier this century, and Ferguson\u2019s tweet suggests they met on the mat at some point even though Ferguson wrestled at 165 pounds and Jones wrestled at 197 pounds. Ferguson and Jones are separated by three weight classes in UFC, so the chances of them actually meeting in the octagon are about nil.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Jones later apologized for the tweet aimed at Tony Ferguson, whose wife filed a restraining order against him earlier this year, saying he was \u201cparanoid and delusional.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uFiBBSSouOFo397Z_SlPK14hCDU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/34EK23B4SAI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
