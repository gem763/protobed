(Marina Lopes/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 When Guilherme Rocha surveys the golden sand beaches, turquoise waters and dramatic cliffs of this speck of an island in the South Atlantic, he sees a model of sustainable development for Brazil \u2014 and the world. A place where the number of visitors is limited, where the money they bring is used to promote electric cars, solar farms and mandatory recycling, where the tourist activities include lectures on climate change and ways to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThe world is turning a page,\u201d says Rocha, the island\u2019s administrator. \u201cThe era of dirty energy is over.\u201d\n\nLuiz Falc\u00e3o considers the same tropical paradise and sees untapped potential \u2014 for more business. The owner of the Dolphin Hotel dreams of creating a world-class port to welcome cruise ships packed with passengers coming to patronize a growing landscape of bars, restaurants and hotels.\n\n\u201cThis could be a Maldives, a Cozumel,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, we can have only 100,000 tourists. There, they receive 90 million.\u201d\n\nThose competing visions have made Noronha an unlikely battleground in the larger debate over growth across the Western Hemisphere\u2019s second-largest nation. Will Brazil exploit its abundant natural resources to lift itself out of economic stagnation? Or will it use those resources to show humankind the way to a green future?\n\nFor a time here, the environmentalists appeared to be winning. Since the beginning of the year, this island of 3,000 residents and almost as many dolphins has banned disposable plastic, imposed mandatory recycling and launched a program to neutralize carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nTourism here has nearly doubled since 2012, but the number of visitors remains capped by law. Foreigners are charged more than $50 to use the beaches, and environmental regulations, strictly enforced, have restrained development.\n\n[Why the Amazon is burning, and what it means for climate change]\n\n\n\nThe Two Brother Mountains rise from the turquoise waters off the island. (Marina Lopes/The Washington Post)\n\nBolsonaro calls Noronha \u2018an example of how not to do tourism\u2019\n\nBut now local business leaders have a powerful new ally in Brasilia.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change skeptic who won office last year on promises to cut environmental red tape and promote development, posted his displeasure with the beach fees this summer on Facebook. He called them \u201crobbery\u201d and said they explain why \u201cthere is almost no tourism in Brazil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrazil is the No. 1 country in the world in natural beauty, but one of the last in tourism revenue,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cFernando de Noronha is an example of how not to do tourism.\u201d\n\nHis take on Noronha mirrors his administration\u2019s approach to the environment more broadly: Ease regulations, promote business, shout down critics.\n\nWhen the head of the government\u2019s space research agency reported a jump in deforestation in the Amazon this year, the president denounced the data as \u201clies\u201d and fired him. He has dismissed international criticism over deforestation as an assault on Brazil\u2019s sovereignty; as fires spiked across the Amazon last month, he initially rejected an aid package offered by the Group of Seven and told foreign leaders to mind their own business.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric has isolated him on the world stage. But here in Noronha, it\u2019s struck a chord.\n\nFabiana da Silva, 31, remembers when living on the island meant wading through muddy streets and waiting weeks for food to be shipped from the mainland. Growing tourism has changed life here, creating jobs, funding improvements, strengthening the economy.\n\nEnvironmental regulations, she says, mean she has to ask the government for everything.\n\n\u201cWe are humiliated,\u201d says da Silva, who works at a shop that sells clothing and jewelry. \u201cWe have to ask to build a toilet. If you want to build a house, you have to beg.\u201d\n\n[Why Brazilian farmers are burning the rainforest \u2014 and why it\u2019s so hard for Bolsonaro to stop them]\n\n\n\nBiologists measure a green sea turtle as part of their research. (Marina Lopes/The Washington Post)\n\nEndangered species, and the world\u2019s most beautiful beach\n\nWhat happens in Noronha can reverberate throughout Brazil. After officials here introduced the ban on plastic, they say, they received calls from local officials around the country hoping to do the same. Paulo C\u00e2mara, the socialist governor of the state that administers the island, says he uses it as a laboratory to test ideas before implementing them more broadly.\n\nNoronha, just a 70-minute flight from Recife on the Brazilian mainland, has much to attract visitors. UNESCO has declared the island a World Heritage Site, citing its \u201cindescribable beauty,\u201d its biodiversity and its endangered species, including green sea and loggerhead turtles. TripAdvisor has named Baia do Sancho the world\u2019s most beautiful beach. Spinner dolphins greet tourists in the morning; lemon sharks dive around them during the day, stingrays gather at their feet at dusk.\n\nThe island received 103,000 visitors last year. They generated nearly $9 million in taxes.\n\nMarco Aurelio da Silva, a ranger at Fernando de Noronha Marine National Park, delivers lectures to visitors each week. Between instructions on how to behave during their stay \u2014 \u201cPlease don\u2019t poke the sharks with your selfie sticks\u201d \u2014 he tries to instill a sense of environmental responsibility he hopes they\u2019ll take with them when they leave. \u201cWe have to remember Planet Earth is our home,\u201d he told one group. \u201cWho takes care of it? We do!\u201d\n\n[The dog is one of the world\u2019s most destructive mammals. Brazil proves it.]\n\n\n\nNoronha's tallest peak, seen through palm trees. (Marina Lopes/The Washington Post)\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nTourists have brought opportunities, but also challenges: Growing crowds are straining the primitive sewage system, taxing the limited water supply and wearing out unpaved roads.\n\nThe solution? Business leaders say it\u2019s more development \u2014 building the new port, expanding the desalination plant, reinforcing the infrastructure.\n\nFalc\u00e3o, the hotelier, considers himself the founder of tourism in Noronha. He began chartering flights for 100 travelers a week in 1981, when only fishermen, soldiers and biologists had reason to venture here.\n\nHis 40-room hotel, between the airport and the beach, is one of the island\u2019s most popular. But expanding the business has proved all but impossible. His hope of building a second hotel has stalled over environmental permits.\n\nHe blames the environmentalists.\n\n\u201cThey say no, just to say no,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the people\u2019s heritage. Noronha should compete with the world.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro, he hopes, will rein in local officials and clear the way for more business-friendly decisions.\n\nThe president is already making changes. After his Twitter tirade, he sent Environment Minister Ricardo Salles here to assess whether some of the tourist fees should be waived. Salles met with business leaders, lifted a ban on sardine fishing, and replaced the head of the island environmental agency with a native who the business community hopes will ease restrictions.\n\nIn Noronha, where environmentalists have enjoyed an outsized influence, activists fear that Bolsonaro could threaten projects decades in the planning. Local officials worry that speaking out could make them the president\u2019s next target.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have to wait long to see their fears realized, with the reassignment of a local environmental official. Jos\u00e9 Martins is an oceanographer who worked on Noronha for three decades. A public critic of the spike in tourism, he was ordered to leave Noronha after Salles\u2019s visit.\n\nThe Ministry of the Environment denied repeated interview requests and would not allow Martins to speak to reporters. At a town hall meeting in August, however, all eyes were on him. He silently teared up as lifelong friends called on the government to reconsider.\n\n\u201cHe has not committed a crime,\u201d said Dom\u00edcio Alves, one of Noronha\u2019s most senior political leaders, drawing a standing ovation. \u201cIf you disagree with him, let\u2019s discuss it, but don\u2019t do this.\n\n\u201cHe is an affront to the interests of big business. That\u2019s why this is happening.\u201d\n\nThe meeting descended into chaos. Business leaders shouted over activists. The future of the island was at stake, and everyone had an opinion.\n\nRead more\n\nThe world wants to save the Amazon rainforest.
