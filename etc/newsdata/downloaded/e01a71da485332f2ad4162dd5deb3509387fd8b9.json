For example, 'Old Town Road,' formerly the number one song in the world, picked up steam on TikTok\n\n'If lawmakers on Capitol Hill knew that their children\u2019s TikTok data may have been flowing right into China, I bet they\u2019d worry about it as much as I do,' he said.\n\nIn the US, similarly influential Chinese companies have already started to hit guardrails imposed by skeptical lawmakers, including smartphone giant Huawei.\n\nThe company has been accused of spying on users in the US and abroad at the behest of the Chinese government.\n\nThe wireless infrastructure and phone manufacturer was blacklisted this year amid an increasingly heated trade war between the US and China. That conflict has continually alluded resolution.", "description": "Among the concerns are both the growing influence of TikTok, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, and its adherence to an agenda set by the Chinese government.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/13774246-0-image-a-6_1571948025815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
