Out of the 454 tree species native to Europe, two-fifths are regionally threatened with extinction.\n\nHowever, when looking at the species endemic to Europe \u2014 meaning they don\u2019t exist anywhere else on the planet \u2014 58 per cent face extinction mostly due to invasive species and pests. Some 15 per cent are already critically endangered, which is the closest a species can be to extinction.\n\nThis Artist Paints Endangered Animals To Remind Us What We're Fighting For Alexis Kandra has been drawing animals for years, but she never drew them with a moral message. They served as symbols \u2014 for danger, peace or mystery. Kandra, a contemporary artist, is now painting animals to help raise awareness about their impending probable doom.

Pests, such as the leaf-miner moth that damages trees such as the horse-chestnut, affect 38 per cent of European tree species. Deforestation, wood harvesting and urban development follow as major risk factors.\n\nClimate change, however, is a major threat, too. Its impacts still aren\u2019t all that well-understood and could be underestimated, the report states. The report authors understand it\u2019s a threat to all tree species, but it\u2019s only included in the report where its impacts are already apparent \u2014 such as with the Serbian Spruce.\n\nOther recent research about the tree also indicates it could disappear in the \u201cnear future\u201d without further interventions such as assisted migration. Currently, climate change directly threatens about 50 tree species.\n\nAny plants and trees imported into Europe need to be carefully vetted to ensure more pests aren\u2019t entering the region, according to The Guardian. That\u2019s especially true as countries look to trees as carbon sinks to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTrees in Europe are but one victim to humans and the far-reaching impacts of our actions. Other species \u2014 from frogs to birds \u2014 are suffering, too. That\u2019s on us.", "description": "A new assessment shows that more than half of the trees only found in Europe are at risk of extinction....", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Beth Elderkin"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xp7dxavpr0ptnxmriikv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
