Guilty if the former, not guilty if it were the latter.'\n\nAfter she was kissed, the woman, who cannot be named, was shocked and a fellow passenger challenged Gascoigne, saying: 'What you have just done is sexual abuse.'\n\nJurors were shown photos of Gascoigne kissing celebrities, including Princess Diana in 1990, in an attempt to back up his claim that he often kissed people\n\nPolice later traced Gascoigne to a hotel in Jesmond, Newcastle, and when an officer spoke to him on the phone, prior to arrest, the footballer said: 'I know what it's about, I kissed a fat lass.'\n\nWhen he gave evidence, Gascoigne said he was trying to reassure his alleged victim after he claimed to have overheard someone say of her: 'You don't want a photo with her, she's fat and ugly.'\n\nHe spoke of his own battle with his weight, struggles with bulimia and bullying suffered by family members.\n\nGascoigne said that he came and sat next to the woman, telling her 'take no notice of what they say' and 'listen, you're not fat and ugly'.\n\nHe denied being drunk at the time, telling the jury he had undergone an operation in Australia to have pellets implanted in his stomach which would make him 'spew up' if he drank spirits.\n\nThe incident happened on a York to Newcastle train at Darlington (pictured in file photo)\n\nThe defence showed the jury pictures of Gascoigne kissing and being kissed by other people, including former footballers Steve Bull, Ian Wright, Ally McCoist and Wayne Rooney, as well Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe court heard character references from former boxers Ricky Hatton and Jane Couch, his alcohol therapist and his former agent Mel Stein, which spoke of Gascoigne frequently kissing people.\n\nMr Stein's statement recounted a time when Gascoigne kissed and hugged a rabbi's wife, but the potentially offensive moment was quickly forgiven due to the player's apology.", "description": "The 52-year-old ex-England midfielder was charged with the offence after he forcefully kissed a woman on a train travelling through Yorkshire.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/19831730-0-image-a-20_1571307601466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
