And it appears Pete Buttigieg is their candidate.\n\nWhile Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren are topping national polls in the contest for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, California\u2019s deep-pocketed Silicon Valley is donating to the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana over the former vice president by a 5-to-1 margin.\n\n\u201cPete is a clean slate for the party in ways Biden can\u2019t be,\u201d said Cyrus Radfar, a 35-year-old technology entrepreneur and Democratic donor. \u201cThere\u2019s new life and new energy that Pete brings, especially as the base of the Democratic Party is getting younger. I think he\u2019s going to be on the national stage for a long time.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has staged a fundraising blitz in posh Northern California communities, holding events hosted by technology executives such as Netflix Inc. Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, Nest Labs home-automation company co-founder Matt Rogers, and Chelsea Kohler, director of product communications at Uber Technologies Inc., among others.\n\nWere he to win, Buttigieg would not only be the youngest president, but also the first openly gay one. While he is successfully raising money, Buttigieg has struggled until recently to enter the top tier of candidates nationally.\n\nBut there are signs that he could be a moderate voter\u2019s alternative to Biden. While raising money in California, Buttigieg is campaigning heavily in Iowa, and it appears both efforts are paying off. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll of likely Iowa caucus goers put Buttigieg just behind Biden and Warren for the first time. Biden had 18% support, Warren 17% and Buttigieg 13%.\n\nMillennial voters in the tech industry say they appreciate that Buttigieg\u2019s liberal policies seem grounded in reality and recognize \u201ca cutthroat world,\u201d as Elizabeth Moran, 28, put it at a debate watch party in Silicon Valley\u2019s Sunnyvale. Moran, who works at Poshmark, a social commerce platform, said she likes Buttigieg\u2019s grasp of economics.\n\n\u201cWell-educated recognizes well-educated,\u201d Moran said, adding that Buttigieg could have come to Silicon Valley after graduating from Harvard as many Ivy League graduates do.\n\nIn other words, in their eyes, Buttigieg is like them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big move on the Democratic side to more heavily regulate tech, and that hasn\u2019t been part of Buttigieg\u2019s message,\u201d said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. \u201cHis message is consistent with innovation and forward-looking technology. He has not given the impression that he would threaten their interests.\u201d\n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t said much about competition and antitrust, Buttigieg has focused on improving regulations as opposed to breaking up big tech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to empower the FTC to be able to intervene, including blocking or reversing mergers, in cases where there\u2019s anti-competitive behavior by tech companies,\u201d he said in a CNN town hall in April, referring to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nButtigieg was his high school\u2019s valedictorian and went on to Harvard, where he befriended two roommates of future Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and was one of the first 300 users on the social media platform. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, joined McKinsey & Co. as a consultant, and volunteered for Barack Obama\u2019s tech-savvy 2008 presidential campaign before joining the U.S. Navy Reserve and serving in Afghanistan.\n\nHis relationship with Zuckerberg persisted. Zuckerberg, 35, visited South Bend in 2017 while doing research for his philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and got a personal tour from Buttigieg. That relationship lasted into this year, when Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, recommended two people that Buttigieg ultimately hired for his campaign. Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Zuckerberg and Chan, said the couple hasn\u2019t yet decided whom to support for president.\n\nThe Golden State\n\nCalifornia voters have an unusually large influence in choosing the party\u2019s nominee this cycle. The state primary next year is in March instead of its previous June slot and its donors contributed 1 of every 5 dollars raised by the party\u2019s presidential candidates in the first six months of this year, data from the Center for Responsive Politics show.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The technology industry is looking for something different in a president in 2020.
