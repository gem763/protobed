China approved such a drug for anemia last year.\n\nFor cancers, on the other hand, trials for drugs that interrupt this process and thus short-circuit tumors are now underway.\n\n- Basic research -\n\nFor Kaelin, the breakthrough highlighted the importance of basic research -- that is, work aimed at deepening understanding of natural phenomena and driven by scientists' curiosity.\n\n\"Here I am as a cancer biologist helping to contribute to a new drug for hematological condition, namely anemia,\" he said, adding he hoped to use his voice to advocate for sufficient funding for such science.\n\n\"I think that's the way real science works, it doesn't work by putting blinders on people and trying to make believe they're working on an engineering problem when they're really working on a scientific problem.\"\n\nThat was echoed by Semenza, who told AFP: \"We do know that a lot of the really novel discoveries in terms of therapies come from unexpected turns in projects that started in very basic research.\"\n\n\"We made the discoveries when we were young, but we get recognized when we're old,\" the 63-year-old director of the Vascular Research Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering added.\n\nKaelin said he was accepting his prize partly on behalf of his late wife Carolyn, a breast cancer surgeon who died from a brain tumor in 2015.\n\nAfter she died, he thought winning the Nobel \"would be just be too bittersweet and it would be too crushing\" he said, \"but I'm at a point now where I like to think she's smiling down and nodding and saying 'I told you, I told you this can happen.'\"", "description": "When US scientist William Kaelin's phone began ringing at 5:00 am, he wasn't sure whether he was dreaming: Winning the Nobel Medicine Prize had long been a goal, but he also thought it was a long shot.
