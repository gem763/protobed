Dr Goldstein asked.\n\nShining a light on the reality of polyamory, the expert said it was worth thinking about what might happen if things 'go wrong'.\n\nWhat is polyamory and how does it work? * The word' polyamory,' by definition, means loving more than one. * Polyamory is a style of relating romantically that involves openness to emotional and sexual attachments to more than one person, with the knowledge and consent of all involved. * The only real rules for calling something polyamory is that the sexual and relational interactions be 1) consensual, 2) above-board, and 3) respectful. The main definition for polyamory, though, is contained in the coined word: 'many loves', not just many sexual partners.
