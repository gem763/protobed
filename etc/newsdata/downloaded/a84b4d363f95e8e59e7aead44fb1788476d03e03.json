Very little, if you believe the Harvard boffins behind the much-discussed Atlas of Economic Complexity. They reckon Australia's major exports of ores and oil are so unconducive to long-term economic development we might as well be a country peopled by barely educated subsistence farmers.\n\nRicardo Hausmann: lack of service trade an \"important drawback\" Bloomberg\n\nIf a piece of academic research comes up with conclusions as counter-intuitive as this, it should be vigorously examined for methodology flaws. But not, it seems, in Australia, for all its challenges a very wealthy nation so used to debasing itself we'd more easily countenance our future among the world's poorest.\n\nAside from this newspaper, which both broke news of and reported some scepticism about the survey, gullible reporting of Harvard's research was repeated far and wide in outlets as unfamiliar with matters of economic complexity as SBS' The Feed and the Daily Mail.\n\nBut here's something that might explain Australia's position at the bottom of Harvard's league tables. Some of its biggest and most sophisticated exports aren't counted. At all.\n\nThe data in Harvard's survey comes from that reported by customs agencies. Service exports don't go through customs offices, and aren't uniformly reported to the United Nations. For the purposes of statistical coherence, trade in services is thus utterly excised.", "description": "What's the difference between Namibia and Australia?
