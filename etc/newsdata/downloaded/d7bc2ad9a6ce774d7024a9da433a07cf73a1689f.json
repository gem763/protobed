The distinct red color is part of the patty\u2019s appeal, allowing it to look and taste like real meat.\n\nIn a report with the Associated Press, biochemist Smita Shankar explained that the key ingredient used to give burgers that bleeding effect is actually engineered rather than extracted from a plant.\n\nTo replicate the taste of meat, the company scanned plants for molecules that mimic a protein in meat that contains iron, which makes blood red. They finally settled on soy leghemoglobin, which is found in the root of soy plants.\n\nThe company website touts its plant-based foods, but \u201cno plant is actually touched\u201d in the process of making its infamous \"burger.\" Instead of using those plants directly, they insert synthetic versions of sections of soy DNA into yeast so it produces soy leghemoglobin during fermentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ingredient is meant to be less than 1% of the patty.\n\nMany ingredients don\u2019t need approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Companies often hire scientific experts to declare ingredients to be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d Impossible Foods says soy leghemoglobin met that requirement in 2014.\n\nStill, critics like the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Environmental Defense Fund have taken issue with companies make their own consumption safety determinations.\n\nA lawsuit by advocacy groups against that system is ongoing.\n\nImpossible Foods isn\u2019t just using soy leghemoglobin for patties.
