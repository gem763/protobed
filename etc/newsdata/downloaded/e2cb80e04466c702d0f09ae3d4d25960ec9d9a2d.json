Trust has been destroyed and the only way to rebuild it is to provide some transparency.\n\n\u2018Release vote volumes by contestant for both phone and online, film a special ITT in which the judges explain their irrational scoring, release a statement from the producers to reassure public that they do not seek to influence results in any way and provide a clear policy statement regarding pro dancers use of social media and the extent to which it is controlled by the production team.\u2019\n\nAs of Tuesday, October 16, the petition has reached 167 signatures.\n\nYou can sign the petition here.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted the BBC but they declined to comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
