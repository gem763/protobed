Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nIn the last 12 months, we have seen RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season 11, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars season five, the RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Holi-Slay Spectacular and, currently, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race U.K. season one. Sans RuPaul, the show has also expanded into Thailand and will soon hit Canada. New seasons of Drag Race and All Stars are in the works. And now, hold onto your wigs, because VH1 will produce RuPaul\u2019s Celebrity Drag Race for 2020. Are you satisfied yet? The show will only be four episodes (thankfully), and will feature 12 celebrities competing for charity in drag. There\u2019s no list of celebrity competitors yet, but your favorite queens will come back to help, including Alyssa Edwards, Bob the Drag Queen, Mon\u00e9t X Change, Trinity the Tuck, and Trixie Mattel. We now know that in today\u2019s ever-changing world, Drag Race will be the one constant us homosexuals can hold onto. And hey, maybe we\u2019ll finally get to see Andrew Garfield live out his drag dreams?", "description": "RuPaul and VH1 announced a four-episode season of \u201cCelebrity Drag Race\u201d featuring 12 celebrities competing for charity in drag.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/22/22-rupaul.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
