Now it's going to be some \"mechanized\" reinforcements.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperWhite House weighing options that would keep 500 troops in Syria: report Overnight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties Nuclear command nominee sidesteps questions on arms control treaties MORE confirmed Friday the United States will send some \u201cmechanized\u201d reinforcements into eastern Syria to protect against possible attacks by ISIS fighters on oil fields held by U.S. partner forces.\n\n\u201cThe United States will maintain a reduced presence in Syria to deny ISIS access to oil revenue as we reposition for the next phase of the defeat ISIS campaign,\u201d Esper said at a NATO defense meeting in Brussels.\n\nEsper said that the military is \u201cconsidering how we might reposition forces in the area in order to ensure we secure the oil field,\u201d currently held by Syrian Kurdish fighters, and is working to \u201cstrengthen our position\u201d at Deir Ezzoir. He added that the reinforcements \u201cwill include some mechanized forces.\u201d\n\nHe would not go into details as to the number of troops to be sent, but a mechanized force would likely include tanks and other combat vehicles and several hundred more military personnel. The U.S. presence in Syria up until this point has not included such equipment.\n\nWhat this means: The decision would also mean the Trump administration has backtracked on President Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE's decision earlier this month to pull almost all of the 1,000 U.S. troops out of northern Syria, paving the way for Turkey's invasion into the country.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans who fiercely back Trump, have slammed the move as upending the security of the region, potentially allowing the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to resurge and abandoning the Kurds, who helped the United States fight the terrorist group.\n\nTrump still insists fight is over: Trump, meanwhile, wrote on Twitter on Friday that U.S. troops would be returning to the United States and claimed that the U.S. military mission in Syria is finished.\n\nEsper also told reporters the U.S. mission in Syria has always been to prevent the reemergence of ISIS and that \u201cremains unchanged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf ISIS has access to the [oil], and therefore the means to procure arms or to buy fighters or whatever else they do, then it means it makes it more difficult to defeat ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\nThe comments mark a rapidly shifting U.S. strategy in Syria following Trump\u2019s announcement that all troops in the country would return stateside.\n\nIMPEACHMENT LATEST: House Democrats have subpoenaed three Trump administration officials for depositions as part of their impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine, lawmakers announced Friday.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffDemocrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Ocasio-Cortez calls out GOP lawmakers asking to be arrested, citing privilege How the 2019 impeachment proceedings defy our democracy MORE (D-Calif.) issued subpoenas for two officials with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and one State Department official.\n\nSchiff subpoenaed Michael Duffey, OMB\u2019s associate director for National Security Programs, and OMB Acting Director Russell Vought to give depositions on Nov. 5 and 6, respectively.\n\nDuffey is considered a key figure in the administration\u2019s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine.\n\nThe administration gave Duffey the authority to stall Ukraine aid after career civil servants in the White House raised concerns that they did not have the legal power to delay such funds, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nDemocrats also issued a subpoena to T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor, for a Nov. 6 deposition. Brechbuhl previously told the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry that he would not appear voluntarily.\n\nBrechbuhl is one of the officials named by William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, in his detailed 15-page opening statement that was obtained by The Hill and other outlets when he testified behind closed-doors on Tuesday.\n\nTaylor named Brechbuhl as someone he brought his concerns to amid the withholding of nearly $400 million Ukraine security aid.\n\nTrump keeps up Taylor attacks: Trump on Friday called Taylor a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d and said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties Pompeo hints State Dept. will comply with order to release Giuliani communications Pompeo to reporter in Kansas: 'The whole predicate of your question is insane' MORE made a mistake hiring him.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem: He\u2019s a Never Trumper,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House in response to a question about Taylor\u2019s explosive testimony from earlier this week.\n\n\u201cHis lawyer is the head of the Never Trumpers,\" the president added.\n\n\"They\u2019re a dying breed, but they\u2019re still there,\u201d Trump said of Republicans who do not support his agenda.\n\nNBC News reported last week that lawyer John Bellinger, a former George W. Bush administration official who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, would represent Taylor and another witness in the impeachment probe: Pompeo\u2019s former chief of staff, Michael McKinley.\n\nTrump attacked Taylor and Bellinger earlier this week on Twitter by labeling them \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d while adding that he didn\u2019t know Taylor. Trump also said this week that Republicans who do not support his agenda are \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\nTrump dismisses need for impeachment team: Trump also dismissed the need for a bolstered team to defend him against House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t have teams. Everyone\u2019s talking about teams. I\u2019m the team. I did nothing wrong,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House before leaving for an event in South Carolina.\n\nThe comment came as part of a lengthy rant against the impeachment inquiry, which Trump derided as a \"phony deal\" focused on a \"perfect\" call he had with the Ukrainian president. He went on to say that if anything came of this inquiry, he thinks it could plunge the country into economic downturn.\n\n\"I will say this: If anything ever happened with this phony witch hunt that the Democrats are doing ... I really believe you\u2019d have a recession, depression the likes of which this country hasn\u2019t seen,\" Trump said, questioning how Democrats could impeach \"one of the most successful presidents.\"\n\nON TAP FOR MONDAY\n\nThe House Rules Committee will prepare the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act, which would sanction Turkey for its offensive in Syria, for floor debate at 5 p.m. at the House, room 313. https://bit.ly/2pXSgFh\n\n\n\nICYMI\n\n-- The Hill: Senate Dems slam Trump for shifting funds meant to deter Russia to border wall\n\n-- The Hill: Senators concerned impeachment will consume agenda\n\n-- Stars and Stripes: So far, 41 US troops have been ID\u2019d from remains returned by North Korea, DPAA says\n\n-- Reuters: U.S. still pressing Turkey to 'walk away' from Russian missile purchase, official says\n\n-- Bloomberg: Key senators circulate legislation banning Iran nuclear waivers\n\n-- Associated Press: Iraqi police fire shots, tear gas at protesters; 23 killed", "description": "Happy\u00a0Friday and welcome to\u00a0Overnight Defense.
