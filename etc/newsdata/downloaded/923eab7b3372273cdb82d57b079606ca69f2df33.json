But when it comes to the smallest headphones, the ones that are small enough to just pop into your ears, that sense of freedom is at its best.\n\nSome in-ear headphones have a neckband to connect the two earphones, but others are what\u2019s called true wireless which are just two distinct earbuds and nothing else.\n\nWe\u2019ve tested a range of true wireless earbuds for audio quality above all else, but also ease of use, extra features, battery life and comfort of fit.\n\nExtra features include access to a smart virtual assistant, how easy it is to pause the music and noise-cancelling.\n\nWe tested each pair until they ran completely flat on multiple occasions.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Tiny but capable, airpods are now on to their second generation. The small white buds look like they might fall out but in fact are a good fit for most ears, even when you\u2019re exercising.\n\nAlthough they work with any phone, the seamless integration with Apple devices is spectacular: open the case and a message flashes up on the iPhone screen to show battery level, for instance. Pairing is instantaneous and easily switched between Apple devices as you need them.\n\nAudio quality is excellent and extra features are enjoyable. Say, \u201cHey, Siri\u201d, and the virtual personal assistant is summoned to answer your questions or change track and so on. Take one airpod out of an ear, so you can talk to someone, and the music pauses automatically, resuming when you place the bud back in your ear.\n\nThe case charges the airpods: the buds themselves have a five-hour charge, then another 19 hours of battery life in the case. If the buds are flat, a 15-minute charge gives three hours of listening time.\n\nA version with an optional case is available which is wireless-chargeable (\u00a3199): place the case on a wireless charging pad to charge the case without plugging in a cable.\n\nBuy now\n\nSony WF-1000XM3 true wireless in-ear headphones: \u00a3220, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThe latest earbuds from Sony include something special: noise-cancelling. This is a feature regularly found on over-ear headphones but rare in the smaller version, not least because it needs a bigger battery than many earbuds offer.\n\nIt\u2019s also to be found in the Libratones below. In-ears often have useful noise isolation by fitting the ears tightly but noise-cancelling adds an electronic effect; it uses a microphone to measure ambient noise and this noise is then reversed in phase and fed back into the earpieces.\n\nThe out-of-phase \u201canti-noise\u201d cancels the real noise. Sony\u2019s earbuds make the most of this effect and sound great. The fit is good \u2013 place in the ear and twist to get them just right. Although they don\u2019t feel as snug a fit as Apple\u2019s airpods, they held in place happily enough.\n\nThe case, which contains a battery to recharge the buds, is slick and effective, with magnets inside which the earbuds find easily. They snap into place satisfyingly. Remove one and Bluetooth is turned on automatically to begin the pairing process. The case comes with several sizes of ear tip so you can find the size and feel you prefer. Battery life is three hours in the earbuds plus 18 hours in the case.\n\nBuy now\n\nBose soundsport free truly wireless sport headphones: \u00a3150, Amazon\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of oomph to the Bose earbuds, with a really satisfying and inviting sound to them. A mostly comfortable fit delivers a decent seal to help the music sound even better. The companion app for iPhone and Android handsets helps make the pairing process quick and easy. If you mislay these earbuds, you can find them again using the smartphone app which will show them on a map and sound a here-I-am signal if they are nearby.\n\nA recent software update has fixed a previous issue where one bud would lose connection to the other occasionally. Battery life is five hours plus another 10 from the case (which has a row of five LEDs to show battery charge status). Choose from black, midnight blue, bright orange or ultraviolet.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeats powerBeats pro totally wireless earphones: \u00a3219, Amazon\n\nBeats is now a part of Apple, so it\u2019s no wonder that these new earbuds pair effortlessly and effectively with Apple products (though they work with other smartphones, too). Part of that is down to the H1 chip that is inside, the same as in the airpods, which means you can also use them with Apple\u2019s virtual personal assistant Siri.\n\nStories of airpods tumbling from your ears are rare but powerBeats pro headphones will definitely stay in place: as well as a decent fit in the ear, there\u2019s an over-ear hook that holds them securely. They look and feel sporty but are lightweight and comfortable to wear, even for extended periods.\n\nBeats is a brand is known for its bass. Here, it\u2019s present but not overwhelming, letting the rest of the music shine. Audio overall is excellent, a little fuller and richer than the airpods. Battery life is good: nine hours plus another two and a half charges from the (admittedly rather large) charging case.\n\nBuy now\n\nSennheiser momentum true wireless earbuds: \u00a3235.89, Sennheiser\n\nThe fit on the Sennheiser headphones is snug and works well to isolate the music from the world outside. Still, you can double-tap on the right earphone and the microphone will let outside noise in. These are not the most comfortable earbuds but work well and sound great. An app lets you see how much charge is remaining in the earbuds while a light on the charging case shows how much juice is left there. Battery life runs to four hours plus another eight hours from the charging case.\n\nBuy now\n\nSamsung galaxy buds: \u00a3139, Samsung\n\nSamsung\u2019s earbuds featured wireless charging before airpods did, and it\u2019s something that comes as standard, not an optional extra. When the in-ears are running low on juice, placing them on the back of the Samsung galaxy S10+, for instance, with its two-way wireless charging capability, recharges the earphones from the phone. Audio quality is very good, almost on par with the Sony earbuds.\n\nThe fit is excellent, with a twisting movement and a springy wingtip earpiece which, once you\u2019ve put it in, spins backwards to lock into your ears with ultimate security. Samsung adds a more solid bass and a beefier all-round sound compared to many, but doesn\u2019t overtake Apple in terms of richness overall. Just as airpods work with any phone but best with Apple\u2019s, these are compatible with other brands but work especially seamlessly with Samsung phones.\n\nBuy now\n\nLibratone track air+: \u00a3179, Amazon\n\nLike the Sony headphones above, the new true wireless headphones from Danish manufacturer Libratone have electronic noise-cancelling on board. They have a distinctive design though the small but pointy shape may divide opinion. They are also very light which adds to the comfort rating of the earbuds and the small size means the carry case is more pocketable, too. Battery life is longer than some at six hours, with another 18 hours\u2019 worth of charge in the case. As well as noise cancellation, the snug fit means the seal works well and the resulting audio is powerful and rich with plenty of bass.\n\nBuy now\n\nCambridge Audio melomania 1: \u00a3119.95, Amazon\n\nBattery life for the little bullet-like melomania 1 earbuds is very impressive: nine hours plus another 36 hours from the charging case. This is all the more striking when you see the size of the case \u2013 it\u2019s about the size of a dental floss box. Sound quality is strong, with a subtle, faithful tone that\u2019s understated but appealing. There are multiple eartips, including memory foam ones, so you can find the right fit. When you do, the noise isolation is effective. These are good value for money, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nJayBird vista headphones: \u00a3159.99, Jaybird\n\nJaybird is part of the large electronics company, Logitech, and has built a reputation for excellent headphones with a leaning towards active users. The fitness focus means there\u2019s more sweat-proofing than on some rivals (also useful if you\u2019re running in the rain, say). The light vista buds fit well, with decent audio sealing against outside noise. You can adjust the audio profile until it\u2019s just right thanks to a series of tests to customise the sound to what your ears hear best. Battery life is six hours for the earbuds and another 10 hours in the charging case.\n\nBuy now\n\nJabra elite 65T active: \u00a3148.99, Amazon\n\nThe Jabra 65T true wireless earbuds have neat little forward-pointing microphones to use in phone calls. The free app is useful, not least because the full manual is in it, though the headphones are easy to use. Buttons on the earbuds control which track you\u2019re listening to, or the volume. Battery life is five hours, with another 10 hours in the charging case. A quick charge of 15 minutes gives up to 90 minutes of listening. These headphones stood out for strong audio and an extremely comfortable fit.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: True wireless earphones\n\nTrue wireless earbuds can\u2019t match the bigger batteries and longer run times of over-ear models, but they are convenient and effective. It\u2019s still hard to beat Apple airpods, especially if you\u2019re an iPhone user. A bigger sound comes from the also excellent Beats powerBeats pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3 with built-in noise-cancelling are fantastic.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
