It was there that he stepped into the thick of an in-house squabble about the activities of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney who had been conversing with Ukrainian leaders outside of traditional U.S. diplomatic circles.\n\nKnown as a \u201chawk\u201d in national security circles, Morrison is set to be the first political appointee from the White House to testify before impeachment investigators. The probe has been denounced by the president, who has directed his staff not to testify.\n\nRegardless of what he says, GOP lawmakers will be hard-pressed to dismiss Morrison, formerly a longtime Republican staffer at the House Armed Services Committee. He\u2019s been bouncing around Washington in Republican positions for two decades, having worked for Rep. Mark Kennedy, R-Minn., Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and as a GOP senior staffer on the House Armed Services Committee, including nearly four years when it was chaired by Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas.\n\nMorrison\u2019s name appeared more than a dozen times in earlier testimony by William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador in Ukraine, who told impeachment investigators that Trump was withholding military aid unless the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, went public with a promise to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Taylor\u2019s testimony contradicts Trump\u2019s repeated denials that there was any quid pro quo.\n\nTaylor said Morrison recounted a conversation that Gordon Sondland, America\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, had with a top aide to Zelenskiy named Andriy Yermak. Taylor said Morrison told him security assistance would not materialize until Zelenskiy committed to investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that once employed Biden\u2019s son. A White House meeting for Zelenskiy also was in play.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland-Yermak conversation,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that the security assistance \u2014 not just the White House meeting \u2014 was conditioned on the investigations.\u201d\n\nTaylor testified that Morrison told him he had a \u201csinking feeling\u201d after learning about a Sept. 7 conversation Sondland had with Trump.\n\n\u201cAccording to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a quid pro quo,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cBut President Trump did insist that President Zelenskiy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskiy should want to do this himself. Mr. Morrison said that he told Ambassador Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this phone call between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland.\u201d\n\nMorrison told people after Bolton was forced out of his job that the national security adviser had tried to stop Giuliani\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Ukraine and that Morrison agreed, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss Morrison\u2019s role in the impeachment inquiry and spoke only on condition of anonymity. The official said Morrison told people that with the appointment of Robert O\u2019Brien as Bolton\u2019s successor, his own future work at the NSC was in a \u201cholding pattern.\u201d\n\nBolton had brought Morrison into the NSC in July 2018 as senior director for weapons of mass destruction and biodefence. He\u2019s known as an arms control expert or an arms treaty saboteur, depending on who you ask.\n\nMorrison, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Minnesota and a law degree from George Washington University, keeps nuclear strategist Herman Kahn\u2019s seminal volume on thermonuclear warfare on a table in his office.\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said Bolton and Morrison are likeminded. Kimball said both have been known for calling up GOP congressional offices warning them against saying anything about arms control that didn\u2019t align with their views.\n\n\u201cJust as John Bolton reportedly did, I would be shocked if Morrison did not regard Giuliani\u2019s activities as being out of bounds,\u201d said Kimball, who has been on opposite sides of arms control debates with Morrison for more than a decade.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller and Matthew Lee contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's top adviser for Russian and European affairs is leaving his job at the White House, a day before he's scheduled", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/78787e_trump-67129-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-walks-out-north-portico-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
