If someone is ill you can prepare yourself and say goodbye, but to go like this, there are no words to describe it. I will never get over it.\"\n\n(Image: Marcus Tisson)\n\n(Image: Marcus Tisson)\n\nMarcus last spoke to Margaret, who was 58 when she died, the day before her death - and desperately wishes she had spoken to someone about what she was going through.\n\n\"I just wish she had reached out and spoken to someone,\" he said.\n\n\"We could have helped her through it.\"\n\nOn August 21, 2016, the worst day of Marcus' life, he received a call from his aunt breaking the tragic news that his mum had died at Mile End station.\n\n(Image: Marcus Tisson)\n\nThe tragedy, and his dad's death soon after, left him reeling, anxious about showing his grief to his young children and unable to leave his home.\n\n\"I had really bad anxiety and PTSD,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't want to be around my children, I didn't want them to see me broken.\"\n\nMarcus, who teaches speech, language and literacy in a school, had long harboured a dream of going into comedy.\n\n\"Comedy saved my life,\" he said. \"It sounds strange, but it helps my anxiety.\n\n\"I always wanted to be a comedian, I was always the class clown, but taking to the stage is very different. It's like therapy to me.\"\n\n(Image: Marcus Tisson)\n\nHe started by cautiously going up onstage at an open mic night and telling a few jokes.\n\n\"Once I get my first laughs I was OK,\" he said.\n\nHe gave his first solo show, named Don't Call Me Crazy, at the start of October in London, and has more events lined up, including a set in Edinburgh.\n\n\"I want to be international,\" he said.\n\n\"I want to travel around the world and take this message about mental health.\n\n\"I was a bit worried about using my mental health as comedy, I don't want people to thinking I'm laughing at mental health, but I'm telling my truth, I'm telling my story.\n\n\"I talk about my parents, I talk about my own anxieties.\"\n\n(Image: Marcus Tisson)\n\nAnd Marcus said he has had positive feedback from people who say his comedy resonates with them.\n\n\"It's a daily struggle, I have to take it day-by-day,\" he said.\n\n\"I know that my parents would want me to strive and carry on making people happy and inspired.\"\n\nMarcus has set up a voluntary campaign group, Don't Suffer In Silence , and gives talks to businesses and schools to provide valuable help.\n\nHe also holds regular walks in East London's Victoria Park, and wants to help provide a support network for people with mental health issues.\n\nMarcus said: \"I'm not a professional, I'm not a counsellor, but I can send people to the right places.\n\n\"I think I'm making my parents proud.\"\n\n* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
