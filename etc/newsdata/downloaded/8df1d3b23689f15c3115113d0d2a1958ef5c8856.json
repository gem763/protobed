Collins: Pelosi, Schiff Acting \u2018Un-American\u2019 in Impeachment Effort", "language": "en", "text": "On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Briefing,\u201d Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, said the way House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Intelligence chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) are running the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump was \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nCollins said, \u201cThe Clinton investigation in the late \u201990s, the Nixon impeachment series, there was always a fairness issue, and the American people are beginning to see that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff like going behind closed doors where no one can examine what they are doing. Where they can only leak out information that they want to have, and nobody in this country believes that is American. They believe on a look at it on face value \u2014 they might even not like with the president is doing, but they do not believe that it should be done in an unfair way, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing right now.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf Speaker Pelosi is willing to put her house speakership the House majority on the line on the line, if she is willing to try to interfere in the 2020 election if she\u2019s willing to go forward to the American people and explain to the American people why she\u2019s being unfair, why she is being un-American, why she has not asked for due process, why she doesn\u2019t want to do it properly then that\u2019s the choice that she\u2019s going to have to make. But this president has been very clear in everything he has done. She\u2019s the one who is deceiving the American people, and we have to understand if she\u2019s wanting to do this on obstruction, she\u2019s doing what I call an Al Green impeachment. She is just writing up things, taking it to the floor to force her members to vote on it.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of Fox News Channel's \"The Daily Briefing,\"\u00a0Rep.
