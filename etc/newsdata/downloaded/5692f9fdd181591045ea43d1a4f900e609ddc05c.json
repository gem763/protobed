Martin Center for Academic Renewal", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think.\u201d \u2014Socrates\n\nClassical education\u2014a tradition of education with ancient roots\u2014is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to the current K-12 public education model. Its emphasis on reading the Great Books and making students active participants in their own education is appealing to parents and educators who seek not only to forms students\u2019 minds but their characters as well.\n\nOne of the most notable hallmarks of classical education, in both secondary and postsecondary schools, is the use of the Socratic method. Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, the Socratic method involves teachers posing questions to students, prompting them to think through what they know and deduce the most logical answer. It is distinct from the typical lecture model, where the student quietly takes notes as the teacher speaks.\n\nThe Socratic method is an effective tool for student learning, and it also embodies an ideal central to classical education\u2019s mission: intellectual humility\u2014an idea that was discussed at a recent meeting of classical educators in North Carolina.\n\nOn October 4th, educators from two K-12 education organizations, Thales Academy and the Institute for Classical Education, came together at the Regional Classical Symposium in an effort to \u201crenew classical education for the next generation\u201d in Rolesville, North Carolina.\n\nThe symposium\u2019s overarching theme was \u201cReading as Soul-Formation: How Great Books Change Lives.\u201d During the symposium, educators spoke about living the examined life, cultivating one\u2019s \u201cmoral imagination,\u201d and how words provide an understanding of objective reality.\n\nThe final talk of the day focused on ways teachers can use the Socratic method in their classrooms. The lecturer, professor Matthew Post of the University of Dallas, discussed Plato\u2019s Republic and its famous Socratic dialogues. Post explained that a Socratic seminar is a guided, focused discussion. \u201cYou\u2019re not being dictated to; you\u2019re being invited into a conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Post was speaking to an audience of classical educators, there are three main reasons why all teachers\u2014at the K-12 and university levels\u2014should incorporate the Socratic method into their teaching style.\n\nFirst, the Socratic method fosters an attitude of intellectual humility in students. When an instructor poses questions like \u201cWhat is the good?\u201d or \u201cWhat is wisdom?\u201d to his or her students, it forces them to confront their own ignorance and recognize the need to deepen their understanding.\n\nSecondly, the Socratic method encourages intellectual humility not only in students but in teachers also. This is because, by engaging in dialogue with their students, teachers are constantly being challenged to deepen their understanding of the subject matter\u2014an idea that Post emphasized in his talk.\n\nPost reminded teachers that they are \u201cco-learners\u201d with their students and that they aren\u2019t simply imparting knowledge, but also learning with them. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of who Socrates is: He wants to learn,\u201d Post said. In a video interview about classical education, Post explained:\n\nThe classical educator fosters\u2026love of inquiry by being a co-learner with the student; by doing their best to meet them where they are. And there\u2019s nothing condescending about this because the classical educator actually is learning.\n\nSocrates himself was a model of intellectual humility. Instead of considering himself an academic authority, he stated: \u201cI know nothing except the fact of my ignorance.\u201d In fact, he didn\u2019t think of himself as a \u201cteacher\u201d because he didn\u2019t believe that he gave students new information, but simply helped \u201cdraw out\u201d of them what they already knew. That\u2019s why he referred to his practice of conversing with students as his \u201cart of midwifery:\u201d\n\nAnd the highest point of my art is the power to prove by every test whether the offspring of a young man\u2019s thought is a false phantom or instinct with life and truth. I am so far like the midwife that I cannot myself give birth to wisdom\u2026\n\nHe continues:\n\nThose who frequent my company at first appear, some of them, quite unintelligent, but, as we go further with our discussions, all who are favored by heaven make progress at a rate that seems surprising to others as well as to themselves, although it is clear that they have never learned anything from me. The many admirable truths they bring to birth have been discovered by themselves from within.\n\nA third and final benefit of teaching via Socratic dialogue is that it can improve students\u2019 ability to learn and retain information. That\u2019s because Socratic discussion engages students in \u201cactive learning.\u201d Active learning takes place when students participate in the learning process instead of passively absorbing information.\n\nActive learning is shown to improve how students retain information, understand subject matter, and synthesize information to draw logical conclusions. According to research summarized by Pearson Education:\n\nOne of the strongest findings in the learning sciences is that recall and comprehension is greater if learners are frequently required to produce ideas rather than exclusively receiving information from an instructor or textbook.\n\nFortunately, institutions of higher education seem to be responding to the growing thirst for classical education. Indeed, several colleges offer programs that seek to educate current and future teachers in the ideals of classical education. Hillsdale College and Grove City College, for example, offer minors in classical education.\n\nAnd Post runs a classical teacher education program at the University of Dallas. The program\u2019s primary focus is on educating teachers in the history and philosophy of classical education, as well as the most effective pedagogies for the modern classroom. The university offers a master\u2019s program in classical education, a certificate program, and apprenticeships and practicum hours. One teacher said that the program gives teachers a \u201csense of purpose and renew[s] their commitment to the life of the mind.\u201d\n\nAll teachers\u2014and students\u2014would undoubtedly benefit from the \u201csense of purpose and commitment to the life of the mind,\u201d that a classical education provides and requires.\n\nIt\u2019s clear: Modern cognitive research affirms truths about human nature that Socrates recognized years ago: \u201c[E]ducation is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.\u201d He understood that education is not simply about giving students the \u201cright answers,\u201d but about compelling them to participate in the lifelong search for wisdom.\n\nShannon Watkins is senior writer at the James G.
