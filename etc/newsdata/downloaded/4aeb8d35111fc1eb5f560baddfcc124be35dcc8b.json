In a Sept. 1 text, Taylor expressed concern about a possible quid pro quo between the U.S. and Ukraine. Sondland responded by telling Taylor to \u201ccall me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring that phone call, Amb. Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President [Volodymyr] Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Taylor said Tuesday in his opening statement, obtained by the Post.\n\nBiden, who was formerly vice president to Barack Obama, is running for president in 2020, and until recently was leading in the Democratic primary. Biden\u2019s son Hunter was a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma until earlier this year.\n\nThe question of a quid pro quo is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, relating to a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky in which the U.S. president pressured the Ukrainian leader to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate the Biden family. The call came soon after Trump suspended nearly $400 million in already approved military aid to Ukraine.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) told reporters on Tuesday that Taylor \u201cdrew a direct line\u201d with the hearing, which she said included documents, timelines and records of individual conversations.\n\n\u201cI do not know how you would listen to today\u2019s testimony from Ambassador Taylor and come to any other [conclusion] except that the president abused his power and withheld foreign aid,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nRepublicans reportedly declined to share details of Taylor\u2019s testimony, but said Democrats are exaggerating about the level of damaging information provided.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that any of us, if we are being intellectually honest, are hearing revelations that we were not aware of,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said, according to the Times. \u201cThe bottom line is no one has yet to make the case for why the aid was withheld or even if the Ukrainians knew about it.\u201d\n\nRead Taylor\u2019s opening statement here:\n\nThis is a developing story.
