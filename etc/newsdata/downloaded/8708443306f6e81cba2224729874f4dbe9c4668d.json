The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them.\n\nThen, if the DUP will not support his deal, he will need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all.\n\nThat is still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents.\n\nThis time it is likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal.\n\nAll this still leaves the vote very close. And it is possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome.\n\nMeanwhile, Scotland's highest civil court, the Court of Session, is set to consider a legal bid to block Mr Johnson's deal.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners believe the deal contravenes existing legislation preventing Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory to the rest of the UK.\n\nElsewhere, the SNP has tabled an amendment to Mr Johnson's deal demanding an immediate extension to the 31 October deadline and a general election.\n\nThe SNP's parliamentary leader, Ian Blackford, said opposition parties need to \"quit dithering, back our amendment, and finally act to bring this appalling Tory government down and stop Brexit\".\n\nAnd former Prime Minister David Cameron has said he would have backed the deal if he was still an MP.\n\n\"I hope he'll get it through Parliament. I suspect he will but it will be tight.\"", "description": "The PM will try to persuade MPs to back his deal ahead of what is expected to be a knife-edge vote on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/45D5/production/_109277871_mediaitem109277868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
