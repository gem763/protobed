But when the families \u2014 who are not named \u2014 attempted to board, a staff member for NYC Ferry reportedly denied them \u201cbecause there was a security issue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the families probed further, a staffer for the commuter-ferry service reportedly said \u201csecurity\u201d had told her not to let them aboard. According to the complaint, two of the women in the group were wearing hijabs in addition to other religious clothing, and had \u201cpronounced accents.\"\n\nThe group was escorted to security as other passengers watched from the vessel. The public fiasco humiliated the families, the complaint states \u2014 including some of the children, who began to cry because they could not board the ship.\n\nAs the situation escalated, an employee reportedly told the families they were denied boarding because the children were standing on the seats. The complainants believed this was an \u201cafter-the-fact false excuse\u201d at the time, and NYC Ferry later admitted to them that the reasoning was false, the complaint reads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe families were eventually able to take a ferry back to Bay Ridge, about two hours later.\n\nNYC Ferry called the incident a \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d according to the complaint, and offered them reimbursement. But on behalf of the families, CAIR is seeking compensation for damages including \u201chumiliation, embarrassment and severe emotional distress.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, CAIR\u2019s New York litigation director, Ahmed Mohamed, said the families involved were \u201chumiliated and traumatized\u201d because of their Muslim beliefs. The complaint states NYC Ferry staff \u201chad reason to know\u201d the families\u2019 beliefs because of the clothing two of the women wore.\n\n\u201cAll New Yorkers, regardless of creed, deserve equal and fair service free of discrimination, especially when using public transportation like the NYC Ferry,\u201d Mohamed wrote. \u201cThese families were humiliated and traumatized in public view and treated as suspect because they happen to be Muslim. That is unacceptable. We hope the City will live up to its commitment of nondiscrimination and swiftly correct this injustice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew York City\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, which operates NYC Ferry, said Thursday that the city was investigating the incident. In addition to the commuter-ferry service, the complaint also accuses New York City and the Economic Development Corporation of discrimination.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination has no place in our city,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cThe City is investigating these allegations, and if they are proven true, will take swift and appropriate action to hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the NYC Commission on Human Rights confirmed it had received the complaint but declined to provide additional comment.\n\nRead More:\n\nAD", "description": "Two of the women in the group wore hijabs in addition to other religious clothing, according to the complaint.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eteNq1gRcmr59oykzjAAwFTAimM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VRDT4KHRDYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
