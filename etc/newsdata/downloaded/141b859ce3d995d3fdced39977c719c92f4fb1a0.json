(Oct. 26) AP\n\nA war of words has ignited between Jameela Jamil of \"The Good Place\" and Victoria's Secret model Sara Sampaio.\n\nThe two began clashing about the fashion industry on Twitter Tuesday, with Jamil slamming its treatment of women while Sampaio defended her fellow models.\n\nIt all began when Jamil retweeted a video of women smiling and dancing on a catwalk Saturday.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" she wrote, \"this looks like the most fun, and not a long-starved terrified teenager in sight. Beautiful.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Sampaio jumped in, taking issue with Jamil's characterization of models.\n\n\"How about celebrating someone without bringing other people down?\" she tweeted. \"Calling runway models 'long-starved terrified teenager' is extremely offensive. From someone that is always preaching for body positivity this just screams hypocrisy.\"\n\nHow about celebrating someone without bringing other people down?

Eating disorders, drugs and cocaine use aren\u2019t a exclusive problem of models, it\u2019s a huge problem is society as a whole.

While Jamil argued her comment was directed at the fashion industry in general, Sampaio accused her of bringing down some women in order to raise up others.\n\nSara, respectfully, I don\u2019t think this is the hill to die on. This industry is unlike other industries in that it makes professionals out of children, and informs culture and society, and is a standard set for young people everywhere. Fashion is a dangerous industry for too many. https://t.co/h0muUpRMtL \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 16, 2019\n\nAs the conversation ran its course, Sampaio said it didn't seem like they were on the same page.\n\n\"With all due respect right now it just feels like I\u2019m talking about apples and your talking about pears!\" she wrote. \"I think I\u2019ve been very clear in what I meant.\"\n\nMore: Jameela Jamil, Piers Morgan Twitter feud reignited over Duchess Meghan's Vogue issue\n\nMore: Valentina Sampaio announces she will be Victoria's Secret's first openly transgender model\n\nHow is saying to not deminish other people to celebrate others negative for girls?

Be better than that! \u2014 Sara Sampaio (@SaraSampaio) October 16, 2019\n\nA few more heated tweets later, their beef seemed to have died down.\n\nBut Jamil continued the argument Wednesday, posting a link to a news article about their spat.\n\nJamil said it was \"ridiculous\" their fight made headlines and tagged Sampaio in a tweet where she accused the model of missing her point. Rather than \"taking aim at kids,\" Jamil said her target was \"this (unbelievably (expletive)) industry.\"\n\nMore: Victoria's Secret just got its first plus-sized model: 'It felt surreal'\n\nAfter a few more heated back-and-forths, Sampaio said she was done responding.\n\n\"This is the last I\u2019ll say on this,\" she wrote. \"Your constant condescending tone is just unnecessary, and makes it impossible to actual have a conversation.
