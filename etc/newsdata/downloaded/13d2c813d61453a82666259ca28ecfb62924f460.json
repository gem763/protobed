ETH price is likely to continue higher towards the $200 and $205 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nAfter testing the $175 support, Ethereum started a steady rise above the $180 resistance. Moreover, there was a break above the $185 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nThe price even broke the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $199 high to $174 low. It opened the doors for more gains above $190. The price tested the $194 area and it is currently correcting lower.\n\nAn immediate support is near the $188 level. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $184 low to $193 high is also near the $188 level. More importantly, there is a new bullish trend line forming with support near $187 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThere is also a new bullish trend line forming with support near $187 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line coincides with the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $184 low to $193 high.\n\nTherefore, a downside break below the $187 level might push Ethereum towards the $182 support area. The 100 hourly SMA is also near the $182 level to provide support.\n\nOn the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $195 level. A clear break above the $195 level could set the pace for more gains above the $198 and $200 resistance levels. If there are more upsides, the next stop for the bulls may perhaps be near the $205-$206 zone.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly climbing steadily above the $188 and $190 levels. Thus, there are high chances of an upside break above the last swing high near $200. Conversely, if there is a downside correction, the price could dip towards the $188 support area. The main support is now near the $182 level and the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is correcting lower and it could soon test the 55 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $182\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $195", "description": "Ethereum price is trading in an uptrend above $185 versus the US Dollar, while bitcoin is consolidating.
