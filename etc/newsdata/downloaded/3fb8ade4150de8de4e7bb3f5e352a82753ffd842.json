It was the start of a new semester for students in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, but protest organizers told CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio that as many as 10,000 students from 200 schools were skipping class.\n\nHigh school students at one rally told CBS News they were grateful for the support they've received from other Hong Kongers. But the demonstrations over China's perceived efforts to curtail the city's unique freedoms come after a weekend of chaos.\n\nThousands of protesters swarmed Hong Kong's airport Sunday in an effort to shut it down again, and force the world to pay attention to their demands.\n\nThis time they were prevented from entering the terminal buildings because of a court injunction, so they blocked traffic instead, and threw objects onto the airport link's rails, shutting down the service.\n\nHong Kong protesters clash with police in vicious fight after defying ban\n\nProtesters built barricades to block the airport rail service just one stop away from the airport itself. The action forced many travelers to make the 45 minute trek to the airport from that point on foot.\n\nRiot police gathered down the road, and it looked like things were heading for a confrontation. In the end there was no clash, and although about two-dozen flights were cancelled, the airport managed to remain open and operational.\n\nSaturday was more violent, with protesters assaulting government headquarters. They threw bricks and fire bombs. Police fired back with tear gas and water cannon that were tinted with blue dye, so those hit could be easily identified later.\n\nUndercover police were attacked by protesters, and again they fired warning shots. In the subway, the police beat and pepper sprayed screaming passengers.\n\nThousands of Hong Kong protesters defy police ban to march for 13th week of protests\n\nInocencio says Hong Kong's police, once so respected, are now distrusted\u2026even feared.\n\nOn Monday an editorial in Chinese state media warned \"the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong.\"\n\nIt didn't give detail on any specific upcoming action, but it could be referring to a potential crackdown by Chinese troops, who have massed both inside Hong Kong territory, and just across the border in southern China.", "description": "Pro-democracy movement soldiers on after violent weekend clashes, but Beijing is sending more signals that a major crackdown could be imminent", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/1d9ef291-f287-41d8-bba2-46c6b9041ffa/thumbnail/1200x630/3f49a0aec413c06df80127f6bb8b8dd0/hong-kong-1165624976.jpg"}
