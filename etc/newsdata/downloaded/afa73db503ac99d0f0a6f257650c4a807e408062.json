The report states:\n\n\u201cAs enterprises began writing detection rules to block those emails, threat actors modified the text by replacing it with an image, which prevented key words from being identified by Secure Email Gateways (SEGs). The bitcoin address was left as a plain text string in the email, so it could be easily copied.\u201d\n\nCompromising browser history as leverage\n\nPer the report, perpetrators of \u201csextortion\u201d usually claim that they have installed some kind of spying malware on potential victims\u2019 devices and gained access to allegedly compromising browsing history and webcam footage.\n\nIn the past, scammers usually demanded ransom in Bitcoins \u2014 threatening to release damaging information to family, friends and co-workers of the victim. Malicious actors\u2019 claims were further solidified by the fact that they often had access to recipients\u2019 emails from password breach lists which sometimes include passwords to lend authenticity, the report states.\n\nAccording to Cofense, contemporary email filters are forcing scammers to search for other means of ransom delivery such as Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies, adding:\n\n\u201cThis latest sextortion version is using a Litecoin wallet address instead of bitcoin to evade detection. Previous iterations showed a gradual shift away from identifiable patterns and to alternative crypto currencies, in an attempt to foil SEG bitcoin-detection rules. The current emails appear to be crafted to contain very few searchable word patterns.\u201d\n\nLarge variety of crypto assets on demand\n\nIt is also noted that scammers will most likely continue switching their chosen means of crypto payments, although they are somewhat limited by any given coin\u2019s availability on major exchanges, the report claims:\n\n\u201cWhile there are thousands of crypto currencies, only a dozen or so are easily attainable from large exchanges. For the scam to work, the recipient needs an easy way to acquire the requested payment method.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, Cofense states that in most cases users can safely ignore ransom and phishing emails, noting that \u201cif threat actors actually had such access and data, they would include stronger proof.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 27, scammers asked British citizens for nearly $2.5 million in Bitcoin, claiming that the funds will be spent to maintain the local economy after Brexit.", "description": "Litecoin and other alts are becoming increasaingly prevalent among crypto \u201csextortionists\u201d since they allow to avoid detection more easily, a new research says", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy84NjAxMmNiOWI4OGY2OTJiYWM2NTY2NDg3NTIxOWMyNS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
