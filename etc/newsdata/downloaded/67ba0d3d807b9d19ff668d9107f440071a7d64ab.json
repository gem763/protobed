The company said disposals of a 10% and a 30% interests in the Arctic LNG 2 project in March and July amounted to RUB675.0 billion taken together.\n\nRevenue for the quarter fell 14% to RUB189.16 billion from RUB219.37 billion a year earlier due to lower hydrocarbon prices, Novatek said. Production volumes increased due to the launch at the second and third LNG trains at the Yamal LNG project in Russia.\n\nWrite to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayudvaello@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 07:35 ET (11:35 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
