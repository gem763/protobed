(Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/TODD GREENE)\n\nFollowing July's powerful California earthquakes, a utility crew on a private road made a remarkable find: a 600-pound stone block encasing a fossil of a large torso that scientists believe probably dates back 15 million years.\n\nThe scientists think the July 4 earthquake \u2014 magnitude 6.4 \u2014 and the July 5 earthquake \u2014 magnitude 7.1 \u2014 in Kern County dislodged the 4-foot-long block from the Tapo Canyon area, causing it to roll down into the Simi Valley.\n\nRussell Shapiro, professor of paleontology at CSU Chico, believes the fossil could be a small whale, the kind that swam in the Pacific Ocean when it covered the Simi Valley area and coastal Southern California millions of years ago.\n\nBut he's not certain because the creature's head hasn't been found.\n\n\"I really want to go back and look for it,\" Shapiro said with a laugh.\n\nThus, he said, the fossil could be a sea hippo, a species that also lived in the Pacific when the Simi Valley area was underneath it.\n\n\"We're confident that this rock is of the Miocene age,\" which ranges from 23 million years ago to 5.3 million years ago, he said.\n\n\"We think this particular one is probably about 15 million years old,\" he said.\n\nShapiro said he's excited \"by how much material is in the large block. It's not just a few random bones.\n\n\"But we would be more excited if there was a head,\" he said.\n\nThe fossil \"will definitely add to our knowledge of the area,\" he said. \"And it could be very important for future study.\"\n\nA 600-pound stone block encasing a 15-million-year-old fossil was found on a private road in Simi Valley following July's Ridgrecrest earthquakes.

Such fossils on public lands cannot be collected or willfully destroyed, he said. But such fossils on private property belong to the property's owner, he said.\n\nIn this case, the owner gave the team permission to take the 600-pound block encasing the fossil, he said.\n\nThe owner also gave them permission to take a couple dozen smaller such blocks they had found there.\n\nBut only about 12 of those were deemed significant enough to take back to CSU Chico, Shapiro said.\n\n\"We only chose to collect the ones that either have the potential to be identified or were large vertebrae\" \u2014 a creature with a backbone \u2014 he said.\n\nThey included a 200-pound block with a whale vertebrae, he said.\n\nThe rest of the smaller blocks were left at the site, Shapiro said.\n\nExperts pose with the 600-pound stone block encasing a torso fossil, found in July in Simi Valley.

And in most vertebraes, they're not. But that's one of the key figures of whales because they don't need a neck under water.\"\n\n\"So the neck looks like a whale,\" he said. \"But the ribs don't look like whale ribs. That's where I'm stumped.\"\n\nThat's why he thinks it might be a sea hippo, known as a Desmostylidae.\n\n\"I've actually collected Desmostylidae fossils in the Ojai area,\" he said.\n\nDoes Shapiro think experts will positively identify the fossil one day?\n\n\"I think we will actually,\" he said. \"I think that even though we're missing the head, by comparing it to specimens at other museums, you might find that there are some key characteristics that I just don't know.\n\n\"I think there's so much material that's so well-preserved that somebody who is a specialist in whale or other marine mammals could look at it and know what it is,\" he said.\n\nRise of the mammals: Trove of 66-million-year-old fossils discovered from post-dinosaur era\n\nWhere did we come from?: Fossils discovered in South Africa are the 'missing link' in human evolution\n\nFossil to be part of exhibition\n\nThe Simi Valley torso fossil, and some of the others, are scheduled to be displayed at the Gateway Science Museum on the CSU Chico campus starting next summer, Shapiro said.\n\nThey will be part of an 18-month exhibition of California fossils, he said.\n\n\"The nice thing about this fossil is that it's rock hard,\" he said. \"So if you ever want a fossil for kids to touch without damaging it, they can do it with this one.\"\n\nAfter the exhibition, the fossils will be stored at the university in an area for experts to study but off-limits to the public, he said.\n\nFollow Mike Harris on Twitter: @Mike___Harris\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/26/california-earthquakes-july-reveal-mysterious-fossil-simi-valley/2468723001/", "description": "Two powerful earthquakes in Kern County may have dislodged the fossil from the Tapo Canyon area, causing it to roll down into the Simi Valley.", "authors": ["Mike Harris", "Published P.M.
