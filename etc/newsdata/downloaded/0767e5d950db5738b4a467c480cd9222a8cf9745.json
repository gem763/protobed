The first article includes a custom screen of 25 dividend stocks. The third includes advice about which high-dividend stocks to avoid. In the fourth piece, Fabio Paolini of Pictet Asset Management disagrees with the focus on dividend stocks but also favors three with very high yields.)\n\nFor investors who have been hungry for income, today\u2019s low interest rates have erased many options from the menu.\n\nThat\u2019s where Federated Investors\u2019 Daniel Peris comes in.\n\nPeris, head of the Strategic Value Dividend Team at Federated, takes a different approach, focusing on providing an increasing income stream to shareholders of three mutual funds he co-manages.\n\nThose include the $9.5 billion Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund SVALX, +0.36%, the $423 million Federated International Strategic Value Dividend Fund IVFLX, +0.60% and the Federated Global Strategic Value Dividend Fund GVDLX, +0.59%, which is much smaller, with $1.6 million in total assets and was established in January 2017. Including private and institutional accounts and advisory relationships, Peris\u2019 team manages about $30 billion.\n\nThe Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund is focused on the U.S. market, with the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index DJDVP, -0.29% as a benchmark. The Federated International Strategic Value Dividend Fund is made up of non-U.S. stocks, and its benchmark is the MSCI World ex-U.S. High Dividend Yield Index. The Federated Global Strategic Value Dividend Fund, as its name implies, includes U.S. and non-U.S. stocks; its benchmark is the MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index. IVFLX, +0.60%\n\nFocusing on income\n\nPeris said the main objective of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund is to provide shareholders a monthly income stream, while also aiming for capital growth over the long term. An important goal of the fund is to increase the portfolio yield (before fees) by 4% to 5% a year, and Peris expects share-price appreciation to match dividend appreciation.\n\nThe 30-day SEC yield for the fund\u2019s R6 shares (the share class with the lowest annual expense ratio of 0.79%) is 4.17%, however, Peris said the 30-day yield, which looks backwards, \u201cis almost impossible to experience.\u201d\n\nIt may be more reasonable to look at the fund\u2019s weighted average dividend yield of 4.67% in the second quarter. The fund distributes all of its income, so it is not as simple as subtracting the 0.79% in annual expenses from the portfolio yield. The expenses come out of the fund\u2019s total assets. If we were to subtract the annual expense ratio from the second-quarter portfolio yield, we would have a yield of 3.88%. That is an attractive yield in this environment, considering the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.17% is 1.53% and the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.04% is 2.02%. (The weighted aggregate yield for the S&P 500 is 2.05%, according to FactSet.)\n\nFor the class R shares, dividends distributed during 2018 totaled 27 cents a share. If we divide this by the closing price of $6.15 on Dec. 29, 2017, we have a dividend yield of 4.39% for 2018.\n\nLooking further back, annual dividend distributions for the Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund\u2019s Class R shares increased 8% in 2018, after increasing 9% in 2017. The Class R shares were launched in June 2016.\n\nIt is important to look at the annual distributions, because those include special dividends that can vary greatly by company, industry and even for the entire market from year to year. The fund\u2019s institutional shares SVAIX, +0.36% have a longer track record (and a current annual expense ratio of 0.81%). Here are annual dividend distributions per share over the past five years, according to FactSet:\n\nYear Dividends distributed per share Increase from previous year 2018 $0.27 8% 2017 $0.25 9% 2016 $0.23 0% 2015 $0.23 -4% 2014 $0.24 0% Source: FactSet\n\nSelecting stocks\n\nPeris said he and his team look for companies with \u201ca clear path to dividend growth,\u201d and try to avoid companies that may be likely to cut their dividend payouts.\n\nMany managers will look for companies with ratios of dividends to free cash flow that aren\u2019t very high, to be comfortable that there is headroom to increase dividends. But Peris said companies with high payout ratios are typically attractive to him, because \u201cthey have less cash available for buybacks.\u201d\n\nWhile being careful to emphasize that he wasn\u2019t looking to \u201cstarve\u201d companies of cash they need to reinvest in their businesses, Peris said, \u201conce they have made all their relative investments, we are inclined to ask for the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. stock market is set up completely differently, where free cash is spent on repurchases,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about how he decides when to sell a stock, Peris said: \u201cOver the past 10 years, the vast majority of exits has been companies whose price appreciation has been way ahead of the dividend increase rate.\u201d\n\nTop holdings\n\nHere are the top 10 holdings (of 41) of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund as of July 31:\n\nHere are the top 10 holdings (of 43) of the Federated International Strategic Value Dividend Fund as of July 31:\n\nIncome and yield-to-cost\n\nRather than pointing out that a focus on total return may be best for long-term investors seeking growth, we have looked at income \u2014 and increasing income \u2014 in this article. Peris said it was \u201csuper important\u201d for investors to understand yield-to-cost. If you buy shares of a company that later raises its dividend, the current yield may not increase if the shares have risen, but your yield, based on what you paid for your shares, will increase. The same will be true for a mutual fund that increases its dividend distributions.\n\nAn excellent example of how patience can pay off is provided by Southern Co. SO, +2.59%, the ninth-largest holding of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund.\n\nIf you had purchased shares of Southern on Aug. 22, 2014, you would have paid $43.68 a share. The quarterly dividend at that time was $0.525 a share, for a yield of 4.81%. The share price on Aug. 23, 2019, was $57.68. The current quarterly dividend distribution rate for Southern is 62 cents a share. So the current yield has declined to 4.30%. If you didn\u2019t reinvest the dividends, your yield-to-cost would have increased to 5.68%. That is an attractive yield in this environment, and in this case you would also have enjoyed capital appreciation of 32% over the five years.\n\nMore about dividend stocks in a world of low interest rates:\n\n\u2022 25 dividend stocks selected for value by an outperforming money manager\n\n\u2022 Seeking attractive dividend stocks?
