Ready to pack up and go at a moment\u2019s notice. Ready to lose it all, sometimes again.\n\nThis year, they added a new item to their checklists: ready to live without power, sometimes for days on end.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had to evacuate through flames and the sky is black and there\u2019s fire all around you, it\u2019s absolutely terrifying,\u201d said Nancy Hallman, 65. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to clear, be ready, be vigilant, be careful. Turn off the lights if you have to.\u201d\n\nWildfire rages in northern California as power shutoffs sweep the state Read more\n\nHallman works at Howell Mountain Market and Deli in Angwin, a 4.9-square mile community nestled in the forested hills of the Napa county wine region, north of San Francisco. While a wildfire was raging less than 50 miles away and other areas in the region were hit by planned power shutoffs, life continued as usual in the brightly lit, air-conditioned store.\n\nThat\u2019s because the store sits in the heart of one of two of Pacific Gas & Electric\u2019s resilience zones, areas designed by the utility to be quickly isolated from the broader electric grid during shutoffs so that they can receive power from a PG&E-installed interconnection hub.\n\nEarlier this month, PG&E cut power to more than 2 million people in an effort to prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires amid high-risk weather. On Wednesday, it began rolling blackouts that affected a half-million people, or nearly 180,000 customers, and warned that a second round of outages could occur over the weekend when even stronger winds are expected in the region.\n\nPlay Video 0:44 California: wind-driven Kincade wildfire forces evacuations in north of state \u2013 video\n\nThe utility has presented the blackouts as an imperfect but necessary tool to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, and experts warn they could soon become the new normal during fire season in parts of the state. (PG&E declared bankruptcy in January, in part because of potential liabilities from its role in some of the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire.)\n\nIn January, PG&E announced that it would create its first resilience zone in Angwin. If blackouts are the utility\u2019s stopgap solution to wildfires, then resilience zones are the answer to the challenges blackouts present in turn: portions of the grid that can keep going with mobile power generation when the rest of the power shuts off. PG&E hardened its infrastructure in Angwin to withstand high winds, with some lines undergrounded, and others upgraded, in order to \u201callow for important emergency and community services such as first responders, grocery stores, and gas stations to remain energized\u201d.\n\nWildfires burning during a climate crisis means certain death and destruction. Resilience zones are a kind of mitigation strategy for the mitigation strategy. For PG&E, and for some local residents, this is California\u2019s future.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Capt Eli Cronbach, a firefighter with the city of Napa, lets Dylan Ramirez, six, spray water as crews work to contain the American Fire in American Canyon, California, early this month.

We\u2019re definitely bringing more generators in because people want to live their normal lives when the outages happen.\u201d\n\nEven after just the second shutoff of the month, the blackouts have begun to feel almost normal, Kim said. \u201cThe first day is when everybody is talking about it.\u201d she said. \u201cNow people are coming in regularly, getting more ice, more hot food from the deli.\u201d\n\nPetra Hartman used the resilience zone in Angwin for her real estate work during the shutoff, but she was unhappy about it. She typically works from home, and it\u2019s a long distance to drive and use somebody else\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient,\u201d Hartmans said.\n\n\u201cLast time, it was terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time I understand a little bit better why it has to be done. The wind was kind of tough. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessary to bring it in for the whole day. We don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have power.\u201d\n\nKim lost her rental home in the Valley Fire in 2015. Everybody in this community, she said, has a personal experience with fire.\n\n\u201cI know there are a lot of upset people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the end, I\u2019d rather be in an outage than to have a fire happen because the power wasn\u2019t shut off.\u201d\n\nSusie Cagle contributed reporting from Oakland", "description": "As more blackouts loom, some are lucky enough to live near \u2018resilience zones\u2019 with power hubs of their own", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de2fcac4d90ea22c034747a786d6230ed5b8d1cd/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d99d4069917511955cf9bcf22e92a57", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
