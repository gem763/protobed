Lobbyist", "language": "en", "text": "When Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, R. Hunter Biden, joined the board of a private Ukrainian oil and natural gas company this spring, he explained his new job as a legal one, disconnected from any effort to influence the Obama Administration. In a press release, the younger Biden boasted of his abilities on issues like improving corporate transparency.\n\nBut the company, Burisma Holdings, did not disclose at the time the scope of their plans for influencing the U.S. government. Recently released documents show that Biden\u2019s hiring coincided with the launch of a new effort to lobby members of Congress about the role of the company in Ukraine and the country\u2019s quest for energy independence.\n\nDavid Leiter, a former Senate chief of staff to Secretary of State John Kerry, signed on to work as a lobbyist for Burisma on May 20, 2014, about a week after Biden announced he was joining the company, according to lobbying disclosures filed this month.\n\nLeiter\u2019s involvement in the firm rounds out a power-packed team of politically-connected Americans that also includes a second new board member, Devon Archer, a Democratic bundler and former adviser to John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign. Both Archer and Hunter Biden have worked as business partners with Kerry\u2019s son-in-law, Christopher Heinz, the founding partner of Rosemont Capital, a private-equity company.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

On June 27, Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, wrote President Obama a letter with three other Democratic senators calling for increased aid. \u201cWe should leverage the full resources and expertise of the U.S. government to assist Ukraine in improving its energy efficiency, increasing its domestic production, and reforming its energy markets,\u201d wrote Markey, who has also proposed legislation with about $40 million in additional aide for Ukranian energy development.\n\nMarkey\u2019s letter was trumpeted by Burisma Holdings as a commendable move towards securing the future security of Ukraine. \u201cBurisma Holdings today applauded the range of U.S. legislative support for development of Ukraine\u2019s broad and untapped resources and an increase in transparency and good governance,\u201d the company said in a statement on the day the letter was released.\n\nAn aide in Markey\u2019s office told TIME that Leiter, Biden and Archer were not part of discussions that led to the drafting of the letter or the legislation. Staff for the other senators who signed the letter, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Christopher Murphy of Connecticut, also said they did not have contact with Leiter, who could not be reached for comment.\n\nBurisma Holdings is owned by a Cypriot holding firm, Brociti Investments Limited, which is controlled Nikolai Zlochevskyi, a former Ukranian government minister, according to Cypriot records. It controls government development licenses in three regions of Ukraine, and sells to industrial customers in the country, according to the company.\n\nBy taking a job with Burisma, the younger Biden has put himself in the middle of a struggle between the United States and Russia, which currently provides the bulk of the natural gas supplies to Ukraine. Both the White House and European nations have recently emphasized the strategic interest in making Ukraine less dependent on Russia.\n\nSince Hunter Biden took the new job, his father, Vice President Joe Biden, has continued to serve as the Obama Administration\u2019s point person on Ukraine, traveling to the country as recently as June for the inauguration of President Petro Poroshenko and talking to Poroshenko by phone at least five times in the last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time in the last two months in Ukraine,\u201d the elder Biden said on June 19. \u201cYou see what the Russians are doing relative to using gas as a foreign policy tool to try to alter behavior. And so it\u2019s \u2014 around the world in varying degrees it\u2019s of significant consequence in terms of security, both economic and political security of a nation.\u201d\n\nThere is no legal barrier to prohibit Hunter Biden from working with a company that can be impacted by the policy decisions of his father, and the White House has maintained that the Vice President has not been influenced by his son\u2019s employment. \u201cThe Vice President does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company,\u201d said his spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff.\n\nBut Hunter Biden\u2019s new job, along with the association with Burisma of other politically-connected businessmen, has raised concerns among some Ukraine watchers. \u201cIt\u2019s unhelpful when we are trying to get across to the Ukrainians to clean up corruption and special deals for special folks,\u201d said Ed Chow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a U.S. think tank. \u201cIt maybe sends the wrong message that Westerners are just hypocritical.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Rogers and Zeke Miller/Washington\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "An obscure private Ukrainian natural gas company has been hiring friends and family of Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden, while seeking to influence Congress", "authors": ["Michael Scherer"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/hunter-biden-ukraine.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2014-07-08"}
