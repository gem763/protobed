On several occasions in the past few months, Allen and former coach Jay Gruden said they expected Williams to return to the team at some point this season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut ahead of Tuesday\u2019s trade deadline, and with its record at 1-7, the team relented on its season-long stance that it would not trade Williams, according to multiple people with knowledge of the Redskins\u2019 thinking. There remained skepticism around the league that a team would be willing to meet Washington\u2019s substantial asking price, with one person describing the Redskins as looking for a \u201cblockbuster\u201d deal.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns pursued Williams heavily in the lead-up to the 4 p.m. deadline, with General Manager John Dorsey having previously acknowledged his interest in Williams. But the Browns were wary of surrendering the first-round draft pick \u2014 or more \u2014 that it probably would have taken to convince the Redskins to trade Williams, according to one person with knowledge of the deliberations.\n\nThe two sides couldn\u2019t come to an agreement as the final seconds of the deadline counted down, and word came out minutes later that Williams was coming back to the team.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilliams has spent his entire career with Washington after being drafted with the fourth overall pick in 2010 out of Oklahoma. He has been perhaps the team\u2019s best offensive player during that period, earning seven trips to the Pro Bowl.\n\nThe Redskins have struggled mightily on offense without him this season. Their averages of 12.4 points and 261.1 yards both rank 30th in the NFL, and they have turned the ball over 14 times in eight games. Gruden was fired after just five games, and interim head coach Bill Callahan has made the running game a priority since taking over. Veteran Donald Penn, signed during training camp, has been starting in Williams\u2019s place.\n\nIt is not yet clear if Williams will be on the team\u2019s active roster for Sunday\u2019s game at the Buffalo Bills.\n\nAD\n\nBy reporting to the team, Williams is credited with a year toward his free agent status, meaning he will not be tied to the Redskins for an additional year beyond the end of the 2020 season, which is when his contract ends and he will be eligible for unrestricted free agency. Williams missed eight weeks and is to make a little more than $5.7 million in salary for the remainder of this season, or nine-seventeenths of his full-season salary of $10.85 million. His contract also contains bonuses of $15,625 per game. He has a $12.5 million salary for 2020.\n\nAD\n\nWilliams\u2019s holdout could cost him a substantial portion of his signing bonus, lost salary and bonus money and fines imposed by the Redskins. NFL teams sometimes reach settlements with players when they end holdouts. It was not immediately clear if the Redskins and Williams made any such arrangements.\n\nWhile Williams\u2019s standoff with the team was partly because of his health scare and broader concerns with the team\u2019s medical staff, it was just one of several things that had Williams frustrated, two people with knowledge of Williams\u2019s thinking said this summer. That led Williams to ask the team for either a trade or a new contract that would provide him with better financial security. The Redskins declined both requests, and Williams\u2019s holdout began.\n\nAD\n\nWilliams has not spoken publicly about the reasons for his holdout.\n\nAD\n\nThe Redskins did not make any trades ahead of Tuesday\u2019s deadline, despite having conversations with other teams. A person with knowledge of the situation said the Redskins did get one offer for running back Adrian Peterson that they declined. Cornerback Josh Norman was a frequent subject of trade speculation, but he also remains with the team.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington had been having trade discussions with teams about its star left tackle, who held out during all offseason workouts and the season's first eight games.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ba9IOXhsoW0P_YaNaQLkaZfvxY4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAJNOBVOIUI6TPC4445WAPT7HA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
