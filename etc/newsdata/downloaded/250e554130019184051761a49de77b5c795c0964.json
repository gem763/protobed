I hope they ramp up the mutants and scares next year.\n\nThe ghouls were especially enamored with a victim\u2019s long hair this year as I was harassed multiple times. An executioner was even so bold to come up, grab my locks and declare, \u201cI wonder if the pretty hair comes with a head so I can see it all roll.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Nocturnal Wasteland \u2014 A sweaty and exhaustive 15-minute walk greets guests as they survive a 3/4-acre twisting, forested gauntlet of horror filled with killers, hungry creatures and environmental challenges while they escape through tunnels, cages, multiple abandoned vehicles and catwalks.\n\nVisitors even pass over the Haunted Hayride and must avoid the long-range attacks of a \u201cMad Max\u201d-style ghoul shooting air blasts at them.\n\nIn addition to the new Deadwood Cemetery, complete with life-size angel gravestone statues, and an updated butcher shop, the attraction also boasts a much bigger neon-green swamp illusion than last year. It gives visitors the effect that they are waist-deep in water as they walk by an abandoned fishing boat.\n\nHowever the scariest part of the journey was listening to the cries and pleas of \u201csorry\u201d from a younger child further behind me. His father and older sibling were laughing at him throughout with only some occasional sympathy. Just another BIG reminder to parents that these attractions are really scary, and younger children who are easily frightened should be discouraged from attending.\n\nThe attractions round out with a pair of haunted houses \u2014 Frightmare Asylum and Den of Darkness \u2014 that each offer a roughly 12-minute, multistory walkthrough that is not recommended for the physically challenged or faint of heart.\n\nThe Den is a mid-19th century, converted barn-turned-mansion housing a doll shop, butchery, claustrophobic attic and new dining room with a main course that will make the weak of stomach urp.\n\nThe Asylum features a maze of nurses, clowns, holding pens, a reanimation lab, a crazed dentist office and multiple autopsy tables with (politically incorrect alert) live female victims being tortured and a sickly sweet smell throughout (like one might find in a humidity-drenched basement morgue).\n\nHowever, the biggest surprise this year had nothing to do with the attractions.\n\nThe brothers have added a second story to the merchandising area and a roughly 75-foot-tall steel grain silo with the \u201cField of Screams\u201d banner illuminated at the top.\n\nThe extra story is the headquarters of the operation and actually a monitoring station loaded with video screens that cover much of the area and help with line and crowd control during the nights.\n\nThe silo acts as a watchtower for Gene and Jim Schopf as they use a spiral staircase (with metallic webbing for stairs no less) and a ladder on its outside to get to the top and admire their fiefdom.\n\nI can easily see the boys working this into some sort of special access attraction at next season\u2019s opening.\n\nAs per tradition each year, I pick my favorite ghoul, and this season it goes to a weird super-skinny guy with a long blond beard dressed in a nurse outfit.\n\nStrategically hidden in the Frightmare Asylum, he slowly moved in front of me and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a matter? Never seen a pretty girl before?\u201d\n\nNote: My most important suggestion is get to the event early, especially during peak nights near Halloween. The park had a record 10,000 folks show up on one evening last year.\n\nIF YOU DARE GO\n\nWhat: Field of Screams\n\nWhere: 191 College Ave., Mountville, PA 17554\n\nFear factor (out of 5): 4.5 for adults; children younger than 12 need to stay away.\n\nHours: Open weekends rain or shine through Nov. 9 \u2014 Friday, Saturday, Sunday and select Thursdays; also, open until the last person is through attractions.\n\nPrice range: $16 to $20 for individual attractions to $35 for a \u201cScream Pass\u201d accessing all four attractions (look online for price variations and daily deal sites to find less wallet-bleeding pricing).
