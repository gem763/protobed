The 10 best films about aliens Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 10 best films about aliens 1/10 The Blob (1958; Irvin Yeaworth) So eager are we to plant metaphors onto alien movies that The Blob has been referred to as everything from an analogy for the Cold War to a grim warning against the perils of capitalism. But it\u2019s also very much about a giant blob of goo that consumes everything in its wake. A pre-fame Steve McQueen in his feature film debut is the preppie high-schooler facing off against the aggressive alien entity. Burt Bacharach sings the film\u2019s theme song\u00ac \u2013 driving home The Blob\u2019s kitsch, drive-in-movie charm. 2/10 The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976; Nicholas Roeg) If the experience of being abducted by aliens was translated into a cinematic mood, it would result in something like The Man Who Fell to Earth. It dispenses with all logic and concept of linear time, and instead takes place in a kind of unmoored netherworld (Nicholas Roeg fans will recognise and appreciate it immediately). And its power is punctuated, of course, by the presence of David Bowie, who is beautiful and uncanny, and perfectly cast. Rex Features 3/10 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978; Philip Kaufman) We\u2019re long-overdue a new remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The pod-people premise is effortlessly translated into new decades, and spun into powerful new metaphors for modern threats. But of the many incarnations of Jack Finney\u2019s novel, it\u2019s Philip Kaufman\u2019s 1978 adaptation that remains its most terrifying and daring, exploiting the Cold War paranoia of the era and building to a devastatingly brutal final twist. Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and a young Jeff Goldblum are among the stars confronted with an alien invasion that replaces the world\u2019s populace with mindless doppelg\u00e4ngers. Rex 4/10 Alien (1979; Ridley Scott) The original and still the best. And not just in terms of the long-running Alien franchise, but the alien genre as a whole. Chilly and sparse, with moments of languid contemplation interrupted by bloody carnage, Alien is both a haunted house movie and delicate meditation on life, power and authority. HR Giger\u2019s ubiquitous design work remains terrifying, and Sigourney Weaver is an instant star as the compassionate and smart Ellen Ripley. Rex Features 5/10 ET: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982; Steven Spielberg) A film that taught a generation of children (and, if we\u2019re being honest, their parents) the importance of friendship, whether shared with an intergalactic gremlin or not. ET is magical cinema and the finest distillation of Steven Spielberg\u2019s power as a filmmaker \u2013 emotional but never cloying, otherworldly but always resolutely human, and with a deep understanding and respect for child-like wonder. Anyone who isn\u2019t in a puddle of tears by its conclusion is, I think according to international law, an irredeemable monster. GETTY IMAGES 6/10 Liquid Sky (1982; Slava Tsukerman) Liquid Sky is a fluorescent revenge tale, a hyper-stylised fever dream, and the most vivid depiction of New York\u2019s underground no-wave scene in the early 1980s. It sees aliens arriving in New York in search of heroin, only to discover better highs via the human orgasm. Meanwhile an aspiring, put-upon model learns that alien powers can be a tool to rid the world of bad people. Liquid Sky touches on sex, drugs, art and androgyny, with eye-candy set design and a transfixing lead performance from Anne Carlisle. 7/10 Starman (1984; John Carpenter) Starman is ET if ET was an incredibly handsome 30-something man who looks uncannily like your dead ex. A radical departure for John Carpenter, this 1984 romantic drama sees Karen Allen\u2019s grief-stricken widow spooked and then saved by the arrival of an alien who takes the form of her dead husband. An Oscar-nominated Jeff Bridges stars as the Starman of the title; he is astounding, tasked with embodying something odd and otherworldly yet warm enough to be loveable. The film\u2019s climax, in all its aching, deeply romantic glory, is a tribute to maintaining hope in the face of grief, and proof that Carpenter is no one-genre pony. 8/10 Contact (1997; Robert Zemeckis) Worth revisiting in the wake of the Amy Adams vehicle Arrival, Contact finds Jodie Foster communicating with aliens and fighting for the right to meet them. It is a still, thoughtful movie, interested in bureaucracy and misogyny in a way that sci-fi movies so often aren\u2019t. But it also recognises the emotional power of marvelling at something extraordinary, and the sheer wonder of cracking open a door to the previously unimaginable. Robert Zemeckis hasn\u2019t done anything of a similar quality in the decades since. Getty 9/10 The Faculty (1998; Robert Rodriguez) A genre-splicing teen thriller that could only have been birthed in an era of Scream and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Faculty sees a cluster of disparate high schoolers (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall among them) become convinced that their teachers have been replaced by aliens (the likes of Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen and a scene-stealing Robert Patrick having been transformed into pod-people overnight). Sweet, pulpy and dripping in Gen-X cool, The Faculty is Body Snatchers by way of The Breakfast Club, with the cheery spookiness of an RL Stine book you loved when you were 13. 10/10 Under the Skin (2013; Jonathan Glazer) Alien movies are unusual in that they\u2019re always driven by outsiders and extra-terrestrials, yet almost always anchored by us, the humans. Under the Skin, a characteristically trippy experiment from visionary filmmaker Jonathan Glazer (Birth, Sexy Beast), is us as seen through the eyes of a beguiling and curious alien played by Scarlett Johansson. She marvels at human idiosyncrasies and our faces, or else delights in our chocolate cake. And in a further twist, she finds that she likes us. Under the Skin is uncomfortable and horrifying yet also unusually tender, and proof that we haven\u2019t yet run out of new ways to depict alien visitors. Under the Skin 1/10 The Blob (1958; Irvin Yeaworth) So eager are we to plant metaphors onto alien movies that The Blob has been referred to as everything from an analogy for the Cold War to a grim warning against the perils of capitalism.
