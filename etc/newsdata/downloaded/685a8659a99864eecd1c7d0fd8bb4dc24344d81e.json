But as we saw in the case of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, different rules apply to progressives. Former President Obama made that clear today by endorsing Trudeau for another term:\n\nI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019\n\nReally, if you\u2019re Justin Trudeau, having America\u2019s only black president offer an endorsement is like being offered racial absolution. But let\u2019s be honest about it. The real value of this endorsement isn\u2019t whatever progressive bona fides Obama is praising. I mean, it\u2019s a tweet. It\u2019s not about details. The whole point here is that the world\u2019s most famous black politician is telling us to overlook Justin\u2019s unmentioned problem. Obama gave Justin a hall pass.\n\nAs good as Justin must feel today, this has to be causing Joe Biden to flinch a bit. Biden is struggling to raise money and last night\u2019s debate showed that the other candidates now see Elizabeth Warren as the leader of the pack. So where is the Obama endorsement for Uncle Joe? Biden claimed months ago that he had asked Obama not to endorse him but I bet he\u2019d welcome a surprise endorsement now. It\u2019s true that Biden has made some odd and awkward statements but at least he hasn\u2019t worn blackface.\n\nThe other person that came to mind when I saw this endorsement was Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein was famously an outspoken progressive and friendly with Bill and Hillary Clinton among many others on the left. After the New Yorker published the story that resulted in his downfall, the Clinton\u2019s and the Obamas were initially silent. It took several days for the Democratic bigwigs to react and decide what to do about all the money he had given them. Meanwhile, Weinstein\u2019s own statement about the allegations was heavy on promises to do more for the cause:\n\nI want a second chance in the community, but I know I\u2019ve got work to do to earn it. I have goals that are now priorities. Trust me, this isn\u2019t an overnight process. I\u2019ve been trying to do this for 10 years, and this is a wake-up call. I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt, and I plan to do right by all of them. I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party. I\u2019m going to do it at the same I had my Bar Mitzvah. I\u2019m making a movie about our President, perhaps we can make it a joint retirement party. One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year. It will be named after my mom, and I won\u2019t disappoint her.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll take down the NRA and the President!\u2019 said the accused rapist. Here\u2019s what I wrote about this two years ago:\n\nThis guy\u2019s one and only redeeming quality may be the sheer contempt in which he holds the left\u2019s intelligence and willingness to be bought off. He\u2019s essentially offering them the same hush-money settlement he allegedly offered his victims if they\u2019ll just keep their mouths shut, look the other way, and let him go on doing what he does. The difference this time is that instead of paying it to them personally, he\u2019ll pay it to their pet causes. You want a million bucks for gun-control groups in return for pretending like he\u2019s not inviting starlets to his hotel room and \u201casking\u201d them if they want to watch him shower? Done. Two million? Done, done. Name your price. Everyone has one. Oh, and don\u2019t forget, this is all a right-wing conspiracy, you partisan progressive zombies.\n\nIf you were wondering why Weinstein thought he could get away with his behavior because of his politics, this endorsement is a microcosm of why. Of course, blackface and rape aren\u2019t remotely the same thing, not by a longshot. Weinstein is a genuine monster and doesn\u2019t deserve a pass. But then so is Bill Clinton and so was Ted Kennedy depending on what you believe they did. Clinton got a pass on alleged (but I believe Juanita) rape and Kennedy on something akin to murder but both were lionized and defended by the left. Weinstein thought he could get the same deal. He was wrong and maybe that shows things have changed a bit with regard to sexual abuse. But more generally, people on the left still expect to get a pass on behavior that would prove fatal for anyone else. Obama\u2019s endorsement of Trudeau is proof they still do.\n\nImagine if President Trump had been caught wearing blackface. There would be an army of journalists demanding that Republicans denounce him. I don\u2019t expect any of those same reporters will be complaining about Obama giving a foreign leader a hall pass days before an election. It\u2019s always different when Democrats do it.", "description": "Hall pass.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Trudeau-Obama.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
