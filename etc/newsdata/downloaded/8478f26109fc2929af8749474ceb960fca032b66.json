The Turkish operation is aimed at moving the U.S.-backed Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units (YPG), away from its southern border with Syria.\n\nAnkara views the group as terrorists and stresses the YPG's ties to a separatist Kurdish group in Turkey, the PKK, which has carried out a decades-long violent insurgency against the Turkish state. Nonetheless, Kurdish forces were a strategic partner to the U.S. and played a crucial role in defeating the so-called Islamic State.\n\nTrump's controversial move has received widespread criticism in the international community. The U.S. administration has also been accused of sending mixed messages by, at times, distancing itself from the Kurdish militia but also preparing sanctions on Turkey if it steps over the line.", "description": "U.S. foreign policy in places like Syria has been \"contradictory,\" according to the former chief of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services.", "authors": ["Emma Graham"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102234894-132915449.jpg?v=1504278854", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
