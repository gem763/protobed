The move would be a first for the NBA.\n\nDinwiddie will securitize his NBA contract as a digital token, sources told The Athletic. The extension would bring him more than $34 million over a three-year period, but sales of the digital token would allow him to raise a significant portion of that sum upfront.\n\nBy selling the token, Dinwiddie relinquishes some future income for a smaller payment. As a borrower, the guard could then invest the upfront sum.\n\nSources said Dinwiddie's bond would pay investors principal and interest. The payments would be covered by what the Nets owe him, as set out in his contract extension.\n\nThe NBA was alerted of Dinwiddie's decision earlier this week, sources told The Athletic. It's unclear how future contract decisions, extensions or negotiations would affect those invested in the guard's digital bond.\n\nThe biggest risk in the Nets player's deal is his contract, as it's the primary driver for Dinwiddie to pay investors back. Dinwiddie could find himself without the funds to repay bondholders if misconduct threatens his deal with the team.\n\nThe move isn't unprecedented in the sports world. Former NFL running back Arian Foster tried to list himself as a private stock in 2013 before delaying his IPO and eventually scrapping the plan in 2015.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

It will also impact how the guard views future contracts. The guard may look to maximize investor returns once his three-year contract is up, introducing a new variable to the negotiation landscape.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets player averaged 16.8 points, 4.6 assists, and 2.4 rebounds in 68 games last season. The Nets were defeated in the first round of NBA playoffs by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nDinwiddie may be the new owner of a $3 million penthouse found at the highest floor in Brooklyn, according to a September report from the New York Post. The Brooklyn Point tower boasts the highest infinity pool in the Western Hemisphere, as well as a wine library and rock-climbing wall.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nOracle tanks after CEO Mark Hurd takes indefinite medical leave\n\nGlobal central banks are in a rate-cutting frenzy.
