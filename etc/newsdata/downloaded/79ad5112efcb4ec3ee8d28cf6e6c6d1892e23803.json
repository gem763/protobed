But with the flagship phones still costing you a fortune in monthly repayments, getting a cheaper plan with great data offerings is the goal. With that in mind, here are some of Australia's best plans with beefy data caps for under $30 per month.\n\nThe Best 'SIM Only' Phone Plans You Can Get Right Now Whenever a big new phone launches, telcos will try and woo you into a 24-month contract with glossy deals and big bonuses. However, buying your phone outright and signing up for a SIM-only plan can often save you money in the long run. If you can't afford to drop $2000 upfront on a shiny new handset, you should still consider grabbing one of these plans. (Your old phone is probably just fine.) Read more\n\nIf you just need to go on Facebook, Google some random thoughts and check emails, you'll probably only need around 3GB a month, according to WhistleOut. These days, however, a newsfeed on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram will be filled with videos and other data-intensive activities. For that, you'll need at least 15GB a month of data to comfortably sneak that all in.\n\nSo, each of the following mobile plans $30 or under per month will have at least 15GB of data available, which should be enough to stream and view data-heavy apps like Instagram.\n\nJeenee Mobile $22.50/month\n\nThis Jeenee Mobile plans will cost you $12.37 upfront plus the regular $20.25 per month on a 12-month contract but you'll get 15GB of data each month including unlimited national calls and texts. It uses the Optus 4G mobile network so for $22.50 per month, you really can't go wrong with this plan. Just make sure you keep an eye on your monthly data limits as you'll be charged $10 for each gigabyte you go over.\n\nTeleChoice LIVE $25 Plan\n\nYou'll get 17GB of data each month with this TeleChoice plan as well as unlimited national calls and messages. The $25/month plan is on a 12-month contract and uses parts of the Telstra 4G and 3G networks so you should get a reasonable amount of coverage within the country.\n\nSpintel $25.95/month\n\nSpintel's $25.95 a month offering comes with 15GB of data as well as unlimited calls and text messages. This one comes without a contract and for a limited time, no upfront fee so if you try it and hate it, you only have to pay for the first month you used it for. It also uses the Optus 4G and 3G mobile network\n\nExeSim Plus 4G $29.99/month\n\nThis one will cost you a few more dollars than the other plans but you'll get a pinch extra of data with 18GB available each month. The usual unlimited national calls and messages are included but a neat addition of $500 worth of international calls is a nice bonus if it's relevant to you. You'll get a free setup so the minimum spend is $29.99 or just one month.\n\nMoose $29/month\n\nSetting you back $29 a month, Moose's contract-less plan gives you 15GB of data, unlimited national calls and texts. There's no startup fee for this one so again, if you don't like it, ditch it after the first month. It also utilises the Optus 4G Plus and 3G Network.\n\nIf you suspect 15GB a month won't be enough data, you'll need to spend up to $50 a month. Check out the below options offering at least 30GB of data per month without a lock-in contract.\n\nFind more great bargains at Lifehacker Coupons.\n\nAs Lifehacker editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
