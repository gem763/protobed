Second of all, I have not forgotten that today is officially one year since Kim Kardashian-West announced Yandhi\u2019s release date, Black Friday 2018, and then the album never came. To celebrate, it seems like an enterprising fan with a lot of time and a blatant disrespect for iTunes\u2019 uploading terms and conditions, published the nine leaked Yandhi tracks as ringtones. And they cost $1.29 each. Who is going to pay for leaked tracks? They\u2019re \u2026 leaked. Yandhi is more than likely never going to see the light of day, especially considering Kanye West\u2019s recent claims that he\u2019s done making \u201csecular\u201d music. Now, he\u2019s focused on not dropping his other new album Jesus Is King, and allegedly dropping an accompanying documentary about his Sunday Services and an affordable housing project on October 25. So I guess \u2026 Yandhi\u2019s 26-second ringtones are all we have until Jesus Is King arrives.\n\nKanye West appears to have dropped his new album, \u2018Yandhi\u2019 exclusively in the Ringtones category on iTunes. \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/1aI5frsOh9 \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) October 1, 2019", "description": "Kanye West\u2019s leaked album, \u2018Yandhi,\u2019 has been shared on iTunes as ringtones, confusing fans ahead of the \u2018Jesus Is King\u2019 release.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/01/01-kanye-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
