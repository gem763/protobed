The network announced today that it\u2019s handed out a triple-season, 30-episode renewal to Matt Stone and Trey Parker\u2019s long-running animated comedy series, which comes less than two weeks before its return to the air on Wednesday, September 25.\n\n\u201cSouth Park is the greatest comedy in the history of television, unmatched in its satirical strength and cultural relevancy and it shows no signs of slowing down,\u201d Comedy Central\u2019s president, Kent Alterman, said on the news. \u201cIf humanity is still intact in 1,000 years, historians will see the most transcendent artists of our era as the Beatles, Muhammad Ali, and Matt and Trey. We\u2019ll do as many seasons as they would like.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently, our efforts to get our own show canceled have fallen short,\u201d Parker and Stone said. \u201cLuckily, we love Comedy Central and Kent and our staff so we are looking forward to new cancellation opportunities in the next few years.\u201d", "description": "Comedy Central has handed out a 30-episode, triple-season renewal to Matt Stone and Trey Parker\u2019s animated comedy series \u201cSouth Park,\u201d which will keep it on the air through at least a 26th season.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-south-park-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
