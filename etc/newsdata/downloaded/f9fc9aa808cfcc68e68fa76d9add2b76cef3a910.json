Walmart wasn\u2019t alone. Within hours, Kroger, the country\u2019s largest grocery chain, said it too would ask customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms at all 2,800 of its stores.\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Wegmans made similar announcements in quick succession. In total, those retailers have more than 23,000 stores in the United States, though some of them are in places that already have such a policy against openly carrying guns. Other big chains, such as Target, Starbucks and Chipotle, have had such policies against open carry for years.\n\nGun-control advocates and industry experts hailed it as an admission by one of the country\u2019s largest corporations that the government wasn\u2019t doing enough to stop gun violence.\n\n\u2018The status quo is unacceptable\u2019: Walmart will stop selling some ammunition and exit the handgun market\n\n\u201cThe sheer size and power of Walmart means this is perhaps the biggest blow to the NRA in the history of the organization,\u201d said Chris Allieri, a crisis management expert and founder of Mulberry & Astor, a public relations firm in New York. \u201cThis is not some left-leaning coastal CEO sending a tweet or two. This is Walmart saying. \u2018This is how we\u2019re going to do business going forward. Take note.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough Americans took to social media to say Walmart\u2019s efforts made them feel safer about shopping at the company\u2019s stores, the National Rifle Association and gun rights groups increasingly are encouraging members to stop shopping at retailers that have tightened their open carry policies in recent days. Freedom Movement USA, a group of constitutional conservatives calling for a Walmart boycott, has had 3.5 million visitors on its Facebook pages since Tuesday, according to the group\u2019s head, Brandon Harris.\n\nHoward, 57, who calls himself \u201ca constitutionalist and a Christian,\u201d said the policy changes felt personal. He owns about 20 guns and has been openly carrying a pistol for six years. His wife keeps a revolver in the middle pocket of her purse. He said he quit going to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods last year after the company stopped selling military-style rifles. Now he\u2019s prepared to boycott Walmart too, if anyone there gives him trouble about his gun.\n\n\u201cWith this world being the way it is, we\u2019ve got to protect ourselves,\u201d said Howard, who worked as a construction supervisor until he broke his back on the job 15 years ago. \u201cI haven\u2019t had to shoot anybody yet, but you never know. I\u2019ve keep a fire extinguisher in my house even though I\u2019ve never had to use it.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, he strolled in as he always does. In the hour he spent buying groceries, he says he saw at least seven others \u2014 mostly white men like him in their 50s and 60s \u2014 who also had guns visibly strapped to their hips. He chatted with the manager and bought 2\u00bd cases of shotgun shells.\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods overhauled its gun policies after Parkland. The CEO didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nWhen Howard\u2019s experience was brought to Walmart\u2019s attention, a spokesman said Friday that the company was working to add new signs and employee training that reflect its new open-carry policy in the coming months. In his statement Tuesday, chief executive Doug McMillon, who is also a gun owner, said the company will have \u201ca very nonconfrontational approach\u201d to enforcing its new rules. It \u201cwill treat law-abiding customers with respect.\u201d\n\nTom Gresham, the host of \u201cGun Talk,\u201d a nationally syndicated radio show, says he will personally stop shopping at Walmart and that many of his listeners have told him they\u2019ll do the same.\n\n\u201cThe gun owners of America are not fooled,\u201d he said. \u201cWalmart has staked out its position in the culture wars, and we, the 100 million gun owners who don\u2019t commit crimes, are like, wait a minute, you just threw us under the bus.\u201d\n\nGresham, who has been carrying a concealed weapon for more than 25 years, says he hardly sees anybody openly carrying weapons near New Orleans, where he lives. \u201cI probably have seen one person open-carrying this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know thousands of people who conceal-carry every day.\u201d\n\nCovered in princesses \u2014 and bulletproof: Inside the booming business of everyday ballistic gear\n\nWalmart\u2019s new policy prohibiting open carry, he says, doesn\u2019t affect him. But the way he sees it, \u201cthese companies are doing nothing other than trying to show that they\u2019re one of the cool kids.\u201d\n\nAnd although he\u2019s carried around a firearm for at least 25 years, Gresham says it\u2019s not something he likes to advertise.\n\n\u201cGetting away and being a good witness is often the best course of action,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nobody knows I\u2019m carrying a gun, it gives me an opportunity to do that.\u201d", "description": "Major retail chains, including CVS, Walgreens and Kroger, are asking customers to stop openly carrying guns to their stores.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QZZQFKGOZEI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
