(Photo: Kelly Bryden, MakeItGrateful.com)\n\nTo celebrate Halloween, we\u2019ve created five different cake toppers you can make with supplies around your house.\n\nFive seems like a lot, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 you don\u2019t need to (but could) put them all on one cake. We\u2019ll walk you through steps on how to make an easy cake topper in under five minutes as well as more complicated cake toppers that will take a little more effort. What we love about all five is that they are made with pieces you can most likely find around your home. So no excuses for a boring cake! Let\u2019s get to making them.\n\nGOOGLY-EYED FOREST CAKE TOPPERS \u2014 EASY\n\nMaterials\n\nWooden sticks\n\nGoogly eyes\n\nHot glue\n\nEyeballs glued on wood sticks. (Photo: Kelly Bryden, MakeItGrateful.com)\n\nThis is a one-step wonder. Simply glue googly eyes onto wooden sticks and you are done. What makes this cake topper interesting is varying the type and amount of googly eyes you glue onto each stick. Glue some horizontal, vertical, eight on a stick, one on a stick \u2013 go crazy with it!\n\nDIY eyeball cake toppers in cake.

Just as if creepy crawly creatures were lurking in bushes and all you could see was the glow of their eyes.\n\nMore: Use our Halloween party checklist so you won\u2019t forget a thing\n\nGHOST CAKE TOPPERS \u2014 RELATIVELY EASY\n\nMaterials\n\nCotton balls\n\nTissues\n\nBlack paper\n\nWooden sticks\n\nScissors\n\nHot glue gun\n\nArt supplies and tools for making DIY cake toppers.

Use your hands to press the tissue down so it drapes over the cotton ball. You might need to add a few extra drops of glue on the inside to hold the tissue in place and create a nice ghostly draping effect.\n\nTissues glued to wooden sticks.

I used colored contact paper, which made it a breeze but isn\u2019t necessary to buy if you don\u2019t have it around. You could also use colored duct tape or washi tape.\n\nThese tubes will be the witch\u2019s legs \u2013 a witch wearing striped stockings.\n\nPaper wrapped around empty toilet rolls.

I used a Google image as a reference to look at a witch shoe while I was drawing.\n\nStep 3\n\nCut two 3/4-inch slits at the top of the toilet paper tube and slide the cut-out shoe to sit at the top.\n\nDIY witch shoes with paper and empty toilet rolls.

Tie tightly and then release from the pompom maker.\n\nCraft scissors with orange pom pom. (Photo: Kelly Bryden, MakeItGrateful.com)\n\nStep 3\n\nTrim up the pompom to look like a pumpkin. The more you trim off, the more dense your pompom will look.\n\nStep 4\n\nGlue your pompoms onto the top of a wooden stick, or you can glue a piece of cardstock to the bottom of the pompom if you want it to sit directly on the cake. No one wants to mix yarn and frosting.\n\nOrange pompoms glued onto wooden sticks.

(Photo: Kelly Bryden, MakeItGrateful.com)\n\nStep 1\n\nPrint out an image of a spiderweb and cover it with a piece of wax paper. Trace over the spider web with your glue gun, leaving behind a spider web made out of hot glue. You will want to make sure your web has thick lines and good connections, because you won\u2019t want it to break when assembling the cake topper.\n\nHot glue over spider web stencil.

You will want all the letters to connect to make it easier to attach to the web.\n\nHot glue on stencil with glue gun.

You can also use an X-Acto knife to trim up the edges if your hot gluing got out of hand.\n\nStep 4\n\nPaint over your hot glue pieces with acrylic paint. You will probably need two coats of paint to get a good covering.\n\nPainted hot-glue spiderweb.
