Businesses are increasingly turning to home sharing for corporate travel through Airbnb for work,\u201d Mr Thomas said.\n\nBut homeowners have profited from using the platform by offering up space in their homes.\n\nBrunswick hosts Paul Hart and Justine Hanna have enjoyed renting out their spare room, which had been a helpful \u201csupplementary income\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your natural tourist area \u2026 but we do get different people staying with us,\u201d Mr Hart said.\n\n\u201cWe get people staying a bit longer to visit family and about 10 per cent of our guests are here on some kind of work or study trip.\u201d\n\nSunbury was revealed as one of the fastest growing regions for Airbnb worldwide.\n\nThe northwestern suburb had 365 per cent year-on-year growth in bookings, making it the fourth largest leap in popularity for any region.\n\nMELBOURNE\u2019S BUSIEST COUNCILS FOR AIRBNB:\n\nMelbourne 7530 listings\n\nYarra 2052 listings\n\nStonnington 1615 listings\n\nMoreland 1065 listings\n\nBoroondara 733 listings\n\nDarebin 705 listings\n\nGlen Eira 651\n\nMonash 636 listings\n\nWhitehorse 628\n\nWyndham 521\n\nMaribyrnong 511\n\nMoonee Valley 384\n\nBayside 383\n\nManningham 350\n\nKingston 349\n\nBanyule 251\n\nHume 198\n\nKnox 194\n\nFrankston 190\n\nCasey 172\n\nDandenong 152\n\nBrimbank 149\n\nWhittlesea 146\n\nCardinia 132\n\nMaroondah 116\n\nNillumbik 105\n\nMelton 101\n\nSource: Inside Airbnb, figures updated July 2019", "description": "Short-stay rentals are creeping into Melbourne\u2019s family suburbs, causing a stir among residents concerned about wild parties and unwelcome visitors.
