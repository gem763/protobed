As a result we have moved the US forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\" US Defence Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nA Turkish security official said one of the main goals of the overnight strike was to cut off a transit route between Iraq and Syria often used by Kurdish armed groups \"before the operation in Syria\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was unclear what damage was done or whether there were casualties. Details of the strike, a joint operation by Turkey's intelligence service and the military, were hazy. One official described them as an air strike, while the other said the site was made \"unusable through various means\".\n\nTrump denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective US partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening to \"totally destroy\" Turkey's economy if it acted \"off limits\" in Syria.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in north-east Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nSignalling a further potential shift in the region's power balance, the Kurdish- led forces said they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full US withdrawal.\n\nAAP", "description": "Turkey says it is ready to advance into north-east\u00a0Syria now that the United States has begun withdrawing troops from the Turkey-Syria frontier.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2601%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fab1fd43d1990be152895ba8b3ee27a2b3b54cbb", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
