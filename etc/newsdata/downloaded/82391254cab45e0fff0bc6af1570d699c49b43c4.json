(AP) - Acting Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small and two others were nominated by the city\u2019s Democratic party to be considered to serve as mayor for the next year or so.\n\nSmall became acting mayor last week when Frank Gilliam Jr. resigned after acknowledging having taken $87,000 from a youth basketball club he founded. Gilliam\u2019s guilty plea to wire fraud could land him a 20-year prison term.\n\nAlso nominated Tuesday night were Pamela Thomas-Fields and Gwendolyn Callaway Lewis. Both women told The Press of Atlantic City that they support Small\u2019s bid.\n\nThe City Council soon must select one of the three to serve as mayor until the November 2020 general election.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Acting Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small and two others were nominated by the city's Democratic party to be considered to serve as mayor for the next year or so.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
