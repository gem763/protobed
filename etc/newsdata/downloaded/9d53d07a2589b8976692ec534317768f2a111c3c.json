The singer was promoting her remix of Lizzo\u2019s \u201cGood As Hell\u201d when she tweeted \u201cbaby how u feeling,\u201d but Bernie Sanders had other things on his mind.\n\n\u201cReady to fight for Medicare for All,\u201d the senator replied.\n\nSander\u2019s response did not go unnoticed by Grande, who retweeted him and added \u201cscreaming.\u201d\n\nNext to get in on the action was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who showed off both her knowledge of progressive policies as well as Ariana Grande\u2019s discography.\n\n\u201cProgressive policies as an Ariana dance party,\u201d she wrote. \u201cthank u, next: Replace for-profit health insurance w/ #MedicareForAll . God is a Woman: Strike the Hyde Amendment. Break Free: Student loan debt forgiveness. Be Alright: Pass a Green New Deal!\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez recently endorsed Senator Sanders during his political rally last weekend in New York, giving Sanders a much-needed campaign boost.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a child that relied on CHIP so that I could see a doctor, Bernie Sanders fought for a single-payer health care system,\u201d AOC told the crowd. \u201cWhen the federal government decided to discriminate and abandon my queer family and friends, Bernie Sanders was putting his career on the line for us.\u201d\n\nSanders also took the opportunity to address his health. The rally was his first since he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, prompting many to question whether he\u2019s fit for the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and their apologists. And I am more ready than ever to create a government based on the principles of justice,\u201d he said. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Ariana Grande\u2019s Twitter feed just got a lot more political.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CAqLKmgGXYq4CU73xp7GnQ--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/e39a47c5706fe4bab2ce3ce61ed562b5", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
