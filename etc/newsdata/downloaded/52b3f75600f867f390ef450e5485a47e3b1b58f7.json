So I then used my breaks for mountaineering,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2014 he climbed his first \u201c8000er\u201d \u2014 Dhaulagiri in western Nepal.\n\nA period of leave following a deployment to war-torn Afghanistan in 2016 coincided with the climbing season, and he used his R&R period to make his first ascent of Everest.\n\nNext year he was back on the mountain, leading a successful Gurkha climbing expedition and was appointed a member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by the Queen for his work in high altitude mountaineering.\n\nLater, he swapped his army boots for crampons, quit the military after 16 years of service and re-mortgaged his house to raise funds for his high-altitude, high-speed quest.\n\n-\u2018More than trophy-hunting\u2019-\n\nPurja said he hoped his feat would inspire the next generation of Nepali climbers to break his records.\n\nSherpas \u2014 Nepalis who often work as guides for foreign mountaineers \u2014 are the backbone of the country\u2019s lucrative climbing industry, but don\u2019t attract as much attention or accolades as international climbers.\n\n\u201cAs a Nepali, I hope my climbs put a spotlight on the talented climbers here,\u201d he said.\n\nMountaineers around the world have encouraged Purja, including Messner \u2014 who made his 14 ascents without the aid of supplementary oxygen \u2014 whom he met at Nanga Parbat base camp in Pakistan.\n\nBut purist climbers frown upon Sherpa support, bottled oxygen and helicopters \u2014 all of which Purja has called on in his quest.\n\nHowever, Purja has earned respect for deviating from summits to rescue others even as the clocks ticked, including a Malaysian climber on Mount Annapurna.\n\nMountaineering blogger Alan Arnette said that what was impressive about Purja was his recovery time between his forays to the roof of the world.\n\n\u201cEven with the nits around style, overall he is setting a marker that may take decades, if ever, to surpass,\u201d he said.", "description": "Kathmandu (AFP) \u2013 Such was the determination of Nepali climber Nirmal Purja to climb the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains, that he had them", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/fc9515_picture-released-by-nirmal-nims-purja-bremont-project-shows-climber-on-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
