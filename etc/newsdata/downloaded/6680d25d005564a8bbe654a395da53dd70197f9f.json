These moves received far less attention than Russian interference but arguably had a more demonstrable impact on the election result. According to an MIT study, more than 1 million people did not vote in 2016 because they encountered problems registering or at the polls. Clinton lost the election by a total of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cIn a couple of places, most notably Wisconsin, I think it had a dramatic impact on the outcome,\u201d Clinton said of voter suppression.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s new voter ID law required a Wisconsin driver\u2019s license or one of several other types of ID to cast a ballot. It blocked or deterred up to 23,000 people from voting in reliably Democratic Milwaukee and Madison, and potentially 45,000 people statewide, according to a University of Wisconsin study. Clinton lost the state by fewer than 23,000 votes. African Americans, who overwhelmingly supported Clinton, were more than three times as likely as whites not to vote because of the law.\n\n\u201cIt seems likely that it cost me the election [in Wisconsin] because of the tens of thousands of people who were turned away and the margin being so small,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton says of voter suppression that in at least one state, \u201cIt seems likely that it cost me the election.\u201d\n\nShe noted that this was the first presidential election in more than 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court gutted the law in a 2013 ruling, and 14 states had new voting restrictions in effect for the first time. \u201cSo many places have really tried to make it as difficult as they possibly could for young people, for African Americans, the elderly, to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Clinton and others who question the legitimacy of the election results, particularly due to Russian interference, there\u2019s not an obvious next step. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a method for contesting that in our system,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve long advocated for an independent commission to get to the bottom of what happened.\u201d On Wednesday, Democrats in Congress introduced articles of impeachment against Trump, but Clinton thinks that\u2019s the wrong approach. \u201cI think we need the investigations to continue,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think that it\u2019s premature.\u201d\n\nBut Clinton stood by a claim she made during a presidential debate last year, that if Trump were elected president, he would be Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet.\u201d Asked if she still felt that way, Clinton said, \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the president of the United States, with all of the concerns about the integrity of our elections, could meet with Putin just recently and basically say, \u2018Well, you know, he told me again he didn\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s so na\u00efve. I think that he hopes or expects the rest of us to be na\u00efve, or at least the people who support him to be na\u00efve. But this is a serious cyberattack on America.\u201d\n\nThe impact of Russian interference in the election can be measured in a few tangible ways. Operatives in Russia published about 80,000 Facebook posts that reached 126 million Americans, as Russia-linked Facebook ads targeted swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. More than 36,000 Russia-linked Twitter accounts generated 1.4 million tweets about the election that had 288 million impressions. The constant drumbeat of stories based on Clinton campaign and Democratic Party emails obtained by Russian-backed hackers is one reason that then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s 11th-hour letter hurt Clinton so much.\n\nClinton admitted that her campaign had \u201cshortcomings\u201d that contributed to her loss, but she said the stakes of Russian meddling were bigger than just the election result. \u201cIf we don\u2019t figure out what they did to us and take adequate steps to prevent it, they\u2019re only going to get better,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve ever been attacked by a foreign adversary and then they suffer no real consequences.\u201d\n\nThe interview came amid a slew of new allegations of sexual assault against prominent figures in politics and entertainment. Asked why the various sexual assault allegations against Trump haven\u2019t stuck when similar ones have recently ended careers, Clinton said she couldn\u2019t explain it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand a lot about how he got away with so many attacks and insults and behaviors that allowed him to win the presidency,\u201d she said. \u201cI think part of it is because a lot of people really saw him more as an entertainment figure.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s something that people are going to be scratching their heads about a long time.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ari Berman", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mj_clinton_blackyoutubemaster.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "published_at": "2017-11-17"}
