Keyser was named by Ford as a witness, one of four who denied any knowledge of the event in question.\n\nThe book offers no evidence in support of the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, but, they write, their \u201cgut reaction\u201d was that her allegations \u201crang true.\u201d\n\nTheir \u201cgut\u201d instinct was based on the fact that Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh grew up in the same rough area and she had dated one of his friends. Further, Leland Keyser had gone out on a date \u2014 maybe even two dates, they\u2019re not sure \u2014 with a friend of Kavanaugh\u2019s. \u201cNone of that means that Ford was, in fact, assaulted by Kavanaugh,\u201d they write, \u201cBut it does mean that she has a baseline level of credibility as an accuser.\u201d It is unclear what they mean.\n\nThe authors go on to say they have seen no evidence of Ford fabricating stories. They ignore the dramatic inconsistency between her claimed fear of flying that necessitated a lengthy delay of the reopened confirmation hearings and her stated love of global \u201csurf travel\u201d to remote islands across vast stretches of ocean and other distant destinations, such as Hawaii, Costa Rica, the South Pacific islands and French Polynesia. A sworn affidavit from an ex about her tendency to fly frequently and in small planes is waved away by the authors.\n\nWhile acknowledging the outpouring of support from some of the world\u2019s wealthiest and powerful people in Silicon Valley, accolades from corporate media, participation in far-left political causes, and nearly a million dollars raised in GoFundMe accounts, the authors say the only reason to come forward with an uncorroborated 35-year-old account of sexual misconduct would be because she believed it to be true.\n\nAnd then, just before the book ends, the reporters drop a bombshell:\n\nWe spoke multiple times to Keyser, who also said that she didn\u2019t recall that get-together or any others like it. In fact, she challenged Ford\u2019s accuracy. \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in the story.\u201d\n\nThis on-the-record quote is the first time that Keyser has spoken publicly about what was previously reported in detail in the new bestseller \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court\u201d (of which this writer is co-author).\n\nThe New York Times authors dismiss Keyser\u2019s statement as the product of a bad memory, before noting that their unsuccessful efforts to corroborate Blasey Ford\u2019s claims including desperately searching for a house that matched the description she gave. Nevertheless, their \u201cgut\u201d told them to believe her in the absence of facts.\n\nThe authors also acknowledge what had previously been reported in \u201cJustice on Trial,\u201d about the efforts of mutual friends to get her to change her testimony to be more supportive of Blasey Ford. The reporters say that some of Blasey Ford\u2019s friends \u201chad grown frustrated with Keyser. Her comments about the alleged Kavanaugh incident had been too limited, some of them felt, and did not help their friend\u2019s case. Surely, given what a close friend Keyser had been, she could say more to substantiate Ford\u2019s testimony and general veracity, even if she could not corroborate Ford\u2019s more specific memories.\u201d\n\nA group text was formed in which friends such as Cheryl Amitay and Lulu Gonella discussed how to get her to say something more helpful to the cause. An unnamed man on the text suggested that they defame her as an addict. Keyser has been in recovery for some time, as her friends know and as has previously been reported.\n\nAmitay answered, \u201cLeland is a major stumbling block.\u201d While asserting she didn\u2019t want her to make anything up out of whole cloth, she offered ideas for things that could sound supportive of Ford\u2019s story, such as that she\u2019d been in similar situations with Blasey Ford that summer.\n\n\u201cI was told behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn\u2019t comply,\u201d Keyser told the reporters, a stunning admission of the pressure to which she was subjected to by Blasey Ford\u2019s allies.\n\nAs previously reported in \u201cJustice on Trial,\u201d Keyser continues to think about the story in which she was supposed to have played a part. She has both \u201clogistical and character-driven\u201d problems with it. Focusing on one of the angles that many women had trouble believing, she says, \u201cIt would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she\u2019s going to get home.\u201d\n\nThe authors previously note that Blasey Ford suggested that Keyser might have driven her home, which they do not note is a change from her claim that she does not know how she got home. Keyser also reflects that the get-togethers of their youth were not like the one Ford described. She adds, \u201cI just really didn\u2019t have confidence in the story.\u201d\n\nStanding up to the pressure campaign to tell the truth was difficult, the reporters acknowledge. They note she had a framed copy of a magazine that bore the headline, \u201cWas Leland Keyser the Hero of the Kavanaugh Controversy?\u201d A GoFundMe account set up by her son says, \u201cDespite her lifelong friendship with Christine Blasey Ford and her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, Keyser resisted immense personal pressure and courageously came forward with the truth, putting everything in her life at risk. As a result, she faces great personal hardship. The harsh glare of the public eye has taken a tremendous physical, emotional, and financial toll on her.\u201d\n\nDespite this new reporting that supports what was first reported in \u201cJustice on Trial,\u201d the authors downplay it as unimportant, and not something that affects their shared \u201cgut.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/blaseyfordhearing9..27.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
