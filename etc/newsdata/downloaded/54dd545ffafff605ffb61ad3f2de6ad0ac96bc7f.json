(Talia Ricci/CBC)\n\nBecause Naomi\u2019s family has roots in the former British colony, the 17-year-old Chinese-Canadian has been there several times.\n\n\u201cMy mom and dad have been keeping up with the Hong Kong news, and from that I became interested and researched more on what was happening,\u201d Naomi said in a recent interview with CBC News.\n\nPro-democracy demonstrators, some the same age as Naomi, have been protesting in the streets for months.\n\nA sign saying 'Five demands' is held by students demonstrating inside a shopping mall after a human chain event in Sha Tin district in Hong Kong on Sept.19.

(Anthony Wallace//AFP/Getty Images)\n\nInspired by the movement, Naomi decided to use ink, designing a mostly black-and-yellow shoe, incorporating the colours worn by the protesters.\n\nShe also drew an umbrella along with faceless protesters wearing helmets and rain jackets, plus a red Bauhinia flower \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s emblem.\n\nArt has always been a big part of Naomi's life, so she was excited about the idea of getting to collaborate with her favourite shoe company.\n\nNaomi\u2019s Hong Kong-themed shoe was pulled from an online Vans contest. (Vans)\n\nAnd it looked like she might even win the $25 000 prize.\n\nNaomi\u2019s design got hundreds of thousands of votes, but then to her total surprise, it suddenly got pulled from the online contest.\n\n\u201cIt was totally unfair,\u201d Naomi said.\n\nWhen voting began earlier this month, her sneakers generated more than 200,000 votes in just a few days, putting her in first place.\n\nNaomi says her design, which made first place within days of entering the Vans contest, went through a first round of approval before it could be voted on. (Vans)\n\nOn the fourth day of the contest, friends told her the entry had disappeared.\n\n\u201cVans didn\u2019t contact me to understand the meaning behind my shoe,\u201d she said.\n\nNaomi felt this was disrespectful to her freedom of expression as an artist.\n\nNaomi speaks with CBC Toronto reporter Talia Ricci in a park. (Turgut Yeter/CBC)\n\nWhen she sent an email asking why it was removed, Vans responded with a statement saying its decision was based on competition guidelines.\n\n\u201cAs a brand that is open to everyone, we have never taken a political position and therefore review designs to ensure they are in line with our company\u2019s long-held values of respect and tolerance,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSo why is Naomi\u2019s design so controversial?\n\nThe breakdown\n\nHong Kong, which was originally part of China, became a British colony in 1947 and remained under British rule until 1997.\n\nThis was because China temporarily lost Hong Kong to Britain in the Opium Wars, two wars that were fought between the two countries during the 1800\u2019s\n\nUnder British rule, Hong Kong people lived in an open democracy.\n\nWhen it was returned in 1997, China, a communist country, agreed to allow Hong Kong a high degree of independence for the next 50 years.\n\nThat\u2019s how Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR), meaning it has its own legal system.\n\nWhat does Free Hong Kong mean?\n\nThe crisis in Hong Kong has continued into its fifth month.\n\nProtesters are calling for the protection of their democratic rights.\n\nAlthough the government has since reversed its decision on the bill that started it all, protesters are still on the streets demanding wider democratic freedom.\n\nProtesters with umbrellas and protective gear face off against police at Kowloon Bay in Hong Kong on Aug. 24.(Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201cimpactful event in history,\u201d said Naomi.\n\nOne that moved her to use art to make a difference.\n\n\u201cSome feelings are not easily expressed through words,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think it's important for people to express whatever they want through art because developing something beautiful for others to relate to is very important.\u201d\n\nWith files from Talia Ricci/CBC News", "description": "Toronto teen\u2019s Free Hong Kong-themed sneaker design gets pulled from Vans design contest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/HonKongSneakers_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
