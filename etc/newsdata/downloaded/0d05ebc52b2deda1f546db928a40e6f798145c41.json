You can also change from Medicare to Medicare Advantage, health insurance plans administered by private insurers. If you\u2019re unsatisfied with your prescription plan, you can switch plans during this time, too.\n\n\u201cPeople continue with the same plan without looking to see if their prescriptions have changed, whether there\u2019s a new plan that is a better fit for them in terms of their coverage needs, personal values and preferences,\u201d said Casey Schwarz, senior counsel at the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit. \u201cWe try to encourage people not to do so.\u201d\n\nThere are also four major changes to Medicare from last year, so even veteran enrollees may be surprised with this year\u2019s process. Here\u2019s what you need to know for Medicare 2020.\n\nPLEASANTON, CA: Volunteer Rebecca Cox (R) helps a man log prescription drug information as he registers his parents for Medicare's drug program.

The layout has more blank space along with new sort-and-filter tools on the results page. While these changes are useful, there are some drawbacks to the new design.\n\nMedicare ID requirement: Previously, you didn\u2019t need a Medicare ID, an identification code assigned to beneficiaries, to save search results. Now, counselors, adult children and other caregivers need a senior\u2019s login information to access their saved medication lists. This poses a problem for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP), which rely on the tool to help seniors with their plan selection.\n\nPulling up last year\u2019s information: If you want to compare this year\u2019s drug list with last year\u2019s, you must switch between the old plan finder and this year\u2019s \u2013 a major inconvenience. That means if you want to make sure last year\u2019s drug list is covered under this year\u2019s plan, you must access the old plan finder first.\n\nCaregiver access: If you\u2019re a caregiver who needs access to your senior\u2019s saved medical information on the old system, you need to first fill out an authorization form.\n\nThe new Medicare Plan Finder has received mixed reviews from caregivers and nonprofits. More\n\nClosing the \u2018donut hole\u2019\n\nSome Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage plans come with a coverage gap known as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d After you meet your deductible, you and your plan split costs for covered drugs up to a certain amount. In 2020, that is $4,020. After that, you have to pay more for those same drugs, which has been considered the donut hole.\n\nThe percentage you pay during the coverage gap \u2013 or donut hole \u2013 has been declining the last few years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nIn 2019, you had to pay 25% of the sticker price for brand-name drugs and 37% for generic drugs. For 2020, you\u2019ll pay no more than 25% for both brand-name and generic prescription medicine during the coverage gap until you reach the out-of-pocket spending limit of $6,350.\n\nChanges to drug coverage\n\nMedicare Part D plans come with a list of prescription drugs \u2013 both generic and brand-name \u2013 that they cover. These lists are called formularies. In 2020, Part D plans are able to choose which specific disease or symptom \u2013 called indication - a covered drug can be used for. That means if one drug can be prescribed for multiple illnesses, your Part D plan may only approve coverage for only one of those uses.", "description": "Medicare 2020 open enrollment is here.
