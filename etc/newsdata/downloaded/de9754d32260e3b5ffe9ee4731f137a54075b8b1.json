They started off ok and then went all emosh \ud83d\ude33. #Strictly \u2014 Joanne Powell (@JoannePowell14) October 12, 2019\n\nIntoxicating high marks all round, what's up judges? #SCD #Strictly \u2014 Erik LFC Zoha (@ErikZoha) October 12, 2019\n\nCraig\u2019s marks are the only realisting marking this week in the show. All the others are marking OTT for some the dances which don\u2019t deserve 9s I think some the judges are marking to weed out the ones the don\u2019t want to see go through to the next show #strictly \u2014 TheWorld2Day (@ViewerViews) October 12, 2019\n\nStrictly judges just picking up random paddles this week?! Some of these marks just don\u2019t make sense!! #StrictlyComeDancing \u2014 Mimi Robinson (@life_art_mimi) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat are the judges thinking tonight\u2026.they give Kelvin amazing comments then score him 9s, then also give Mike 9s \ud83e\udd14 #Strictly \u2014 Karen Milne (@karenmilne63) October 12, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides the controversial scores from the judges, last night\u2019s episode of Strictly was full of action.\n\nKatya was left in tears following her dance with Mike, with the 30-year-old professional dropping to the floor in tears after a particularly tough week of training.\n\nAfter dancing the quickstep, Mike told Tess Daly that the dance felt good, explaining: \u2018Because of the struggles, the flu, the cold this week\n\n\u2018Thursday afternoon I never thought we\u2019d get around like that.\u2019\n\nElsewhere, Craig branded Kelvin filth as he critiqued the Emmerdale star\u2019s rumba.\n\nSpeaking after his dance, Craig said: \u2018Well you\u2019re obviously in touch with yourself darling. We can certainly see that.\n\n\u2018It was full of machismo which I loved. It oozed masculinity. It was filth.\u2019\n\nAs the judges cackled, Motsi joked: \u2018I don\u2019t know, you know. I\u2019m just like, hold on Kelvin that\u2019s my sister, stop it!\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
