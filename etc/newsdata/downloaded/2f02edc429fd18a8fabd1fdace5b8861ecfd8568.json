That compared with a 5.5% pace in the first eight months and was down from 5.8% growth announced after the first half.\n\nInvestment in the agricultural, manufacturing and industrial sectors retreated in September while infrastructure investment accelerated ahead of the Communist Party's celebration of its 70th year in power on Oct. 1.\n\nDing Shuang, an economist with Standard Chartered, said the pickup in infrastructure investment was attributable to greater bond issuances to finance projects launched by local governments, though he said the acceleration in September's industrial production was probably due to the inclusion by the statistics bureau of previously missed data.\n\nChinese growth has been on a downward trajectory for the past several years. Each quarterly slowdown in growth pulls the economic performance to new lows not seen since the current measure of GDP was adopted in 1992. The economy performed worse in 1990, when China was reeling from the 1989 crackdown on students in Tiananmen Square, which crippled investment.\n\nThe deceleration reported Friday compares with a 6.2% rate of growth posted in the second quarter--which economists said was driven by more lending--and a 6.4% figure in the first quarter, which was helped by a March tax cut worth 2 trillion yuan ($283 billion).\n\n\"Despite increased downward pressure on economic growth, major economic indicators remained in a reasonable range,\" a spokesman for the Statistics Bureau, Mao Shengyong, said, citing steady employment and inflation, aside from energy and food prices.\n\nThe fourth quarter, Mr. Mao forecast, would feature \"conditions and supports\" for the economy, including a less-steep drop in auto sales and industrial production, as well as stabilizing infrastructure investment.\n\nMr. Mao also cited apparent progress between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators as a positive factor, describing it as \"a good thing for the markets and the global economy, including the Chinese economy.\"\n\nCapital Economics's China economist, Julian Evans-Pritchard, wrote in a note that despite the stronger September figures, downward economic pressure is building.\n\n\"We expect monetary policy to be loosened before long in response, but it will take time for this to put a floor beneath economic growth,\" Mr. Evans-Pritchard wrote.\n\nThe quarterly figure was slightly lower than a median forecast for 6.1% growth in a poll of 13 economists by The Wall Street Journal. Beijing's target range for GDP growth of between 6.0% and 6.5% this year has anticipated a weakening performance. The average for the first nine months is 6.2%.\n\nLast year, the Chinese economy expanded 6.6%.\n\nFriday's report showed value-added industrial output in China rose 5.8% in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 4.4% figure in August and better than a median 4.9% forecast of 15 economists surveyed by the Journal.\n\nRetail sales climbed 7.8% in September from a year earlier, matching economist expectations. That was a touch better than August's 7.5% rise.\n\nThe 5.4% growth in construction activity matched economists' median forecast.\n\nHome sales by value for the January-to-September period rose 10.3% from a year earlier, versus a 9.9% gain in the first eight months of the year. Investment in commercial and residential real estate gained 10.5% in the first nine months of the year, unchanged from the first eight months.\n\nConstruction starts were somewhat weaker, increasing 8.6% from January to September from a year earlier, compared with 8.9% in the first eight months of the year.\n\nThe government put the final consumption expenditure at 60.5% of the GDP in the first nine months of the year, with investment at 19.8% and net exports at 19.6%.\n\nLiyan Qi and Grace Zhu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to James T.
