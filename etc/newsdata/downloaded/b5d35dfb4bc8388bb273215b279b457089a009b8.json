The enemy suffered heavy losses \u2026 and wide swathes of territory were liberated in only a few days,\u201d said the Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdul Salam.\n\nHe also claimed hundreds of Saudi soldiers lay dead or injured on the battlefield, and Riyadh had little option but to consider how to withdraw. He said the Houthis would end their attacks if the Saudis took reciprocal measures.\n\nThe attacks, if verified, would be a remarkable show of force inside Saudi Arabia and mark another embarrassment for the kingdom, after its US-made Patriot missile defence system failed to protect two Saudi Aramco oil sites from an attack by drones and cruise missiles earlier this month.\n\nOn Saturday, the Houthis claimed they had captured three Saudi brigades \u2013 a major proportion of the kingdom\u2019s army. The group also says it was responsible for the oil attacks, but this has been disputed by western and European governments.\n\nSaudi Arabia made no comment on the latest claims.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A screengrab purports to show a burned-out Saudi military vehicle in Najran.

The United Arab Emirates pulled some of its troops out of Yemen earlier this year after deciding there was no possibility of an outright military victory.\n\nA week after the attack on the Saudi oil sites, the Houthis surprisingly offered to end drone strikes in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe UN security council welcomed the announcement and hinted at a process that might lead to discussions on a future political settlement.\n\nCurrent talks between Houthis and the UN-recognised government of Yemen are confined largely to mutual troop withdrawals from the Red Sea port of Hodeidah and measures such as prisoner releases.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, the security council described the Houthi offer as \u201can important first step towards de-escalation, which will need to be followed with positive action on the ground by the Houthis as well as restraint by the coalition\u201d.\n\nThe security council also gave its full support to a plan floated by Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen, to hold informal consultations with Yemeni political actors and establish an advisory group in preparation for the resumption of formal negotiations.\n\nIn a statement, the group called on the parties in Yemen to \u201cengage constructively with the special envoy to resume inclusive and comprehensive political discussions which can end the conflict\u201d.", "description": "Yemen militant group says it captured further 2,000 troops in operation in Saudi Arabia", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a07b851dab41bda3d825668e0eeeb5e27ae6b5f/42_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d000ec0c99d36eed42179b47a4307586", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
