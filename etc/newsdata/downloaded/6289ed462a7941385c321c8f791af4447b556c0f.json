Jordan Davies was awkwardly forced to chose who was more attractive between his current girlfriend Isobel Mills and his former flame Megan McKenna\n\nUnable to contain his laughter, Jordan responds: 'I know Megan McKenna, yeah.'\n\nMaking light of Jordan's Lothario past, co-host Katherine Ryan jokes: 'Are we going to get all of his exes on? Because I don't think we have a budget.'\n\nIt is then up to Jordan and Isobel to decide who the audience will say is better looking out of the reality stars girlfriends past and present.\n\nWhich one? During an upcoming episode of Your Face Or Mine, the Ibiza Weekender star, 27, is adamant his girlfriend is better looking before branding Megan, pictured on Monday, as 'fake'\n\nAlthough Isobel is insistent that Megan will be voted higher than her, Jordan jumps in and says: 'No, I'd say you because she's so fake! Those lips aren't real.'\n\nAs they continue to bicker over who the correct answer is more likely to be, Jordan tries to reassure her and tells Isobel she underrates herself.\n\nAfter they eventually pick Megan, the weighting was 59% to 49% in Megan's favour.\n\nJordan, who soared to fame on Magaluf Weekender met Megan during their first stint on Ex On The Beach in 2015, where they fell in love on the show shortly before returning last year when he popped the question.\n\nMegan has recently admitted that her former 'big lips' looked 'awful' and that she had a 'massive dose' of body dysmorphia.\n\nSpeaking on TV show Lorraine, the X Factor: Celebrity star revealed she had ditched her lip fillers in a bid to be taken seriously in the music industry.\n\nAfter looking at a picture of herself with the fillers in, Megan said: 'Honestly, I look back at myself and think: \"Oh my God, what was I thinking?!\" I had a massive dose of body dysmorphia.\n\n'I feel like what I would like to say to my younger self is, you really need to accept the way you look. You lose yourself a bit and you forget. I feel like I look awful, every morning my mum would say: \"Your lips are so big!\"\n\n'Awful': Megan has recently admitted that her former 'big lips' looked 'awful' and that she had a 'massive dose' of body dysmorphia (pictured before, left, and now, right)\n\nHeartfelt: The singer broke down in tears on The X Factor: Celebrity after she made it through to the live finals (pictured)\n\n'I was noticing that every single thing that I did, which linked to my music, would be about my lips. I was working so hard to do music and everything was being taken away from that because of my big lips.'\n\nMegan's lips also came up during her audition for X Factor. When she appeared on stage, Louis Walsh commented: 'You look different than the last time I saw you - what have you done?'\n\nJumping to Megan's defence, Simon jumped in and said: 'What have you done [Louis]? You were bald when I met you 20 years ago.'\n\nHowever Megan honestly admitted: 'I'm not gonna lie I used to have a lot of lip filler in my top lip and it was a bit embarrassing now I look back and I've had them taken out.\n\nOuch: In an uncomfortable twist, after Megan's picture flashes up on the screen host Jimmy Carr knowingly asks Jordan whether he knows her\n\n'I want to be seen as an artist so I can't be on stage looking like that, can I?'\n\nFollowing the first awkward decision on Your Face Or Mine, Isobel and Jordan are then forced to chose who was more attractive out of him and her ex Brad Simpson from The Vamps.\n\nIsobel was also voted more attractive than Jordan's former Celebrity Big Brother co-star Sarah Harding.\n\nViewers will also be treated to a visit from another of Jordan's 'blasts from the past' in the form of ex-girlfriend and Ibiza Weekender co-star Chyna Ellis.\n\nIt doesn't get much better for Jordan as he reveals he didn't think Chyna liked him, to which Chyna replies 'I didn't really\u2026'.\n\nYour Face Or Mine continues tonight at 8pm on Comedy Central UK", "description": "Jordan Davies was awkwardly forced to chose who was more attractive between his current girlfriend Isobel Mills and his former flame Megan McKenna.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20385798-0-image-a-121_1572452475996.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
