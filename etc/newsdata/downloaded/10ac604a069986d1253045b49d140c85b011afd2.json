Her widower, Brendan Cox, swiftly condemned the prime minister\u2019s remarks, saying it had left him feeling sick.\n\nBrendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) Feel a bit sick at Jo\u2019s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attitude was lambasted by Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, who called him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister, who said she felt \u201cdisgust watching Johnson\u201d, describing him as \u201cuntrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions\u201d. Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said his reaction showed that Johnson was \u201ca cruel, uncaring, spoilt man\u201d.\n\nSwinson revealed on Wednesday that she had reported to police a death threat against her young child.\n\nAmber Rudd, who resigned from Johnson\u2019s cabinet earlier this month, told ITV the prime minister was being \u201cdishonest and dangerous\u201d in his use of language.\n\nJess Phillips, the Labour MP and women\u2019s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson\u2019s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. \u201cThat is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201c10 Downing Street might think we are \u2018humbugs\u2019 about his words but they are literally being used in death threats against me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI get death threats and still I stand up. I don\u2019t surrender to fear and aggression. I don\u2019t surrender to lowest common denominator of fear to votes. I don\u2019t surrender to bullies who call me names. It is not I who have surrendered, it is Boris Johnson. He has surrendered his dignity.\u201d\n\nJohn Bercow, the Speaker, implicitly rebuked Johnson and told MPs that he had also received threats: \u201cEach and every one of us has a responsibility to weigh his or her words ... with care, eloquence, humour but in terms that demonstrate respect for those who hold a point of view that differs from our own.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn called on the Speaker to call together the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration \u201copposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t, then what happens is those on our streets who would do violence feel emboldened to do it and the most vulnerable people in our society suffer as a result of it,\u201d the Labour leader added.\n\nBercow said he was \u201cvery open\u201d to the idea of convening a meeting to draw up a house-wide public statement.\n\nAfter an aggressive debate in parliament, with the prime minister accusing the opposition of signing a \u201csurrender act\u201d over Brexit, Sherriff received applause from the opposition benches for calling on Johnson to stop using such language.\n\n\u201cWe should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019 and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d\n\nJohnson replied with a half-smile, saying: \u201cI have to say Mr Speaker I\u2019ve never heard such humbug in all my life.\u201d\n\nEarlier he was confronted by Brabin, who criticised him for using language such as \u201csurrender\u201d, arguing it cast his opponents as traitors.\n\nNo apologies. Labour fury as Boris Johnson goes on the attack Read more\n\n\u201cAs the woman who has taken over a seat left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him in all honesty as a human being please, please will he going forward moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we\u2019re going about our jobs?\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Johnson responded by repeating some of the language and suggesting the answer was to deliver Brexit.\n\n\u201cOf course there will be an attempt to try to obfuscate the effect of this Act, but it does \u2013 the capitulation act, or the surrender act or whatever you want to call it \u2013 it does, I\u2019m sorry, but it greatly enfeebles, it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate.\n\n\u201cBut what I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nCommons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, condemned the abuse that MPs had received as \u201cdeeply, deeply unpleasant and troubling\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we\u2019re speaking in this house or outside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid to say it\u2019s something where all sides err from time to time and it would be invidious to pick on individual examples but we have a responsibility of leadership.\u201d\n\nFormer Tory Anna Soubry raised a point of order to criticise the prime minister\u2019s language: \u201cIt takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears ... but I am not alone tonight. There are others who have left the estate such has been the distress.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s reference to memory of murdered MP prompts gasps in Commons", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f669792208e0c10410d9c23bd5975b35ed50fc87/0_118_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eb3cb32f5eba672a05a63ede343073ce", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
