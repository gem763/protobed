He has said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron piled the pressure on MPs, saying he did not want a new delay now a deal was struck.\n\n\u201cThe October 31 date should be respected. I don\u2019t think that new deadlines should be given,\u201d he said at the EU summit in Brussels.\n\n\u201cWe need to end these negotiations and get on negotiating the future relationship.\u201d\n\nLuxembourg\u2019s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel added: \u201cThere is no choice between Brexit or no Brexit: it\u2019s a choice between deal or no deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to keep to the October 31 Brexit deadline, deal or no deal.\n\nHe pledged to renegotiate the most contentious elements of a divorce text agreed by his predecessor Theresa May with Brussels last year, which MPs rejected three times.\n\nThe compromise deal that was finally struck on Thursday has a new arrangement for keeping open the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nThe DUP has said it cannot support the plans, as efforts to avoid checks on the Irish land border would lead to new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.\n\n\u2013 Former PMs wade in \u2013\n\nFormer Conservative prime minister John Major (1990-1997) and his Labour successor Tony Blair (1997-2007) pleaded with MPs to back a second referendum, ahead of a major rally by the \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d campaign outside parliament on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhatever is the outcome, no deal or bad deal, it should not pass without the final say resting with the people,\u201d said Blair.\n\nMajor said Brexit was a \u201cthoroughly bad idea\u201d that risked breaking up the UK.\n\nSterling steadied around $1.29 Friday as dealers took a breather at the end of a dizzying week.\n\nETX Capital analyst Michael Baker said the market was \u201creally gambling\u201d on the vote and had \u201cnot priced in fully all scenarios \u2014 so expect big moves\u201d.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Friday there was \u201cno better outcome\u201d to the tortuous Brexit process than his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/8d95b9_parliamentary-vote-on-brexit-deal-is-expected-close-johnson-tells-mps-no-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
