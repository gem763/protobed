Yep, I\u2019m already back on my Glee bullshit. L-I-V-I-N-G FOR THIS.\n\nThe show, which he calls \u201ca love letter to the Golden age of Tinseltown,\u201d is still in it\u2019s early stages, but we\u2019ve already confirmed that Glee alum Darren Criss is involved. So I guess it\u2019s time to binge-watch Glee and The Assassination of Gianni Versace because your fave TV combo are back, baby.\n\n\u201cHonored to say that I\u2019m heading back to the House of Murphy where I\u2019ll be starring in but also executive producing HOLLYWOOD with Time\u2019s King of Television,\u201d Darren said in an Instagram post.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Hollywood, but considering the pair\u2019s roaring success with previous projects, I\u2019m pretty sure this will be one of those binge-the-whole-thing-in-one-night shows.\n\nThe show will be set in Hollywood in the 40s, and will likely show us the ol\u2019 razzle dazzle of the entertainment biz back in the day. If Criss\u2019 previous roles as Blaine Anderson in Glee, and Andrew Cunanan in American Crime Story is anything to go off, the acting in Hollywood is going to be top notch.\n\nMurphy has a history of collaborating with the same people on a reccurring basis, so it\u2019s unsurprising that Criss has been cast for a third role in his shows. But this time we\u2019ll also be seeing Criss in a producer role, with the actor revealing that he and Murphy have had Hollywood in the works since late 2018.\n\nThe limited series will make its Netflix debut in May 2020. Until then, you\u2019ll catch me watching Glee re-runs on repeat until the lyrics to Don\u2019t Stop Believing are etched into my brain.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1078642350.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
