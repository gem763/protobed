REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union may impose rules to ensure companies that collect data do not misuse it, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief said on Friday, signaling how she could use her expanded powers to rein in U.S. tech firms like Facebook and Google.\n\nThe comments by Margrethe Vestager, appointed to serve another five years as European competition commissioner with new regulatory powers, suggests she may introduce rules to specifically cover tech companies and their use of data.\n\nUntil now, fines have been handed out on a case-by-case basis based on regulations that are not specific to the sector.\n\nUnder Vestager, fines totaling about 10 billion euros ($11.1 billion) have been handed down to Google and Qualcomm after court rulings determined they had thwarted rivals.\n\n\u201cIf we want to define the market, to set out what\u2019s acceptable and what isn\u2019t, then what we need is not more competition enforcement. We need regulation,\u201d she told a conference in Copenhagen.\n\n\u201cSo we may also need broader rules to make sure that the way companies collect and use data doesn\u2019t harm the fundamental values of our society,\u201d Vestager said without giving details.\n\nShe said the bloc\u2019s data protection rules, adopted last year, gave Europeans control over personal data but did not help in instances when problems arose from companies misusing data to draw conclusions about individuals or to undermine democracy.\n\nTech giants, once seen as engines of economic growth and a source of innovation, have come under fire on both sides of the Atlantic for allegedly misusing their power and for failing to protect their users\u2019 privacy.", "description": "The European Union may impose rules to ensure companies that collect data do not misuse it, Europe's antitrust chief said on Friday, signaling how she could use her expanded powers to rein in U.S. tech firms like Facebook and Google.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429445220&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C17X", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
