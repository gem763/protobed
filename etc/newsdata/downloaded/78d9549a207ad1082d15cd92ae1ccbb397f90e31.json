REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nJust three weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc, it is still unclear on what terms it will leave or indeed whether it will become the first sovereign state to depart the European project.\n\nBrexit descended into a public row between London and Brussels this week after a Downing Street source said a Brexit deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.\n\nThe EU accused Johnson of playing a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d and bluntly told London on Wednesday - exactly a week since Johnson\u2019s initial bid for a last-minute deal - that it would have to make further significant concessions.\n\nAs both sides position for another delay followed by a British election, or an acrimonious divorce on Oct. 31, Johnson will meet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at an undisclosed location in the north west of England on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis will be a private meeting to allow both leaders and their teams to have detailed discussions,\u201d the offices of both leaders said in identical statements.\n\nJohnson said he was cautiously optimistic, though Varadkar said on Tuesday that it would be very difficult to strike a Brexit deal by next week - when the EU holds a crucial Oct. 17-18 summit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seriously focused on trying to resolve this issue and trying to get a deal,\u201d junior business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said.\n\nEU diplomats, though, are sceptical about the chances of a deal. Most expect Johnson to be forced to accept a delay to Brexit - a step that could ultimately lead to either a disorderly exit or the reversal of the entire Brexit endeavour.\n\nNO DEAL BY DEFAULT?\n\nBritain\u2019s former foreign minister Jeremy Hunt cautioned that a \u201ccatastrophic failure in statecraft\u201d could lead to a no-deal Brexit as Johnson would likely win an election and, then emboldened, be unwilling to compromise.\n\nHunt said the EU was misreading British domestic politics as it had when dealing with both former prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa May.\n\n\u201cIf Boris wins, which is what the polls are saying, at the moment, and he comes back with a majority, that British government will be much less willing to compromise,\u201d Hunt told the BBC.\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution.
