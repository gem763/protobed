Under text that said: \u201cNOW HIRING CONSERVATIVE MINORITIES,\u201d the poster said that because I\u2019m a black conservative, I \u201clack dignity, shame, and charisma.\u201d It also implied that my thoughts and motivations were for sale to the highest bidder, a constant (and dreadfully boring) critique of black conservatives.\n\nThis is just one example of the left\u2019s war on minorities of any kind who dare to challenge leftist dogma. To them, blacks, Latinos, or anyone nonwhite who rails against the prevailing victimhood orthodoxy of the left is a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d or \u201cgrifter for hire.\u201d\n\nIn response to our event with @robsmithonline, which had an AMAZING turnout, campus socialists decided to put up these flyers. Absolutely disgusting. @charliekirk11 @TPUSA pic.twitter.com/zqxEA8l0V4 \u2014 TPUSA at UIUC (@TPUSAatUIUC) October 17, 2019\n\nAnd, if you think it\u2019s just black conservatives that are smeared: you\u2019re wrong. Chinese University of Michigan student and conservative activist Kathy Zhu was just smeared with a photo of her plastered around campus with text that read: \u201cWe have white supremacists on campus. They can be dangerous.\u201d For a moment, set aside the leftist absurdity of falling a young Chinese woman a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and think about how unsafe she must feel walking around campus at night.\n\nThis has been posted around my school at @UMich This is complete slander and incites violence towards me. Being a trump supporter does not make me a white supremacist. I\u2019m also asian if you SJWs can\u2019t tell. pic.twitter.com/zT86PHBv4H \u2014 Kathy Zhu (@PoliticalKathy) October 22, 2019\n\nWhen the left smears me, or Kathy, or any number or Black/Latino/gay/Asian campus conservatives who dare to think for ourselves, they\u2019re showing their true colors. They don\u2019t care about \u201cequality\u201d for \u201cpeople of color.\u201d If they did, they\u2019d welcome different and diverse opinions. Instead, they seek to silence, shame, and bully us for not promoting their agenda in the way they see fit.\n\nI\u2019m currently on the fall leg of a campus lecture tour that I call \u201cFrom Leftist to Liberated.\u201d In it I share my story about \u201ccoming out\u201d as a conservative with which you\u2019re probably all well aware, but I talk to conservative AND liberal students and community members about military service, the politics of the moment, and good old fashioned \u201cpick yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d motivation that can only come from a guy who grew up black and poor in Akron, Ohio, and has been able to overcome many obstacles to succeed based in no small part to the fact that I was blessed enough to be born into the greatest country in the world.\n\nThis is what they fear. That my message of motivation, hope, and love for country will Trump their message of fear, divisiveness, and hatred for America. When people like me, or Kathy, or any number of conservative minorities are smeared, the left is showing what they truly fear: a coalition of young, attractive, diverse freedom fighters coming together to save America from their assault on it and the values we all share.\n\nMy message for them: you should be afraid, because if the bullets that whizzed by my head in Iraq didn\u2019t stop me, your flyers, tweets, names, and protesters certainly won\u2019t.\n\nRob Smith is an Iraq War Veteran, Political Commentator, and Contributor with Turning Point USA.
