Few who are typically eager to defend the president have appeared at all on television so far this month.\n\nWhite House officials close to President Donald Trump are pulling off a disappearing act, remaining largely absent from public view \u2014 in the middle of the storm over impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe invited the White House on to answer questions on the show this morning,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper explained to his viewers on Sunday\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201dThey did not offer a guest.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a well-worn strategy in the Trump White House: Senior officials conveniently manage to be elsewhere when major controversies engulf the building. The frequent absences of Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump during moments of consequence have long been a running joke among their detractors. Their detours included a trip to Florida during the partial government shutdown.\n\nPlenty of others have jumped town during tense moments.\n\nAs Trump struggled with mounting Republican defections over his decision to declare a national emergency to pay for the stalled border wall, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney wasn\u2019t at the Capitol cajoling his former colleagues or in the West Wing making calls. Instead, he was in Las Vegas for an annual friends and family getaway.\n\nMore recently, embattled national security adviser John Bolton scheduled a trip to Mongolia while Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea, a gesture that didn\u2019t sit well with Bolton, who would leave the administration a few months later.\n\nIndeed, knowing \u201cwhen to be out of town\u201d was one of the top nuggets of advice that Kevin Hassett, the president\u2019s former top economic adviser, said he\u2019d received from a predecessor and had to offer his successor.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the tactic Wednesday. But even when they\u2019re in Washington, many of the White House\u2019s most visible officials have been staying out of public view, letting the president\u2019s indignant Twitter feed and his frequent commentary drive the public conversation.\n\nThat includes White House spokesman Hogan Gidley, a frequent guest on Fox News shows and the gaggles with reporters that often follow on the White House driveway. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, an aggressive defender of the president, has not made an appearance on the driveway since a highly contentious Sept. 27 gaggle in which she berated reporters and dismissed a question about whether the White House was organizing an impeachment war room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only person out here taking your questions,\u201d Conway noted then. She did, however, appear at an event with first lady Melania Trump, speaking with teens and young adults about their experiences with electronic cigarettes and vaping.\n\nAppearances have come instead from lower-profile staffers, including the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short; the acting director of Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought; and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who tried to stay out of the controversy. He\u2019s said repeatedly that questions about Ukraine and the president\u2019s efforts to dig up damaging information about former Vice President Joe Biden are way out of his lane.\n\nAdding to the vacuum is the continued lack of White House briefings. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has yet to hold one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that they\u2019re not using the many levers on the most powerful communications platform in the world, which is the White House,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, who served as press secretary during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. He said that the White House is losing out on effective platforms to try to drive its message.\n\n\u201cNobody is vouching for him or validating him and filling in the blanks,\u201d Lockhart said of Trump.\n\nMany aides to the president have grown reluctant to speak out on Trump\u2019s behalf for fear the president will then contradict them. Instead, they allow the president to set the day\u2019s message on his Twitter feed and vigorously defend himself.\n\nBut one of the reasons Clinton\u2019s impeachment strategy was effective, Lockhart said, was that the president almost never talked about the impeachment drama. He relied on his lawyers, his communications staff and outside allies to make the case for him.\n\n\u201cThe president shouldn\u2019t be his own defender,\u201d Lockhart said. \u201cThe president should be focused on doing the job of the president.\u201d\n\nBut unlike Clinton, Trump has another tool at his disposal: a massive and well-funded campaign operation that has vigorously defended the president on Twitter and cut a series of ads that paint the impeachment inquiry as nothing more than a Democratic \u201ccoup\u201d aimed at overturning the results of the 2016 election.\n\nAnother ad released Wednesday focuses on allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, which the president and his allies have been pursuing despite lacking evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nTim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, said the campaign team speaks with its counterparts at the White House every day and work in tandem.\n\n\u201cAt all times we take our lead from the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president is our boss and we are an extension of him we make made all of our decisions accordingly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 They've skipped the high-profile Sunday TV shows and avoided driveway chat sessions with reporters.
