Andrew Cuomo said the unthinkable: \u201cAndy Byford is exactly right on this.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s forthright praise of the New York City Transit Authority chief came the same week he acknowledged \u201cAndy Byford\u2019s progress\u201d in improving subway service in a public letter detailing the governor\u2019s long-term MTA investment priorities.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA subway official familiar with Byford\u2019s thinking said he \u201ctook heart\u201d from reading the letter, \u201cwhich is basically a full-on vindication of Fast Forward,\u201d the name Byford gave to his own list of MTA investment priorities.\n\nAs tellingly, the governor hasn\u2019t spoken snidely about Byford or his priorities recently, which is new.\n\nPeople who talk to the governor and Byford say Cuomo\u2019s recent public utterances betray an actual, behind-the-scenes mellowing of relations between two men whose publicly rocky relationship over the past two years prompted many to fear Cuomo would drive Byford out of New York.\n\nNo one is suggesting this is an enduring bromance, like that between the governor and Billy Joel. Nor is it necessarily a lasting detente.\n\nThe governor's office disputes Cuomo and Byford were ever truly at each others' throats in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe press-manufactured drama was never true as the Governor has always valued and respected the job Andy Byford and all the other MTA senior officials have done,\u201d said Cuomo spokesperson Dani Lever in a statement. \u201cAndy's focus on quality of life issues and customer service is in line with what the Governor has been urging the MTA to do.\u201d\n\nCertainly, in recent private conversations, Cuomo has adopted a markedly nicer tone when discussing the transit chief, a knowledgeable source said. But that tone represents a stark departure from Cuomo\u2019s monthslong public derision of Byford as just another anonymous department head, and his longstanding mockery of Byford\u2019s professional subway priorities: a modern signaling system \u2014 known as communications-based train control \u2014 and a less-demoralized staff.\n\n\u201cI have noticed that they seem to have warmed and have been on the same page and have shared priorities,\u201d said an MTA board member, who sought anonymity so as to be able to speak freely.\n\nFor a while, the governor would sometimes hold meetings about the subway without inviting Byford, a third source said. That seems to have changed.\n\n\u201cRecently things have seemed like the relationship is warming up and becoming better, and the two of them are in more meetings together and talking more often,\u201d that source said.\n\nEarlier this year, transit reporters followed their public acrimony with fascination. It was hard not to suspect some of it was rooted in gubernatorial frustration. Since Byford's first day on the job in January 2018, transit advocates showered him with praise, and the media showered him with favorable coverage. Try as Cuomo might to prove himself finally, truly dedicated to resurrecting the subway system, those same folks greeted the governor with distrust.\n\n\u201cYou could almost feel the governor\u2019s teeth grinding if you asked a question about Byford \u2014 describing him as a \u2018department head\u2019 like he was an anonymous employee Cuomo had barely heard of,\u201d said one transit reporter.\n\nIn an effort to allay public concern about the hastily devised L-tunnel repair plan Cuomo thrust upon the MTA with short notice, Byford promised to commission an independent review of the matter. Not only did that review never materialize, but the MTA, which Cuomo effectively controls, took Byford off the project, as POLITICO reported in March.\n\nThe governor also developed a habit of publicly mocking Byford\u2019s preferred option for upgrading New York\u2019s subway signals as an old-fashioned technology, even though it\u2019s the international standard. Cuomo would refer to the MTA as \u201cdiabolical.\u201d In a speech that Byford did not attend in February, Cuomo publicly scoffed at the MTA and its subway workers, whose morale Byford has worked steadfastly to boost.\n\nIn April, The New York Times reported that Byford and Cuomo had not spoken in months.\n\nThat\u2019s changed. It\u2019s not clear why, or if it will last.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Cuomo was talking about \u201cquality of life\u201d issues on the subway \u2014 the omnipresence of the homeless, rising worker assaults, aggressive panhandling. It\u2019s an issue on which Byford and the governor happen to have some agreement. And it\u2019s in that context that Cuomo uttered those formerly unimaginable words.\n\n\u201cAndy Byford is exactly right on this,\" Cuomo said. \"His point is the customer experience. And a customer has a right, a rider has a right, not to be harassed, not to be threatened, not to be subjected to intolerable conditions.\u201d\n\nByford says he and the governor have always shared the same priorities.\n\n\u201cI have an excellent working relationship with Governor Cuomo,\" he said in a statement. \"The Governor and I always have been, and are, on exactly the same page about the need to modernize New York\u2019s transit system.\u201c\n\nLisa Daglian, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA, hopes the two can keep up the reasonably good humor.\n\n\u201cTeamwork makes the dream work and in this case the dream is a safe, reliable and accessible transit system that gets people where they need to go without delay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all need to be pulling in the same direction to get our system back on track for the region\u2019s nearly nine million daily riders.\u201d", "description": "People who talk to the governor and Byford say Cuomo\u2019s recent utterances betray an actual, behind-the-scenes mellowing of relations between two men.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/99/94/f6399b4d4f109c855b3b6303a525/untitled.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
