He was shaking,\u201d Trump said of Kerr when he was asked for his thoughts on whether the Chinese were wrong to be putting pressure on the NBA after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted out a since-deleted photo in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Protesters have for months demonstrated against China allegedly infringing on their Western-style democratic rights.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to answer the question,\u201d Trump said, referring to when Kerr was asked if he had any thoughts on the NBA-China controversy. Kerr said he didn't.\n\nPRO-HONG KONG NBA FAN BOOTED FROM PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESEASON GAME AGAINST CHINESE TEAM\n\n\u201cI watched Popovich, sort of the same thing, but he didn\u2019t look quite as scared, actually. But they talk badly about the United States -- but when (they) talk about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad,\u201d Trump continued. He accused the two coaches of \u201cpandering\u201d to China, though on Oct. 1 Trump himself tweeted a congratulations to the People\u2019s Republic of China for 70 years of communist rule. Trump has remained largely silent on Hong Kong demonstrations.\n\nThe NBA has had a growing relationship with China, but voicing support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong threatens to damage that relationship. After Morey\u2019s tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association said it would suspend all cooperation with the Houston Rockets, and the sports channel of China\u2019s top state broadcaster announced it would suspend airing Houston Rockets events on television.\n\nIRAN LIFTS 40 YEAR-BAN ON WOMEN ENTERING FOOTBALL STADIUMS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bizarre international story. A lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about like everybody is, but I\u2019m not gonna comment further,\u201d Kerr said of the controversy.\n\nPopovich praised league commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s measured response to the controversy, in which he pledged not to restrict free speech, and pivoted to listing grievances against Trump without naming him directly.\n\nSilver has \"been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous. Then you compare it to what we've had to live through the past three years, it's a big difference,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cA big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise. It wasn't easy for him to say. He said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. I'm thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\u201d\n\nAfter Morey\u2019s \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d tweet, NBA owners incited outrage for appearing to side with deep-pocketed Beijing powerbrokers over one of their own employees.\n\nRockets owner Tillman Fertitta tweeted to say Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak for\u201d the team.\n\nMorey also backtracked on his initial support. \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nSilver issued a statement Tuesday saying the league \u201cwill not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\u201d Silver said in the statement. \u201cIt is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,\u201d Silver continued.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump mocked Golden State Warriors coach and frequent critic Steve Kerr for how he responded to a question about a controversy between China and the NBA, calling Kerr a \u201clittle boy.\u201d", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/TrumpWH092719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
