The home was made to look like a minimalist sculpture.\n\ncaption \u201cTiny Holiday Home\u201d won the top prize for 2019 House Interior of the Year. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\nThe house sits just outside of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and the judges awarded it the top prize because of its \u201cclever use of space\u201d and sustainable materials. The home is just under 600 square feet, according to Dezeen.\n\nFour separate concrete blocks of different sizes connect through a porch, creating the cohesive space.\n\nThe founding designers of i29 Jeroen Dellensen & Jaspar Jansen told Insider that the blocks are separated by function. There is a block for an entrance space, one for kitchen and dining, one for general living, and another for sleeping.\n\ncaption Four blocks make up the house. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\nThe bedroom block is the largest and spans two stories according to Dezeen.\n\n\u201cThe smart arrangement of functions make use of every square centimeter,\u201d Dellensen and Jansen told Insider.\n\nThe kitchen and living room are in the middle of the house, made of two blocks that each feature sliding doors with access to a patio and garden. The doors highlight the contrast between the structure and the surroundings.\n\nBut the different functions aren\u2019t visible from the exterior. \u201cOn the outside, the diversity in size and the interconnected positioning create a sculptural image, looking different from every angle,\u201d Dellensen and Jansen said.\n\ncaption The contrast between the structure and the surroundings is clear. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\nThe designers said the concept of a house that looked like a minimalist home appealed to them because they \u201clike to provoke a bit and contrast different elements to provide energy in every new location.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe building stands out to its surroundings, which makes it at one hand a landmark and recognizable object,\u201d said Dellensen and Jansen. \u201cAt the same time, the facade is built completely in natural materials (wood) and therefore blends in naturally.\u201d\n\nAlthough the contrast is dramatic, the designers think it\u2019s actually representative of the myriad hues we see in nature.\n\ncaption The house\u2019s appearance shifts based on your perspective. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\n\u201cIn nature itself, you also see many contrasts in color\u2026 so why not use this in man-made additions?\u201d the designers said.\n\nThe sculptural appearance comes through in that the house looks different from every angle, giving visitors a new experience as they wander in and out of the home. The house also has invisible roof overhangs, which makes it look more like a piece of art than a home.\n\nThe designers used concrete floors throughout the house that continues to the exterior porch, making the space feel connected.\n\ncaption The designers worked to make the house feel cohesive inside and outside. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\n\u201cIn every detail, we aimed for the ultimate space-efficient solution,\u201d Dellensen and Jansen said of the small home. Despite its size, the house features a living room, kitchen, three bedrooms, one full bathroom, one half bath, and a patio space.\n\nBuilt-in cabinetry made of sustainable wood, large windows that create natural light, and solar panels make the space eco-friendly as well.\n\ni29 kept the house as minimal as possible, painting the walls white. You can also see the cabinets have no visible handles, keeping the space clean to the eye.\n\ncaption The house was made with a minimalist aesthetic. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\nThe design team also created custom furniture for the home according to Dezeen, which made the house look even more unified.\n\nA family of four uses the space as their vacation home.\n\nThe designers think of it as the \u201cmodel example of a tiny house.\u201d\n\ncaption The space is less than 600 square feet. source Ewout Huibers/Dezeen\n\n\u201cWith simple yet smart interventions, this project is of the highest standard and at the same time energy efficient, eco-friendly, and built with a small footprint,\u201d Dellensen and Jansen said.\n\nThey designed a home that meets the needs of the residents and embraces minimalism but doesn\u2019t make aesthetic sacrifices. \u201cSmall is beautiful,\u201d they added.\n\nYou can see more of i29\u2019s sustainable projects on Instagram.", "description": "Business Insider - \"Tiny Holiday Home\" took the top prize in Dezeen's 2019 design awards in the House Interior of the Year category..
