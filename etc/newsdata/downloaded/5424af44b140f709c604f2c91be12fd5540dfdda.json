By the time they stepped off onto the platform at Brussels' Gare Midi, one had been signed between negotiators.\n\nThere had been talk of the Brexit part of the summit being shifted back to Friday or even Saturday while talks continued on the other side of the road in the European Commission: that talk immediately evaporated, and events became more straightforward. The veil of uncertainty had been lifted.\n\nAnd yet, there was an element of Groundhog Day about proceedings. Most converging on Brussels were also there for Theresa May's triumphant day, when Boris Johnson's predecessor secured her own Brexit deal against the odds. As the former prime minister will no doubt be remarking at home this evening, there's a big difference between getting a deal and getting one through parliament. The Brexit circus may well roll back into town again.", "description": "The Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk double act will be familiar to anyone who has been following Brexit closely.
