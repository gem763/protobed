This puts 2019 on pace to be the first year since 2016 with an average of more than one mass shooting a day.\n\nAs of September 1, which was the 244th day of the year, there have been 283 mass shootings in the U.S., according to data from the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which tracks every mass shooting in the country. The GVA defines a mass shooting as any incident in which at least four people were shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThe toll of 283 mass shootings includes several high-profile, mass casualty attacks, two of which happened within 24 hours of each other:\n\nA shooting in a historic district of Dayton, Ohio, on August 4, with nine people killed and 27 injured.\n\nA shooting at Walmart in El Paso, Texas\n\nA shooting in a municipal building in Virginia Beach, on May 31, where a former city employee killed 12 people and wounded four.\n\nTrump denounces white supremacy after weekend of violence\n\nThe GVA said there have been 37,662 total shooting incidents, resulting in 9,932 gun deaths and 19,868 injuries, as of September 1.\n\nThe last time the mass shooting toll topped days of the year was 2016, which had 382 mass shootings \u2014 the most in any year since the Gun Violence Archive started keeping track. The past two years came close, with 346 mass shootings in 2017 and 340 in 2018.", "description": "There have been more than 280 mass shootings so far this year \u2014 and more than 37,000 shootings overall", "authors": ["Jason Silverstein"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/05/9326fd86-4dd0-4ddc-8887-cf9a2206b23a/thumbnail/1200x630/2db161c6db967c35f30052251f7c8923/gettyimages-1166142975.jpg"}
