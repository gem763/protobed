Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is taking the fight to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment after a spat Friday in which the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee claimed Gabbard was a Russian puppet.\n\nIn a video released Sunday on Twitter, Gabbard talks about the origins of her long-simmering feud with Democratic leaders, dating back to her support for the insurgent campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016.\n\nGabbard resigned from her post within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at the way then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) was treating Sanders. Her concerns were later vindicated by Wikileaks, which released emails showing that party leaders had conspired to help Clinton secure the nomination, forcing Schultz to resign.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s video, Gabbard recalls: \u201cPeople warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my \u2018political career.\u2019 They said, \u2018Clinton will never forget,\u2019 that \u2018she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media, will make sure that you are destroyed.'\u201d\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced. Join me in taking our Democratic Party back & leading a govt of, by & for the people! https://t.co/TOcAOPrxye pic.twitter.com/TahfE2XOek \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 20, 2019\n\nGibbered then refers to the \u201ccountless hit pieces\u201d against her in the mainstream media, the most recent of which was an Oct. 11 article in the New York Times painting Gabbard as a right-wing extremist. (The Times hosted the fourth primary debate just three days later, and the article \u2014 which lacked any evidence \u2014 was seen by some as an effort to marginalize Gabbard after she had attacked Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) effectively in the second debate.)\n\nCiting her 16 years of military service in the U.S. Army National Guard, and her congressional service on national security committees, Gabbard rebukes Clinton and others for \u201cfalsely portray[ing] me as a traitor.\u201d\n\nClinton claimed in a podcast hosted by former Barack Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe last week that Gabbard was a \u201cRussian asset\u201d likely to run as a third-party candidate. She cited no evidence to back up her claim \u2014 which Gabbard promptly rejected, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of the warmongers\u201d and blaming her for a string of media smears.\n\nIn her video, Gabbard goes on to say that the message of the party establishment is that \u201cif you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will not intimidate us,\u201d she declares. \u201cThe will not silence us.\u201d\n\nGabbard goes on to say that not only is she running against corruption, but against the Democratic Party elite.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president to bring about a New Democratic Party, a new leadership that will fight for peace, fight for the people, and protect our planet.\u201d\n\nSeparately the Gabbard campaign sent fundraising emails over the weekend capitalizing on the confrontation with Hillary Clinton. The email from Gabbard read, in part (original emphasis):\n\nHillary Clinton \u2014 the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long \u2014 finally came out from behind the curtain yesterday, accusing me of being a Russian asset, asserting I was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Russian interests. If this a fight she wants to have, one that has implications for all of us and the future of our democracy, then I challenge her to come out from behind her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media, and face me directly.\n\nGabbard has struggled to escape the second tier of presidential candidates, and failed to qualify for the third debate in September. However, she has made an impact in each debate appearance, partly because of her strong anti-war stance, and partly because of her willingness to attack other candidates\u2019 positions \u2014 something few others have been bold enough to do until recently.\n\nThough she supported Sanders in 2016, Gabbard has more moderate positions on several issues. She does not believe in decriminalizing illegal border crossings, for example, and would restrict many abortions in the third trimester \u2014 a position widely shared by the American public but which few of her rivals would dare to take.\n\nShe has come under fire in recent years for her opposition to U.S. military involvement in Syria \u2014 a position she has pursued, in part, through a controversial visit to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a similar visit in 2007.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
