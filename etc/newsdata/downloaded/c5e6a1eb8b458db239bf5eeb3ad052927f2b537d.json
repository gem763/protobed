Now we know one thing: Netflix won\u2019t be a part of them.\n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings confirmed Monday that the company won\u2019t be selling subscriptions to its video service through a hub that Apple plans on launching, similar to one that Amazon already uses to sell video subscription services like HBO and Showtime. Facebook is working on a similar plan.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s a great company. We want to have people watch our shows on our services,\u201d Hastings said at a press event Monday in Los Angeles.\n\nThat\u2019s 100 percent unsurprising, since Netflix has been steadily disengaging with Apple over the last few years \u2014 which happens to be the same period that Apple has been ramping up its interest in video.\n\nIn 2016, for instance, when Apple launched a new \u201cTV\u201d app, designed to be a digital TV guide, Netflix never signed on. And late last year, Netflix stopped selling subscriptions to its service via Apple\u2019s store. Asked Monday about that move, Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos shrugged and said Apple hadn\u2019t been an important revenue source for his company.\n\nAsked repeatedly about how Netflix would compete with a new host of competitors, including Apple, Disney, and AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia, Hastings used variations of riffs he has used in the past: Competition is great for Netflix, consumers, and content makers.\n\nAfter saying he would compete with the new entrants \u201cwith difficulty,\u201d Hastings switched to a more optimistic answer: \u201cThese are amazing, large, well-funded companies \u2026 but you do your best job when you have great competitors.\u201d\n\nHastings has said this for years when asked about competitors like HBO and Amazon. He has also said, correctly, that those services have grown while Netflix has grown, so his success doesn\u2019t have to come at their expense.\n\nWhat\u2019s different now is the sheer array of services trying to sell video subscriptions directly to consumers, like Hastings has been doing for years. And it is hard to imagine that all of them will succeed at once.\n\nIt\u2019s technically possible that some people will be interested in subscribing to, say, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, WarnerMedia, Apple, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, HBO, Showtime, Starz, and CBS All Access. But there won\u2019t be many of those people. Some of these services won\u2019t win.\n\nIn other news: While investors have grouped Netflix alongside giant, valuable consumer tech companies including Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, Hastings says his company isn\u2019t really a tech company after all \u2014 at least when it comes to regulation.\n\nAfter I asked him what role US lawmakers should play when it comes to regulating big tech companies over issues like privacy and antitrust, Hastings said his company is actually a media company, like Disney.\n\nHis argument: Netflix spends $1.2 billion a year on technology and around $10 billion on video programming. So \u201cwe\u2019re really mostly a content company powered by tech.\u201d\n\nSign up for the newsletter Recode Daily Email (required) By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.
