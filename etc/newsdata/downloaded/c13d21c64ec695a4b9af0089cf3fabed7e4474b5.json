We cannot keep track,\u201d Erdogan told Turkish journalists aboard a plane returning from Baku, in comments carried by the Hurriyet daily.\n\nTurkey last week began an operation to drive back Syrian Kurdish militants from northern Syria, after the US pulled 1,000 troops out of the area.\n\nThe withdrawal was seen as a greenlight from the White House for the Turkish offensive.\n\nBut facing a massive backlash at home, Trump later issued a series of conflicting statements, at times threatening Ankara, and at others, suggesting the US had no role in the fight between Turkey and Kurdish militants.\n\nIn one typically contradictory tweet, Trump announced: \u201cBig sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!\u201d\n\nIn his interview with the Turkish journalists, Erdogan also shared an anecdote from his telephone call with Trump this week.\n\n\u201cI told Trump: \u2018You get very angry with the media from time to time. You are now under their influence. Don\u2019t listen to them, you are a strong leader. This does not befit a strong leader\u2019,\u201d he said, according to the Yeni Safak daily.", "description": "Istanbul (AFP) \u2013 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he could no longer \u201ckeep track\u201d of the tweets by his US counterpart Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/9785c1_turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-he-had-told-his-us-counterpart-donald-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
