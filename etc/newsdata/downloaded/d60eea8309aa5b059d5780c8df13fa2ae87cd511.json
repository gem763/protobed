Meric/Getty Images\n\nPlank, the youngest of five brothers, was kicked out of Georgetown Prep, a private Jesuit high school outside Washington D.C., for being involved in \u201can alcohol-fueled brawl\u201d during his sophomore year.\n\nHe then attended St. John\u2019s College High, another Catholic prep school in the area, where he played football. He graduated at 17, and instead of going directly to college, he went to a military academy known for producing top football talent for one year.\n\nPlank became a walk-on at the University of Maryland in College Park; it was there that he started focusing on the material of his football uniform.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, he couldn\u2019t stand the way his cotton T-shirts became drenched up with sweat and bunched up under his gear, even though they were on trend for the 1990s.\n\nIn 1996, Plank developed the first prototype of a skin-tight base layer made from a sweat-wicking synthetic fabric. He started the entire operation in his grandmother\u2019s D.C. basement.\n\nsource Under Armour\n\nIn a 2014 interview with the Washington Post, Plank said \u201cI had about $15,000 in cash, and I had established pretty good credit.

However, Under Armour has grown to be comparable to other mainstay athletic brands like Nike and Adidas.\n\nWhile Under Armour\u2019s initial growth was rapid, it has slowed as of recent.\n\nAs Haley Peterson reported for BI, the company\u2019s revenue in 2018 grew just 4% over the previous year to $5.2 billion. For comparison, Nike grew 7.5% to $39.1 billion in its 2019 fiscal year.\n\nRead more: We visited Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour to see which store does athletic-wear the best \u2013 the winner shocked us\n\nRecently, Plank worked directly with Richard Branson to design and develop spacesuits for Virgin Galactic.\n\nsource Under Armour\n\n\u201cI have followed Under Armour\u2019s progress through a personal friendship with its CEO, Kevin Plank and via the great relationships it has established over the years with various Virgin companies,\u201d Branson explained of the partnership in a January statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved its determination to push technical boundaries in order to improve performance, so could not have been more pleased when Kevin and his talented teams stepped up to the considerable task of creating a range of space apparel and performance programmes for Virgin Galactic,\u201d Branson continued.\n\nRead more: Take a look at the Under Armour-designed spacesuits Virgin Galactic wants to send people to space in\n\nIn 2017, Plank sparked controversy after he praised President Trump in an interview.\n\nsource Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Plank said: \u201cTo have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country.\u201d\n\nThe comment caused waves and Under Armour ultimately issued a statement saying: \u201cWe engage in policy, not politics.\u201d\n\nOn other topics, however, Plank publicly disagreed with Trump. When the president referred to Baltimore as a \u201crodent infested mess,\u201d Plank took to Instagram to defend Under Armour\u2019s homebase.\n\nPlank lives outside of Baltimore, Maryland with his wife of 16 years and their two children.\n\ncaption Plank, his wife, and their son at the Kentucky Derby in 2004. source Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Moet & Chandon\n\nIn February, The Wall Street Journal reported that sources had indicated that Plank had a very close relationship with an MSNBC anchor, Stephanie Ruhle.

The family does not live in the home and is selling, according to the Washington Business Journal, because they do not use it as often as initially anticipated.\n\nThe family lives outside of Baltimore, near Under Armour\u2019s headquarters. According to the Baltimore Sun, they were also building a home nearby, but construction was halted for unknown reasons last fall.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal reported in February, Plank owns a company that leases a black Gulfstream jet to Under Armour.\n\ncaption A mockup of the Gulfstream G700 is unveiled during a news conference at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) exhibition in Las Vegas. source Reuters\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Khadeeja Safdar, Plank \u201calso uses the same aircraft for private travels.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear what model Gulfstream the company owns, a new Gulfstream G700 just revealed in Las Vegas will have a list price of $75 million.\n\nThe family also has a privately held investment company called Plank Industries.
