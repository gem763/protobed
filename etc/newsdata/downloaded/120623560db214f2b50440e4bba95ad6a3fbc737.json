On Sept. 9, Taylor and Sondland were texting about the withholding of aid.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote Taylor.\n\nNearly five hours later, Sondland responded with a formal-sounding statement that could be seen as attempting to cover for any potential illicit behavior from the White House and ends communication via text.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d wrote Sondland. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal reported that during the five hours between texts, Sondland was in phone contact with Trump. The New York Times also reported the conversation last week. Sondland is not a career diplomat but a businessman, the founder and chairman of the Provenance chain of hotels, and a Republican donor who contributed $1 million to the Trump inauguration before his appointment.\n\nSondland flew from Brussels to Washington for a Tuesday morning deposition before three House committees, but in a post-midnight phone call to his lawyer, the State Department instructed him not to testify.\n\nGordon Sondland and President Trump (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP, Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) More\n\nThe White House has signaled that it intends not to cooperate with the impeachment investigation, setting up another standoff with Congress. Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d anyone from the administration appearing in front of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry panel.\n\nDemocrats, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, have said they view the White House\u2019s actions as obstruction and will subpoena Sondland and documents related to the investigation. Sondland and Taylor were using WhatsApp on their personal phones as opposed to encrypted government devices, calling into question their compliance with record regulations.\n\n\u201cThe American people have the right to know if the president is acting in their interests, in the nation\u2019s interests with an eye toward our national security, and not in his narrow personal, political interests,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cBy preventing us from hearing from this witness and obtaining these documents, the president and secretary of state are taking actions that prevent us from getting the facts needed to protect the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters she agrees that Trump\u2019s efforts to block Sondland from testifying represent obstruction.", "description": "As the standoff intensified Tuesday between House Democrats and President Trump, attention turned to a crucial phone call between Trump and Ambassador Gordon Sondland.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nb40ovQRBEd5vxxAjJzFBw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/b3b3d760-ea03-11e9-9dbb-06d3d6abba73", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
