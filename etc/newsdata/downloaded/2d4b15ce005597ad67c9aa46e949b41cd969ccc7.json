There, she is surrounded by people who fret about what could happen to their industry should Elizabeth Warren win the presidency and implement the tough regulatory policies that are so closely associated with her candidacy. And yet, Ocampo has given $400 to the Massachusetts Democrat and plans to max out to her presidential campaign, saying that Warren's policies resonate with her more than most.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a firm believer that we all prosper when the middle class prospers,\u201d Ocampo, who didn\u2019t want her employer to be named and stressed she doesn\u2019t speak on their behalf, told The Daily Beast. \u201cSome people just don\u2019t have the time; frankly they might not even care to really understand what she\u2019s talking about. It could be perceived as being extreme until you look at what the plans really say. I might work in the financial services industry but I don\u2019t have too many friends who have $50 million in the bank.\u201d\n\nOcampo has also gone to fundraisers for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But in Warren, she said, she saw something critically different. She\u2019s \u201ca very consistent advocate for the middle class,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was very important to me as I see that disappearing.\u201d\n\nOcampo is part of what is so far a tiny, tiny minority of Warren donors in the financial industry. The senator, who has built a career warning about and legislating against the excesses of financial institutions\u2014including crafting a consumer financial protection bureau to carry on that very mission\u2014has reported receiving donations from only about 30 employees at the world\u2019s top 20 investment banks.\n\nIt is a small crew composed of everyone from IT workers to risk managers at small firms and larger outfits. It\u2019s also one that isn't quite yet comfortable trumpeting its politics. Ocampo, for starters, would only talk on the condition that her place of employment not be listed. Others declined to be named at all or declined to comment given their public-facing roles in various financial institutions.\n\nBeing a Wall Street Warren backer, after all, can make one a pariah\u2014a traitor to the cause of capitalism in its purest, unadulterated form. Earlier this month, CNBC host Jim Cramer declared that bank executives had grown fearful of the Massachusetts Democrat becoming president.\n\nWhile that may be true, Warren\u2019s candidacy has still resonated with a (very) small subset of employees at various financial institutions.\n\n\u201cElizabeth dreamed up and successfully fought for the creation of a new government agency that has returned more than $12 billion to people who were cheated by big financial institutions,\u201d a campaign spokesperson said. \u201cShe helped push two Wells Fargo CEOs out the door because of their role in scamming customers. She has led the fight against Wall Street giveaways, and is not cozying up to Wall Street at fundraisers. She has been the leader in holding Wall Street accountable and getting results\u2014she will do the same as president.\u201d\n\nOne contributor, who shared information on the condition of anonymity, had worked in the financial industry for 20 years and had given to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in his first campaign for the presidency in 2015. This time though, he has given $500 to Warren, motivated by one major reason.\n\n\u201cShe came out first of anybody for impeachment. I think that was the number one thing,\u201d this individual said referring to Warren\u2019s push for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings after reading Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nAt the heart of Warren\u2019s appeal among this small sect of finance industry types is a larger disgust with the current White House occupant. Many Wall Street denizens continue to support President Trump, who has slashed taxes and regulations in ways that have been highly favorable to their industry. But he is not entirely beloved. The aforementioned donor said that politics comes up often at work because of \u201corange Jesus,\u201d a reference to President Trump.\n\n\u201cYou cannot escape it because there\u2019s so much shit in the news on a daily basis that it has to come up at least once a day,\u201d this donor said. Though the donor had given to Warren, he said he would be supportive of any Democratic nominee and surmised that former Vice President Joe Biden would not end up winning the nomination, despite his early lead in the polls. No one else with whom this person directly works has openly supported another Democratic candidate so far but the donor joked that he was waiting to get turned into human resources for the amount of time Trump comes up with some coworkers who back the president.\n\nOthers in the Warren camp felt a bit more open about touting their support, perhaps because they\u2019d been through similar waters four years ago. Wade Black, who works at the small investment firm Scarsdale Equities, counted himself among the \u201cBankers for Bernie\u201d support group during the 2016 primary.\n\nWade still favors Sanders in his second run for the presidency. But he said he has given money to both the Vermonter and Warren. For the latter, Black was inspired to contribute when she proposed one of her banner campaign issues: a wealth tax on net worth above $50 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a Sanders guy but wouldn\u2019t be upset if Warren got the nomination,\u201d Black told The Daily Beast in an interview. \u201cPrimarily what the country needs right now is somebody inspirational and somebody that can really tear the system down piece by piece, the economic system that\u2019s been plaguing us for decades.\u201d\n\nBlack credited Sanders with shifting the frame of the conversation about the concept of government regulation and presidential politics in general. He said that it no longer seems so strange for someone like him to be supportive of the race\u2019s more progressive candidates\u2014that even contemporaries now concede that wealth inequality is a national emergency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a tiny firm in a large market of people that don\u2019t always do the right thing,\u201d Black said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of regulation in our business; usually that\u2019s reactionary rather than proactive. There\u2019s a too-big-to-fail problem, there\u2019s a too-big-to-prosecute problem that continues to this day, and there\u2019s impunity for a lot of malfeasance and there\u2019s no damage ever done to the big banks.\u201d\n\nThe hope for many supporters of Warren and Sanders, including individuals like Black, is that the candidates could finally provide a much-needed check on Wall Street\u2014that maybe, in the end, the medicine that the industry is being told to swallow will be good for it in the long run.\n\n\u201cI thought Obama would be the kind of guy to do that and I was sorely mistaken,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be a non-captive administration, an administration that doesn\u2019t defer to big business by default.\u201d", "description": "The senator wants to go after Wall Street and supposedly inspires fear among its top brass.
