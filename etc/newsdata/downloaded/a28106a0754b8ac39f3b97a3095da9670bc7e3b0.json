AMC Theatres, the US\u2019s largest cinema chain with more than 600 venues, has said in a statement that they are \u201cworking with law enforcement\u201d and that their standard policy allows audience members to wear costume but \u201cwe do not permit masks, face paint or any object that conceals the face \u2026 [or] weapons or items that would make other guests feel uncomfortable\u201d.\n\nSecurity concerns were raised on Tuesday when families of victims of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises, wrote to Warner Bros condemning gun violence in the film and asking them to withdraw funding from politicians who oppose gun law reform. The studio\u2019s reply said the film was not \u201can endorsement of real-world violence of any kind\u201d. However, Joker will not be showing at the Century Aurora and XD theatre where the shooting took place.\n\nA bulletin issued by US army officials at a base in Oklahoma suggested that the FBI had collected intelligence of a \u201ccredible potential mass shooting\u201d connected to the film after \u201cdisturbing and very specific\u201d discussions on the dark web. However, police in Los Angeles issued a statement playing down possible threats, saying: \u201cWhile there are no credible threats in the Los Angeles area, the department will maintain high visibility around movie theatres when it opens.\u201d\n\nBox office tracking suggests Joker will collect more than $80m on its opening weekend, a record for October.", "description": "Following concerns about the potential for violence, several chains will not allow face coverings or clothing that \u2018would make other guests feel uncomfortable\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e7d2e8b46191e74c393d405145f0b79a4ce6802/0_58_4440_2664/master/4440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a985f2c7046cedd36b4f559661ed7f3e", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
