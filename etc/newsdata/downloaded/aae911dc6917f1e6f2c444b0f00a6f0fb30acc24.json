Soon he was receiving special orders for dolls with other conditions.\n\nJoao was not just making crochet dolls with vitiligo but also wheelchair and hearing aid users as well.\n\nStanganelli\u2019s miniature success was certainly unexpected but he suggests that peoples\u2019 differences should be respected.\n\n\u201cThey think you are different, in reality, we are all different, and we are all similar in our differences.\"", "description": "Joao wanted to leave his granddaughter something to remember him by, so he made her a doll that looks exactly like him", "authors": ["Jasper Pickering"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584741.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195990657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
