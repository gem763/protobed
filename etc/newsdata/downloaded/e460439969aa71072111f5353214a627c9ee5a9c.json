You\u2019re forced to go through a search, and everything that seems suspicious to the police officers is taken away from you (i.e. everything that mentions Putin), and you will never ever see it again. Well, this situation is something that Russian activists go through on a daily basis.\n\nOn the 7th of September, me, my 17-year-old sister Polina Tolokonnikova, and 14 other Pussy Riot activists were arrested when we got out of my apartment. We were planning to walk around Moscow with a rainbow flag and Pussian Federation flag, also we had a \u201cPUTIN YOU\u2019D BETTER LEAVE BY YOURSELF\u201d banner and a handful of colorful smoke cannons. Our ultimate goal was the White House\u2014we wanted to make an art statement in front of our government. It was a day before the elections in Moscow City Parliament; elections that put Moscow on political fire this summer, causing mass protests and crazy outrage by cops who beat and injured people.\n\n\u201cWhy are we arrested? We just left the house, we did not do anything. Please tell us your name! Why are you using physical force against us? Where are you bringing us? Why did you take away my phone\u2014give it back!\u201d\u2014that\u2019s what I was asking the police, but they did not reply, and just threw me in the car alongside the others. It was the first time I was arrested with my sister.\n\nThen came long hours in the police station, with cops trying to force us to give our fingerprints, trying to divide us, trying not to let our lawyer see us, trying to send a 16-year-old activist to spend a night in a hospital (because she\u2019s younger than 18, and her parents were not able to come to the police department). Why all this malicious activity, why all these intimidations? For people just leaving a house with their friends?\n\nWe were not scared though. And it\u2019s a sign of our times. It\u2019s true for us in Moscow right now\u2014more and more people are getting angrier. Being politically aware is a new norm. If you respect yourself, you go to rallies. If you respect your country, you\u2019re not afraid or the riot police because, in the end of the story, the country is ours. We are the many and they are the few.\n\nSee Pussy Riot\u2019s call to free political prisoners in Russia.", "description": "On Sept. 7, Nadya Tolokonnikova and 15 other members of the Russian punk rock-art collective Pussy Riot were detained by Moscow police.
