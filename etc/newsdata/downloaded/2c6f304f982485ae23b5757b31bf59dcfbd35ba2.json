Fleck, who was shown shedding tears at the inspirational play.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo have it be one of those things that went from tragic to hope to accomplishment, that\u2019s important,\u201d Fleck said.\n\n\"That's what college football's all about.\"\n\n\n\nFour-time cancer survivor Casey O'Brien just got his first hold for @GopherFootball.\n\n\n\nIt was perfect, and so was everyone's reaction. pic.twitter.com/mnaGvgsErF \u2014 Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) October 19, 2019\n\nA redshirt sophomore walk-on for the 7-0 Gophers, O\u2019Brien was a high school quarterback when he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 2013. Since then, he\u2019s undergone a reported 14 surgeries, as well as more than 200 nights in hospitals and numerous rounds of chemotherapy, as he\u2019s battled the disease four separate times \u2014 twice in high school and twice after joining the Gophers in 2017.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI took chemo pills before every practice in my first spring ball. Did not miss a practice,\u201d O\u2019Brien said in July, when he gave a 13-minute speech at the annual Big Ten Kickoff Luncheon. \u201cI spent all of last season wearing a specially made shirt with a pad sewn into it to protect a medical port in my chest for treatment I was receiving. Did not miss a practice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\"This is what I dreamed about, and tonight it got to come true.\"@GopherFootball's @caseyob14, a four-time cancer survivor, is an inspiration. pic.twitter.com/5eRdSGLPcX \u2014 Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) October 20, 2019\n\nO\u2019Brien elicited roaring applause from the audience at the event when he said he was \u201cover one year cancer-free.\u201d He also said to the Athletic at the time, \u201cWhen I was first diagnosed with cancer, I was told that I wouldn\u2019t play football again. And I knew that I needed football in my life, that had been something that had been there my whole life, and I just wasn\u2019t ready to give it up.\"\n\n\u201cSo I kind of had a back and forth with the doctors, like there\u2019s gotta be a way that I can still play,\u201d he continued. \u201cI ended up talking them into letting me move from quarterback to placeholder. This was after nine months of chemotherapy, and eight-and-a-half-hour knee surgery, they were like, you can\u2019t take a hit. I was like, okay, all I can either be [is] a punter or I could be a placeholder.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t punt at all, so that narrowed it down to one position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday, it came down to a college debut that made all the hard work, both at practice and medical facilities, worth it. Making it all the sweeter was that it came with his parents in attendance, and they were able to celebrate together.\n\nOf the reaction by his teammates, O\u2019Brien said, \u201cIt puts a huge smile on my face to even talk about. It\u2019s a blessing to be on this football team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole team mobbed him on the field after the game,\u201d Fleck said of O\u2019Brien, who also held for the Gophers\u2019 final two extra-point attempts. \u201cHe found a way to make his dream happen, to keep working and working and working until it did. I know it\u2019s a hold, but that\u2019s pretty important. He\u2019s the biggest motivator \u2026 we have on this team.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt was a moment and a night that I\u2019ve been thinking about since I picked up a football,\" said Minnesota's Casey O'Brien, who has undergone a reported 14 surgeries since being diagnosed with a rare bone cancer in high school.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zgZLoQLdWewOj_xUZi7y16_i_pk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6HSJK7HSZII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
