I don't think anyone could complain about that. The right decision was made,' Gatland said.\n\n'Rugby is heat of the moment stuff and he made an error of judgement. When you have got a lot of testosterone involved in some pretty high intensity games, that will sometimes happen. He's made a poor decision.'\n\nAfter grappling his arm around Wainwright, Vahaamahina saw red on Sunday in Oita\n\nBrunel agreed that Vahaamahina deserved to be dismissed.\n\n'The red card I don't contest - when you see the images it's very clear. He did have contact with the face so we can't deny that,' Brunel said.\n\n'Of course it changed the game. When you're playing half the match with 14 men it's difficult.'", "description": "World Rugby are investigating after a photograph emerged of referee Jaco Peyper appearing to mimic the elbow by France's Sebastien Vahaamahina that saw him sent off.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/23/19968302-0-image-a-101_1571609929469.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
