A Beijing court then put the building up for auction on a website run by e-commerce giant, Alibaba.\n\nGuo, who claims to be a corruption whistle-blower and has lived in the US since 2014, is wanted by Chinese authorities on a series of charges, including fraud and bribery. Many of his assets in China have been frozen or repossessed by the government.\n\nAccording to the online listing, only two bidders signed up to participate in the auction, though more than 150,000 people registered to watch the sale online. Bidding was open for 24 hours, with only two offers for the building made in that time.\n\nRelated video: Architect Ma Yansong on why curves matter\n\nThe property eventually sold for just under 5.19 billion yuan ($734 million), only 5 million yuan ($708,000) above the opening bid.\n\nThe buyer has been identified as Beijing property firm Yucheng Zhiye, according to a statement released by its parent company, BBMG Corporation. And the group may have secured something of a bargain: The auction listing claims the tower is worth over 7.4 billion yuan ($1.05 billion) -- more than 40% above the selling price.\n\nGuo claims that the property is worth even more. In a video uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday, he said the winning bid was only 10% of its estimated value.\n\nThe tower was designed to resemble a dragon's head, with a further four towers representing the creature's body and tail.

It was designed to resemble a dragon's head, with a further four towers representing the creature's body and tail.\n\nPangu Plaza's other buildings -- which contain offices and a self-described \"7 Star Hotel\" -- were not included in the auction.", "description": "The dragon-inspired building sold for a bargain $734 million after it was confiscated from an exiled billionaire.", "authors": ["Oscar Holland", "Serenitie Wang"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190821163043-pangu-plaza-page-top-restricted-super-tease.jpg"}
