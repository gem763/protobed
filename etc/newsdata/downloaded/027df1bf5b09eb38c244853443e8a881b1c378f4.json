Staying quiet became trickier.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really alarming is that in the Eighties, you couldn\u2019t be public about trying to start a new chapter of the KKK or something,\u201d says the 34-year-old now, on the phone from New York, no dinner party in sight. \u201cThese things were whispered in basements. And now, it\u2019s all out in the open. It\u2019s kind of shocking that it\u2019s all gone so backwards.\u201d\n\nKendrick is lively and unguarded. Maybe she\u2019s less reticent to talk politics in a world where Donald Trump reigns supreme \u2013 though, given the film she\u2019s promoting, there\u2019d be no escaping it anyway. It would be unfairly glib to say that The Day Shall Come, cult British satirist Chris Morris\u2019s first film since 2010\u2019s Four Lions, is full of hot-button issues \u2013 but it is certainly arriving at a time when its themes of institutional racism are most relevant. And most needed. The film, says Morris, is \u201cabout governments betraying citizens in the name of some bogus war on terror\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBy turns messy yet powerful, farcical yet deeply troubling, it has an undeniably potent message. Doing justice to its elaborate plot would take longer than its lean 87-minute running time, but here goes: Moses (newcomer Marchant Davis) is an impoverished Miami preacher with mental health issues who runs a poorly attended community farm and mission, is adamant about the need for peaceful revolution against \u201cthe accidental dominance of the white race\u201d, and believes that dinosaurs will come to his aid. Kendrick plays Kendra, a foul-mouthed FBI anti-terror agent, quick of wit but weak of moral backbone, who discovers Moses on Facebook and spots an opportunity to lead a case. Using undercover operatives, the agency offers Moses money, and weapons, in an attempt to turn him into a legitimate terror threat in order that they can arrest him. Chaos ensues.\n\nThe film doesn\u2019t shy away from the darkness of what it\u2019s trying to expose \u2013 how US authorities radicalise, bankroll and entrap vulnerable, usually black or brown, people. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated feeling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Kendrick, when I tell her I laughed through the film and then left with a bitter taste in my mouth. \u201cThe very absurdity of the story is the thing that\u2019s compelling. It\u2019s funny, and then the subject matter is so grim that it leaves you with this weird mix of chemicals running around... which is hopefully affecting, because humour is such a powerful way to get people thinking.\u201d\n\nHumour has always been Kendrick\u2019s bread and butter. Watch on YouTube the grainy VHS tapes of her on Broadway, aged 12, playing insufferable stage school brat Dinah in High Society, and you\u2019ll see the seeds of her fearsome comic timing. She was nominated for a Tony Award for that role, and would later use her eminently expressive singing voice in the movie adaptation of Sondheim\u2019s Into the Woods (2014), The Last Five Years (also 2014), and, of course, three dizzyingly successful Pitch Perfect films. But before all that, there was Twilight.\n\nIn a role that would have been instantly forgettable were it not for her ability to gracefully tiptoe between sweet and sardonic, the then-22-year-old played Jessica Stanley, the \u201csassy, awkward friend\u201d of Kristen Stewart\u2019s Bella. The vampire saga didn\u2019t turn Kendrick, who grew up in Portland, Maine, the daughter of a history teacher and accountant, into a paparazzi-plagued superstar like it did her co-stars Stewart and Robert Pattinson. But it did open doors that had previously been shut, with Kendrick deciding not to barrel straight into another blockbuster but to use her substantial paycheck to take on smaller, riskier roles. \u201cNone of the filmmakers I worked with during those years had ever seen Twilight,\u201d she wrote in her 2016 memoir Scrappy Little Nobody, \u201cbut the series kept me in room and board while I did their movies for no money. It was like the world\u2019s most ridiculous day job.\u201d\n\nThe breadth of Kendrick\u2019s post-Twilight roles is impressive. After gaining an Oscar nomination for her role as an inexperienced but ambitious businesswoman alongside George Clooney in Up in the Air (2009), she mostly opted for films with a budget lower than $10m (the final Twilight film cost more than 10 times that). Kendrick has A-list charisma in abundance, and could easily have spent her career bouncing from cutesy part to cutesy part. But instead, she has used her five-foot frame and butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt looks as a weapon against those who would underestimate her, specialising in characters who are deadpan and quietly acerbic.\n\nShe worked twice with mumblecore director Joe Swanberg, on low-budget, improvised films Drinking Buddies (2013) and Happy Christmas (2014); played Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s clueless therapist in cancer comedy-drama 50/50 (2011), and appeared as Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s girlfriend in brutal police drama End of Watch (2012). Just like The Day Shall Come, that film exposed the brutality of the US criminal justice system \u2013 only we were being asked to root for the police officers doling out the violence, not their victims. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d says Kendrick. \u201cI do wonder if I watched it now, would there be stuff that I found problematic?\u201d\n\nThere will be plenty that people will find problematic about The Day Shall Come \u2013 including the abundance of racism played for laughs. \u201cWatch out for the nice ones,\u201d Kendra\u2019s boss tells her. \u201cThey get under your skin, and the next thing you know, the Statue of Liberty\u2019s wearing a burqa and we\u2019ve beheaded Bruce Springsteen.\u201d For Kendrick, that line works because \u201cwe\u2019re clear that the person who\u2019s saying this insane thing is a bad guy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re allowed to laugh at something this absurd. We\u2019re not saying that the joke is funny, we\u2019re saying that the person saying it is absurd.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the sexism. Though Kendra\u2019s hardly a victim \u2013 in fact, says Kendrick, \u201cI wanted it to be clear that she\u2019s one of the bad guys\u201d \u2013 as the only woman in the room, she is on the receiving end of a barrage of misogyny. \u201cWe had this amazing consultant, she was in the FBI for many years, and she\u2019s my height,\u201d says Kendrick. \u201cIt was really difficult for her. There\u2019s no out-tough-guying guys who are six foot four, so you have to be clever and persistent and work harder than everybody else. Those things that women have to do to just try and get a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nDid she find herself having to do similar things in her career? \u201cUm, yeah. There was a film I did many years ago and it was a mostly male cast... which doesn\u2019t narrow it down very much at all,\u201d she adds, with a wry laugh. \u201cThere were times when I was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m a joke to you.\u2019 I think if those guys could see videos of themselves now, they would be totally horrified. They wouldn\u2019t even recognise themselves, because the world is changing and people are becoming more self-aware.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the 'white crow' will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.\" StudioCanal 15/41 Border \"Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent \u2013 a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.\" TriArt Film 16/41 Fighting with My Family \"Certain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won\u2019t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?\" James Field 17/41 Us \"Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele\u2019s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.\" AP 18/41 Avengers: Endgame \"The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.\" AP 19/41 Eighth Grade \"It\u2019s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade \u2013 the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham \u2013 breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we\u2019ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that\u2019s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.\" A24 20/41 Vox Lux \"Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet\u2019s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman\u2019s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking \u201cfloozy\u201d whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.\" Neon 21/41 High Life Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a \u201cclass-one suicide ride\u201d. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time. A24 22/41 Amazing Grace Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It\u2019s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the \u201cfirst lady of soul\u201d, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation. Neon 23/41 Aladdin Disney\u2019s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 24/41 Booksmart \u201cOlivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clich\u00e9s.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Annapurna Pictures 25/41 Late Night \u201cLate Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It\u2019s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writer/producer/star Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it. The film has a glorious performance from Emma Thompson and a very sly one from Kaling. Thompson is at her most imperious as Katherine Newbury, a legendary entertainer, the only female in a male-dominated field, but one whose career is beginning to slide.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Amazon Studios 26/41 Gloria Bell \u201cGloria Bell is somewhat exhausting \u2013 both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove \u2013 but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Curzon 27/41 Toy Story 4 \"The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who\u2019ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.\" Pixar/Disney 28/41 In Fabric Curzon Artificial Eye 29/41 The Flood \"Perhaps The Flood isn\u2019t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.\" 30/41 Midsommar \"Ari Aster's follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it\u2019s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It\u2019s also bound to be one of this year\u2019s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.\" A24 31/41 The Lion King \"The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it\u2019s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.\" AP 32/41 Varda by Agn\u00e8s \"For a film that\u2019s almost entirely narrated by Agn\u00e8s Varda's own voice, it doesn\u2019t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.\" 33/41 Animals \"Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You\u2019ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.\" 34/41 Blinded by the Light \"Blinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen\u2019s lyrical genius, but of how he\u2019s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.\" Warner Brothers 35/41 Good Boys Lined up against some of this year\u2019s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. 36/41 Hustlers \"Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we\u2019ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that\u2019s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.\" AP 37/41 For Sama For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It\u2019s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors. 38/41 Ad Astra The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt\u2019s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt\u2019s performance and Gray\u2019s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 39/41 The Farewell Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it\u2019s one of the best films of the year. 40/41 Judy This is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s Judy. It doesn\u2019t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It\u2019s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film\u2019s creation. Path\u00e9 41/41 Ready or Not As absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn\u2019t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don\u2019t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It\u2019s a timeless metaphor. 20th Century Fox 1/41 The Favourite \u201cMacabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn\u2019t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief.

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 24/41 Booksmart \u201cOlivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clich\u00e9s.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Annapurna Pictures 25/41 Late Night \u201cLate Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It\u2019s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writer/producer/star Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it. The film has a glorious performance from Emma Thompson and a very sly one from Kaling. Thompson is at her most imperious as Katherine Newbury, a legendary entertainer, the only female in a male-dominated field, but one whose career is beginning to slide.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Amazon Studios 26/41 Gloria Bell \u201cGloria Bell is somewhat exhausting \u2013 both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove \u2013 but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Curzon 27/41 Toy Story 4 \"The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who\u2019ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.\" Pixar/Disney 28/41 In Fabric Curzon Artificial Eye 29/41 The Flood \"Perhaps The Flood isn\u2019t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.\" 30/41 Midsommar \"Ari Aster's follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it\u2019s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It\u2019s also bound to be one of this year\u2019s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.\" A24 31/41 The Lion King \"The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it\u2019s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.\" AP 32/41 Varda by Agn\u00e8s \"For a film that\u2019s almost entirely narrated by Agn\u00e8s Varda's own voice, it doesn\u2019t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.\" 33/41 Animals \"Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You\u2019ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.\" 34/41 Blinded by the Light \"Blinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen\u2019s lyrical genius, but of how he\u2019s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.\" Warner Brothers 35/41 Good Boys Lined up against some of this year\u2019s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. 36/41 Hustlers \"Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we\u2019ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that\u2019s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.\" AP 37/41 For Sama For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It\u2019s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors. 38/41 Ad Astra The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt\u2019s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt\u2019s performance and Gray\u2019s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 39/41 The Farewell Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it\u2019s one of the best films of the year. 40/41 Judy This is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s Judy. It doesn\u2019t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It\u2019s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film\u2019s creation. Path\u00e9 41/41 Ready or Not As absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn\u2019t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don\u2019t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It\u2019s a timeless metaphor. 20th Century Fox\n\nThe world may have changed, but structural sexism is still ingrained into the film industry \u2013 and many others. When Michelle Williams won an Emmy for Fosse/Verdon last month, she used her speech to highlight this inequality: \u201cThe next time a woman \u2013 and especially a woman of colour, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared with her white, male counterpart \u2013 tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her. Believe her.\u201d Kendrick was in awe of that speech. \u201cI thought that was incredibly well put,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a person, especially a marginalised person, asks you for something, it\u2019s not because they want to cause trouble, it\u2019s because they want to do the best they can for you, so be grateful. Sometimes people assume that people only ask for things because they woke up and were like, \u2018How can I annoy my boss today?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not disappointing, but it is disconcerting, to find that Kendrick doesn\u2019t speak in quite the way she does on Twitter, where she has gained 7.4 million followers and a reputation for her pithy, often self-deprecating remarks. She was more prolific a few years ago, when articles abounded with headlines such as, \u201cLiterally Just 19 Hilarious Tweets From Anna Kendrick\u201d, or \u201c35 Life-Changing Things Anna Kendrick Tweeted in 2014\u201d, or \u201c215 Reasons Why Anna Kendrick Is The Funniest Person On Twitter\u201d. Yes, 215.\n\nHer tweets are certainly very funny. \u201cUgh \u2013 NEVER going to a Ryan Gosling movie in a theater again,\u201d reads one, which has been liked 32,000 times, \u201capparently masturbating in the back rows is still considered \u2018inappropriate\u2019.\u201d Her pinned tweet perfectly sums up her brand of earnest self-effacement: \u201cFor someone with an intense need to be liked, you\u2019d think I would have figured out how to be less of an asshole.\u201d\n\nThe trouble is, tweets like this \u2013 along with winning appearances on the US talk show circuit \u2013 earned Kendrick a reputation for being \u201crelatable\u201d and \u201cdown-to-earth\u201d. Other female actors who\u2019ve had these labels thrust upon them, who have had the temerity to be frank or funny or crude or any of the things men have been doing forever without raising so much as an eyebrow, have faced a sudden backlash. Kendrick spoke of this phenomenon a few years ago, saying that Jennifer Lawrence suffered from \u201cbeing everywhere, and then people going, \u2018Ugh, that Jennifer Lawrence is f***ing everywhere.\u2019 Right, but that\u2019s because you put her everywhere.\u201d\n\nI wonder if she worried she might suffer the same fate. Sort of, she says. \u201cI worry about everything all the time. It\u2019s just a generalised anxiety thing. But on the other hand, I don\u2019t know. Occasionally people would prefer to think that you must be some eccentric throwing drinks in people\u2019s faces and getting pedicures for your dog, which is a strange outlook. I guess there\u2019s gonna be no convincing those people that I deal with self-doubt and laziness and all those very unbeautiful parts of being a human being.\u201d\n\nIt seems like a lose-lose. Show too much self-belief and you\u2019re accused of being conceited. Show too much self-deprecation and people say you\u2019re faking it. \u201cI know what you\u2019re saying,\u201d agrees Kendrick. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be bigging ourselves up, so it doesn\u2019t feel like we have to perpetually be going, \u2018No, no, no, I totally still think I\u2019m a piece of s***! Therefore, am I allowed to exist in society? As long as I think I\u2019m the worst?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given up trying to fight it. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense in trying to desperately convince them,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cSo they can go ahead and think that I get my dog pedicures.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Day Shall Come\u2019 is out in UK cinemas on Friday", "description": "Back in the heady days of 2012, a year before\u00a0Pitch Perfect\u00a0made her a household name, Anna Kendrick wasn\u2019t keen to talk politics. \u201cI never really want to go into it too much \u2013 it\u2019s always tricky,\u201d she told an interviewer.", "authors": ["Alexandra Pollard"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/16/screen-shot-2019-10-03-at-17.07.36.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
