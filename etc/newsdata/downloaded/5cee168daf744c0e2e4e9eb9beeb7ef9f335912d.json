To use the service, businesses need to verify their ID with a joint administrator's digital certificate \u2014 issued by Spain's National Mint and Stamp Factory \u2014 and have self-signing software installed. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe bank claims the entire process takes under 10 minutes and notes that it complies with \"current legislation and with the highest standards of security,\" per Oscar Velez de Mendizabal, head of BBVA's business transformation factory.\n\nThis innovation comes as small- and medium-sized business (SMB) banking neobanks expand throughout the EU, increasing competition for the region's 24 million SMBs. There are over 21 providers in the SMB digital banking space in Europe, far more than the Americas' eight providers and Asia's six, per data from Medici cited by Fintech Switzerland.\n\nAnd those digital banks are growing in the EU, which ups their threat on incumbents: UK business banking platform Tide recently raised \u00a344 million ($54 million) in Series B funding for expansion in the UK and internationally, and neobank Starling has been fleshing out its business banking marketplace.\n\nServices like BBVA's end-to-end digital onboarding for business will be critical for incumbent banks across the EU looking to stave off digital challengers. Online services that make business banking more accessible and less complicated are attractive to business clients, and can be especially useful for new and emerging companies that may lack the staff to dedicate to banking functions.\n\nFor digital challenger banks, which are relatively young and have no physical presence or legacy systems, innovating such digital tools is naturally top-of-mind. Incumbents should focus on them as well, but they don't necessarily have to develop entire suites of SMB banking tools in-house \u2014 they also have the option of partnering with fintechs or even dipping into their sizeable tech budgets to acquire fledgling digital competitors completely.\n\nBBVA itself serves as an example of taking a mixed approach to digital transformation in business banking: While it has recently developed tools like an intelligent account aggregator and a digital process for requesting guarantees, it also outright acquired Finnish online business banking service Holvi in 2016.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
