Soon after her detainment, China arrested two Canadians \u2014 including a former diplomat \u2014 on espionage charges.\n\nThe U.S. says Meng and Huawei \u2014 which was founded by her father, Ren Zhengfei \u2014 are guilty of violating sanctions against Iran, a charge Meng and the Chinese government adamantly deny.\n\nSee: How to invest in \u2014 or avoid \u2014 what makes China, China\n\nOn Monday, Meng\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue that her detainment at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 was unlawful and that the case should be delayed or thrown out. Video of Meng\u2019s arrest at the airport was released last month by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, but additional audio and video evidence is expected to be discussed at the hearing \u2014 particularly her interview immediately after detainment.\n\nGetty A scene from the Huawei celebration of its launch of the Huawei P30 Pro phone in London.\n\nThe case has been closely watched by Washington, Ottawa and Beijing. Huawei is one of China\u2019s largest private companies, and the U.S. and other countries have sought to ban the use of its telecom equipment within their borders, arguing that it has dangerously close relations with the Chinese government and military.\n\nHuawei has long said the Meng case was \u201cguided by political considerations and tactics, not by the rule of law,\u201d a claim that was bolstered after President Donald Trump said the charges could be dropped if that might benefit U.S. trade talks with China. But experts said this week\u2019s proceedings are likely to focus on whether Canadian authorities unlawfully detained Meng.\n\nThe resumption of the case comes just one month before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a tough re-election bid in October. His Liberal Party has gradually slipped in polling and is at risk of losing its majority to the Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer.\n\nDomestic issues like affordable housing and income equality remain key issues in the election.\n\nBut Canada\u2019s relationship with China looms large as an economic and political concern for voters. China is Canada\u2019s second largest trading partner, a relationship that was further strained when China held up the import of Canadian soybeans, pork and canola earlier this year \u2014 a move widely interpreted as retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nConservative challenger Scheer took the opportunity to place blame on Trudeau, telling him that \u201cCanada is being bullied by the Chinese government, and you have done nothing to stand up for Canada in response.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Meng Wanzhou.\n\nThe neck-and-neck race means that the Meng case could have an outsized impact on voters\u2019 decisions. Taking what is perceived as a soft line against China has become a political liability in Canada, as polling has shown increasing rejection of closer ties with China and overwhelming approval of Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nTanner Brown is director of real-time news at Caixin Global in Beijing.", "description": "Meng Wenzhou\u2019s lawyers will seek a stay in case that could extradite her to the U.S.", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN259_Meng_2_ZG_20190712142944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
