It works just like all other cards once you have fund loaded onto it so you can use it anywhere that Samsung Pay works via NFC or MST.\n\nThe idea is that you can put money into Samsung Pay Cash and then more closely manage that money. It is clear that Americans get into trouble with credit cards that have high limits and allow people to spend with few limits, but Samsung Pay Cash is just like cash so there are indeed limits to how much can be spent with this method.\n\nIf you sign up for Samsung Pay Cash right now, $5 will be deposited into your account. It is secure with Samsung Knox and Mastercard token services so you can use it without exposing the 16-digit card number.\n\nMoney Transfer feature\n\nMany people have friends and family located around the world so transferring money international is a necessary service.
