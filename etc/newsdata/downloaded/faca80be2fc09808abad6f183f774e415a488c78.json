Trump in August said his administration was reviewing Amazon\u2019s bid after complaints from other companies.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft battle for $10bn 'war cloud' contract with Pentagon Read more\n\nThe contract is part of a broader digital modernisation of the Pentagon meant to make it more technologically agile. One goal is to give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields and other remote locations.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesman said the company was \u201csurprised about this conclusion\u201d.\n\nThe company said that a \u201cdetailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings\u201d would \u201cclearly lead to a different conclusion,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nAmazon is considering options for protesting the award, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon boasts the world\u2019s most potent fighting force, its information technology remains woefully inadequate, according to many officials.\n\nOfficials have complained of having outdated computer systems and being unable to access files or share information as quickly as they might be able to in the private sector.\n\nPentagon reviewing 'war cloud' contract after Trump claims Amazon favoritism Read more\n\n\u201cIf I am a warfighter, I want as much data as you could possibly give me,\u201d lieutenant general Jack Shanahan, the director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, told reporters in August describing the importance of the contract.\n\nSome companies were concerned that a single award would give the winner an unfair advantage in follow-on work. The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.\n\nThis week, the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his adult son\u2019s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp. IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.\n\nMicrosoft said it was working on a comment. IBM and Oracle did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement announcing Microsoft as the winner, the Pentagon underscored its view that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.\n\n\u201cAll (offers) were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed,\u201d it said.", "description": "Donald Trump said in August his administration would \u2018take a very long look\u2019 at contract, after public swipes at Amazon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9c519b5b6ac1c5b8ce72cb040409316622b051/136_103_2864_1719/master/2864.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a815b403609f4534a0e56d908c0c3af", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
