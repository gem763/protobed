Photo: Courtesy Commerzbank AG Commerzbank\u2019s supervisory board recently approved a new strategy dubbed Commerzbank 5.0, which is supposed to help the bank navigate negative interest rates, tight margins and a weakness in its corporate clients business. \u201cOver the course of 2019, the market environment has continued to deteriorate further,\u201d the bank said in a statement. Newsletter Sign-up As part of its overhaul, Commerzbank plans to invest \u20ac750 million ($820 million) into digitization efforts, new information technology infrastructure and growth plans. The bank said it will cut 2,300 full-time positions\u2014resulting in \u20ac850 million in restructuring costs\u2014and divest its majority shareholding in Polish lender mBank SA. Commerzbank\u2019s cost base is set to come down by \u20ac600 million to \u20ac5.5 billion or less in 2023, following the sale of the mBank stake, the bank said in the earlier press release. Group revenue fell to \u20ac4.28 billion in the first six months of the year, down from \u20ac4.39 billion in the prior year period, while operating profit declined to \u20ac542 million, down from \u20ac659 million. \u201cThe agenda [for the bank] is clear,\u201d said Daniele Brupbacher, an analyst at UBS Group AG. \u201cAnd the industry headwinds are also more than clear,\u201d she said. Merger talks between Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank earlier this year collapsed, as both banks cited the costs and complexity of a potential transaction.
