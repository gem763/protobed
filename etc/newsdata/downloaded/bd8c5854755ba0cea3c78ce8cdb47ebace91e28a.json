Tulsi Gabbard and Anita Hill to take a stand.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I\u2019m a mother with a ridiculous birthright and a heart for displaced people,\u201d Carlile wrote in a statement on Twitter. \u201cRespectfully, I absolutely cannot support Kirstjen Nielsen having a voice among the most powerful and inspiring women in America.\u201d\n\nClinton announced last week that she would no longer be speaking, citing scheduling conflicts. But a person close to the former secretary of state told Slate she cancelled after learning Nielsen was part of the lineup. Hampton cited Nielsen\u2019s \u201cimmoral and reprehensible actions\u201d when she pulled out last week.\n\nMore than 53,000 people have signed onto a petition asking Fortune to disinvite Nielsen from the yearly event, which brings together the most prominent women in the Fortune 500. In a statement, Fortune spokeswoman Alison Klooster said the organization wanted Nielsen to have to answer \u201ctough questions\u201d in a \u201cno-holds-barred interview.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that the most powerful women in business, who also happen to be some of the most powerful women in the world, have strong views about how the U.S. Administration has handled its immigration policy,\u201d Klooster said. \u201cWe sought out an opportunity to bring the woman who was effectively responsible for that policy to ask her tough questions publicly and on stage about that policy.\u201d\n\nNielsen will appear in a 30-minute segment on Tuesday called \u201cThe Hard Questions,\u201d moderated by PBS NewsHour\u2019s Amna Nawaz. She was previously scheduled to speak on a panel with Cisco Chief Security Officer Edna Conway, focused on Neilsen\u2019s time at the department and the border security landscape. Klooster told the Huffington Post that the panel description changed because Conway was no longer able to attend.\n\nGabbard, a Democratic presidential candidate who sparred with Clinton on Twitter earlier this week, is still scheduled to speak at the summit during dinner program on Tuesday night. And Hill, the law professor who became a feminist icon after testifying against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, will speak at a segment on the future of the #MeToo movement.\n\nBoth women, along with actress Eva Longoria and former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, have been pressured on Twitter to drop out of the program. Even journalists who planned to cover the summit received pushback from concerned citizens, many of whom used the hashtag #NoSoftLanding\u2014the same slogan activists used to protest Nielsen\u2019s inclusion in the Atlantic Festival last month. (The Atlantic announced a week before the festival that Nielsen would no longer be able to attend.)\n\nAmy Nelson, the founder of women\u2019s coworking space The Riveter, responded to the public pressure in a lengthy Twitter thread in which she said she had considered dropping out of the summit, as well. Instead, the lawyer said, she decided to attend in order to ask Nielsen about her role in family separations.\n\n\u201cLike it or not\u2014and I don\u2019t\u2014the Trump administration and his executives are powerful beyond words,\u201d she tweeted. \u201c@SecNielsen is part of that power. Her actions will live on in history. In infamy. We must ask her why.\u201d\n\nAs Homeland Security secretary, Nielsen oversaw the implementation of the zero-tolerance policy starting in June 2018. According to the ACLU, more than 2,000 children were separated from their parents at the border as a result of Trump administration policies and more than 100 have yet to be returned.\n\nLast summer, Nielsen famously claimed the administration did not have a policy of separating families at the border\u2014a claim the Washington Post fact checker dismissed as \u201cOrwellian.\u201d She resigned as secretary in April of this year.", "description": "Speakers like Tulsi Gabbard and Anita Hill are under pressure to pull out of the Fortune event to protest Kirstjen Nielsen.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1961,w_3487,x_0,y_49/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571681337/RTS2GR99_d38gih", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
