We have now followed the first year\u2019s picks for five years and it is time to summarise and let go of them.\n\nSo what kind of picture emerges? Out of our 20 players from the English top flight in that 2014-15 season, only three are playing at Premier League clubs now: Marcus Rashford, Dominic Solanke and Hamza Choudhury.\n\nThat may not sound very impressive but some others are at Premier League clubs but on loan in the Championship. Six of the 20 are playing second-tier football (five in England and one, Harley Willard, in Iceland) so nearly half are playing at a very high level. On the other hand, two of the 20 \u2013 as far as we are aware \u2013 are not playing football any more.\n\nMany things can contribute towards whether a player makes it. Injuries can play a huge part, while the mental side of the game should not be underestimated. In addition, players develop at a different ages.\n\nWe recently asked our reporter in Portugal why Jo\u00e3o Felix was not picked for our 2016 edition and the reply was simple: because he wasn\u2019t among the best then.\n\nIn 2017, when Steven Gerrard was working as the Liverpool Under-18 coach, we interviewed him about what it takes to make it from the academy to the first team and this is what he said: \u201cI like streetwise footballers. I think all the top players come from the street, that type of player. The kids in our academy are coming into an unbelievable place to work, they are getting boss food, they are getting picked up and the full-time lads get a lot more money than we got when we started.\n\n\u201cThere is a case that they get a bit too much too soon. They get into a comfort zone of working in a lovely place and then it is a big shock for them when they have to move on or get released. I\u2019ve seen a lot of players come out of the academy with huge reputations and go into the Melwood dressing room. Then it is sink or swim and a lot of them sink.\u201d\n\nThe encouraging thing for these talented youngsters is that even if you sink on your first attempt with a first team there is normally a way back. In our worldwide list from 2014, Nikola Vlasic was one of our 40 players, but a \u00a310m move to Everton from Hajduk Split in 2017 did not work out.\n\nHe made only 12 appearances, did not score a goal and was loaned to CSKA Moscow before joining the Russian club permanently this summer. These days he is a regular scorer in the Russian Premier League and a Croatia international. He scored his first goal for his country in a man-of-the-match performance against Slovakia in September and looks certain to move to one of the big five European leagues again. And he is only 22.\n\nYouri Tielemans, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Luka Jovic were three other picks that year and, whereas the first two made their breakthrough very early on, Jovic took a more circuitous route to the top, not being given a chance at Benfica and being loaned to Eintracht Frankfurt before a standout season in the Bundesliga and the Europa League earned him a summer move to Real Madrid.\n\nTwenty-eight of the 40 are playing top-flight football and 16 have represented their country. Eleven of the players are in the top five European leagues. To clarify, Rashford was among our Premier League picks but not our world ones.\n\nIt is also important, however, to remind ourselves that life is extremely fragile and that one of our 40-strong selection and one of the most talented players of his generation, Abdelhak \u201cAppie\u201d Nouri, collapsed and suffered permanent brain damage during a friendly between Ajax and Werder Bremen in July 2015.\n\nThe world of football was stunned and, four years later, it is still difficult to come to terms with what happened to this hugely talented and tremendous young man. As Ryan Babel wrote: \u201cI will never understand why such horrible things actually happens to genuine people who are positive and have good intentions to make something with their lives.\u201d", "description": "From Rashford to Tielemans, we check in on the initial players to be chosen for our Next Generation project", "authors": ["Marcus Christenson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4b393d454d3443ed3144701bd4ebbaba6463d15/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3fb8f2f21949531acc12e58a693bc5a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
