It has the window like all modern Australian notes,' Mr Jones said.\n\n'It's not paper, it's printed on some form of plastic type material, like normal notes. The material's slightly textured so it does feel legitimate.'\n\nMr Jones then found the mistake was lying along the bottom of the note, saying the counterfeited cash didn't 'perfectly make a five-pointed star'.\n\nA shop assistant noticed the money was fake when they were able to tear it (file image)\n\nPolice were first notified when a counterfeited note using liquid paper was spotted outside a supermarket last Tuesday.\n\nOn Saturday another incident arose after a shop assistant noticed a $100 note they just received 'felt funny'.\n\nThe cashier said the note was able to be easily ripped which alerted them it was fake.\n\nPolice have urged business owners to compare any notes they believe are fake with ones that are known to be genuine.\n\nAnybody who believes they have received counterfeited money are advised to contact police.", "description": "Alarms were raised after three fake notes were discovered in Riverland, South Australia last week.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/06/20070338-0-image-a-44_1571810199060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
