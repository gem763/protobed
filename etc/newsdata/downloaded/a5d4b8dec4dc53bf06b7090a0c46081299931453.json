(AP) - Saquon Barkley has become a touchy topic for the New York Giants after their season-opening loss to Dallas.\n\nTouch is the key word.\n\nBarkley had 15 touches in the 35-17 loss to the Cowboys and many felt it wasn\u2019t enough for last year\u2019s NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe statistics on those 15 touches were impressive. Barkley carried 11 times for 120 yards, including a 59-yard run on his first carry, and he caught four passes for 19 yards. That\u2019s 139 total yards.\n\nThe problem is the Giants ran 66 plays, so Barkley touched the ball roughly 23% of the plays.\n\nIn 2018, Barkley averaged 22 touches. He carried the ball 261 times for 1,307 yards and 11 touchdowns, and caught 91 passes for 721 yards and four more scores.\n\n\u201cWe all know that Saquon is a focus of our offense,\u201d coach Pat Shurmur said Thursday before the Giants practiced for their home opener against the Buffalo Bills (1-0) on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s also, smartly, the focus of the teams that are defending us. His charm is that you can hand it to him or throw it to him. Yeah, we want him to get the football. It makes sense for him to get the football. Each game plays out differently.\u201d\n\nShurmur said the Giants only had four possessions in the first half and they had to throw more in the second when they fell behind 28-10. Had the score been closer, the scenario might have been different.\n\nBarkley downplayed his touches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to help the team win,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cIf we play better than we did last game, and we execute what we need to execute, I don\u2019t think the conversation will be about 15 touches. I think we find a way to win that game. But at the end of the day, Dallas made more plays than us. We just have to find a way to do that better next game.\u201d\n\nIf there was a main concern for some fans, it was some of the play calls.\n\nWith the game tied 7-7 in the first quarter, the Giants had a third-and-1 at the Cowboys 35. They opted for a pass to Barkley and Manning was called for grounding.\n\nIn the third quarter with the Giants down 28-10, they had a third-and-2 from the Dallas 8. Fullback Eli Penny gained a yard on third down and the fourth-down play was a bust as Manning rolled out and was sacked.\n\nBarkley might have been the better option on both short-yardage situations.\n\nBarkley isn\u2019t overly concerned about the team after getting beaten badly.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s more everyone outside of our locker room that\u2019s panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you break it down, there are 32 teams in the NFL. Half of those teams lost last week, besides two of them that tied. But half of those teams lost. Any team in the NFL, just because you won big doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to go 16-0. Just because you lost badly doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to go 0-16. Don\u2019t panic. Just find a way to get better every single week.\u201d\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike Shula said Barkley\u2019s approach is the same this week as always.\n\n\u201cI sense that Saquon wants to win, and he\u2019ll do it in whatever role,\u201d Shula said. \u201cHe is the ultimate team player. He\u2019s locked in just like he\u2019s been since the minute he got here on how he and the other offensive guys can help us win.\u201d\n\nNOTES: WR Sterling Shepard missed his second straight practice with a concussion. Fellow receiver Cody Latimer was sidelined Thursday with a calf problem. \u2026 DL Dexter Lawrence (shoulder) was again limited. LB Markus Golden (hip) and G Kevin Zeitler (shoulder) practiced fully after being limited Wednesday. \u2026 Analytics anyone? Barkley on being caught by Chidobe Awuzie on 59 yard run. \u201d It\u2019s the NFL. People are going to make great plays and take great angles, and he was moving I think 22.8 (mph). I was running like 21.8. Respect to him. He made a great play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saquon Barkley has become a touchy topic for the New York Giants after their season-opening loss to Dallas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/giants_cowboys_football_70180_c0-751-2439-2173_s1770x1032.jpg?cce0897cb58533c1d944085b1c1dc37fb719f529"}
