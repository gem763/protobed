Newton\n\nHalf the fun of stews is choosing which carb to serve on the side. As much as I love a crusty loaf of bread and potatoes in all their forms, my favourite partner for rich, meaty braises will always be the humble buttered noodle \u2014 specifically, cheap lasagna noodles that have been smashed to bits.\n\nBroken lasagna noodles edge out more classic options like dried egg noodles or fresh pappardelle for a few reasons. Crushing them up into jagged shards lets you choose the perfect size; the noodles can be as enormous and floppy or teeny-tiny as your stew demands.\n\nOnce boiled, they\u2019re surprisingly substantial \u2014 you just need one or two whole noodles per serving \u2014 and all those ridges and ruffly edges are excellent sauce traps. And, since no lasagna recipe on earth uses exactly one or exactly two boxes of noodles, they\u2019re basically free. I bet there\u2019s a lonely, mostly-empty box of lasagna noodles in your pantry right now.\n\nThe next time you have a hearty braise in need of a carb friend, skip the fancy pastas and go straight for the cheap stuff in your pantry. There\u2019s no special prep required: just break some noodles up and boil them in salted water until al dente.\n\nLike any other dried pasta, you could stop here, or you could finish them in a pan with a splash of pasta water and a bit of stew. I served them with a chicken thigh stroganoff situation, but broken lasagna is the perfect match for everything from boeuf bourguignon to vegan bolognese and anything else you can dream up.", "description": "Half the fun of stews is choosing which carb to serve on the side.
