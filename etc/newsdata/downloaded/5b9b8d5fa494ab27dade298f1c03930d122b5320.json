Hearing that their daughter and her boyfriend planned to launch a clothing brand with $5,000 of their personal savings and no real experience in the fashion industry came as a bit of a shock.\n\n\u201cMy parents were both hesitant about me leaving my job at Ernst & Young,\u201d she said. \u201cTo them, I had already \u2018made it,\u2019 meaning I was working at a company with a big name and reputation and had found \u2018success.\u2019 They saw it as a big risk and thought I should stay at my current role for a few more years because it was more stable.\u201d\n\nEventually, they came around. And now, both her parents are big fans of the brand. When they launched last fall, Zhang\u2019s dad was their second customer. (Kang\u2019s mom was their first.)", "description": "Nimble Made wants to be the go-to clothing brand for slim men.", "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8926d42300005600d66cbf.jpeg?cache=loWBpdTtcH&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
