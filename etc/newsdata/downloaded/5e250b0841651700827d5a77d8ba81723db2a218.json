India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century.\n\nWho is fighting the case?\n\nThe long and complicated property dispute has been dragging in various courts for more than a century.\n\nThis particular case is being fought between three main parties - two Hindu groups and the Muslim Waqf Board, which is responsible for the maintenance of Islamic properties in India.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe Hindu litigants are the Hindu Mahasabha, a right-wing political party, and the Nirmohi Akhara, which is a sect of Hindu monks.\n\nThey filed a title dispute in the Allahabad High Court in 2002, a decade after the mosque was demolished.\n\nA verdict in that case was pronounced in September 2010 - it determined that the 2.77 acres of the disputed land would be divided equally into three parts.\n\nThe court ruled that the site should be split, with the Muslim community getting control of a third, Hindus another third and the Nirmohi Akhara sect the remainder. Control of the main disputed section, where the mosque once stood, was given to Hindus.\n\nThe judgement also made three key observations.\n\nIt affirmed the disputed spot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, that the Babri Masjid was built after the demolition of a Hindu temple and that it was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.\n\nThe Supreme Court suspended this ruling in 2011 after both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed against it.\n\nWhat are the other important legal developments?\n\nIn 1994 the Supreme Court, which was ruling on a related case, remarked that the concept of a mosque was \"not integral to Islam\". This has bolstered the case made by Hindus who want control of the entire site.\n\nIn April 2018, senior lawyer Rajeev Dhavan filed a plea before the top court, asking judges to reconsider this observation.\n\nBut a few months later the Supreme Court declined to do so.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hindu activists are demanding the construction of the Ram Temple\n\nHave religious tensions eased in India in recent years?\n\nEver since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP first came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions.\n\nThe call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud, and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP since it took office.\n\nRestrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of a number of people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle.\n\nAn uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism in other areas has also contributed to religious tension.\n\nMost recently, the country's home minister Amit Shah said he would remove \"illegal migrants\" - understood to be Muslim - from the country through a government scheme that was used recently in the north-eastern state of Assam.", "description": "India's Supreme Court is nearing a ruling on whether the contested site belongs to Hindus or Muslims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D088/production/_95248335_gettyimages-93316687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
