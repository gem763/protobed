The negative effects of this policy are becoming overwhelming while the positive effects are wearing off,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement, leading politicians including Chancellor Angela Merkel had said Germany didn\u2019t need to let its budget\u2014which has been in surplus since 2014\u2014slide into a deficit to support the economy.\n\nBut Germany\u2019s gross domestic product dropped 0.1% in the second quarter and is expected to fall again in the third quarter, which would put the country in a recession. Industrial production contracted 5.3% in July, according to data released on Thursday, the steepest drop in the eurozone, with the important car sector shrinking even more.\n\nThe fallout of the U.S.-China trade dispute and Britain\u2019s pending departure from the European Union have put additional strain on Europe\u2019s largest economy, which is heavily reliant on exports. Yet politicians are adamant that they will ramp up borrowing only once the country is firmly in a recession, unemployment starts rising, and corporate-tax revenue falls.\n\nGerman and international economists have urged Berlin to use a Green policy package to be unveiled late next week as a vehicle to pump money into the economy, for instance via incentives to buy electric cars or insulate homes.\n\nMr. Draghi, who was holding his penultimate press conference as ECB president, will be succeeded by Christine Lagarde, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund. But Ms. Lagarde has made it clear she would keep the pressure on Berlin.\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing on Sept. 4, Ms. Lagarde urged governments with healthy state finance to spend more. While she didn\u2019t address Germany by name, she pointed to the need some countries had in investing in broadband internet networks\u2014an area where Germany is known to be lagging behind other developed nations.\n\n\u201cIt has been the case\u2014and I said it as managing director of the IMF\u2014that some countries in the euro area can actually use some of their fiscal space in order to improve broadband infrastructure and set in place the public spending that will actually help fight the recession,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi held his penultimate press conference on Thursday.
