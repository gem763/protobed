Klopfer, who formerly operated abortion clinics in South Bend and Gary, Indiana, until losing his medical and facility licenses in 2016, was once believed to be Indiana\u2019s \u201cmost prolific abortion doctor, with thousands of procedures in multiple counties over several decades,\u201d the South Bend Tribune reported.\n\nAn investigation was reportedly launched after the late doctor\u2019s family called authorities upon finding the fetal remains while going through his belongings. The family is reportedly cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nMr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, told reporters he found the news \u201cextremely disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that it be full investigated,\u201d he said. \u201cI also hope that it doesn\u2019t get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care. There\u2019s no question that what happened is disturbing, it\u2019s unacceptable and it needs to be looked at.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
