Illinois is a real good team. Night game, so I think we want to go in there and prove we\u2019re here, that we can go anywhere and play and come out victorious.\u201d\n\nNebraska is a two-touchdown favorite against the Illini (2-1), who are coming off a 34-31 home loss to Eastern Michigan of the Mid-American Conference.\n\n\u201cThe real season starts right now when you get into Big Ten play,\u201d Illinois coach Lovie Smith said. \u201cThey beat us pretty good last year, and we know they are an outstanding football team. They present a lot of different challenges for us, but we are really excited about that.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Huskers converted four of the Illini\u2019s five turnovers into 24 points while pulling away for a 54-35 win in Lincoln. The Huskers rolled up 606 total yards on a raw afternoon when the wind chill dipped to 13 degrees. Illinois amassed 509 yards in a meeting of what was then the Big Ten\u2019s worst defenses.\n\nBoth teams\u2019 defenses have been upgraded, though Illinois is banged up, and the Illini have a new quarterback in Brandon Peters who presents more of a passing threat than his predecessor. Nebraska\u2019s Adrian Martinez will be playing the Illini for the second time, and Smith said he and his defensive assistants are better able to scheme against the dual-threat quarterback.\n\n\u201cWe have an idea how they\u2019re going to try to attack us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a game plan that we feel very comfortable doing. Show up Saturday and you\u2019ll see exactly what it is.\u201d\n\nINJURY ISSUES\n\nNebraska was preparing sophomore offensive lineman Broc Bando to play more snaps at left tackle. Three-year starter Brenden Jaimes went out with a lower-body injury in the second half of last week\u2019s 44-8 win over Northern Illinois. Jaimes was limited in practice this week, as was safety Cam Taylor-Britt (upper body).\n\nFor Illinois, injuries have sidelined defensive linemen Jamal Woods, Kenyon Jackson and Isaiah Gay, linebacker Khalan Tolson and safeties Tony Adams and Stanley Green. Defensive lineman Lere Oladipo was out last week because of suspension.\n\nTHE 900 CLUB\n\nIf it beats Illinois, Nebraska will become the sixth college program to win 900 games. They would join Michigan, Ohio State, Texas, Alabama and Notre Dame. The Huskers are 899-389-40 all-time.\n\nCORBIN\u2019S COMEBACK\n\nIllinois RB Reggie Corbin returned from a hip pointer to run for 144 yards against Eastern Michigan and is averaging 7.5 yards per carry. Corbin left last year\u2019s game in Lincoln because of injury in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cI know there are a couple of other good running backs in the league,\u201d Nebraska defensive coordinator Erik Chinander said, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s right there with all of them.\u201d\n\nNebraska opponents are averaging just 2.2 yards per carry.\n\nKICKING SITUATION\n\nFrost said punter Isaac Armstrong or safety Lane McCallum would do the place-kicking and backup punter William Przystup would handle kickoffs. Starting kicker Barret Pickering remains out with an undisclosed injury.\n\nEXTRA MOTIVATION\n\nThe Illinois athletic department is giving free tickets to students, and 13 Illini greats in several sports will be inducted into the school\u2019s athletic hall of fame. Also, record-setting quarterback Jack Trudeau (1983-85) and Mike White, who coached the Illini to the 1983 Big Ten title, will be on hand.\n\n\u201cI talked (to the players) about the audience that will be watching us and what we have going on this weekend,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things surrounding this game, and we want to be ready to go. And as much orange as we can see, the better off we will be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nebraska heads to Illinois not only looking to win its Big Ten opener Saturday night but also shed something of an albatross.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/n_illinois_nebraska_football_78741_c0-128-3059-1911_s1770x1032.jpg?0c02ffc2bc4fff3edb8e62a1a0d7c3921e396ee3", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
