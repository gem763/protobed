In October, a single Instagram post from her about an unknown car brand called DS Automobiles earned 2.6 million views - and a predictable wave of inquiries about its cars. She claims that many of her adoring fans admit they were never interested in cars before they started watching her videos.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve widened the interest in the automotive world,\u201d says Hirschi, who prefers the term \u201ccontent creator\u201d, rather than influencer. Whatever you call it, the high profile is exactly what makes her irresistible to car makers.\n\nHirschi, Burton, and Enileev each make enough money from their social media content to support comfortable lifestyles in Dubai, England, and Russia, respectively - and to cover extensive travels to the most glamorous cities and Instagram photo-worthy hotels in the world. Car companies such as McLaren, Porsche and Lamborghini vie to host them - all expenses paid, plus project rates and appearance fees - to win glowing posts featuring videos of their cars.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that to have that contribution, we can really influence the opinion of thousands or millions of people,\u201d says Katia Bassi, Lamborghini\u2019s chief marketing officer. It\u2019s a high-stakes game set in two volatile landscapes: Cars and media have undergone massive revolutions in recent years. The losers are those unseen by millions. The prize in last place is irrelevance.\n\nHow do they do it?\n\nSupercarblondie notes that she is \u201cnot an automotive expert\u201d - and that\u2019s the point. Supercarblondie\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA car influencer - defined in modern terms - is someone who receives gifts, travel, accommodations, or cash in exchange for exposure on their social media channels for the entity that provided the gifts. That individual deliberately and systematically courts car makers as a business model while not being directly involved in the car business - unlike, say, five-time Formula 1 Champion Lewis Hamilton, who has 13 million followers on Instagram.\n\nFor many, it is their lifeblood.\n\nIn general, car influencers can charge around $US10,000 per post for every million followers - more if they have exceptional engagement rates. (A good engagement rate on Instagram is about 5 per cent.)\n\nSeb Delanney has 226,000 Instagram followers and 142,000 YouTube subscribers. He got his first influencing gig when he was 14: He received a free hat in exchange for wearing it in a video. \u201cThat was what sparked me to think that, eventually, this may become a source of income,\u201d he says. These days, though he declined to discuss his annual take, Delanney says he commands enough money to support a comfortable lifestyle in London.\n\nSometimes Delanney will approach a company with a specific idea about something they can do together, including a road trip, surprising fans, or a track day. He does a lot of work for certain clients on a long-term basis, such as Tag Heuer and McLaren. He also makes sure to keep regularly in touch with contacts he has made over the years \u201cto pitch my ideas to their social media or communications teams and hope they take the time to read and respond\u201d, he says. More often, the work he gets comes in response to direct requests from press officers at automotive brands and marketing agencies.\n\n\u201cI genuinely think the most hidden fact about this business is the work behind it,\u201d Delanney says. \u201cIt\u2019s very competitive, with very long hours and constant thought process required. Social media is 24/7, so you need to work constantly and love what you do accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe day-to-day grind\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the never-ending cycle of the social media world, the all-day, every day qualifier is all too real. Comments come in from all over the globe, like a water-torture drip, and engagement with fans requires round-the-clock vigilance. In this line of work, weekends and holidays aren\u2019t exactly built-in scenarios.\n\n\u201cI work all the time and find it hard to switch off,\u201d Hirschi says. \u201cYou are also at the mercy of the platforms you post on. They tend to favour content creators who post very regularly, meaning: If you take a break, the algorithms will work against you.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she says, it\u2019s surprising how many people expect her to advertise their businesses for free: \u201cThey don\u2019t realise how hard it is to grow an engaged audience of millions of people.\u201d\n\nFor Delanney, generating new ideas is often the hardest part: \u201cI have made over 700 videos - that\u2019s 700 ideas, 700 edits, 700 video shoots,\u201d he says. \u201cIt requires a lot of work.\u201d\n\nThen again, each influencer has a distinct style. Some bow to the algorithm chain-gang death grip more than others.\n\n\u201cTim is absolutely flat-out busy with the creation of content for his YouTube channel,\u201d Burton\u2019s assistant wrote in reply to an interview request, noting it would take six months before Shmee had an opening in his schedule for a phone call. \u201cIt is part of the life of an influencer: never time and always lived by the algorithms of YouTube.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the allure?\n\nThe human perspective that influencers provide forms their strongest allure, first for their audiences and consequently, for the car makers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey humanise what we do,\u201d Bentley chairman and chief executive officer Adrian Hallmark told me recently in Monaco. We had sat down for an interview about the company\u2019s new $215,000 Flying Spur; nearby, a lithe, platinum-haired young man recorded social media videos about Bentley\u2019s latest trademark fragrance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re 23 and you\u2019ve not got a career yet, the thought of a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce must be so alien and irrelevant - at least, it was for me when I was that age,\u201d Hallmark says. \u201cBut if you can get across human stories - human content - then, when you\u2019re with Bentley, it doesn\u2019t feel like a pompous, old-fashioned, arrogant organisation.\u201d\n\nMost influencers are under 30 years old; many are under 25. They are natural allies for automotive brands that have, since the beginning of time, striven to reach younger buyers. Rolls-Royce, for instance, reports that its average buyer is 45 years old, a commendable figure, considering the average age of luxury car buyers is above 50.\n\n\u201cAutomakers are smart to be using [influencers] to get the word out about their product to anyone under the age of 60,\u201d says Spike Feresten, a screenwriter with a successful automotive podcast. \u201cThey need to - because while the over-60s are at home reading the newspaper, the rest of us are on social media.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: About 88 per cent of consumers trust online recommendations as much as face-to-face recommendations, while 70 per cent of teens think that YouTubers are more reliable than celebrities, according to Social Media Today.\n\nCar companies experience varying degrees of social media engagement for car buyers, ranging from 25 per cent to 75 per cent and higher, depending on the numbers you read. Luxury brands, in general, outpace others when it comes to interactions per post. According to a recent report, Volvo generated $US5 million worth of media exposure after two weeks of working with Aimee Song, a benign young woman based in Los Angeles hired to promote the new XC90 SUV. Song shared three Instagram posts and an Instagram story with her 5.4 million followers; Volvo declined to comment.\n\n'Influencer' as a 'disgusting word'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfluencers have drawn vociferous critics. Beyond the ambivalence some car makers have about merely speaking about them on the record (Ferrari and BMW, among others, declined to comment for this story), there are significant ethical ramifications to the relationship. When car companies transfer undisclosed amounts of money, products, and travel packages to private individuals, those who receive said gifts are expected to play nice. That means influencers are unlikely to say anything disparaging - ever - about products that may not, in fact, be very good.\n\n\u201cInfluencers are easily confused with actual car critics - but they\u2019re essentially doing advertisements,\u201d says Jonny Lieberman, a longtime columnist and video presenter at Motor Trend. Lieberman has built a devoted following for his contrarian takes on supercars and his blunt linguistic style. \u201cBecause they\u2019re all independent contractors, they don\u2019t ever say anything negative, no matter what. And they would never say anything negative, because they are making income from the manufacturers.\u201d\n\nThe scenario creates an unnatural feedback loop of automotive leaders surrounded by people professionally incapable of critiquing the products they\u2019re shilling, Lieberman says. \u201cI hope that in 30 years we all look back on the term \u2018influencer\u2019 as a disgusting word.\u201d\n\nDan Neil, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who now works for the Wall Street Journal, shares the concerns about the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d that influencers have introduced into the automotive industry, notwithstanding their popularity.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of fantastic young people who are doing really good stuff [on social media] - and more power to them - but it\u2019s a confusing landscape, especially for newbies as they seek authority,\u201d Neil says.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be much of an expert to have a million followers.\u201d\n\nIn short order, the thinking goes, car makers could do away altogether with public relations departments and interacting with professional journalists. They could funnel the money they spend working with traditional media back into marketing, with no risk of even constructive criticism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, consumers would suffer if product performance, reliability, and safety were to decline for lack of professional feedback and critique. Since consumers vote with their wallets, the end result would be felt at under-performing car companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s the future?\n\nHirschi/Supercarblondie, for her part, notes that she is \u201cnot an automotive expert\u201d - and that\u2019s the point: \u201cI speak in relatable terms, without too much car lingo, so more and more people can engage with the car world,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not afraid to ask questions on behalf of a whole community of people who want to learn but are afraid they\u2019ll be shut down.\u201d\n\nMany brands feel comfortable playing in this field, with caveats. Lamborghini\u2019s Bassi says the 56-year-old Italian marque approaches influencers as an \u201cevolution\u201d of media to be appreciated, not feared.\n\n\u201cOur customers are very, very young right now; they are the same people following influencers on social media,\u201d Bassi says. \u201cAt the same time, Lamborghini is always careful about the trends. We don\u2019t want to swim in a big ocean of 5000 people pretending to be influencers. We have to carefully select the right ones.\u201d\n\nAt Mercedes-Benz, Willem Spelten says the right influencers can make the industry more \u201cinteresting and lively\u201d. The global senior manager for brand and product communications at Mercedes-Benz sees plenty of potential for healthy growth.\n\n\u201cIf an influencer stays true to himself or herself, and if they continue to produce their own stories, then there is certainly a potential for them to continue to grow,\u201d Spelten says.\n\nIndeed, London\u2019s Delanney says his income has been \u201csteadily increasing each year\u201d. Hirschi says she rarely, if ever, has to approach brands for paid collaborations the way she used to. Now they reach out to her.\n\n\u201cThere are some brands who completely ignore this movement, but I think it\u2019s only going to hurt them in the end,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate when I see brands spending a lot of time and money on creating online content that hardly anyone watches.\u201d\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Luxury marques are using social media personalities to introduce and market their cars.
