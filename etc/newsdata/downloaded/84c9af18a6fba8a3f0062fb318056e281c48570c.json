He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden told The New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken \u201cjust once\u201d about his work in Ukraine.\n\nA source told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. Contemporaneous news reports indicated the vice president was in the Hamptons at the time.\n\nHunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma Holdings board in April 2014.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump suggested that despite his claims, Joe Biden seemingly discussed Ukraine matters with his son. The White House has sought to point to possible corruption by the Bidens, amid the House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\n\u201cAnd now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOf course you spoke to your son!\u201d\n\nBiden has acknowledged on camera that in spring 2016, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire top prosecutor Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter had a lucrative role on the board despite limited relevant expertise.\n\nThe vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.\n\nTRUMP SEEKS TO TURN TABLES ON BIDEN AMID IMPEACHMENT PROBE\n\n\"Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,\" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office.\n\nShokin himself had already been widely accused of corruption.\n\nCritics alleged Hunter Biden might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.\n\n\"Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,\" political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted.\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani, on Sunday, suggested Shokin was the target of an international smear campaign to discredit his work.\n\nIn a combative interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, Giuliani presented what he said was an affidavit signed by Shokin that confirmed Hunter Biden was being investigated when Shokin was fired.\n\n\"I have an affidavit here that's been online for six months that nobody bothered to read from the gentleman who was fired, Viktor Shokin, the so-called corrupt prosecutor,\" Giuliani said. \"The Biden people say that he wasn't investigating Hunter Biden at the time. He says under oath that he was.\" The Shokin affidavit purportedly said the U.S. had pressured him into resigning because he was unwilling to drop the case.\n\nREPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER\u2019S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE\n\nLater, Giuliani added: \"I have another affidavit, this time from another Ukrainian prosecutor who says that the day after Biden strong-armed the president to remove Shokin, they show up in the prosecutor\u2019s office -- lawyers for Hunter Biden show up in the prosecutor\u2019s office and they give an apology for dissemination of false information.\"\n\nAfter anchor George Stephanopoulos expressed skepticism, Giuliani fired back: \"How about if I -- how about if I tell you over the next week four more of these will come out from four other prosecutors? ... No, no, no, George, they won\u2019t be [investigated], because they\u2019ve been online for six months, and the Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this.\"\n\nSpeaking separately to Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque.\n\n\u201cThe pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,\" Giuliani said, \"which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know and when did he know it?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGiuliani referred to a December 2015 New York Times article about Hunter Biden, Burisma and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message.\n\n\"The question is,\" Giuliani asked, \"when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say, 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'\"\n\n\u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d producer Alex Pfeiffer contributed to this report.", "description": "A photo obtained by Fox News'\u00a0\"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" shows former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings with Hunter.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
