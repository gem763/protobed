Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), but said she is \u201cthe clear-cut person to beat.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Billionaire George Soros said that his lifetime of funding left-wing causes has been impeded by his opposition, including President Trump.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/George-Soros-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
