That complaint revealed Trump\u2019s request of Ukranian leaders to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival. It has spurred an impeachment probe on Capitol Hill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe IRS complaint has come amid the escalating legal battle between the Treasury Department and House Democrats over the release of President Trump\u2019s tax returns. Part of that inquiry from Democrats is over how the IRS conducts its annual audit of the president and vice president\u2019s tax returns. That process is supposed to be walled off from political appointees and interference.\n\nThat was the focus of the whistleblower complaint. The people briefed on its contents said, for the first time, that the complaint pertained to allegations of interference in the audit process by at least one Treasury Department official. They also said, for the first time, that the complaint revealed that the whistleblower is a career IRS official.\n\nThe existence of a whistleblower complaint was revealed in a court filing several months ago, but little about it had become public.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s account focuses on the integrity of the government\u2019s system for auditing the president and vice president\u2019s tax returns.\n\nPresident Trump has broken decades of precedent by refusing to publicly release his tax returns. Democrats filed a lawsuit earlier this year demanding the disclosure of those filings, invoking a federal law designed to give Congress access to any tax return.\n\nThe IRS complaint has received less attention but has divided government officials.\n\nTwo administration officials have described the complaint as hearsay and suggested it was politically motivated, but they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Democrats who have reviewed it regard it as a deeply significant allegation that, if true, suggests that political appointees may have tried to interfere with the government audit process, which was set up to be insulated from political pressures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKey parts of the complaint remain under wraps in part because of strict privacy laws that prevent the disclosure of any details related to the filing of tax returns.\n\nPeople who described the complaint spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nRep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who received the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in July, said in court filings this summer that the complaint contains credible evidence of \u201cpotential \u2018inappropriate efforts to influence\u2019 the audit program.\u201d Neal has also said the complaint raises \u201cserious and urgent concerns.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower, a career official at the IRS, confirmed in an interview with The Washington Post this week that he had filed a formal complaint and sent it to the tax committee chairs in both houses of Congress, including Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), and to the Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration on July 29.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower would not comment on the substance of the complaint itself but focused on the importance of protecting those who come forward to disclose problems in government.\n\nConfidential draft IRS memo says tax returns must be given to Congress unless president invokes executive privilege\n\nTrump has closely guarded any details of his tax returns, refusing to release them during his presidential campaign and throughout his presidency. He has given a variety of reasons for refusing to release the returns, often saying they are under audit and therefore should remain private. Vice President Pence also has not made public any of his recent tax returns.\n\nNeal has not revealed whether the whistleblower complaint is about Trump or Pence, but he said in an August court filing that the allegations \u201ccast doubt\u201d on the Trump administration\u2019s contention that there is no reason for concern that IRS employees could face interference when auditing a president\u2019s tax returns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is very unusual for political appointees at Treasury to ask IRS career staff about the status of an individual\u2019s audit, according to legal experts and former IRS officials.\n\n\u201cNobody at the Treasury Department should be calling to find out the status of anybody\u2019s audit,\u201d said John Koskinen, who served as IRS commissioner under both Trump and President Barack Obama. \u201cFor a Treasury official to call a career person \u2014 even just for information \u2014 seems to me highly inappropriate, even if it\u2019s just checking in on how it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nThe Post has been unable to verify the allegation in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint of improper communication between Treasury and IRS on the tax audit program.\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for the Treasury Department did not comment on details of the complaint. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin previously told Neal he forwarded the complaint to the inspector general\u2019s office.\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for Neal refused to share any details about the substance of the complaint, citing taxpayer protection rules. Michael Zona, a spokesman for Grassley, also declined to comment, saying the senator does not discuss such confidential complaints.\n\nHowever, the top Democrat on the committee Grassley leads called for the panel to look into the complaint immediately. \u201cIt would be negligent for the Finance Committee to fail to investigate a whistleblower\u2019s allegations of political interference,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) said. \u201cA bipartisan committee effort to get to the bottom of this should have been started months ago.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJames Jackson, a deputy inspector general at the Treasury Department, said in September when asked about the whistleblower complaint at a congressional hearing: \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm or deny that we may or may not be doing anything. I can tell you, though, that anytime we get any kind of allegation in this world, in this realm, we investigate it aggressively.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJackson added: \u201cWe are not aware of any misconduct.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with The Post, the whistleblower dismissed the contention of critics that the complaint was uncorroborated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what investigations are for,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also denied his action was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows me knows I would not hesitate to do the same, as would most career IRS public servants, regardless of any political preference,\u201d he said. \u201cI take very seriously the duty of career civil servants to act with integrity and perform our duties impartially, even at the risk that someone will make a charge of bias.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower also castigated public officials who he said were making federal employees fearful of reporting wrongdoing. Trump has in recent days said he wants to know the identity of the whistleblower in the Ukraine case.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI steadfastly refuse to discuss the substance or details of the complaint, but I have some legitimate concerns about reckless statements being made about whistleblowers,\u201d he said. He said such statements \u201cattack the messenger when the focus should be on the facts that were presented. I am concerned also by the relative silence of people who should be repudiating these dangerous attacks in the strongest terms.\u201d\n\nNeal told Bloomberg he is consulting with legal counsel about whether to release the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe chairman has \u201cbeen almost entirely silent about the whole matter\u201d related to the whistleblower in private meetings of the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, according to one lawmaker who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nLegal experts and former government officials expressed alarm at the prospect of interference from political appointees with audits conducted by career IRS staff.\n\nThe tax returns of the president and vice president must be kept \u201cat all times\u201d in an orange folder and locked in a secure drawer or cabinet when the appointed IRS examiner is not with the documents, according to the IRS\u2019s manual.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that enforcement matters, including audits, be handled independently by the IRS,\u201d said Mark W. Everson, who served as IRS commissioner under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe mandatory audit program refers only to the audit of the president and vice president, said Mark E. Matthews, who was a deputy IRS commissioner under Bush and is now a partner at the firm Caplin & Drysdale. Those audits are viewed only by a small number of senior career IRS staff, Matthews said.\n\nThe president\u2019s tax returns have already produced divisions between political appointees in the Treasury Department and officials at the IRS. In May, The Post obtained a 10-page memo written by an attorney in the IRS Office of the Chief Counsel finding the administration had to turn over a president\u2019s returns if requested by Congress, unless the president invokes executive privilege. The Treasury Department has denied Congress\u2019s request for the returns, but the White House has not invoked executive privilege.\n\nIn April, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin also revealed department attorneys consulted with the White House general counsel\u2019s office about the potential release of Trump\u2019s tax returns before they were formally requested by House Democrats.\n\nMnuchin, who said he was not involved in those conversations, said the communication between Treasury and White House attorneys was \u201cinformational\u201d and that Treasury officials did not ask the White House for permission about whether to release the returns.\n\nThe whistleblower said that Treasury investigators, and presumably the inspector general, were aware of his complaint. \u201cI brought my concerns to my supervisors, who advised me to report the matter to the appropriate people with investigatory authority,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nDavid Barnes, a spokesman for the Treasury inspector general, declined to comment.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint was first disclosed by Neal as part of his lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking six years of the president\u2019s tax returns, which the administration refused to turn over despite a 1924 law explicitly giving Congress the authority to obtain them.\n\nNeal told a federal court this summer that House Democrats had received an unsolicited message from a federal employee \u201csetting forth credible allegations of \u2018evidence of possible misconduct\u2019 \u2014 specifically, potential \u2018inappropriate efforts to influence\u2019 the mandatory audit program.\u201d", "description": "The IRS official who filed the complaint told The Washington Post he is alarmed by recent attacks on government whistleblowers.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "Tom Hamburger", "Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money", "Politics In Washington", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cPWN132K71N7IpOhzBT0Qk1LOY8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2QFVBHPAQI6FEAIMHUUU7VCBU.jpg"}
