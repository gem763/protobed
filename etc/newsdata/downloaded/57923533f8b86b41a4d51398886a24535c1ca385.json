But the fate of the popular show remains uncertain following reports of a feud between Starz and cable provider Comcast.\n\nThe Lionsgate-owned Starz recently informed its viewers that Comcast intends to drop Starz channels from all of its packages and bundles. The two sides have failed to reach an agreement on new carriage terms following months of negotiations, according to Variety.\n\nTheir current agreement is set to end Dec. 31. Without a new agreement, shows including Power and Outlander would vanish from the screens of Comcast Xfinity subscribers.\n\nWhile Comcast is reportedly claiming that Starz\u2019s terms are unreasonable, 50 Cent is putting the blame squarely on Comcast CEO Roberts.\n\n\u201cThis is the guy fucking up (Power) over at @Comcast for no reason,\u201d the rapper posted on his Instagram account on Sunday. \u201cMother fucker look like he been pushed around his whole life. He need to chill out, go to a golf course or sit his ass down some where.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that 50 Cent \u2014 real name, Curtis Jackson \u2014 has lashed out at Comcast over Power.\n\nEarlier this month, the rapper tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m sick right now so I lose millions of viewers today because of Comcast\u2026 They are dropping Starz no more POWER, I\u2019m Dead.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sick right now so I lose millions of viewers today because of Comcast, They are dropping STARZ no more POWER, I\u2019m Dead. #lecheminduroi #bransoncognac pic.twitter.com/QVT3PyW0Mu \u2014 50cent (@50cent) October 19, 2019\n\nAs the head of Comcast, Roberts presides over a telecommunications and media empire that includes NBCUniversal and the European satellite TV provider Sky.\n\n50 Cent\u2019s feud with Comcast is reminiscent of his fight with AT&T four years ago, when the company threatened to pull Starz off of its U-Verse service.\n\nThe rapper called AT&T \u201cracist\u201d for dropping \u201curban friendly\u201d cable channels.\n\n\u201cChange your cable package from AT&T to anything else,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s 2015 and these people are still racist. They are dropping all channels that are considered urban friendly.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
