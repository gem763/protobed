And so what, according to that view of the world, if that includes the judges as part of the establishment standing in his way?\n\nBut there is a difference between being ruthless and reckless.\n\nAnd the scope and strength of this judgement cannot just be dismissed as some pesky judges sticking their noses in.\n\nRead more from Laura's blog here.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Mr Johnson said it was an \"unusual judgement\", adding: \"I don't think this was the right decision. The prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who basically want to stop this country from coming out of the EU and we have a Parliament that is unable to be prorogued and doesn't want to have an election. I think it is time we took things forward.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaker John Bercow says the Commons will sit on Wednesday\n\nThe PM said getting a deal was \"not made much easier with these sort of things in Parliament or the courts\", but insisted the UK would still leave on 31 October.\n\nPushed on whether he would attempt to suspend Parliament again, he said there was \"a good case for getting on with a Queen's Speech anyway\", and the Supreme Court had not \"remotely excluded\" the possibility.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ruling showed Mr Johnson's \"contempt for democracy\", adding: \"I invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position.\"\n\nMr Corbyn was due to close the Labour Party conference in Brighton with a speech on Wednesday, but has brought it forward to Tuesday afternoon so he can return to Parliament.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: \"I invite Boris Johnson to consider his position\"\n\nLawyers for the government had argued the decision to prorogue was one for Parliament, not the courts.\n\nBut the justices disagreed, unanimously deciding it was \"justiciable\", and there was \"no doubt that the courts have jurisdiction to decide upon the existence and limits of a prerogative power\".\n\nThe court also criticised the length of the suspension, with Lady Hale saying it was \"impossible for us to conclude, on the evidence which has been put before us, that there was any reason - let alone a good reason - to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for five weeks\".\n\nThe damage is done\n\nWow! This is legal, constitutional and political dynamite.\n\nIt is worth just taking a breath and considering that a prime minister of the United Kingdom has been found by the highest court in the land to have acted unlawfully in shutting down the sovereign body in our constitution, Parliament, at a time of national crisis.\n\nThe court may have fallen short of saying Boris Johnson had an improper motive of stymieing or frustrating parliamentary scrutiny, but the damage is done, he has been found to have acted unlawfully and stopped Parliament from doing its job without any legal justification.\n\nAnd the court has quashed both his advice to the Queen and the Order in Council which officially suspended parliament.\n\nThat means Parliament was never prorogued and so we assume that MPs are free to re-enter the Commons.\n\nThis is the most dramatic example yet of independent judges, through the mechanism of judicial review, stopping the government in its tracks because what it has done is unlawful.\n\nBe you ever so mighty, the law is above you - even if you are the prime minister.\n\nUnprecedented, extraordinary, ground breaking - it is difficult to overestimate the constitutional and political significance of today's ruling.\n\nWhat was the court considering?\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Gina Miller led campaigners against the suspension of Parliament\n\nThe ruling was made after a three-day hearing at the Supreme Court last week which dealt with two appeals - one from campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, the second from the government.\n\nMrs Miller was appealing against the English High Court's decision that the prorogation was \"purely political\" and not a matter for the courts.\n\nThe government was appealing against the ruling by Scotland's Court of Session that the prorogation was \"unlawful\" and had been used to \"stymie\" Parliament.\n\nThe court ruled in favour of Mrs Miller's appeal and against the government's.\n\nHow did those involved in the case react?\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The SNP's Joanna Cherry said the PM's position was \"untenable\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Mrs Miller said the ruling \"speaks volumes\".\n\n\"This prime minister must open the doors of Parliament tomorrow. MPs must get back and be brave and bold in holding this unscrupulous government to account,\" she added.\n\nThe SNP's Joanna Cherry, who led the Scottish case, called for Mr Johnson to resign as a result of the ruling.\n\n\"The highest court in the United Kingdom has unanimously found that his advice to prorogue this Parliament, his advice given to Her Majesty the Queen, was unlawful,\" she said.\n\n\"His position is untenable and he should have the guts, for once, to do the decent thing and resign.\"\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sir John Major - one of the sponsors of the prorogation appeal - said it gave him \"no pleasure to be pitted against a government and prime minister of my own party\".\n\n\"No prime minister must ever treat the monarch or Parliament in this way again.\"\n\nWhat about other politicians?\n\nScotland's First Minister, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, said the ruling was the most significant constitutional judgement in her lifetime, and it would be \"unthinkable\" for Mr Johnson to remain in office.\n\nWales' First Minister, Labour's Mark Drakeford, said the court's decision had been a \"victory for the rule of law\" and the PM had \"tried to play fast and loose with our constitution\".\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, said the ruling must be respected, while Sinn Fein's vice president, Michelle O'Neill, said Mr Johnson should resign.\n\nOther figures have taken to Twitter to support the court's decision, including former Tory minister Amber Rudd, who resigned her post - and the party whip - over the government's approach to Brexit.\n\nThe leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, said the suspension was the \"worst political decision ever\" and called for Mr Johnson's chief advisor to resign.\n\nFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has been an outspoken critic of the suspension, said he was \"not surprised\" by the judgement because of the \"gross misbehaviour by the prime minister\".\n\nHe told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was \"delighted\" the Supreme Court had \"stopped this unconstitutional act in its tracks\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dominic Grieve said it was \"perfectly obvious that the reason for suspending Parliament was bogus\"\n\nBut Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the court's decision was \"the worst possible outcome for our democracy\" and \"an absolute disgrace\".\n\nHe told the same programme: \"What we've got is a Parliament that's completely out of step with sentiment of the country.\"\n\nFellow Tory MP and chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group Steve Baker said the ruling was an \"earthquake moment\".\n\nHe described the Commons as a \"rotten Parliament\" facing a \"crisis\", and called for a general election so a government with a majority could move forward.\n\nWhat happened before Parliament was suspended?\n\nProrogation is a power that rests with the Queen, carried out by her on the advice of the prime minister.\n\nAnd at the end of August - shortly before MPs returned from their summer recess - Mr Johnson called Her Majesty to advise she suspend Parliament between 9 September until 14 October.\n\nMPs had been expecting to be in recess for some of these weeks for their party conferences.\n\nBut unlike prorogation, a recess must be agreed by a vote, and a number of MPs said they would have voted against it to ensure they could scrutinise Mr Johnson's Brexit plans.\n\nThe decision to prorogue prompted an uproar from the Commons, especially from MPs who had planned to take control of Parliament to force through a law to block a no-deal Brexit after Mr Johnson said the UK would leave the EU with or without a deal on the Halloween deadline.\n\nDespite only sitting for a week, they did manage to pass that law ahead of prorogation and it received royal assent on 9 September.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the Supreme Court's decision?\n\nUse this form to ask your question:", "description": "Boris Johnson says he will \"respect the verdict\", but \"strongly disagrees\" with the judges' decision.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p5l89.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
