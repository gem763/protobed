Leaders of the Houthis, the Yemeni rebels whom Saudi Arabia is trying to dislodge from the country\u2019s capital, claimed they sent a squad of drones hundreds of miles into the heart of Saudi Arabia to carry out coordinated attacks on two of the country\u2019s vital energy sites. If true, the attacks marked the most effective and far-reaching drone strikes carried out by outgunned Houthi forces in neighboring Yemen. But officials around the globe investigating the attack questioned the Houthi claims and suggested the strike may have come from Iraq or Iran, to the north, rather than Yemen, to the south. Iran supports a host of Shiite militias in Iraq. The Saudi Interior Ministry said Saturday that the facilities were hit by a drone attack, an account confirmed by people familiar with the strikes. But Persian Gulf officials said experts were examining the possibility that the attackers used cruise missiles, either instead of or along with drones. A strike on Saudi facilities from Iraq isn\u2019t without recent precedent. Earlier this summer, U.S. officials concluded that a May 14 drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s pipeline was launched from Iraq, not Yemen. And the use of cruise missiles rather than drones would suggest an escalation in the conflict beyond drones. In recent months, Houthi forces have used a new type of cruise missile to hit Saudi Arabia at least three times, according to people familiar with the investigation.\n\nSupply Risk", "description": "Despite growing pressure from hawks to attack Iran, huge questions .09/16/2019 19:10:09PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/131/fb46bd94-c58a-4c4e-a6aa-63ba168ac115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
