Bernard Sanders four years ago, but in this presidential election race he is a member of the Yang Gang \u2014 the band of enthusiastic supporters of Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur whom many see as the natural evolution of Mr. Sanders\u2018 2015 message.\n\nThey are fighting it out on the battlefield of ideas, but Mr. Yang also has a bit of the Sanders magic in his grassroots appeal, said Mr. Marchand, pointing to the crowds showing up at events looking for someone who can challenge the Democratic Party establishment.\n\n\u201cThere is an influx of people who are clearly outside the traditional system but are absolutely willing to go through a wall for an exciting candidate,\u201d Mr. Marchand said. \u201cThat is what you saw with Sen. Sanders in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe scrapping between the Yang Gang and Bernie Bros is one of the more fascinating fights in the 2020 field, with Mr. Yang, the newcomer, making a serious play for liberal and disenchanted voters who backed the maverick senator the last time.\n\nThat includes Mr. Yang himself.\n\n\u201cI was a Bernie supporter in 2016,\u201d Mr. Yang joked at a recent campaign stop. \u201cBut now I\u2019m here, and I am younger, fresher, more modern, more Asian, more tech-savvy than Bernie.\n\n\u201cI am like the Bernie of 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nThe elder, whiter Mr. Sanders pushed back last week by saying Mr. Yang\u2019s chief policy plan, a government-guaranteed universal basic income, isn\u2019t the panacea Mr. Yang and his followers believe.\n\nMr. Sanders counters the guaranteed government payout with his own expansive promises, including a federal jobs guarantee and, of course, his signature \u201cMedicare for All\u201d universal health care plan.\n\nSelf-professed 2016 Sanders backers flooded room chats and messaging boards to testify to their conversion to Yangism.\n\n\u201cAs an ex-Bernie supporter, I love both Bernie and Yang but I also believe Yang is the better of the two,\u201d Reddit user \u201cJustInvoke\u201d posted.\n\n\u201cStevenwernercs\u201d chimed in that he didn\u2019t understand the acrimony between the Yang Gang and Bernie Bros, saying the senator from Vermont was \u201cour best hope, until we got \u2026 the latest software update.\n\n\u201cNo need to hate on the guy and the people that haven\u2019t heard about Yang and still follow Bernie.\u201d they said. \u201cWe just need to respectfully inform them about Yang and that we can upgrade.\u201d\n\nOthers ventured that Mr. Yang is \u201cbetter at the internet than Bernie,\u201d \u201cDefinitely a bigger gamer than Bernie\u201d and \u201cProbably better in math too.\u201d They said he was \u201cless angry,\u201d \u201cmore Asian\u201d and \u201cfresher.\u201d\n\nSo far, Mr. Sanders\u2018 bigger threat for voters on the left appears to be Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Mr. Yang received only 3% support in a recent Suffolk University national poll.\n\nDavid Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, however, said Mr. Yang has room to grow, and pointed to softer Sanders supporters as fertile ground.\n\n\u201cIf Yang were looking for a pool of voters among the front-runners to target, Sanders voters would be the prime target,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Yang camp is keeping tabs.\n\n\u201cCertainly one the of the most preeminent groups in the base of voters who we think are going to be very attracted to Andrew\u2019s message are people who supported Sen. Sanders in 2016 and for a variety of reasons are uncommitted to him at this point,\u201d said Mr. Marchand, a former New Hampshire gubernatorial candidate who is serving as a top adviser to Mr. Yang in the state.\n\nMr. Yang is running under the slogan \u201cMake America Think Harder,\u201d or MATH, and enveloping his plan in a post-partisan message of \u201cNot left, not right, forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians and conservatives as well as Democrats and progressives,\u201d he said in the Democrats\u2019 second debate.\n\nThe 44-year-old is polling well enough, and raking in contributions successfully enough, to qualify for the third debate next week in Houston. That means he already has outlasted higher-profile politicians such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the race, and he is ahead of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who didn\u2019t make the debate stage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly at that level that is approaching a springboard,\u201d Mr. Paleologos said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to the springboard unless you are generating some kind of heat, some kind of internal momentum. He is at the point that if he makes a credible showing in the debate he is going to be looked at more serious.\u201d\n\nLike Mr. Sanders\u2018 demand for a Medicare for All health care plan in 2016, Mr. Yang is likely to go as far as his own \u201cbig idea\u201d will carry him.\n\nThat idea is his \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d a plan for the government to dole out $1,000 per month to every single citizen as guaranteed income. He says it\u2019s a response to the automation that has eliminated millions of retail and manufacturing jobs and the rise of tech giants such as Amazon that have hollowed out local businesses while paying nothing in net taxes.\n\nMr. Sanders, asked about Mr. Yang\u2019s plan last week, told The Hill that he preferred a federal job guarantee instead.\n\nMr. Yang suggested it was a head-scratching response.\n\n\u201cBernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day,\u201d he said in a Twitter post. \u201cHe also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government, which isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe Yang message has hit home with Kati Bainter, an independent from Ankeny, Iowa, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 after backing Barack Obama twice.\n\nShe sees Mr. Yang as a solutions-oriented political outsider.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Yang Gang 2020,\u201d Ms. Bainter said after listening to Mr. Yang at the Iowa State Fair. \u201cI think our country is very broken now politically and it is a time for our country to come together and unite, and I think he can do that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
