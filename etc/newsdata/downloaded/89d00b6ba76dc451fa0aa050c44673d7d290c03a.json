The house, Taliesin, which was located in Spring Green, Wisconsin, is seen in the file photo above\n\nIts hardcover version was published by Knopf.\n\nWright died in 1959 at the age of 91. His illustrious career included 1,100 designs and more than 500 projects.\n\nEight of his buildings were added to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage list as cultural sites - perhaps the most famous among them the Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nWright is the subject of a new biography by author Paul Hendrickson titled Plagued By Fire: The Dreams and Furies of Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nMore than a third of Wright\u2019s 409 extant structures are included on the National Register of Historic Places or are in a National Historic District, according to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation.\n\nBut alongside his career accomplishments, Wright was a notorious liar - \u2018a fantastic fabricator,\u2019 in the words of his biographer, Hendrickson.\n\nThose who knew Wright from the world of architecture were turned off by his \u2018vulgar narcissism and arrogance and bombast and egocentrism and reckless financial - not to say moral - ways,\u2019 according to an excerpt of the book published by The Washington Post.\n\nThe tragedy of 1914 took place five years after he left his wife, Kitty Tobin, and their six children for Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who herself was married to one of Wright\u2019s clients.\n\nThe affair and the collapse of his marriage were front-page news stories for the press.\n\nIn fact, Wright was considered at the time to be one of America\u2019s most scandalous celebrities, having had numerous affairs that were reported on in the press, according to the New York Post.\n\nHis tumultuous personal life began to play out in public in 1903, when he was a 36-year-old architect living in a Chicago suburb.\n\nHaving several big projects to his name, Wright had settled down with wife Catherine, who was known by her nickname \u2018Kitty.\u2019\n\nThe couple had just given birth to their youngest child, Robert, when another couple from the same suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, stopped by.\n\nWright died in 1959 at the age of 91. His illustrious career included 1,100 designs and more than 500 projects. Eight of his buildings were added to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage list as cultural sites - perhaps the most famous among them the Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue in New York City\n\nEdwin and Mamah Cheney paid a visit to Wright\u2019s studio and asked him to design a home for them.\n\nFrom that point on, it was said that Mamah Cheney took an active interest in Wright\u2019s plans for the house.\n\nThe relationship between the two appeared to get stronger - so much so that they both left their families.\n\nIn September 1909, Mamah Cheney joined Wright as they sailed to Germany, where a reporter for the Chicago Tribune spotted the couple at a hotel in Berlin.\n\nDespite the affair being front page news, Wright was determined to leave his marriage.\n\nHe built a home in the woods of his native Wisconsin, where Mamah, who by this time had dissolved her marriage to Edwin Cheney, moved in in 1911.\n\nOn the weekend of August 15, 1914, Mamah\u2019s two children, John and Martha, paid a visit to see their mother in her home in Taliesin.\n\nWright\u2019s mistress and her two children were eating lunch on the patio while six workmen were in a separate dining room.\n\nThey were all being served by Julian Carlton, who came from a poor black family in Alabama.\n\nAfter having moved to Chicago, he got a job at Taliesin.\n\nAlongside his career accomplishments, Wright was a notorious liar - \u2018a fantastic fabricator,\u2019 in the words of his biographer, Hendrickson. Wright is seen above in 1947\n\nThough he was on the job for six month, he gave notice that he was about to quit.\n\nHis wife, who was a cook on the premises, would comment that he\u2019d been acting paranoid, though the exact reason is unknown.\n\nAfter serving food to everyone on the patio, Carlton retrieved a hand ax and went back to the patio, where he dug the blade into Mamah\u2019s skull.\n\nCarlton slaughtered both of her children, doused their bodies in gasoline, and set them on fire.\n\nIt is believed he set the door to the workers\u2019 dining room on fire in hopes of killing them.\n\nCarlton was arrested by police, though not before he tried to kill himself by swallowing hydrochloric acid.\n\nHe would die months later while in police custody, having never revealed why he carried out the mass slaughter.\n\nWright was so crushed about what happened that he mourned that night by playing Bach on the piano of his sister\u2019s home nearby while shedding tears.\n\nIn reporting on the tragedy, a number of newspaper stories suggested that the incident was punishment for the couple's abandonment of their families.\n\nHe decided to rebuild Taliesin from the ashes, but the home was once again hit by a fire in 1925.", "description": "Frank Lloyd Wright's (left) relationship with Mamah Borthwick Cheney (right) is explored in a new biography, Plagued by Fire: The Dreams and Furies of Frank Lloyd Wright, which is on sale.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19371432-0-image-a-48_1570395046846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
