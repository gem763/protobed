They were winning ever greater support but, somehow, still appearing to lose the battle.\n\nRecord-breaking crowds had turned up for the Put It To The People rally in the capital in March. Increasing numbers of politicians and experts \u2013 and Gary Lineker \u2013 were throwing their weight behind the idea. An online poll asking for Article 50 to be revoked had just topped 4 million signatures.\n\nYet somehow, despite all this \u2013 or perhaps because of it \u2013 this mass movement was being characterised, with some success, as representing the views of only a minor metropolitan elite.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It did not understand small towns. It did not understand the working class.\n\n\u201cHave these people ever even been in a Wetherspoon\u2019s?\u201d Martin Daubney, now a Brexit Party MEP, asked me in Wolverhampton in April. Raise the idea of a second vote in there, he added, \u201cand see how it goes down\u201d.\n\nBy May, on the back of such claims, his group had won 29 out of 71 seats at the European Parliament elections \u2013 including almost half of those available in England outside of London.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It wasn\u2019t true then and it isn\u2019t true now. So we realised we needed a platform to challenge that myth.\u201d\n\nAnd now, as campaigners prepare for what could become one of the biggest marches ever held in the capital on Saturday, it is perhaps safe to say that challenge has been met and that myth busted.\n\nMore than 175 coaches will make their way to London from towns and cities across the UK, full of people asking to be asked again. Underground users have been told to expect large crowds around St Pancras, King\u2019s Cross and Euston \u2013 the stations that connect London to the north and Midlands.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In supposed Leave-strongholds, such as Sunderland, Derby and Newport, hundreds turned out. In Brighton, 5,000 supporters attended a beach-front Let us Be Heard rally. In Leeds, campaigners cheered as footballing legend Peter Reid dispensed with niceties: \u201cshambollocks\u201d, he said when asked to describe the last three years in a single word.\n\n\u201cThere was a feeling that yes, big London marches are massively important in helping create real political pressure but we also had to be out in the regions showing what we already knew: that there was mass support for a second vote \u2013 everywhere,\u201d says Mr Keith. \u201cThis idea that Sunderland, for instance, had become a no-go area if you wanted a second vote \u2013 it\u2019s just a lie. Sunderland is going to be one of the cities hit hardest by Brexit and there is huge hunger there for a chance to have another say.\u201d\n\nAmong the activists at the Stadium of Light that Sunday afternoon was Louise Brown, a committee member with North East for Europe. \u201cA lot of us will stand on stalls in town centres and it\u2019s hard work because not everyone agrees with what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d she told me as the day\u2019s audience filed past, all EU flags and Bollocks to Brexit stickers. \u201cBut when you come to an event like this, it drives home how devastating leaving the EU will be and how important what we\u2019re doing is.\u201d\n\nThe devastation spoken about differed from region to region and depended on what calamitous no deal revelation had been brought into the open that particular week but concerns generally riffed on similar themes: economic deprivation, job losses, an NHS vulnerable to predatory privatisation, a country less able to protect itself against terrorism, climate change and cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThe scale of just how bad a no deal would be was emerging constantly over the summer,\u201d says Mr Keith. \u201cAnd I think that naturally brought more people to us. What we noticed anecdotally was that we were getting more and more Leave voters supporting us because there was a growing realisation that the Brexit we were told would happen in 2016 never really existed.\u201d\n\nAt each event, an ever-rotating list of political speakers \u2013 Tories, Labour, Anna Soubry \u2013 were joined by comedians, sports stars and business people. The Derby rally may be the only place Michael Heseltine and Margaret Beckett have ever shared a stage. Almost certainly, these events showed footage of the one time you\u2019ll ever hear erstwhile Coronation Street star Denise Welch ponder international import and export tariffs. \u201cWhere are all these trade deals?\u201d she wondered in a video message.\n\nIn Edinburgh, Alistair Campbell played Ode To Joy on the bagpipes, while in Leeds John Barnes compared Brexit to a bad VAR decision. Let\u2019s replay it, he suggested, and get it right.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt this is one of the most varied political campaigns in recent decades,\u201d says Richard Brooks, the 27-year-old co-founder of For our Future\u2019s Sake, ostensibly the movement\u2019s youth wing. \u201cThe people who come can\u2019t be pigeon-holed \u2013 they\u2019re young, old, middle class, working class. It goes across so many spectrums. We\u2019ve had events where there\u2019s been a 20-something Northern Irish apprentice on stage with someone who\u2019s been a member of the Tory party for decades. We\u2019re uniting people constantly.\u201d\n\nCritics would say, of course, that these are still relatively small numbers.\n\nA ComRes poll published on Wednesday showed that, overwhelmingly, people wanted to honour the results of the original referendum. Fifty-four per cent of those questioned said the UK should leave the EU. Only 32 per cent said it should not. All regions had a Leave majority \u2013 save for London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In a similar survey carried out by BMG between July and October, fewer than one in five people said they wanted another referendum.\n\nAnd, yet, as the political landscape has changed on an almost daily basis \u2013 the first northern rally was held way back in the era when Theresa May was still prime minister; before Yellowhammer was revealed; when the prorogation of parliament was not yet a twinkle in Dominic Cummings\u2019 eye \u2013 and politics has mutated, something remarkable has happened. Support for a People\u2019s Vote \u2013 a consistent, accessible plan to move things forward \u2013 has kept gaining momentum.\n\nHilary Benn \u2013 who, whatever happens next, may come to be considered one of his generation\u2019s few politicians of stature \u2013 came on board, despite previous reservations. Every opposition party, bar one, has now said they favour a second vote. Labour\u2019s position may still remain ambiguous under Jeremy Corbyn, but, if rumours are to be believed, it won\u2019t stay that way if chancellor John McDonnell gets his way.\n\nAnd now, on Saturday: a new London march, which organisers say could attract up to 1.5 million people from all corners of the UK.\n\n\u201cOnly an idiot would dismiss that as anything other than a mass movement,\u201d adds Mr Keith. \u201cI compare this to a journey where it\u2019s not just the landscape that\u2019s constantly changing but even the road you\u2019re driving on keeps moving about.\n\n\u201cBut if you have your destination in mind \u2013 a final vote \u2013 it\u2019s just a case of keeping your sights steady, holding your nerve and doing your best to get there. I believe we\u2019re closer now than we ever have been. The country needs it. One way or another, it\u2019s the only possible way out of this mess.\u201d", "description": "It was in spring, shortly after an estimated one million people marched through London demanding a second Brexit referendum, that leaders of the People\u2019s Vote campaign became aware of a troubling paradox.
