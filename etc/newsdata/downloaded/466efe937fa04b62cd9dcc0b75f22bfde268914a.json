Riders tend to think they\u2019re making the right move by hopping on a scooter that\u2019s electric and thus carbon-free. But what they don\u2019t see are all of the emissions that are produced by the manufacturing, transportation, maintenance, and upkeep of dockless scooters.\n\n\u201cif you take a step back, you can see all the other things that are a bit hidden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you only think about the segment of the life cycle you can see, which would be standing on the scooter where there\u2019s no tailpipe, it\u2019s easy to make that assumption,\u201d said Jeremiah Johnson, corresponding author of the study and an associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State. \u201cBut if you take a step back, you can see all the other things that are a bit hidden in the process.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his team \u201ctook a step back\u201d by conducting what\u2019s called a \u201clife cycle analysis\u201d of the dockless scooter industry. That meant looking at all of the emissions associated with each aspect of a scooter\u2019s life cycle: the production of the materials, like the lithium-ion battery and aluminum parts; the manufacturing process; shipping the scooter from its country of origin (mainly China) to its city of use; and collecting, charging, and redistributing scooters as part of the dockless service.\n\nThe study\u2019s conclusions were equal parts obvious and surprising. Driving a car was the least environmentally friendly option, but using the bus \u2014 especially a diesel-powered one along a highly trafficked route \u2014 was a better option than riding an e-scooter. Walking and riding a bike, or even an e-bike, were also vastly superior to using an e-scooter.\n\nOverall, the average greenhouse gas emissions per scooter mile traveled is just over 200 grams of CO2. By comparison, the life cycle emissions for the average automobile is just over 400 grams of CO2. So riding a scooter is a clear winner over taking a car.\n\nthe average greenhouse gas emissions per scooter mile traveled is just over 200 grams of CO2\n\nThe problem is that only one-third of scooter trips are replacing car trips. The NC State team conducted a survey of riders to find out how people were using scooters and what kinds of trips they were displacing by choosing to ride an electric two-wheeler. Their findings \u2014 which are backed up by other surveys of scooter riders \u2014 were that 49 percent of riders would have biked or walked, 34 percent would have used a car, 11 percent would have taken a bus, and 7 percent wouldn\u2019t have taken the trip at all.\n\nEven though about 63 percent of electricity in the US is generated from fossil fuels, the environmental impact of the electricity used to charge each scooter is fairly small \u2014 around 5 percent of the overall impact, the researchers found. The main culprits were the materials used to build each scooter, mostly the aluminum, and the carbon produced by the vehicles used by independent contractors to gather up and recharge the scooters every night.\n\nThere are some simple solutions to these problems that the scooter companies are already trying to tackle. The first is to cut down on all of the driving done by freelancers who collect scooters at night for charging. Lime is trying to do this by introducing a new feature that allows its \u201cjuicers\u201d to reserve a scooter ahead of time, thus reducing the amount of unnecessary driving that takes place when juicers are out searching for scooters to collect.\n\n\u201cIf you can make these things last two years, it would have a very large impact.\u201d\n\nAnother way to reduce the environmental impact would be to build a better scooter that lasts longer than the models that were deployed in the early days of the scooter boom.\n\n\u201cIf the scooter companies are able to extend the life of their scooters without doubling the impacts of materials and manufacturing, that would reduce the per-mile burden,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf you can make these things last two years, it would have a very large impact.\u201d\n\nThe scooter companies are doing this, too. Bird recently unveiled its latest next-generation scooter with a longer-lasting battery and more durable parts. Lime has also rolled out newer models that it claims improve the unit economics of the scooter business.\n\nBut ultimately, the claim that scooter riding is the greenest option available is just not true. And the scooter companies appear aware of that, at least on the surface. Last year, Lime said that in order to make its entire fleet of electric bikes and scooters completely \u201ccarbon free,\u201d the San Francisco-based company will begin to purchase renewable energy credits from new and existing projects.\n\nThis is a fine idea (although there is some skepticism about the effectiveness of carbon offsets), but it doesn\u2019t address the main problem with the dockless scooter industry\u2019s business model: the use of freelancers to collect and charge a fleet of electric scooters. Lime says it hopes to eventually account for those emissions in its carbon-neutral program, but it hasn\u2019t yet.", "description": "Electric scooter companies like to tout their green credentials, frequently reminding riders that every two-wheeled trip they take can help reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change \u2014 but the truth is much more complicated.", "authors": ["Andrew J.
