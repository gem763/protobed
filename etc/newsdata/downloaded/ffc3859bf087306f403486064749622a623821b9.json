The announcement was made on Friday by the official receiver, who has been managing British Steel since its collapse in May.\n\nUnlike the steelmaker, TSP Projects is solvent. The sale has no impact on the ongoing process of selling the remainder of British Steel to an affiliate of Turkey\u2019s military pension fund Oyak, the official receiver said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAtaer Holdings, Oyak\u2019s investment arm, has been picked as the preferred buyer for British Steel and it plans to complete the purchase by the end of the year, pending due diligence checks.\n\nTSP Projects works in the rail, renewable energy, security and aviation sectors and its clients include the Metropolitan Police, Network Rail and First Great Western.\n\nSystra Ltd is a transport consulting and engineering firm. It has worked on projects ranging from London\u2019s congestion charge and Crossrail to schemes that facilitate walking and cycling.\n\nPascal Mercier, the firm\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis acquisition is a game changer for our UK and Ireland business, placing us among the leading UK consulting engineering firms.\n\n\u201cThis is a good fit between two like-minded companies with a shared commitment to excellence, safety and innovation.\u201d\n\nOyak has been less complimentary about the rest of British Steel. Toker Ozcan, who heads the mining metallurgy group at Oyak, told the Financial Times earlier this month that productivity at the steelmaker\u2019s main plant in Scunthorpe is \u201cvery low\u201d compared with other European steel producers.\n\n\u201cWe will take productivity to where it needs to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe plans could result in several hundred job cuts, the newspaper reported.\n\nBritish Steel employs around 5,000 people, most of them in the UK. More than 3,000 work at the Scunthorpe plant.", "description": "A British Steel subsidiary has been bought by a French-owned company, preserving 400 jobs in York.
