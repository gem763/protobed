It\u2019s our bread and butter. I can\u2019t think of a disease in childhood cancer that doesn\u2019t use vincristine,\u201d Unguru added.\n\nHe told the newspaper that shortages of the drug could affect kids across the country and force doctors to make difficult decisions.\n\n\u201cThere is no substitution for vincristine that can be recommended,\u201d Unguru said. \u201cYou either have to skip a dose or give a lower dose \u2014 or beg, borrow or plead.\u201d\n\nThe drug used to be supplied by two companies, Pfizer and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, until Teva \"made a business decision\" to discontinue it in July, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pfizer is now the only supplier and has experienced some manufacturing difficulties, according to The Times. Vincristine is used to manage the most common childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and to treat Wilms tumor, a rare kidney cancer. The Children's Oncology Group, an organization of researchers, is recommending changing clinical trial treatment procedures for vincristine, considering using half-doses, skipping doses or not using the medicine in some cases, the Times reported.\n\n\u201cPfizer has experienced a delay, and we are working closely with them and exploring all options to make sure this critical cancer drug is available for the patients who need it,\u201d the FDA told the Times in a statement.", "description": "Doctors are warning that shortages of a drug used to treat childhood cancer may force them to start rationing the medicine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tributetothetroops_doctors_092419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
