(AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) as its antitrust probe of Big Tech widens.\n\nThe committees\u2019 letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions.\n\nApple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation of the company.\n\nApple has faced criticism that its policies and algorithms in its App Store support its own products and stifle third-party applications.\n\nThe letters come days after the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.\n\nApple and Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon did not immediately comment. Google referred to a blog post issued this week that said its services \u201ccreate choice for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe committee requested information from the companies\u2019 executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.\n\nIt asked Apple for information on the company\u2019s decision to remove some parental control apps from its App Store and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults, among other concerns about its App Store.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating \u201cwhether and how\u201d large tech companies in \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d are engaging in anticompetitive behaviour, an apparent reference to the same companies named by the House panel on Friday.", "description": "A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Friday demanded internal emails, detailed financial information and other company records from Amazon.com Inc. , Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , and Alphabet Inc's Google as its antitrust probe of Big Tech widens.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429504972&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C17S", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
