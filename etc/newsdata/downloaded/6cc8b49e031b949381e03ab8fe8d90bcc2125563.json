They don\u2019t need to be reminded of the importance of sleep, nutrition and rehydration by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association welfare director.\n\n\u201cBut when I ask how many look after yourselves emotionally, they don\u2019t answer me because they don\u2019t think about the emotional side,\u201d Bennett said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to make them aware the emotional side of the game is as important as the physical side. They both go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nBennett\u2019s work is busier than ever before, with a surge in members seeking support for mental health issues.\n\nData provided to the AP shows 544 PFA members _ mostly men _ accessed therapy from January to September _ up from the 438 who used the union\u2019s counselling services throughout 2018. It represents an increase of almost 25% on last year\u2019s total with three months of the year remaining.\n\n\u201cThe main reason they come forward is stress, depression and anxiety but we are aware that is a symptom of something,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cSo we try to find out what is causing it. It could be long-term injury. It could be bereavement in the family. It could be a marriage or partnership break up. It could be a gambling issue which is prevalent at the moment.\u201d\n\nBennett has a better insight than most in the English game. He played across the professional leagues, including for Charlton and Wimbledon in the topflight in the 1980s and 1990s. After training as a psychotherapist and counsellor, Bennett joined the PFA and he has been welfare director for eight years.\n\nThe PFA\u2019s mental health services this year have been used by 553 men _250 active players _ and 26 from the women\u2019s game. Eleven people from families of PFA members also sought support.\n\nOnly 160 PFA members accessed counselling services from the union in 2016. But any stigma around seeking help for mental health problems has been eased in the national sport by leading players, including Tottenham defender Danny Rose, talking about fighting depression. The English Football Association campaign has also launched a \u201cHeads Up\u201d campaign fronted by Prince William.\n\n\u201cWe want to make them aware you don\u2019t need to suffer in silence or be alone,\u201d Bennett said from the PFA\u2019s annual mental health conference at the St. George\u2019s Park training base for England national teams.\n\nThe struggles are starting even earlier for players chasing professional contracts.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed is the tension,\u201d former Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker, who now manages the club\u2019s academy, told the AP. \u201cI was injured for a year when I was 16 and to come back into academy football at the same club (Hannover) was easy at that time.\n\n\u201cWhen you are injured now for a year you are almost gone because your chance was there and you didn\u2019t probably take it. So the judgment and assessment will be much earlier than back in the day.\u201d\n\nMertesacker now has to prepare his academy players for not making it about their club.\n\n\u201cPeople write you off, but you never should never settle,\u201d Mertesacker said. \u201cThere\u2019s huge expectation for yourself, from your parents around you. \u2026 So we need to make sure we create an environment where they feel safe with a good football program as well using football as a vehicle to teach them a lot of other stuff which can be helpful to life.\u201d\n\nThe PFA has tracked how being rejected by clubs so early can see players doubt their worth and identity.\n\n\u201cThe demands from the family, the demand from the club and more so the demand they put on themselves can be so intense,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt can be unbearable and they think they can\u2019t cope.\u201d\n\nSocial media just adds to the toll. There is the abuse _ too often racist _ that players can receive on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Then there are the pressures to show a perfect life and body.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing self-image and eating disorder issues are on the rise, particularly in the younger population,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nA weight on the shoulders of players at third-tier clubs Bolton and Bury in recent months was the future of their clubs being under threat. While Bolton was eventually rescued by a takeover, Bury was expelled from League One in August, leaving players out of work. The PFA stepped in to help them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a public perception that all footballers earn a hundred grand a week or even more than that and why should they have any financial issues,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey do and they can still have bereavements, issues in families and injuries that can impact them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dropping in on football clubs across England to speak to players, Michael Bennett poses a question he already know the answers to.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/england_soccer_mental_health_07606_c0-104-2486-1553_s1770x1032.jpg?1c2e57a690227851849e8ef21237d72a33924ab4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
