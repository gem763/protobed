The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.\n\nLam later told a news conference that she had held \u201cclosed door\u201d meetings with some members of the protest movement and when the unrest ended she would hold more to address the political situation.\n\nRESIGNATION CALLS\n\nPro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan said Lam should resign for failing to address the protesters\u2019 five core demands.\n\n\u201cBoth her hands are soaked with blood. We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits,\u201d an emotional Chan said at a news conference. Lam has rejected calls to step down.\n\nIn her news conference, the Beijing-backed Lam rejected two of the protesters\u2019 five demands - amnesty for those charged and universal suffrage - saying the first was illegal and the second beyond the chief executive\u2019s power.\n\nEven the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance party was unhappy with Lam\u2019s speech, saying it lack concrete measures to get Hong Kong back to normal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conservative, procrastinating blueprint with little new ideas. Apart from calling for people to abide by (Hong Kong\u2019s) core values, we cannot see any concrete measures,\u201d said the party\u2019s chairwoman Starry Lee.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attends a news conference after her policy address for 2019, in Hong Kong, China, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nHong Kong\u2019s unrest was ignited by a China extradition bill, which would have seen residents sent to Communist Party-controlled mainland courts for trial. Lam has said the bill is withdrawn, but the suspension of the legislature on Tuesday meant it could not be formally withdrawn.\n\nAuthorities have arrested more than 2,300 people since June when the unrest grew, scores of them teenagers, some as young as 12 and the oldest 83. Two people have been shot and wounded and thousands injured.\n\nA Norwegian lawmaker, Guri Melby, tweeted that she had nominated the Hong Kong people for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for their stand for freedom of speech and democracy.\n\nHOUSING CRISIS\n\nHong Kong\u2019s boasts some of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate and the inability of many young people to get a place of their own has fuelled protests.\n\nLam\u2019s housing policy is one of the boldest in recent years, to take back large tracts of land held by a handful of powerful developers and create public housing.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to create home ownership opportunities for people of different income groups such that they will happily make Hong Kong their home,\u201d Lam said.\n\nLam said about 700 hectares of land in the New Territories would be brought back into public use under what is known as a land resumption ordinance. More than half of the land would be taken back in the next few years, with a further 450 hectares earmarked for \u201cresumption\u201d.\n\nLam faces a complex task in delivering her housing policy, which will take years to see any new housing created. No leader has take back land from private developers since the handover.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nPro-establishment lawmaker Abraham Shek, who represents the real estate sector, rejected the policy on Tuesday. \u201cIt is not for the government to meddle with the market forces,\u201d he said.\n\nMajor developers, including Henderson Land (0012.HK), New World Development (0017.HK) and Sun Hung Kai Properties (0016.HK), are sitting on \u201cno less than 1,000 hectares\u201d of agricultural land, according to government estimates.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had to abandon her policy speech in the legislature on Wednesday because of jeering lawmakers but later offered no direct olive branch to protesters, hoping instead to ease resentment by building public housing.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441444413&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0N9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
