Multiple launch rocket systems were stationed at Suruc, some 60 km (40 miles) to the west, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani, he said.\n\nThree vehicles carrying Syrian rebels drove on Turkey\u2019s side of the border area in Akcakale, a Reuters witness aid. A man in one vehicle waved a rebel flag. Others made victory signs.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Turkey's views on northeastern Syria - here)\n\nRUSSIA CALLS FOR DIALOGUE\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria\u2019s Kurds on solving issues in northeast Syria including border security.\n\n\u201cWe heard statements yesterday both from Damascus officials and the Kurdish representatives that they are ready for such dialogue,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters during a visit to Kazakhstan.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to support the start of such substantive talks,\u201d said Lavrov.\n\nKurdish-led forces said on Tuesday they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nAnother Assad ally, Iran, urged Turkey to show restraint and avoid military action in northern Syria, although it said Turkey was \u201crightfully worried\u201d about its southern border.\n\nThe prospect of a military offensive has unsettled Turkish financial markets, with the lira this week hitting its weakest level since late August. The currency firmed slightly to 5.8220 against the dollar on Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops started to pull back after a call he had with Trump, adding talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would go on.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\u201d U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Turkish army howitzers are positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border, near the southeastern town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 7, 2019.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nKurdish-led forces denounced the U.S. policy shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.
