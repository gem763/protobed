But we don\u2019t try to understand the deep root, the interconnected root of the problem.\n\n\u201cSo what we try to do in our work is unpack the problems one by one to better understand the reasons for particular problems. What works, what doesn\u2019t work and why.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nMuch of the work produced by the trio was until recently overseen by Kremer\u2019s wife, Rachel Glennerster, who as the director of the Boston-based Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) coordinated research by 181 affiliated professors at universities around the world before taking leave last year to become the chief economist at the Department for International Development.\n\nIn 2016 Kremer and Glennerster argued in their book Strong Medicine: Creating Incentives for Pharmaceutical Research on Neglected Diseases that more vaccines would be available to poor countries if sales were guaranteed by funding agencies.\n\nData compiler Clarivate Analytics, which ranks academics by the number of citations they have gathered in academic journals and books throughout their careers, said ahead of the announcement that the most likely winners according their study were Ariel Rubinstein, who teaches game theory at Tel Aviv University and New York University; William Brian Arthur for his research on technological advances; and Katarina Juselius and S\u00f8ren Johansen, economics professors at the University of Copenhagen, for contributions to econometrics.\n\nLast year, William Nordhaus of Yale University and Paul Romer at New York University were honoured for their research into two of the most \u201cbasic and pressing\u201d economic issues of the age.\n\nNordhaus for warning policymakers about climate change in the 1970s and Romer for promoting government support for research and development, and investment.", "description": "Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Michael Kremer \u2018dramatically improved\u2019 practical solutions", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0163a30749044afb1889d2d51de43600d110bcdc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=033c27c7f97995682aabcb42568d3f3f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
