Rather than making Erik her sole protagonist, Horrocks includes his loved ones: his brother Conrad; his girlfriend, Suzanne Valadon; his friend Philippe; and his sister Louise. By writing her male virtuoso from the inside and outside, Horrocks creates a wrenching portrait of overconfidence as a destructive force.\n\nLittle, brown and company\n\nErik begins The Vexations as a boy \u201cmagnificently without shame\u201d; in his adulthood, that shamelessness transforms into unlimited ambition. He crashes through fin de si\u00e8cle Paris as a poorly mannered cabaret accompanist in worn, flamboyant velvet suits, climbing on chairs at bourgeois restaurants and challenging the director of the Paris Opera to a duel after he refuses to look at Erik\u2019s unsolicited ballet score. This behavior (which echoes the real-life Satie\u2019s reputation) humiliates Philippe, whom Erik drags along to the duel. Philippe becomes the first of many characters to abandon Erik, exhausted by his friend\u2019s antagonistic approach to life.\n\nThat antagonism stems from entitlement, which courses through The Vexations. Erik expects attention from the moment he arrives in Paris. Tellingly, Horrocks very rarely shows him working. Rather, she has him wondering irritably \u201cwhy [he hasn\u2019t] superseded himself by now.\u201d This question may motivate artists at all stages in their careers, but in Horrocks\u2019s hands, it becomes less productive ambition than immature demand.\n\nSmartly, Horrocks places Erik\u2019s egotism in contrast to the circumscribed world of his sister Louise, whose gender, in early-20th-century France, sentences her to a small and often grief-filled life. In childhood, Louise is so dutiful that neighborhood women call her \u201cLittle Mother,\u201d trusting her to enforce their rules. As an adult, she longs for glory, but can barely even ask for affection. The first time Erik declares to her that he will be famous, she reacts with mixed emotions. \u201cSomebody has to be extraordinary. Why not you?\u201d Then she thinks, \u201cWhy not me? The thought quiet as a puff of steam from a boiling pot.\u201d This is her lone reach for ambition, and Horrocks presents it in domestic language, the image trapped at home with Louise.\n\nLouise serves as Horrocks\u2019s reminder that Erik\u2019s confidence is predicated on his maleness. She also helps teach the reader to like her brother. Her affection for him is a key point of complexity in The Vexations; it springs from habit and envy and awe, emotions plenty of sisters have felt toward their older brothers. This familiarity allows Horrocks to zoom in on Erik\u2019s inner self: Initially at his most human with Louise, as he behaves more like an artist, he forgets how to respect or care for his sister. In Erik\u2019s faltering relationship with Louise, Horrocks shows a crucial piece of his humanity disintegrating.", "description": "Caitlin Horrocks\u2019s debut novel builds on a rich tradition of women writers who complicate the myth of male virtuosity until it crumbles.", "authors": ["Lily Meyer", "Caitlin Horrocks"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_538446612/facebook.jpg?1567031439"}
