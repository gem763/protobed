As part of securing Great Keppel, the buyers had to prove they had the funds to develop the proposed $400 million resort which will include a 250-room hotel and 250-berth marina.\n\nThe lengthy delay in settlement casts doubt over earlier claims that the buyers' bank statements showed funds of more than $700 million.", "description": "Taiwanese couple has yet to take ownership of Great Keppel island a year after exchanging contracts to buy it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_112/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/db0fa2c875f0b5b848e813baf36a11f4747c2252", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
