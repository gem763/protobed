I bogeyed the last and he went par-par.\n\n\u201cIt was the only time I ever got a chance to play with Sam Snead \u2014 I was two-down through two,\u201d he smiled.\n\nWhile Snead registered his 82nd win at the age of 52, Woods is nine years younger.\n\n\u201cAs far as playing until 52, I hope that\u2019s the case,\u201d said Woods.\n\n\u201cIf you would have asked me a few years ago, I would have given you a different answer, but certainly the future looks brighter than it has.\u201d\n\nAnd that includes coming back to Japan for the Tokyo Olympics next year before defending his Zozo Championship.\n\n\u201cI hope to qualify for the team and represent my country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know some of my friends have made Olympic teams before in the past and they said it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be 44 and I don\u2019t know if I have many more chances after that.\u201d", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods said Monday his latest injury comeback to win the Zozo Championship and tie the US PGA Tour\u2019s win record had", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/db79a8_tiger-woods-holds-trophy-winning-zozo-championship-in-japan-tiger-emerges-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
