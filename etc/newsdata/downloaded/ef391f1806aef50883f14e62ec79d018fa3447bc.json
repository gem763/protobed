According to German legend, it didn't end well.\n\nThe morality tale has spawned countless operas, play and movies, and whether the ultimate prize is knowledge, eternal youth or corporate power, those who barter with the devil inevitably live to regret it.\n\nThis Friday and Saturday night, Ottawa chamber choir Seventeen Voyces presents German director F.W. Murnau's 1926 silent film Faust.\n\nWhile the expressionist classic unfolds on the big screen, the ensemble, along with musical guests, will perform suitably diabolical music including excerpts from Charles Gounod's Faust, Hector Berlioz's La damnation de Faust and Lili Boulanger's Faust et H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nSoloists Iain MacPherson, Melanie Anderson and Obinna Ifediora will sing the roles of Faust, Marguerite and Mephistopheles, respectively.\n\nPopcorn will be provided.\n\nWhere: St. Matthew's Anglican Church, 217 First Ave.\n\nWhen: Friday and Saturday night at 7:30 p.m.\n\nCost: Students $20, adults $30. Tickets are available here.\n\nGaslit\n\nIt's the play that gave the world the term \"gaslighting.\" Today the word is used to describe disinformation, denials and outright lies designed to make you second-guess your own reality, but it's derived from a far more domestic setting.\n\nPatrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller Gaslight is set in Victorian England in the home of Jack and Bella. A sinister plot is unfolding within their shadowy parlour, as Jack methodically manipulates his wife into believing she's losing her mind.\n\nIn OLT's production Gaslight, Jack (J.T. Morris) manipulates his wife (Heather Archibald) into believing she's going mad. (Maria Vartanova )\n\nThe play was adapted into the Oscar-winning 1944 film starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nGeoff Gruson, who plays the detective in Ottawa Little Theatre's production of Gaslight, says the play is especially relevant in the era of #metoo.\n\n\"He is mentally torturing her, without physically torturing her,\" Gruson said. \"At that time, the simplest way to get rid of a wife was to have her sent to a lunatic asylum.\"\n\nWhere: Ottawa Little Theatre, 400 King Edward Ave.\n\nWhen: Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at 2:30 p.m. The play runs until Nov. 9.\n\nCost: Students $14, seniors $26 and adults $29. Tickets can be purchased here.\n\nEn garde!\n\nOttawa soprano Suzanne Elizabeth Brown sings the tragic role of Juliet. (Sylvie-Ann Par\u00e9)\n\nIt has breathless young love, soaring arias and plenty of swordplay.\n\nPellegrini Opera, Ottawa's little opera company that could, brings its production of Charles Gounod's Romeo and Juliet to Nepean this weekend.\n\nArtistic director \u2014 and fight director \u2014 Vincent Thomas prepares the vocalists both to sing and to do battle.\n\nBaritone Cesar Bello enjoys the swordsmanship in Romeo and Juliet, although his character, Mercutio, meets an untimely end. (Opera Pelligrini)\n\n\"Most singers I've met are very excited to sword-fight,\" Thomas said. \"They all work hard and they apply the same notion of discipline that they use in their singing and their art.\"", "description": "A pact with the devil, a sinister thriller and a couple of star-crossed lovers make the cut.", "authors": ["Sandra Abma Is A Veteran Cbc Arts Journalist.
