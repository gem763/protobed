In 2019, this review was managed in partnership with market research agency GfK.\n\nThe 2019 BOSS MBA ranking methodology is a replication of 2017\u2019s, with minor changes.\n\nGraduates and business schools were surveyed separately for the 2019 BOSS MBA rankings. Andrew Quilty\n\nResults are based on findings from two surveys \u2013 one from schools, one from alumni \u2013 to ensure the programs are evaluated from both perspectives. Data from alumni is weighted at 55 per cent, and school data at 45 per cent.\n\nThis year we attempted to incorporate recent changes in MBA education while maintaining consistency with previous years.\n\nRevisions were made to both surveys and divided into two categories: minor changes that could have an implication on the ranking, and those that do not affect the ranking.", "description": "Results are based on findings from two surveys \u2013 one from schools, one from alumni \u2013 to ensure the programs are evaluated from both perspectives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/04497bd35fc870e313083d4146811463120f6e4d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
