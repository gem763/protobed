The seventh-generation iPad features a 10.2in screen, up from the 9.7in size used since the launch of the original iPad in 2010.\n\nThe updated iPad has a faster A10 Fusion processor, which should make it better for games. Greg Joswiak, the head of iOS at Apple, said: \u201cThe new seventh generation iPad is up to two times faster than the top-selling PC in the US.\u201d\n\nThe iPad has a retina screen with nearly 3.5m pixels, Apple Pencil support and wide viewing angles. Apple has added its smart connector for an optional keyboard case, which debuted with the significantly more expensive iPad Pro. Apple said the new iPad was made from 100% recycled aluminium.\n\nThe new device joins a revamped iPad mini and larger iPad Air, which were launched in March. The updates brought those models up to parity with the iPad Pro and iPhone XS with Apple\u2019s A12 Bionic processor, replacing chips dating back to 2014.\n\nThe seventh-generation iPad starts at \u00a3349 in the UK or $329 in the US and will ship from 30 September.", "description": "Seventh-generation iPad is faster, with a bigger screen, Apple Pencil and keyboard support", "authors": ["Samuel Gibbs", "Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d422b1187a5a579a81ac662919c123d0ce979e5/4_195_4989_2993/master/4989.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56834d049439b3a002edc0d0312b9d30", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
