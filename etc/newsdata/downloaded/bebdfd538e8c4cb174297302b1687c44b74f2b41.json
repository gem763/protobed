I joined a fraternal family \u2013 millions strong and centuries old \u2013 sworn to defend unto death the United States of America and the values of liberty we represent, cherish, and live out.\n\nTrading the cocktail receptions and hobnobbing of D.C. media and policy life, which I had spent the better part of the last decade in, for trudging countless miles through the thick Georgia forest hours before dawn, clad in Army gear, was initially quite the shell shock. I realized how few of my former colleagues truly understood the task I \u2013 and so many others before, with, and after me \u2013 was now undertaking. On the whole dramatically less Americans have been serving in our nation\u2019s Armed Forces in recent years and particularly so in our nation\u2019s chief policymaking center.\n\nI personally believe the United States Armed Forces stands at an exciting in its and our nation\u2019s history. We are in an age where technology has taken utmost importance in war fighting, whether in the form of drones, the cyber domain, aeronautics and space, vehicles, production and support, and more. At the same time our nation is moving from the focus on counter-insurgency warfare of the past years back to great power rivalry, however this time in the settings and environs of the increasingly aging 21st century.\n\nAmerica has fought back countless enemies that threatened our global security since the Revolutionary War. Our prevailing advantages have always been the strength of our will, the innovativeness of our minds, and the diversity of our perspectives. In those fundamentals we are no different now than we were back throughout the centuries, even if we must be constantly adapting to a changing military, technological, diplomatic, and social domestic and world landscape.\n\nAfter a year in the military I\u2019ve also gained even greater respect for those who served in our Armed Forces and make incredible sacrifices each and every day to defend all our economic, social, and cultural flourishing in the United States. These sacrifices come not only on the battlefield but, as I saw, with family life, free time, physical strain and injury, pay, freedom of travel, of settling down, and so much more.\n\nAt the same time there are numerous ways our service members still are not getting the treatment they deserve. The military health care system, not even touching on the VA, continues to under treat our service members, many of whom\u2019s ills are military-related, through long wait times, restrictive policies for seeing outside providers, poor treatment, convoluted bureaucracy, and more.\n\nMilitary pay issues are a dime a dozen, with service members often waiting many pay periods and struggling through mind-boggling layers of government to get the salary and benefits they deserve, with no compensation for that delay. And \u2013 at the same time our military fights for technological supremacy \u2013 our service members are mired down in non-digital paper copies routing for everything from simple memorandums to leave/vacation requests.\n\nOur service members retain hardy souls and, as many will remember, are taught to \u201chunt for the good stuff,\" to look on the bright side of things and remember the nation we are fighting for and that has our back. Indeed at a time of historic domestic polarization the military retains its status as the most trusted American institution. This trust is not without good reason - the United States Armed Forces remains a pillar of integrity and honor and of diversity and integration, standing above the partisan fray. It is up to my fellow service members and I to each day re-earn and reinforce that solidarity and belief.\n\nEach day in the United States Armed Forces is an honor and privilege. It is a feeling of being part of an unbroken line of guardians of freedom who have, through their sweat and blood, kept secure in the truest sense the United States of America and its people since our republic\u2019s founding.\n\nErich Reimer is a Captain in the United States Army.
