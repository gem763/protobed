All of my memories are here, I still feel like my mum\u2019s here. We still call it her house, it always will be her house.\n\n\u201cI got the letter telling me that I had to move out and just broke down in tears.\u201d\n\n(Image: leicestermercury.co.uk/)\n\nKerry, 50, claims she was told by a city council housing officer that moving a family member in to the three bed house on Ivychurch Crescent, so she wasn\u2019t living alone in the house, would help her cause to stay.\n\n\u201cAfter we spoke to the officer I asked my nephew and his three teenage sons to move in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been trying to move home from Yorkshire anyway and I had space so that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nKerry\u2019s nephew, Matt Pepper, wanted to move home after he separated from his partner but could not move in with his mum Sue, who lives next door to Kerry, her sister, because other siblings are living there.\n\nHe has also received a letter saying that he must leave the property and that the council has no obligation to house him because he has not lived in Leicester for two consecutive years.\n\nHe said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do or where we\u2019ll go, we'll be homeless. I was told that if we moved in that Kerry could stay there, it suited us both with me wanting to come back.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it if we hadn\u2019t been told it would mean she could keep the house.\n\n\u201cMy boys have already been through the upheaval of moving schools, they\u2019ve settled really well here and my oldest starts his exams next year. I\u2019m not moving them again.\u201d\n\nThe letter, sent to both Kerry and Matt, says that the council plans to seek possession of the property \u201cby court proceedings if necessary\u201d.\n\nIt reads: \"If the council was to grant Miss Barrows a tenancy of this property it would not be in accordance with the council\u2019s housing allocation policy and would be unfair to the many thousands of applicants who are currently waiting for council accommodation.\"\n\nKerry said: \"I\u2019ve been put in the highest priority band, I don\u2019t even need to be on the list. I want to stay here.\n\n\"I work nearby, my sister lives next door, my whole life will change if I have to go.\"\n\n(Image: leicestermercury.co.uk/)\n\nKerry\u2019s sister Sue, added: \"I dread to think what mam would do if she was here. If she knew they\u2019d kick Kerry out she\u2019d been straight down the council offices to sort it out.\"\n\nThe property was originally a joint tenancy, with Kerry and Sue\u2019s mum and dad as the lead tenants, when the sisters\u2019 dad died in 2011, the tenancy passed on to their mum.\n\nA city council spokesman said: \u201cAs the tenancy of this property has already passed from one person to another, housing law does not allow it to be succeeded again.\n\n\"We understand that Ms Barrows would like to stay there, but we are desperately short of three-bedroom homes and have a lot of families waiting for them. We will therefore be seeking possession of the property if it isn\u2019t vacated within an agreed timeframe.\n\n\"Although Ms Barrows\u2019 nephew and children are also currently staying there, evidence they have provided themselves shows they moved in some time after Mrs Barrows death in January.\n\n\"If they had approached us directly for council housing it is unlikely they would have been eligible after previously living in another part of the country for several years.\n\n\u201cWe have made Ms Barrows a priority one for appropriate housing, and offered to help her look for an alternative property. Although we have no obligation to do so, we are happy to advise Mr Pepper about other accommodation that might meet his needs.\u201d", "description": "Kerry Barrows, 50, says her house in Leicester is all she has known but succession rules mean the council are now trying to turf her out", "authors": ["Amy Orton", "Image", "Leicestermercury.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467878.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2324JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
