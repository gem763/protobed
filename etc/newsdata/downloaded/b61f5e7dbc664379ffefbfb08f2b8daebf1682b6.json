When you start lying you have to remember which lie you told which person, and as the truth begins to creep out, as it always does, you find yourself scrambling to twist it to fit back into your lie. Democrats, both in Congress and the media, are finding this out the hard way this week with their latest \u201cTrump is corrupt and must be impeached\u201d lie.\n\nMost people learn that honesty is the best policy when they\u2019re kids, but politicians and journalists are now overgrown, overpaid kids. There are maybe a handful of honest, mature people currently working in politics, but none have seen the business end of a TV camera since the 90s.\n\nAlmost everything about the allegations that have Democrats moving toward impeachment of the President is a lie, a proven lie. And they don\u2019t care.\n\nThe call with Ukrainian President Zelensky did take place, so that part is true. From there, the lies begin.\n\n\u201cThere was a quid pro quo\u201d they said. The President threatened to withhold aid money from Ukraine unless Zelensky investigated Joe and Hunter Biden, we were told. The transcript showed that did not happen.\n\nThat fact did not stop any Democrat from saying it did. It did not stop anchors at CNN and MSNBC from saying it did.\n\nOn MSNBC, Katy Tur summarized the transcript this way: \u201cWill you do me a favor and investigate Vice President Biden\u2019s son? Will you do me a favor and get involved in the 2020 election? Vice President Biden is my chief political opponent.\u201d\n\nOn CNN, Brianna Keillor said President Trump told Zelensky, \u201c\u2019I would like you to do us a favor\u2026\u2019 the President asks Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden and his son, Hunter.\u201d\n\nThe only problem is the President said nothing of the sort. The President was asking for Zelensky\u2019s help investigating attempts by the previous Ukraine government\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. Read the transcript for yourself. To get to any mention of Biden you have to skip 540 words, fully three quarters the length of an op-ed. But CNN and MSNBC simply erased those words and created their own version of the conversation.\n\nThere was a time when the media reported on Ukraine\u2019s attempt to influence our election made news. In January of 2017, Politico ran a story with the headline, \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\u201d\n\nIn that story, by the way, Politico reports, \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nIf seeking aid from foreign governments for political campaigns is a crime, there\u2019s some right there. But that\u2019s of no interest to liberals, they\u2019ve memory-holed those inconvenient truths.\n\nAlso memory-holed is the truth about withholding US aid to Ukraine. For there to be a \u201cthreat,\u201d for there to be a quid pro quo, Ukraine would have to be aware of the fact that the aid was put on hold. But the New York Times, of all places, noted that Ukraine did not know the aid was put on hold until a month AFTER the call. Leverage only works when both sides know one of them has and is using it.\n\nThere is one reporter on both that 2017 Politico story and this Times story \u2013 Ken Vogel. He also reported, \u201cWhen U.S. officials urged TRUMP to meet with ZELENSKY, & to support the new Ukrainian government against Russian aggression, TRUMP said of Ukrainians: \u2018They\u2019re all corrupt & they tried to take me down.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis bolsters President Trump\u2019s claim that he decided to delay aid because of the history of corruption in Ukraine, corruption no one disputes. When President Trump said that\u2019s why he did it, cable news talking heads dismissed it in favor of the \u201cleverage\u201d narrative. But again, there could be no leverage because Ukraine didn\u2019t know of the decision.\n\nThe so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d account gets all of this wrong. Whoever this person is admits they had no firsthand knowledge of any of it, they\u2019d played the child\u2019s game \u201ctelephone\u201d with a couple of people who allegedly had knowledge and felt compelled to file a complaint. If it was so disturbing, why didn\u2019t anyone actually directly involved file the complaint?\n\nThen there\u2019s the charge of a \u201ccover-up!\u201d It\u2019s one of the left\u2019s favorite buzzwords because it evokes a visceral reaction when you hear it. But when you think about it, and look at what they\u2019re using to back it up, it\u2019s another in a long list of scams.\n\nThe story goes that the White House tried to hide this story because the transcript was on a different server, a more secure server than the one transcripts used to be stored on. This was another bit of info the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d found disturbing in the complaint. But those transcripts were moved to the more secure server at the behest of White House lawyers AFTER two transcripts were leaked to the press early in the Trump administration (perhaps by the whistleblower, who seemed to know and care about where they were stored). Classified material was leaked by anonymous, untrustworthy government agents, so it makes perfect sense that you\u2019d secure that information going forward. That Democrats are trying to make something out of this tells you something about their priorities and character.\n\nThe other aspect of the \u201ccover-up\u201d is ridicules it\u2019s surprising adults aren\u2019t embarrassed to make it. How can anyone claim the White House is withholding information when the President declassified every piece of paper associated with the call? The transcript, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General\u2019s report, all of these are classified and could have been held back with a perfectly valid claim of executive privilege. That didn\u2019t happen. The President released the information so quickly that Democrats were still calling for their release after they\u2019d already been released.\n\nWhat is odd is how Congressman Adam Schiff, weeks before Democrats allegedly heard about this whistleblower complaint, laid out the exact narrative Democrats are using. \u201cTrump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent. It doesn\u2019t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security,\u201d he tweeted a month ago like a kid with a secret they just can\u2019t wait to tell.\n\nWhat did Schiff know and when did he know it? And if Schiff knew, who else knew?\n\nIt was weird how everyone got on the same page so quickly, with the same (bad) information and false claims, and just after the intelligence community changed their whistleblowing requirements that information be firsthand, not hearsay. Even self-righteous alleged conservatives who hate the President were quick to get on board.\n\nNone \u2013 not the Democrats, the \u201cjournalists,\u201d or never-Trumpers \u2013 seem remotely bothered by the fact that every claim they\u2019ve clutched their pearls over turned out to be false. When you embrace and repeat something you know to be false, you are lying. If the evidence were there, if it\u2019s on their side, why lie?\n\nIt\u2019s precisely because the truth is not on their side that they have to lie.\n\nThis was a coordinated coup attempt. Democrats were tipped off about the whistleblower complaint and pot-committed themselves to it being the silver bullet they\u2019ve desperately been seeking. But the President was holding all the cards. He released everything to the public and authorized everyone to testify. By the time Democrats realized they\u2019d gotten it all wrong it was too late.\n\nThey knew the other stories they been feeding their supporters were garbage. LIberals simply used stories like \u201cRussian collusion\u201d to keep their base riled up and on the line. But this one, this time they thought they had him. Only they didn\u2019t, there was no \u201cthere\u201d there.\n\nYou only get one bite at the impeachment apple, they have no choice but to plough forward with it anyway.\n\nJournalists and pundits, on the other hand, do have a choice. They\u2019re sticking with their team and ignoring the facts, ignoring the truth.\n\nAll these people are going to fight till the end, go down with the ship. They hate the President so much they are not going to let a little thing like having to lie deter them. They want him gone and are willing to lie to make it happen. Trump Derangement Syndrome is the Kool-Aid at Jonestown.\n\nFor all their insistence that Donald Trump is corrupt, it is his opponents who are willing to pervert reality to get what they want. They deserve every bad thing that happens to them.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "Lying takes a lot of effort, telling the truth is .09/29/2019 1:00:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ef5eb632-e868-4f93-b614-50ad162493a0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
