We are trying to improve every week,\u201d he told reporters in Kobe.\n\n\u201cAfter the New Zealand game, we try not to look at the scoreboard, and really tried to work on things that we knew would be important come the quarter-finals,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome things were good, some things were not as great. Bits and pieces, we are almost there, and hopefully we will really hit our straps in the quarter-final.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks have no idea who they will meet on Oct. 20 at Tokyo Stadium, as the winner of Pool A will only be decided this weekend.\n\nErasmus, however, was convinced there was only so much work South Africa could do in terms of their physical preparation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can get much fitter, faster, quicker or tougher physically in the next three weeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of it, I believe, is mental \u2013 it\u2019s upstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to do with (asking) \u2018how do you handle pressure?\u2019 What is pressure?, and \u2018how can you transfer the pressure from your team onto them?\u2019 And there, a lot of things play a role,\u201d Erasmus explained.\n\n\u201cIf you play Japan, you\u2019ve got a lot of pressure because it\u2019s a home crowd,\u201d he continued.\n\nTo cope with that pressure, Erasmus added that they had been trying to put the players in scenarios they were uncomfortable with in training.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken a lot about role-playing with the things we are struggling with on the field (and) we are putting players in specific situations to try to overcome those things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt definitely didn\u2019t work in the New Zealand game but we took our lessons out of that one and, so far, it\u2019s been going better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been glimpses in all the departments that we are almost there, but we haven\u2019t put together a complete performance together in total.\u201d", "description": "South Africa are not quite where coach Rassie Erasmus wants them to be heading into the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals next week, he said on Friday, but they are training under pressure to replicate knockout rugby.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439635190&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0TH-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
