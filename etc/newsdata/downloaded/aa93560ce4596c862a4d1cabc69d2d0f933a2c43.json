Tony Evers in a tweet that read 'please... read this letter' on Wednesday that was shared with her 62 million followers and liked over 5,400 times.\n\nShe included the two-page note penned by Dassey where he wrote, 'I am innocent and want to go home,' along with his future hopes to become the father to a daughter he would name Grace and a son, Mizar, named after 'a star in the big dipper.'\n\nHe was 16-years-old when he confessed to Wisconsin authorities that he had joined his uncle, Steve Avery, in the 2005 rape and murder of photographer Teresa Halbach, before burning her body in a bonfire.\n\nAttorneys for Dassey, whose story was documented in the 2015 Netflix series 'Making a Murderer,' claim his confession was coerced by law enforcement and have tried to free him ever since - even taking his appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nBut Dassey appeared to be attempting a different approach, outside of court system, with his letter to Evers who relaunched a pardons board this year but only to those who have completed their prison sentences.\n\nBrendan Dassey (pictured in 2016), who was convicted of rape and murder when he was a teenager, asked Wisconsin's governor for a pardon or commutation of his life sentence. His handwritten note was shared by Kim Kardashian (right) in a hope to further his cause\n\nIn the two-page handwritten note (above) included details about his interests, including Pokemon, his favorite wrestler and also that he hoped to be a father one day\n\nDassey asked for a pardon 'because I am innocent and want to go home'. The letter included two hearts - one with the word 'hugs' and one with 'love'\n\nEvers' rules for a pardon forbid anyone still serving their prison sentence from being considered and he's also not issuing any commutations.\n\nIn the letter written by Dassey he congratulated Evers, a Democrat who took office in January, on becoming governor.\n\nHe also listed things he enjoys including Pokemon and hamburgers and drew a pair of hearts with the word 'hugs' in one and 'love' in the other.\n\nEvers re-started Wisconsin's pardons board this year after his Republican predecessor Scott Walker stopped it, but to be considered the applicants must have completed their prison sentences.\n\nHis latest appeal was not considered by the US Supreme Court and Dassey's chances of getting a pardon from Gov Tony Evers (pictured) appear remote. Commutations in Wisconsin are rare. No governor since Tommy Thompson, who left office in 2001, has issued one\n\nKardashian also shared the advertisement to an interview with Dassey and his lawyer Laura Nirider on the podcast 'Wrongful Conviction,' which has claimed to be the 'only interview ever conducted with Brendan'.\n\nBoth posts had been shared more than a thousand times and received a mixture of support and criticism from those believe Dassey and Avery are guilty.\n\nShe shared a link to bringbrendanhome.org, which also featured a petition to Evers to grant clemency to Dassey.\n\nAnyone not meeting that criteria will be rejected as ineligible with no review, the application form says.\n\nEvers has no public rules for commuting a prison sentence, but his spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said in June that he is not considering doing that 'at this time'. Commutations in Wisconsin are rare.\n\nNo governor since Tommy Thompson, who left office in 2001, has issued one.\n\nDassey (left in 2006), now 29, was 16 years old when he confessed to Wisconsin authorities that he had joined his uncle, Steve Avery (right in 2007), in the 2005 rape and murder of photographer Teresa Halbach\n\nHalbach's (pictured) body was then burned in a bonfire. Dassey's attorneys say he's intellectually impaired and claim he was manipulated by police officers into accepting their story of how Halbach's murder happened\n\nStill Nirider said she hoped Evers would make an exception for Dassey.\n\n'What we're hoping to do is to take this moment to ask the governor to hold off, to look at this case as a perfect example for that kind of relief,' she told reporters following a news conference.\n\n'We look forward to working with Governor Evers to help him understand this case, to help him see that it's time to bring Brendan home.'\n\nEvers on Wednesday didn't rule out the Dassey request, saying he hadn't seen it yet. The governor has yet to act on any pardon requests.\n\n'We'll deal with it just like we do any communication we receive,' Evers said. 'We give consideration to all sorts of things that we reject. Whether there's criteria or not, we'll consider it and respond back to them.'\n\nDassey, now 29, was 16 years old when he confessed to Wisconsin authorities that he had joined his uncle, Steve Avery, in the 2005 rape and murder of photographer Teresa Halbach, before burning her body in a bonfire.\n\nThe pardon request argues that Dassey was the victim of a 'uniquely and profoundly flawed legal process'. It says seeking clemency from the governor is 'one of the last remaining legal options' available.\n\nDassey will be eligible for parole in 2048. He is currently imprisoned at Columbia Correctional Institution (pictured)\n\nLaura Nirider (pictured), Dassey's attorney said she hoped Evers would make an exception for her client. 'What we're hoping to do is to take this moment to ask the governor to hold off, to look at this case as a perfect example for that kind of relief,' she said\n\n'By his prison conduct and his gentle, patient insistence of his own innocence, Brendan has shown himself to be the rare person who is worthy of clemency,' the application said.\n\nDassey's attorneys say he's intellectually impaired and that he was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how Halbach's murder happened. They wanted his confession thrown out and a new trial.\n\nAvery and Dassey are serving life sentences. The US Supreme Court last year, without comment, said they would not consider Dassey's appeal of his conviction.\n\nHe could request another trial if a judge agrees he has new evidence that warrants it.\n\nAt Dassey's trial, video of his confession to investigators played a central role. Authorities had no physical evidence tying Dassey to the crimes, and he testified that his confession was 'made up,' but a jury convicted him anyway.\n\nHe will be eligible for parole in 2048.\n\nWisconsin prosecutors have long held that Dassey's confession was voluntary.\n\nProsecutors noted that Dassey's mother gave investigators permission to speak with him, that Dassey agreed as well and that during the interview investigators used only standard techniques such as adopting a sympathetic tone and encouraging honesty.\n\nDassey's mother and cousin attended a news conference in Madison where the pardon application was announced. They did not speak to reporters.\n\nAvery spent 18 years in prison for a different rape before DNA testing exonerated him.\n\nAfter his release, he filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit over his conviction, but he was arrested in 2005 and later convicted of Halbach's murder as that lawsuit was still pending.
