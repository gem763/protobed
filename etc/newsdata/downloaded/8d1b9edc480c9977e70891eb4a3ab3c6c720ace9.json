It denies meddling in Hong Kong and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by its obligations under the Joint Declaration.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as a result of the unrest. A surge in migration applications suggests more locals are making plans to leave.\n\nChina has called on its biggest state firms to take a more active role in Hong Kong, including stepping up investment and asserting more control over companies.\n\nMultiple Hong Kong events and conferences have been cancelled and the number of visitors plunged 40 percent in August. The city\u2019s premier women\u2019s tennis event scheduled for October has been postponed.\n\nOrganisers also called off the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s \u201cMatilda the Musical\u201d, due to run from Sept. 20 to Oct. 20.\n\nSlideshow (37 Images)\n\nPolice on Tuesday set up an \u201canti-violence hotline\u201d on which people could call in giving intelligence on planned unrest.\n\nOn Friday they announced it had been shut down because of \u201cdifferent opinions\u201d.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters took to the hills to form flashlight-carrying human chains on Friday, using the colourful Mid-Autumn Festival as a backdrop to the latest in more than three months of sometimes violent demonstrations.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429511504&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1WF", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
