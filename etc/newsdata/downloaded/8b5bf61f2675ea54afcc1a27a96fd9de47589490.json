From its very first promos, I had a good feeling about AHS: 1984 \u2014 and so far the slasher homage has not let me down.\n\nIt\u2019s been a nice surprise. Ryan Murphy\u2019s earlier ode to all things slasher, Fox\u2019s Scream Queens \u2014 which also featured 1984 stars Emma Roberts and Billie Lourd \u2014 was pretty mediocre (though casting Jamie Lee Curtis was genius). But Scream Queens, which was set amid the mean-girl culture of a sorority house, took place in the present day, and it abandoned its slasher leanings to become more of a shrill murder mystery by the end of its first season.\n\nThe decidedly more adult AHS: 1984 aims for authenticity by placing itself squarely in the time period that spawned so many Halloween and Friday the 13th imitators and sequels. Plus, it has campy fun with well-chosen era signifiers that manage to be both grimy and bubblegum at the same time \u2014 starting with its squad of coke-snorting aerobics enthusiasts who decide to ditch L.A. ahead of the 1984 Summer Olympics and take jobs as counsellors at the recently reopened Camp Redwood.\n\n\u201cRecently reopened,\u201d of course, because of the horrific massacre that happened there 14 years prior. But even blood-stained Camp Redwood isn\u2019t what it seems, in a story that\u2019s so far revealed nearly every character\u2019s got something to hide. The American Horror Story rulebook requires that expectations must be completely upended whenever possible; we\u2019re just halfway through the season (episode five airs tonight) and already the juicy secrets have started rattling loose \u2014 ahead of what will surely be more giant twists down the road.\n\nIf you\u2019re not caught up, get on that \u2014 and return with \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d \u201cManeater,\u201d and \u201cRebel Yell\u201d (all featured on the soundtrack) and the show\u2019s own synthed-out score permanently lodged into your brain to go over what\u2019s happened so far, and ponder what\u2019s to come.\n\nTo sum up, as briefly as possible: The sole survivor of the 1970 Camp Redwood tragedy \u2014 former counselor turned Jesus freak/ultraconservative rich widow/knee-sock enthusiast Margaret Booth (Leslie Grossman) \u2014 has bought the camp and is intent on transforming it back into a wholesome retreat for children. The counselors she hires all have their own reasons for wanting to get the hell out of L.A., most overtly Brooke (Emma Roberts), who\u2019s just had a too-close encounter with Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, played by Zach Villa in a highly fictionalised take on the real-life Satanic serial killer.\n\nThe rest of the group includes Xavier (Cody Fern), whose dreams of becoming a movie star are threatened by the gay porn director who\u2019s blackmailing him to stay in the X-rated biz; Chet, a would-be Olympian who was disqualified for doping (played by Gus Kenworthy, a real-life Olympic medalist); and college dropout Ray (DeRon Horton), who\u2019s terrified the LAPD is about to discover his part in the accidental death of a fraternity pledge.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Montana (Billie Lourd), a horny cardio fiend who seduces the Night Stalker so he\u2019ll go after Brooke, whose former fianc\u00e9 (deep breath, soap opera incoming) shot and killed Montana\u2019s brother in a jealous rage, thinking his soon-to-be wife and best friend were having an affair \u2014 which Brooke (who doesn\u2019t realise who Montana really is) denies but Montana believes to be true. (Since this is American Horror Story, which never misses a chance to go over the top, this crime literally occurs at the altar, with \u201cWhite Wedding\u201d on full blast as the groom kills the best man, the bride\u2019s father, and finally himself. Is there a blood-soaked wedding gown in the mix? Of course there is!)\n\nBillie Lourd and her incredible Montana wig.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s not even everyone, though 1984 has what seems to be a pretty scaled-down cast as far as AHS seasons go. We also meet Trevor (Matthew Morrison), the head counselor, who doesn\u2019t seem to have any notable secrets, though he is hilariously well-endowed; Rita (Angelica Ross), the camp nurse, who\u2019s actually a serial killer-obsessed psychologist named Donna; Jonas (Lou Taylor Pucci), the apparent ghost of a former Camp Redwood counselor who died in 1970 while trying to flee the murders; and finally, Benjamin Richter (John Carroll Lynch), also known as Mr. Jingles, the madman who slaughtered nine kids after suffering a psychotic break brought on by post-Vietnam War PTSD, and who escapes the insane asylum where he\u2019s been locked up ever since.\n\nExcept, well, Mr. Jingles didn\u2019t actually kill any kids in 1970. He may have done terrible things in the war, but the Camp Redwood killer was Margaret \u2014 taking revenge on all the other counselors who tormented her for being a goody-goody and then framing \u201cBenji,\u201d her only friend, for the crime. Over the years, shock treatment and other forms of institutional cruelty have lulled Richter into believing in his own guilt; when he breaks out of the asylum (with Donna\u2019s help), he has grown into becoming the disturbed homicidal maniac everyone already thought he was.\n\nIt must be said that Zach Villa really does look like Richard Ramirez.\n\nSo that\u2019s a general who\u2019s who of those lurking around Camp Redwood, circa summer 1984 \u2014 save a few unfortunate interlopers who also happen to visit the property and are quickly and gruesomely dispatched. The fact that so much plot has happened already is standard for American Horror Story, a series that\u2019s pretty much perfected the art of the scandalous backstory at this point.\n\nBut in 1984, all that oversized drama hangs on a story structure that\u2019s deliberately familiar, especially to fans of classic slasher films (with a little Rambo and kitschy 1980s signposts like \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d tossed in for good measure).\n\nWe had a feeling that would be the case thanks to the note-perfect retro ad campaign, which carries over into the show itself. Even casual fans will note the heavy influence of first three Friday the 13th films \u2014 as well as other 1980s summer-camp horror films (The Burning, Sleepaway Camp) and Halloween, which provides the perfect blueprint for Mr. Jingles\u2019 asylum escape.\n\nAnd beyond specific references, 1984 makes gleeful use of slasher tropes galore, like the gas-station attendant who warns the kids \u201cYou\u2019re all gonna die!\u201d when he hears where they\u2019re headed; the \u201cprank gone wrong in the past\u201d set-up (who else thinks the frat kid Ray oops-murdered is going to pop back up before the end of the season?); and the fact that Brooke \u2014 who\u2019s certainly being positioned as the Final Girl, though who knows where this show will actually take the character? \u2014 is the first person to notice that there\u2019s a killer in their midst.\n\nKillers, actually.\n\nXavier, shortly before he\u2019s attacked by Mr. Jingles, shortly before Mr. Jingles realises he\u2019s not really a killer.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, because this is American Horror Story, nothing is ever as it seems. Of course 1984 is not a straightforward homage; it\u2019s interested in dissecting all those tropes and offering its own commentary on them, while also being cheeky and naughty whenever possible. The pitting of Mr. Jingles against the Night Stalker is particularly clever because it allows the show to dig into various aspects of serial killer psychology.\n\nThanks to Donna, Benjamin comes to believe that he wasn\u2019t born evil; he was shaped into being a \u201cmonster\u201d thanks to environmental influences. That includes Donna\u2019s own influence when her clever plan to \u201cstudy the apex predator in the wild\u201d means Mr. Jingles really does start racking up a body count, at least until Margaret sets him straight about what really happened in 1970.\n\nAt nearly the same moment, Richard realises that none of the evil he\u2019s done is his fault, because he was born into it. The presence of mental trauma, Margaret explains to him, combined with the certainty that you\u2019re doing God\u2019s will (or Satan\u2019s will, as the case may be), means you\u2019ll never feel any guilt about anything. Be free! It\u2019s worked for her for 14 years!\n\nBut as 1984 moves forward, all those ways of thinking are going to be further challenged. Jingles, whose reputation as a boogeyman looms so large there are Halloween masks made of his face, will presumably have to grapple with the bombshell that \u201cit was never me,\u201d while also coming to terms with the gruesome stuff he did (like locking Xavier inside a giant oven and burning his face off) in the interim. Also, last week\u2019s episode ended with Richard \u2014 who appeared to have lost his fight to the death with Mr. Jingles \u2014 being revived with what looked like a helping hand from Satan!\n\nWhat\u2019s the Night Stalker going to be like now that he has supernatural powers? Will Satan manifest as an actual character? Who among those who are currently presumed dead (including Ray and Trevor) will return \u2014 either as ghosts, like Jonas, or something far less benign?\n\nWho among the living will be pushed to the brink by what they\u2019ve experienced \u2014 and add themselves to 1984's roll call of ruthless killers? Who else thinks Margaret probably killed her husband? Also: What\u2019s going to happen in the morning when the kiddie campers show up to this Grand Guignol in the forest?\n\nReal-life sports hero Gus Kenworthy plays failed Olympian Chet.\n\nInevitably, more rugs are going to pulled out from under us as the season continues. We also still haven\u2019t gotten a Gus flashback, and there\u2019s quite obviously way more to Donna (whose kiss-off \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll be remembered as a feminist hero!\u201d to an imperiled Brooke was pure gold) than 1984 has shown us so far. There\u2019s still room for tons of 1980s history and culture to crop up, not to mention lots of other horror movies from the era that could get shout-outs (could 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street find an entry point?).\n\nAlso, it wouldn\u2019t be American Horror Story without some fan-favourite cameos; will the almighty Sarah Paulson, who\u2019s not starring on the show for the first time in nine seasons, grace us with a surprise visit \u2014 maybe on the series\u2019 landmark 100th episode on October 23?\n\nObviously, a lot remains to be seen. The next episode, which airs tonight, is titled \u201cRed Dawn\u201d \u2014 named for the 1984 movie, though it could be more of a reference to the state of things once the sun rises over Camp Redwood rather than a hint about some Cold War terrors on the horizon. Or maybe all those Rambo references are about to pay off big time? We\u2019ll have to tune in to see.", "description": "A show as long-running and as thematically varied as American Horror Story isn\u2019t going to please every fan every season (the \u201ctimely\u201d Cult was a low point, but last year\u2019s crossover, Apocalypse, was fabulous).
