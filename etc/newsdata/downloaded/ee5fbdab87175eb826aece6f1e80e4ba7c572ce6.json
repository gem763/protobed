You see they called America racist. They called capitalism racist. These people even said that personal responsibility is racist. Hell, everything, to them, was racist.\u201d\n\nBut the truth is \u2014 racism is nearly nonexistent in America today. There\u2019s so little racism [in America], that people like Jussie Smollett have to stage hate crimes \u2014 the truth is that the political left has a monopoly on bigotry in America. The Democratic Party is the Party of the KKK. They are the Party of lynching. They are Party of Jim Crow. The Democratic Party is the Party of slavery. And now the Party of slavery is the Party of repetitions for slavery?\n\n\u201cWe all know that for nearly 200 years, the Democratic Party has presided over the destruction of black life in America,\u201d said Hudson. \u201cAnd the numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 are we not supposed to add up all the many ways that leftist policies that have left people like us in a worse state?\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir constant support for Planned Parenthood has resulted in the destruction of millions of black lives in America,\u201d he added. \u201cFor decades, they\u2019ve tried to replace the natural role of the black two-parent household.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d affirmed Hudson. \u201cToday, our message to the race hustlers is this: you had your chance, you did not lead, and now we will.\u201d\n\nHundreds of black conservatives have gathered in Washington, D.C. for the three-day event featuring speeches by prominent leaders in the conservative movement today, such as BLEXIT founder Candace Owens, syndicated radio host Larry Elder, and TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, among others. Attendees also met with President Donald Trump on Friday at the White House.\n\nHudson also talked about Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart, who used to tell people at events \u2014 just like BLS \u2014 to get out their cellphones and harness their power as citizen journalists.\n\n\u201cYou see, the left is afraid of you, because they know that you\u2019re dangerous, and so they try to silence you,\u201d explained Hudson, \u201cbut you are powerful because you\u2019re vocal. And trust me, I know the price that you pay for being a young, black freedom fighter.\u201d\n\nA decade ago I heard Andrew Breitbart encouraging young freedom fighters that look just like you to be happy warriors. You see, I was in college at the time, and I had chosen to reject the left\u2019s silly expectations for how I should think as a young black man. My college campus looked then, looked like far too many of your college campuses look today. Islands of closed-mindedness, where young people are not encouraged to think critically, but are instead programmed to be skeptical of those who do.\n\nHudson concluded by offering attendees three suggestions regarding how they can \u201chelp free more minds\u201d in today\u2019s political climate.\n\n\u201cLove and support each other\u2019s journeys,\u201d he said. \u201cHave each other\u2019s backs \u2014 and remember that as young leaders, it\u2019s your responsibility to help illuminate the path forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second thing is, know the facts,\u201d continued Hudson, who then encouraged attendees to read conservative news outlets, rather than just going to the establishment press for information. \u201cArm yourself with the informational weapons that you will need to win ideological battles on your campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third thing is this: have fun,\u201d said Hudson. \u201cBe happy warriors. Take it from me, there\u2019s nothing more that pisses off the left more than a joyful, black conservative.\n\n\u201cAnd always remember the lesson that history taught us long ago,\u201d concluded Hudson. \u201cEvil wins when good people remain silent.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Breitbart News Entertainment Editor Jerome Hudson spoke at Turning Point USA's annual Black Leadership Summit (BLS) in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, and told an audience of hundreds of young activists that \"there's a political awakening happening in America and it's being led by young free thinkers like you.\"", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jeromebls-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
