The person has still not been publicly identified.\n\nAD\n\nTrump lashed out at the anonymous author after the column\u2019s publication. The president questioned both whether the author existed and whether the author had committed treason. He also demanded on Twitter that the Times turn over \u201cthe GUTLESS anonymous person\u201d to the government \u201cat once.\u201d The Times did not.\n\nThe forthcoming book will list the author as \u201cAnonymous.\u201d Although the person does not reveal their identity in the book, they will discuss the reasons for their anonymity, according to people involved in the project.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPicking up from where those first words of warning left off, this explosive book offers a shocking, firsthand account of President Trump and his record,\u201d reads a statement about the book\u2019s release.\n\nThe book will be published Nov. 19 by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group. It comes during a treacherous period for Trump, as the House continues its fast-moving impeachment inquiry into allegations that the president abused his power.\n\nThe author is being represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin, the same literary agents who represented fired FBI director James B. Comey and former White House aide Cliff Sims \u2014 still a Trump ally \u2014 for their memoirs from their time in the Trump administration. The book was acquired by Sean Desmond, Twelve\u2019s publisher.\n\nPeople involved in the project said that both Twelve and Javelin have verified that the book\u2019s author is the same person who wrote the Times column but would not share the author\u2019s identity with The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere obviously will be those who want the author to reveal themselves publicly, but there are good reasons for that not to happen,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cThe author feels their identity is almost irrelevant because there is scarcely a sentiment expressed in this book that is not shared by numerous others who have served and continue to serve this administration at its highest levels.\u201d\n\nThere is no modern historical parallel for a firsthand account of a sitting president written in book form by an anonymous author. Many senior government officials, including some who served in the Trump administration, have written books under their own names. Many more have shared information with journalists on the condition of anonymity, perhaps most famously the official known as Deep Throat who was a key source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s reporting in The Post on the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe 1996 publication of \u201cPrimary Colors: A Novel of Politics\u201d caused a sensation in part because of the anonymity of its author, who was later revealed to be columnist Joe Klein. The book was a work of fiction, although its characters and events mirrored Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLatimer said the anonymous author of \u201cA Warning\u201d did not take an advance and intends to donate some of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that focus on government accountability and supporting truth-tellers in repressive countries, including the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association.\n\n\u201cThe author could have received a seven-figure advance for writing this book,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cBut \u2018A WARNING\u2019 was not written for financial reasons. The author sees this as an act of conscience and of duty, which is why the author refused any advance and is donating a substantial portion of any royalties to charities that protect those seeking the truth around the world.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The author\u2019s original 2018 column in the New York Times ricocheted around the world and stoked the president\u2019s rage because of its devastating portrayal of Trump in office.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/m1KjX6q6tB5sydBYiUWv7xn_sWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZVSDOAY3YI6RNUBFVGUMKQZEE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
