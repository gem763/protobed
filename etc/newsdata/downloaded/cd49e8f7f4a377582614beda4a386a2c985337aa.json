Perhaps this is too many, but Samsung doesn\u2019t seem to think so. It\u2019s now releasing a blockchain-branded variant of the Galaxy Note 10 to bring in customers holding out for a cryptocurrency-focused Samsung flagship.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the Galaxy Note 10 variant, which is only available in South Korea, will be marketed as a \u201cKlaytnPhone.\u201d It\u2019s named for a blockchain platform made by the blockchain arm of Kakao, a South Korean messaging company. WSJ says the KlaytnPhone will have a crypto wallet and blockchain apps built in, and will also give users a \u201ccertain amount\u201d of Klay, a cryptocurrency made by Kakao.\n\nHaving a wallet and blockchain apps built into a phone isn\u2019t exactly new\n\nHaving a wallet and blockchain apps built into a phone isn\u2019t exactly new \u2014 Samsung included a crypto wallet in some Galaxy S10s, HTC already offers a blockchain phone, and the Journal also says other Android phones can run Klaytn\u2019s blockchain apps. But, according to the Journal, only the KlaytnPhone will \u201cboast the blockchain platform\u2019s full breadth of transaction services.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, the KlaytnPhone has the same hardware and is expected to have the same price as non-blockchain Galaxy Note 10s, reports the Journal. (The KlaytnPhone will also reportedly show the Klaytn logo when it\u2019s booted up and shut down, just in case you forget which version of the Galaxy Note 10 you have.)", "description": "Samsung is releasing a blockchain-branded variant of the Galaxy Note 10 dubbed the KlaytnPhone, to bring in customers holding out for a cryptocurrency-focused Samsung flagship.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vP1_dkqKdg8HWFR8QMAgxY3ZLjU=/0x142:2040x1210/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18841651/tricker_190730_3577_0073.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
