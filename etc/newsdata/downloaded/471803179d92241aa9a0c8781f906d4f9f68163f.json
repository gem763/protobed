They included sparrows, swallows, blackbirds, thrushes, finches, warblers and meadowlarks.\n\nSome 90% of the total loss came from just 12 bird families and 19 widespread bird species such as the dark-eyed junco, common grackle and house sparrows. Each of those species lost more than 50 million individuals.\n\nThe researchers tracked populations of 529 species using decades of bird counts taken on the ground as well as weather radar data that revealed similar declines in the volume of migratory birds.\n\nGrassland birds were particularly hard hit, with a 53% reduction in population, amid agricultural intensification.\n\nShorebirds, reliant on sensitive coastal habitats, sustained a 37% drop. Most shorebirds are migratory and experienced habitat degradation and destruction in many locales where they migrate. In addition, many shorebirds breed in Arctic regions rapidly warming due to climate change.\n\nThe researchers documented a steep decline for migratory birds. They noted broad declines among birds that migrate to the tropics, where there have been devastating rates of habitat loss and degradation. Migrating birds also face threats at their stopover sites and on their North American breeding grounds.\n\nThe researchers said other studies have documented worrisome bird population losses in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cBirds are a critical component of many ecosystems. They serve as predators and prey in food webs, disperse seeds, and provide ecosystem services such as eating insect pests. When we lose large amounts of birds, we disturb the entire web of life, which we all depend upon,\u201d said study lead author Ken Rosenberg, an applied conservation scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy.\n\nWhile climate change was not the major driver of the population plunge, it is likely to exacerbate the existing threats to bird populations, Rosenberg said.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe researchers said the extinction in the early 20th century of the passenger pigeon, once likely the most abundant birds on Earth numbering in the billions, showed that even abundant species can go extinct rapidly.\n\nSome types of birds showed gains. Banning the pesticide DDT allowed for the resurgence of raptor populations including the bald eagle, the researchers said. Waterfowl management policies including wetland protection and restoration enabled ducks and geese to thrive, they added.\n\n\u201cThese are important examples that show, when we choose to make changes and actively manage the threats birds face, we can positively impact bird populations,\u201d Rosenberg said.", "description": "From grasslands to seashores to forests and backyards, birds are disappearing at an alarming rate in the United States and Canada, with a 29% population drop since 1970 and a net loss of about 2.9 billion birds, scientists said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Will Dunham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431704997&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1RD", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
