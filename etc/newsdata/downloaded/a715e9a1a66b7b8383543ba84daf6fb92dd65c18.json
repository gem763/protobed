There is no evidence this occurred, and the same ad was rejected by CNN for containing inaccuracies. The ad was accepted by Fox News, Twitter and YouTube.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d wrote Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s public policy director for global elections, in a letter to the Biden campaign. \u201cThus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers.\u201d\n\nBefore joining Facebook, Harbath worked as chief digital strategist for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and as a digital staffer on Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign. Giuliani is a key figure in the White House\u2019s dealings with Ukraine that are under scrutiny in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPresident Trump meets with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the Oval Office.

Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, wrote, \u201cit is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,\u201d adding that would be done only if a politician\u2019s speech endangers people.\n\nThe Trump campaign has pumped millions into Facebook, including $5 million over the past three months, as it attempts to push back against an impeachment inquiry that\u2019s reached majority support in many polls.\n\nThe move has drawn scrutiny from another Democratic frontrunner. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been a critic of the power of big tech, wrote in a series of tweets on Monday that \u201cFacebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an \u2018existential\u2019 threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election,\u201d adding, \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy \u2014 allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections.\u201d\n\n[ Related: What\u2019s behind Warren\u2019s plan to break up Facebook, Amazon and Google ]\n\nZuckerberg called a potential Warren administration an existential threat to his company during a July meeting, the audio of which was published by the Verge last week. In March, the company removed policy-oriented paid ads by the Warren campaign that called for breaking up monopoly tech companies, then reversed itself after criticism. The company had pledged that it would work to fight disinformation on its site by sharing huge amounts of data with the public to allow researchers to flag questionable posts. But reconciling that goal with its privacy policy has proved difficult, and the company is behind schedule on the project.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Facebook is allowing the Trump campaign to post false information about former Vice President Joe Biden, a policy change that came after CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a White House meeting with the president.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iWf3ompV.7YdRLnus0a50w--~B/aD0xMTA2O3c9MTg2MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/7bc57150-eab8-11e9-ad9f-f4605b0dcf54", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
