Photo: Instagram\n\nGina Rodriguez is sorry she recorded a video of herself rapping the N-word and then posted it on Instagram Stories for three hours before deleting it. No, it wasn\u2019t even an Instagram Live slipup. Rodriguez shared a video of herself rapping along to the Fugees song \u201cReady or Not.\u201d Specifically, she nods her head for a bit, then says the Lauryn Hill lyric \u201cN- - - -s give me heebie-jeebies\u201d (the full bar is \u201cFrontin\u2019 n- - - -s give me heebie-jeebies,\u201d but Rodriguez skips the first part, eager to get to the next). The word appears only once in the three-minutes- and-47-seconds-long song, yet it\u2019s the sole focus of the video.\n\nGina Rodriguez is trending on Twitter after rapping the n-word in a now-deleted Instagram story. pic.twitter.com/5MWvkjDu1L \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) October 15, 2019\n\nRodriguez didn\u2019t delete the post for over three hours, then posted a video apologizing just in case it offended anybody. \u201cI just wanted to reach out and apologize,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sorry. I am sorry if I offended anyone by singing along to the Fugees, to a song I love, that I grew up on. I love Lauryn Hill and I really am sorry if I offended you.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mention the word specifically, and she doesn\u2019t directly address black people.\n\nThis video comes a few months after Rodriguez had a similar reaction to being called anti-black earlier in 2019. The Jane the Virgin actress interrupted Yara Shahidi during an interview last year to say the 19-year-old is an inspiration to \u201call women,\u201d not just black women; she incorrectly said Latinas get paid less than black women in the entertainment industry; and she cried when she received pushback, citing her Afro-Latinx extended family. \u201cSo to get anti-black is saying that I\u2019m anti-family,\u201d she said on \u201cSway in the Morning\u201d this January. \u201cMy father is dark-skinned, he\u2019s Afro-Latino \u2026 If anything, the black community is my community.\u201d", "description": "Gina Rodriguez apologizes after she posted a video on Instagram stories rapping the N-word and left it up for hours.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-nina.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
