Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in action during qualifying. Yuri Kochetkov/Pool via Reuters\n\nSOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Formula One champions Mercedes have fired four employees and disciplined three others after an enquiry into racist bullying at the team\u2019s factory, British newspapers reported on Saturday.\n\nThe team of five-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who has Caribbean heritage and has spoken out against racism, confirmed in a statement that four individuals had been dismissed.\n\nIt said that the dismissals on Aug. 2 \u201cfollowed an internal investigation that confirmed breaches of our diversity and equality policy\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this behaviour in the strongest terms and acted immediately upon the complaint. We value the diversity of our employees and it is a source of strength for our team,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe Sun newspaper reported there had been a \u201ccampaign of racist bullying\u201d against a Muslim employee at the team\u2019s Brackley headquarters.\n\nHamilton has spoken out about his experiences of racism, calling in March for more of a stand against it in all walks of life after England soccer players reported abusive chants in a Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.\n\n\u201cI remember being at school and you got a slap on the hand for it (racism) and it is just allowed to slide. That shouldn\u2019t happen anywhere. Action should be taken and we should be a lot stricter with it,\u201d Hamilton said.", "description": "Formula One champions Mercedes have fired four employees and disciplined three others after an enquiry into racist bullying at the team's factory, British newspapers reported on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434950707&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0OB", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
