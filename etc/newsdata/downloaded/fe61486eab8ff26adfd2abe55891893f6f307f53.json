We can all do better.\"\n\nThe duke continued, saying that while \"no one is perfect\", \"we are all responsible for our own individual impact\".\n\n\"The question is what we do to balance it out,\" Prince Harry added.\n\nThe royal cited several of the greatest environmental challenges the world is facing, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, the excessive amount of plastic in the ocean and poaching, problems which he said \"can sometimes seem too big to fix\".\n\nThe Duke of Sussex's speech comes shortly after he and the Duchess of Sussex faced criticism for flying on private jets four times over the course of 11 days during the summer.\n\nThe duke did not directly reference the criticism he and the duchess received during his speech.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
