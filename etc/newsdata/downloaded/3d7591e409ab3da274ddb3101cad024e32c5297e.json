Chief Executive Officer Sean Boyd expects gold prices to continue to strengthen amid global economic uncertainty and deficit spending, and the metal may hit a record US$2,000 an ounce in the next two to three years.\n\n\u201cGovernments focus on running a deficit budget and spending; that loose money approach is good for gold,\u201d Boyd said Thursday in a telephone interview. \u201cYou continue to get good buyer demand from China, India and the biggest buying coming from the central banks since the early 1970s.\u201d\n\nThe Toronto-based miner plans to increase dividends and strengthen its balance sheet with the extra cash flow generated from higher gold prices, while share buybacks aren\u2019t something the company is considering at the moment.\n\nBullion futures have risen 17 per cent this year as trade tensions and faltering global growth increased demand for the metal as a haven.
