It doesn\u2019t work,\u201d marine campaigner Lawrence Chlebeck said in a statement.\n\nDespite tens of millions of visits to the beach in Australia annually, shark attacks remain rare.\n\nThere were 27 attacks in the country\u2019s waters in 2018, according to data compiled by Sydney\u2019s Taronga Zoo.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Tourism operators want aerial shark patrols to be introduced in Australia\u2019s Whitsunday Islands as they try to stem falling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/5e52a4_in-year-shark-attacks-in-waters-australia-whitsunday-islands-latest-australia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
