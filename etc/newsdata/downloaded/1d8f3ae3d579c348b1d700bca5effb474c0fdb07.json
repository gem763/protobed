It was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II, then spent decades under communism. Today it is a member of NATO and the European Union.\n\nHere are five things to know about this central European country of 38 million people:\n\n\u2013 Non-stop growth \u2013\n\nPoland has posted continuous economic growth since the 1989 fall of communism and is currently the seventh biggest economy in the EU, which it joined in 2004.\n\nIt is Europe\u2019s largest producer of poultry, apples, raspberries and potatoes. The country is also an industrial giant, notably thanks to cheap labour. About a third of the EU\u2019s international transport is carried out by Polish firms.\n\nPoland has also made a name for itself in the video game industry, with hits like \u201cThe Witcher,\u201d \u201cDying Light,\u201d and \u201cThis War of Mine.\u201d Next year\u2019s release \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d has already been crowned the \u201cmost wanted game\u201d by gamers around the world.\n\n\u2013 Majority Catholic \u2013\n\nMore than 90 percent of Poles declare themselves Catholic, but only 38 percent attend Sunday mass. The Church is still going strong in rural areas but is losing its appeal in big cities.\n\nClergy sex scandals have recently tainted its image, though the Church still enjoys close ties with the governing conservatives. Both called LGBT rights a threat to the traditional family ahead of the general election.\n\n\u2013 Migration \u2013\n\nThe governing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party rejected the EU\u2019s migrant quotas, but the country has welcomed Ukrainians and other foreign workers.\n\nAfter around two million Poles emigrated to the West after Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 1.2 million Ukrainians came to replace them. The services industry relies heavily on the foreign workforce.\n\nAccording to estimates from an employer\u2019s association, Poland will require a total of five million foreign workers by 2050. Facing a shortage of skilled workers it already surpassed the United States in 2017 as the top temporary labour migration destination, according to the OECD.\n\n\u2013 Jewish history \u2013\n\nPoland was for centuries considered a safe haven for Jews chased out of Western Europe. By 1939, there were 3.3 million of them living in the country, or around 10 percent of the entire Polish population. It was Europe\u2019s largest Jewish community at the time.\n\nBut Poland\u2019s 1,000-year Jewish history was cut short by Nazi Germany. During World War II, six million Poles died, half of them Jews killed in the Holocaust.\n\nOf the few who remained, most emigrated, with the last wave taking place after the communist regime orchestrated an anti-Semitic campaign in 1968.\n\nToday, an estimated 8,000-12,000 Jews live in Poland.\n\n\u2013 Marriage medal \u2013\n\nPoland is likely the world\u2019s only country to give out presidential medals to couples who survive 50 years of marriage.\n\nThe marital medal was introduced in 1960 under Communist rule and is very much a product of its time.\n\nPoland\u2019s communist party leader at the time, Wladyslaw Gomulka, was himself happily married and frowned upon divorce and sexual debauchery.\n\nTens of thousands of marital medals are still given out each year, despite higher divorce rates today.", "description": "Warsaw (AFP) \u2013 Poland, which holds a general election on Sunday, boasts more than 1,000 years of history.
