A full withdrawal could take two weeks or more, although even that could happen faster than expected, one official said.\n\nEsper spoke to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation and Fox News Sunday. Trump\u2019s national security team planned to meet to assess the situation, he said, as the US continued to urge Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to halt his incursion.\n\nAsked if he thought Turkey, a Nato ally, would deliberately attack US troops in Syria, Esper said: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they would or wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe cited an incident on Friday in which a small number of troops fell under artillery fire at an observation post in the north. Esper called that an example of \u201cindiscriminate fire\u201d coming close to Americans, adding it was unclear whether that was an accident.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that US officials believe Turkish forces knew Americans were in the area.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former US envoy to the global coalition against the Islamic State who resigned over Trump\u2019s attempts to withdraw from Syria, told the paper: \u201cTurkey wants us off the entire border region to a depth of 30km [20 miles]. Based on all the facts available, these were warning fires on a known location, not inadvertent rounds.\u201d\n\nOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! Donald Trump\n\nEsper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs the Turkish invasion, which began on Wednesday, was growing more dangerous.\n\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, we learned that they are likely to intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned \u2013 and to the west,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe American troops have been working for five years with a Kurd-led Syrian group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces to combat Islamic State. Turkey has long objected to the US-Kurd alliance because Turkey considers elements of that force to be terrorists tied to an insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nThe US had come to believe the Kurds are attempting to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with the Syrian army and Russia to counter the invading Turks, Esper said. As a result, Trump \u201cdirected that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Syrian state media said units from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d.\n\nIn tweets on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cVery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change \u2026 Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d\n\nEsper said he would not discuss a timeline for the US pullback, but said it would be done \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d. He did not say how many US troops would leave the north, but said they represented most of the troops in Syria.\n\nThe Pentagon had said before the Turkish operation began that the US military would not support it, and the US pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border.\n\nIt gets worse by the hour Mike Esper\n\nEsper said he was aware of reports of hundreds of Isis prisoners escaping as a result of the Turkish invasion and of atrocities being committed against Syrian Kurds by members of a Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militia.\n\n\u201cIt gets worse by the hour,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThese are all the exact things\u201d that US officials warned Erdo\u011fan would probably happen if he ignored US urgings not to invade northern Syria.\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said on Sunday.", "description": "* At least 750 Isis affiliates escape after Turkish shelling  * Opinion: Trump and Erdo\u011fan risk a resurgent Isis In a picture from December 2018, US military vehicles are seen in Syria\u2019s northern city of Manbij.
