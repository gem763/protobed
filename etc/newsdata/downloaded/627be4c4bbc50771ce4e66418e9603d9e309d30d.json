Add Interest\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump is said to have told Zelensky. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile President Trump invoked Biden\u2019s name, it was Zelenskiy who brought Giuliani into the conversation. Trump later said, \u201cRudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy assured Trump that his new prosecutor general \u201cwill look into the situation.\u201d\n\nThe memo released by the White House includes this cautionary language: CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place....\"\n\nWilliam Thomas Cain/Getty Images\n\nThe crux of the debate surrounding Joe Biden\u2019s conduct in Ukraine refers back to the dismissal of the country\u2019s former prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. At the time, Biden was leading U.S. policy toward Ukraine with an emphasis on cracking down on corruption, and called for Shokin to be fired.\n\nGiuliani and Trump have accused Biden of calling for his dismissal because his office was investigating Burisma, where Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had a seat on the board of directors.\n\nBut the assertion that Biden acted to help his son has been undercut by widespread criticism of Shokin from several high-profile international leaders, including members of the European Union and International Monetary Fund, who said Biden's recommendation was well justified.\n\nAngela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats have accused President Trump of using his desire for an investigation into the Bidens as leverage with Zelenskiy, particularly in light of the fact that the White House had, at the time, withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, which was later released.\n\nWhile there is no explicit mention of the withheld aid money during the July 25 phone call, President Trump invoked the country\u2019s financial fortunes after saying \u201cwe will get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour economy is going to get better and better I predict,\u201d Trump told Zelenskiy. \u201cYou have a lot of assets. It\u2019s a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.\u201d\n\nIn another instance, Zelenskiy thanked the president for \u201cgreat support in the area of defense,\u201d adding that Ukraine is \u201cready to continue to cooperate for the next steps, specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d\n\nThe next words from Trump: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d before launching into his grievances with special counsel Robert Mueller, whose testimony just one day earlier was clearly still on his mind.\n\nErin Scott/Reuters\n\n\u201cAs you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nIn response, Zelenskiy offered support, telling Trump, \u201cYes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s July phone call with Zelenskiy set into motion a series of events that included a dramatic step forward in Democrats\u2019 march toward impeachment.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of an official impeachment inquiry after a debate between Congressional Democrats and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence over how to handle a whistleblower complaint reportedly tied to Trump\u2019s overtures to Zelenskiy during the call.\n\nAsked Wednesday about the newly released transcript, Pelosi told ABC News she had not read it, but said the president \u201cwill be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story.
