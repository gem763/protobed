With all of these styles in mind and widening our aperture to several more, we found the best-selling and top-rated ways for you to make coffee at home, conveniently available on Amazon.\n\nKeurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker, $230 on Amazon: Previously launched exclusively at Walmart, Keurig\u2019s latest is a great marriage of the K-Cup universe and the drip brew. Choose your preference and keep the freedom to change your mind indefinitely. The compact and stylish design will help you fit the K-Duo anywhere and a modular water reservoir can attach on either side or in the back, to best adjust to your counter space situation.\n\nMr. Coffee Simple Brew Coffee Maker, $18 on Amazon: No bells. Few whistles. Get a machine that will make it easy to brew coffee and do so for less than $20. Its warming plate is easy to clean and the machine lets you grab a cup while it\u2019s brewing with a special auto-pause capability because mornings sometimes demand that type of urgency.\n\nChemex Classic Series, Pour-over Glass Coffeemaker, $35 on Amazon: You\u2019ve seen this one at your caffeine-obsessed friends\u2019 places and coffeehouse shelves for high prices. Here it is on Amazon with hundreds of high reviews, for a much more affordable price, and delivered for free in two days (for Prime members). Coffee the more old-fashioned way and keep your coffee fresh and delicious for days afterward with Amazon\u2019s top-selling pour-over coffee maker.\n\nNespresso Inissia by De'Longhi Original Espresso Machine, $108 on Amazon: Espresso, black (or silver, if you prefer) and simple. From programmable espresso to single-serve coffee, the machine\u2019s designed to get brewing in less than 30 seconds. The reservoir holds enough water to cycle through nine single serves before requiring a refill, which should carry you through the week.\n\nToddy Cold Brew System, $35 on Amazon: Yes, you can cold brew at home (in many ways) and this highly-rated option allows for hot drip coffee, cold brew, and even tea. The brewing container sits atop an included glass decanter and filters beans into coffee concentrate that\u2019s substantially less acidic than its hot brew cousins. And Toddy promises that it \u201cstays fresh for up to 2 weeks with no change to the flavor.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
