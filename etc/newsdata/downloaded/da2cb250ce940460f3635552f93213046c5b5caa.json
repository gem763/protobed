(Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination next year, on Monday accused him of \u201ctreason\u201d for pressing the leader of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.\n\nWeld\u2019s comments came in response to reports that Trump repeatedly brought up investigating Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, and his younger son, Hunter, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cTalk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,\u201d Weld said during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be clearer, and that\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That\u2019s the only penalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal,\u201d added Weld, who appeared in a joint interview with two other Republicans challenging Trump, former congressmen Mark Sanford (S.C.). and Joe Walsh (Ill.).\n\n[White House press secretary noncommittal about releasing transcript of Trump call with Ukrainian president]\n\nTrump appeared to confirm Sunday as he spoke with reporters that he mentioned Joe and Hunter Biden in the phone call with Zelensky \u2014 though he insisted he has done nothing improper.\n\nTrump has repeatedly raised the specter of impropriety on the part of Biden, whose son Hunter was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe call with Zelensky is part of a whistleblower complaint that the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has been unwilling to turn over to Congress, a refusal that has rankled Democrats and heightened calls for impeaching Trump.\n\nWeld pointed out Monday that the Constitution calls for the removal of presidents for \u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and argued that Trump has now met the most serious threshold.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about bribery any more, although I think he\u2019s committed that,\u201d Weld said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about other high crimes and misdemeanors, although I think he\u2019s committed many. He\u2019s such a lawless man. We\u2019ve got treason, and we don\u2019t have to dribble around the court. We can go right for the hoop.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well past time for this guy \u2026 to be carted off to save us all,\u201d Weld added.", "description": "The former Massachusetts governor, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, pointed to a July phone call with the leader of Ukraine.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nba7vvWjNMj183G177DPR0isbBo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TFPE6JG6AII6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
