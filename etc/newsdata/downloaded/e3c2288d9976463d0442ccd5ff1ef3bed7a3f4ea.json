They even got a surprise ending to the night. USA TODAY\n\nPresident Trump's tweet supporting his former press secretary Sean Spicer last week didn't not languish in vain.\n\nLast week on \"Dancing With the Stars,\" Spicer received what appeared to be a dream boost from his old boss. Despite pressing affairs of state, Trump asked his 66 million followers to vote for \"good guy\" Spicer, who was facing an elimination vote in the fifth week of the dance competition.\n\nHowever, the 'DWTS' judges decided to cancel a planned elimination after a Disney-themed movie night. Whether it was bad luck or part of the \"DWTS\" Deep State, Trump's golden tweet appeared to be for naught.\n\n'DWTS' drama last week: Disney Night brought princess tears, Hannah Brown as Jasmine\n\nSean Spicer gets Trump support: He's 17 pound light on 'Dancing' and alive in the competition\n\nVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nBut a \"DWTS\" spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY that the votes tallied from last week, including those prompted by Trump, will be combined with votes from Monday's episode (ABC, 8 EDT/PDT).\n\nThe combined votes and judges' scores will determine who is spared from elimination.\n\nSpicer and pro partner Lindsay Arnold performed their best dance last Monday, a quick-step. But they are still at the bottom of the leader board, with 19 points out of a possible 30 from the judges. So they will need every viewer vote they can get to continue.\n\nSpicer told USA TODAY that Trump called before tweeting.\n\nSean Spicer has gone neon and ruffles on \"DWTS\" (Photo: ABC)\n\n\"We were catching up. And he said, 'By the way, you're doing great.' \" Spicer said. \"He had seen some clips. He said, 'I'd love to weigh in and support you.' \"\n\nSpicer would give no further details of the presidential conversation, but said it never veered towards some of Spicer's more outlandish dancing outfits.\n\n\"I never divulge the content of the conversations that I have,\" says Spicer. \"But we didn't get into my outfits, thank God.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/21/dancing-stars-trumps-sean-spicer-tweet-not-wasted/4056058002/", "description": "President Trump tweeted support for Sean Spicer last week on \"Dancing With the Stars\" and the vote was cancelled.
