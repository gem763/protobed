Mandatory Credit: Terrence Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrown spent nine years starring for the Pittsburgh Steelers before forcing a trade to the Oakland Raiders, only to be released on Saturday after a series of squabbles with the team.\n\nBrown agreed to a deal with the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots hours later, and made his way to Foxborough, Mass., on Monday.\n\nDuring his weekly interview with Westwood One, Brady said he \u201creally enjoyed being around\u201d Brown, and called him \u201ca very smart football player, knows how to play the game. He\u2019s been extremely productive.\u201d\n\nBrady, who led the Patriots to a 33-3 win over the Steelers on Sunday night, said he wasn\u2019t \u201cbuying into any hype or potential. I\u2019m into work. He\u2019s into work, and our entire offense is into doing what\u2019s in the best interest for the team. I\u2019m really excited to get to practice on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nBrown is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and four-time first-team All-Pro. In 130 games, he has 837 catches for 11,207 yards and 74 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2014, Brown led the NFL with 129 catches and 1,698 yards. He led the league again the next year with 136 catches, although his 1,834 yards barely trailed league-leading Julio Jones\u2019 1,871.\n\nBrown\u2019s 1,533 yards receiving in 2017 was also the best in the NFL.\n\nBrady said he and Brown are \u201cgoing to meet as much as we possibly can. I think that quarterback-receiver relationship is so important. The more you know each other, the more you know what each other\u2019s thinking, the faster you can accelerate the trust and confidence in one another when you get on the field.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and newly signed wide receiver Antonio Brown began their crash course in chemistry building on Monday, and Brady says he came away impressed that Brown \"is into doing what's in the best interest for the team.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428197776&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890A6-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
