And then there is the other side of Cape Town, where murder rates are high and gang violence grips communities.\n\n\u201cThey are holding the community hostage,\" said Abdul Waheem Martin, the leader of an ambulance crew that services the Cape Flats.\n\n\"If you are looking at these areas, every person\u2019s house has got burglar bars on the inside and on the outside \u2013 their homes look like a prison cell. These people are scared.\"\n\nThe South African Apartheid government created the \"Flats,\" as they are commonly known, when it forced non-white South Africans out of large areas of the city center and its suburbs.\n\nThe royal couple will visit some of these areas, where security is such a concern to the organizers that even journalists covering the event won\u2019t know where they are headed until the last minute.\n\nCrime is so endemic here that even ambulance crews were attacked and robbed more than 80 times in 2018. Martin and his team now need police escorts to enter so-called \"red zones\" \u2013 even if it means patients will die because of the wait.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating \u2013 the guys get restless sitting here. Because we know that there is someone that seriously needs our immediate medical attention and unfortunately because of the situation we can\u2019t get to the patient quick enough,\u201d said Martin.\n\nTeenager Naasief died in 2016, shot as he stood outside a store near his home in the township.\n\n\u201cHe was my pillar of strength. He was my blessing,\u201d says his mother, Shannaz.\n\nShannaz and other mothers who have lost sons to violence in the \"Flats\" say the gangs present young kids with an awful choice.\n\n\u201cIn most cases the children don\u2019t want to be in a situation. But they are forced to be in a situation. You get killed or you must go kill,\u201d she said.", "description": "View the latest news and breaking news today for U.S., world, weather, entertainment, politics and health at CNN.com.", "authors": ["Cnn'S David Mckenzie", "Brent Swails"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190819105644-01-harry-meghan-0714-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
