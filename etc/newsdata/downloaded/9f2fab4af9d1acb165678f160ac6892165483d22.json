US President Donald Trump let fly a cryptic tweet announcing \u201csomething very big has just happened!\u201d while multiple sources confirmed to Reuters and other news outlets that the terrorist was indeed taken down.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Something very big has just happened!\u2019 Trump posts cryptic tweet amid reports ISIS leader al-Baghdadi is killed in US raid\n\nAbdi\u2019s Kurdish fighters had long been US allies in the fight against Islamic State. However, Trump took heavy criticism for pulling US troops out of Kurdish-held territory earlier this month. With the US president accused of \u201cabandoning\u201d his allies, Turkish forces moved in to take this territory, until a ceasefire was called last week.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s forces embarked on a blitzkrieg campaign of jihad across the Middle East in 2014, seizing vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, after the militant leader declared himself Caliph of the Islamic State that summer. However, hunted by Syria, the US, Russia, Iran, and the SDF, Baghdadi laid low as his territorial gains were rolled back in recent years, surfacing only once in a video released by the jihadis this April.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
