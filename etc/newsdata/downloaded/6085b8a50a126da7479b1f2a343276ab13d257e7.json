Matthew Botkin told HuffPost. Allen, free on bond, is scheduled to appear in court for arraignment on Oct. 21.\n\nThe women, who are between the ages of 20 and 30 and live in the San Diego region, weren\u2019t seriously hurt in the attack on Sunday. All three were wearing hijabs as they walked in the city\u2019s Little Italy neighborhood when Allen, without provocation, intentionally barged into one of them, police said.\n\nThe situation quickly escalated, with Allen allegedly telling the women to \u201cgo back to their own country,\u201d and slapping and beating them, police said.\n\nAllen fled after the attack, but a witness followed him to his residence and notified police, authorities said. HuffPost was unable to reach Allen for comment.\n\nSan Diego has seen an uptick in hate crimes in recent years that has correlated with state and national trends of anti-Muslim attacks. Earlier this year, a mosque in California was set ablaze in tribute to the New Zealand terrorist attack that killed over 50 Muslims. In August, a woman was arrested on charges she spray-painted anti-Muslim graffiti on the walls of a Muslim-owned business in California.\n\n\u201cWith the emboldening of white supremacists across the country, we\u2019ve seen a rise in hate crimes in San Diego like other parts in the country,\u201d Dustin Craun, executive director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. His group is in touch with the three Muslim-American women victimized in Sunday\u2019s attack.\n\nAnti-Muslim hate crimes have skyrocketed since the election of Donald Trump, according to civil rights groups, and have surpassed crime levels of 2001, when Islamaphobia peaked after the 9/11 attacks.", "description": "Kyle Allen was booked in San Diego on battery and hate crime charges in an assault on three Muslim women.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e2387210000c008acbdb8.jpeg?cache=l2ehzhsjwe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
