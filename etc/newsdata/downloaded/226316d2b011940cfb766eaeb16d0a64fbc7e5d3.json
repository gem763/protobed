(AP) - No. 7 Michigan is facing a team it has been preparing to play since spring practice, when defensive coordinator Don Brown carved out extra time to study a scheme rarely seen in modern college football.\n\nArmy, which runs a triple option, is coming to the Big House to resume a series that has been idle for more than a half-century.\n\n\u201cThey have a unique style on offense which is very, very effective,\u201d Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said. \u201cWe kind of decided to play the game for the challenge of it.\n\n\u201cHistorically, they\u2019re 5-4 ahead of us, so we\u2019d like to even that up.\u201d\n\nArmy won the first five meetings and the Wolverines won the next four with the last matchup coming in 1962.\n\nMichigan is a heavy favorite to even the all-time series, but the Black Knights should have plenty of confidence Saturday after winning set a program-record 11 games last season. They have won 10 straight, trailing only Clemson\u2019s current run, since losing at Oklahoma in overtime.\n\nArmy is facing a top-10 team for a third straight year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we need to play games like that every single week, but to play a game like that each year is really important to this program,\u201d coach Jeff Monken said. \u201cIt certainly is to the guys that play here, but it\u2019s also important to the legacy of the guys who play here to play those kind of games and challenge the very best teams in America.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch:\n\nSEE HOW THEY RUN\n\nArmy averaged more than 300 yards rushing per game last season, trailing only Georgia Tech, and led the nation with 63-plus rushing attempts a game.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fluke.\n\nThe Black Knights led major college football in rushing two years ago and ranked second in 2016.\n\nSenior Kelvin Hopkins ran for 1,017 yards and 17 touchdowns last season. He averaged fewer than eight passes per game, totaling 1,026 yards passing with six touchdowns and three interceptions. Hopkins ran for a touchdown and threw for a score on one of three passes he completed in eight attempts in last week\u2019s 14-7 win against Rice.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing about going into a game like this is just eye discipline and just not being lulled to sleep by their run game,\u201d Michigan cornerback Vincent Gray said. \u201cAnd, knowing they can still break out any type of pass whenever they want to.\u201d\n\nQUITE A COMEBACK\n\nThe Wolverines weren\u2019t sure a month ago when or if cornerback Ambry Thomas would return from a bout with a colitis diagnosis that landed him in the hospital. He was able to practice about a week before the season began and clearly was ready to play, intercepting a pass and recovering a fumble in his first career start.\n\n\u201cEverybody was just thrilled for Ambry,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nGOING FOR IT\n\nArmy led the nation in fourth-down conversions last season, successfully going for it 31 of 36 times. The 86-percent success rate validated Monken\u2019s penchant for gambling when most coaches would choose to punt.\n\n\u201cIf the analytics book says go for it on fourth-and-1, most people wouldn\u2019t do that even if that\u2019s what the book says,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cCoach Monken believes in what we do here and he believes in us as a team. We\u2019ve got to come through on that. More times than not, that\u2019s something we want. We\u2019re begging him to let us go for it. We\u2019ve just got to capitalize.\u201d\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nMichigan might have wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones, left tackle Jon Runyan and defensive lineman Donovan Jeter back after each was held out of the opener with injuries.\n\nArmy fullback Connor Slomka didn\u2019t play in the opener, but he practiced this week to move a step closer to playing at Michigan.\n\n\u201cHaving Connor back is awesome,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cHe does some things you don\u2019t commonly see. He\u2019s very gifted.\u201d\n\nHE SAID IT\n\nMichigan offensive coordinator Josh Gattis called plays for the first time in last week\u2019s 40-21 win over Middle Tennessee and Harbaugh said he was impressed.\n\n\u201cI thought it was really good, practically flawless,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisive in the play-calling. Clear. Clean.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter at www.twitter.com/larrylage\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 7 Michigan is facing a team it has been preparing to play since spring practice, when defensive coordinator Don Brown carved out extra time to study a scheme rarely seen in modern college football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/middle_tennessee_michigan_football_74988_c0-120-2869-1792_s1770x1032.jpg?80611019ed2caa20007b354e68cc03bf9a140e55", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
