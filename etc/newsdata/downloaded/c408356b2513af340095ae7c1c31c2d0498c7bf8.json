Economists had forecast that exports would drop 2.8% while imports would shrink by 6%.\n\nThe weak trade performance underlines the importance of the \u201cPhase One\u201d agreement struck between the US and China last week, as China\u2019s economy suffers from slowing demand both at home and abroad. The slump in imports in particular bodes ill for the domestic economy, and output is expected to have grown at the slowest pace in the third quarter in almost thirty years according to estimates ahead of data due Friday.\n\n\u201cThe key driver definitely is the slowing global economy,\u201d said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. \u201cThe mini deal is good for sure because it is preventing things from getting even worse. But it\u2019s not about making things much better.\u201d\n\nSeptember exports to the US dropped almost 22% and imports declined almost 16% year-on-year, for a surplus of about $26bn.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously the damage done by the trade war,\u201d said Iris Pang, an economist at ING bank NV in Hong Kong. Exports to Vietnam jumped, \u201cwhich I believe could be goods rerouting to Vietnam for some simple processing then to US to avoid tariffs.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s economists say\n\nLooking forward, the \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal does not yet boost China\u2019s trade outlook in a meaningful way. The key element for China is that the tariff hike due this week won\u2019t take place, relieving some downside risks. Even so, the status quo is still painful - tariffs between 15%-25% still cover $360 billion of Chinese shipments to the US.\n\n- Chang Shu, chief Asia economist and David Qu, economist\n\nThe tentative agreement pauses US tariff increases in exchange for increased Chinese purchases of agricultural goods. If that sticks, a boost to confidence may be ahead, though it\u2019s not clear if another round of tariffs due for December will be implemented or not.\n\nThe official Chinese response to the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with the US reached Friday was wary but welcoming, underlining that Beijing has few options but to play along with President Donald Trump if it wants to relieve some of the pressure on its slowing economy.\n\nBefore the deal announced over the weekend, Oxford Economics forecast that the worst is still to come for US-China trade, which has already fallen 20%.\n\n\u201cBilateral trade has already been hit hard and is likely to decline considerably further, especially if tariffs are extended to more goods as threatened,\u201d according to the report before the data from economist Adam Slater.\n\n\u201cThe decline was not entirely due to the trade tension,\u201d said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Hong Kong. \u201cThe tech cycle has not been supportive. I don\u2019t think the phase one deal will change the trade outlook materially.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s exports and imports shrank more than expected in September, as existing US tariffs and the ongoing slowdown in global trade combined to undercut demand.", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8860/0b6db25ad46e4745820d5f921c1d65d4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
