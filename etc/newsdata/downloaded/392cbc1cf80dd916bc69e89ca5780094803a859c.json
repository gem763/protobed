(WEN) .\n\n\"I think that Wendy's is in good shape. I really like them,\" said Cramer, during the \"Lightning Round\" segment of the show.\n\nI suppose you should not analyze charts when you are hungry, but let's check out the charts of WEN.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of WEN, below, we can see that prices have been in an uptrend the past 12 months. Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line as well as the bullish 200-day moving average line. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved higher the past year to confirm the price gains. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero-line in positive territory, but poised to cross to the downside for a take-profits sell signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of WEN, below, we can see that prices have doubled in the past three years. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been strong the past three months and the MACD oscillator is well above the zero line but poised for a crossover and take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of WEN, below, we can see an uptrend with higher lows and higher highs. A price target of $25 is projected.\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders could look to buy WEN on shallow weakness, risking a close below $19.50.; $25 is our price target for now.", "description": "Traders could look to buy WEN on shallow weakness -- $25 is our price target for now....WEN", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Expect Wendy'S To Keep Serving Up Beefy Returns", "Traders Could Look To Buy Wen On Shallow Weakness --", "Is Our Price Target For Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/59ce2b6e-d3d1-11e9-822b-0bac93e14556.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
