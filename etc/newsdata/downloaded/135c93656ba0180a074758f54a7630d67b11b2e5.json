Did you know?\u201d\n\nMs. Rice replied that while \u201cthere\u2019s no reason why I should know,\u201d Mr. Trump probably didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere is a tradition of common courtesy of presidents informing their predecessors of things of significance like this. Since the White House seemingly didn\u2019t feel it necessary to inform the leadership of the intelligence committees on a bipartisan basis, I\u2019m quite confident that they didn\u2019t do the normal protocol with respect to predecessors either.\u201d\n\nBut when Ms. Rice was asked whether the Obama administration had followed that normal protocol and told President George W. Bush about the 2011 attack on Osama bin Laden, she was evasive, saying neither \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe administration \u201ctried to do that \u2014 as a matter of courtesy,\u201d she replied over the questioner.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
