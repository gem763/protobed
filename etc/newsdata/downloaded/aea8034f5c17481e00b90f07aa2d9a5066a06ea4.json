We will have no further comment while that investigation takes place.\"", "description": "The American footballer denies the accusation, saying that any sexual interaction was consensual.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C264/production/_108746794_antoniobrowngetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
