The Bloomberg news agency has already suggested that a planned $1bn flotation by Megvii could be derailed as a consequence.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Hikvision is one of the world's biggest sellers of surveillance camera equipment\n\nBut perhaps most crucially, the blacklisting threatens to cut off the supply of computer chips and other components that Hikvision requires to build its surveillance cameras, and the others need to train their algorithms.\n\nChinese chips\n\nThe US is the undisputed leader in semiconductors.\n\nWhether its CPUs (central processing unit) and GPUs (graphics processing units) from tech giants including Intel and Nvdia, or chips that specialise in AI-related tasks from lesser-known firms such as Ambarella and ON Semiconductor - American firms provide the tech that underpins the Chinese tech firms' progress.\n\nThis dependence has not gone unnoticed.\n\nAt present only 16% of the semiconductors used within China are made in the country, and only half of those by local companies - according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBut the report notes that Beijing aims to boost that figure to 40% by the end of next year, and raise it to 70% by 2025.\n\n\"For decades, building indigenous Chinese chips has been an aspiration of the government,\" Matt Sheehan, author of The Transpacific Experiment - a book about China and the US's tech ties - told the BBC.\n\n\"Moves like the entity lists have turned that aspiration into an imperative for the government, but also potentially a matter of life or death for private Chinese companies.\n\n\"That doesn't mean they'll succeed at it any time soon. This is one of the most complex engineering tasks out there, one that often requires decades of accumulated in-house knowledge and experience.\n\n\"But it does seem that China's own AI chip start-ups will not be short of cash or new orders any time soon.\"\n\nOver recent weeks, first Huawei and then Alibaba unveiled computer server chips specially designed to carry out machine learning tasks at high speed.\n\nImage copyright Huawei Image caption Huawei claims its new AI chip offers \"more computing power\" for machine learning tasks than its rivals\n\nXiaomi has also said it is working on a similar product.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller start-ups have secured funds for other types of AI processors.\n\nBeijing-based Horizon Robotics raised $600m earlier this year to continue working on products destined for self-driving cars.\n\nAnd Cambricon - another tech firm based in the Chinese capital - received $100m from a government-backed body last year, to help fund research on chips for \"intelligent robots\" among other products.\n\nAmerican firms are not standing still, but one Washington-based think tank recently warned that the US should not consider its lead to be unassailable.\n\n\"US firms are also developing specialised AI chips, such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit and Luminous Computing's optical microchip - which uses different colours of light to move data,\" it said in its AI Race report.\n\n\"Nonetheless, China's development of well-funded AI chip start-ups and advancements in chip design indicate it may be able to close at least some of the gap to the United States.\"\n\nIt added that the EU was a \"laggard\" in this field by comparison.\n\nNational security\n\nAll this matters because AI-driven technologies have the potential to make companies more productive, citizens better-educated and healthier - and also armies better equipped to wage wars.\n\n\"China's success in commercial AI and semiconductor markets has direct relevance to China's geopolitical power,\" noted Gregory Allen in a report for the Center for a New American Security.\n\n\"It reduces the ability of the United States government to put diplomatic and economic pressure on China and... it increases the technological capabilities available to China's military and intelligence community.\n\n\"Regarding the latter, essentially all major technology firms in China co-operate extensively with China's military and state security services and are legally required to do so.\"\n\nPutting the brakes on China's AI champions may serve the US's own national security and foreign policy interest in the short term.\n\nBut ultimately, it could spur on the Chinese Communist Party's determination to make its tech industry less dependent on foreign partners, with all the financial and geopolitical consequences that entails.", "description": "The US move to restrict trade with Chinese AI firms could encourage them to be more independent.", "authors": ["Leo Kelion", "Technology Desk Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2386/production/_109149090_eb55b95e-588a-4f93-b653-946025993c8a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
