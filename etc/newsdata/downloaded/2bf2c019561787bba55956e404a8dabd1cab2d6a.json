Mr. Sarlo, a Hungarian Jewish immigrant who arrived in the United States in 1956, has had great professional success as the co-founder of Walden Venture Capital. He lives in an upscale San Francisco neighborhood, in a large house with an unobstructed view of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAnd yet something was always lacking. Mr. Sarlo\u2019s father had disappeared from their Budapest home in 1942. He had been drafted in a forced labor battalion, an experience he did not survive. At age 4, George had told himself that it was because he was \u201ca bad boy\u201d that his father had left that day, early in the morning, without saying goodbye. He believes that he never recovered from that early loss.\n\nMr. Sarlo\u2019s close friend, a doctor, told him about ayahuasca, a psychedelic brew made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, native to the Amazon. Used for centuries in sacred healing traditions throughout Central and South America, ayahuasca is now gaining popularity around the world, featured in recent headlines about the habits of Silicon Valley, though N, N-Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, the active ingredient in an ayahuasca trip, is mostly illegal in the United States (there are a couple of exceptions, under religious exemption). Ayahuasca tourism is thriving, with more and more people happy to fly thousands of miles to take part in weeklong ceremonies in Peruvian jungles, or to seek out more luxurious contexts, like a four-star resort that comes complete with masseuses, pools, and state of the art fitness centers. And, notably, ayahuasca\u2019s increasing popularity knows no age limits: many of those now showing interest are squarely in Mr. Sarlo\u2019s own demographic.", "description": "Some older adults are dabbling in this powerful psychedelic, which is mostly illegal in the United States.", "authors": ["Casey Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/fashion/17ELDERDRUGS1/17ELDERDRUGS1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
