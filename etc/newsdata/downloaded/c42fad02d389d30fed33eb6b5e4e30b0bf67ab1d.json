The Buddhist-majority nation has refused to recognize Rohingya as citizens or even as one of its ethnic groups, rendering them stateless.\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya fled across the border to Bangladesh after Myanmar's military began a harsh counterinsurgency campaign against them in August 2017 in response to an insurgent attack. The campaign, which has been called ethnic cleansing, involved mass rapes, killings and burning of Rohingya homes.\n\nLee said there are nearly 913,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, near the Myanmar border, including thousands who fled before 2017 and about 1,100 who arrived between January and July.\n\nLee said she \"continues to receive reports of beatings and killings and the burning of houses and rice stores.\"\n\nMyanmar's government and military have consistently denied carrying out human rights violations. They say military operations in Myanmar's Rakhine state were justified in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.\n\nLee said the government's conflict with the Arakan Army, a guerrilla force from the Buddhist ethnic group seeking autonomy for Rakhine, is also affecting the remaining Rohingya in northern Rakhine.\n\nIn April, possibly dozens of Rohingya were killed when government helicopters fired on them while they were collecting firewood in south Buthidaung, she said.\n\nThe U.N. says 128,000 Rohingya are languishing in camps in northern Rakhine, which the government says it plans to close. Lee said she's distressed that families living there who are unable to register with the government aren't receiving food.\n\nShe said the government is constructing housing for internally displaced people without lifting restrictions on their movement which means the Rohinga will remain \"effectively detained.\"\n\nWhile the government has presented this as part of the implementation of recommendations by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine headed by the late U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan, Lee said those recommendations called for the Rohingya to be able to move freely and return home. Therefore, she said, it doesn't appear that closure of the camps will improve their lives.\n\nLee urged U.N. member nations to impose sanctions on companies owned by Myanmar's military and to impose sanctions on the six senior military commanders and their family members identified by the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar as being \"most responsible for the serious violations that have occurred since 2011.\"\n\nOn other issues, the special rapporteur raised serious questions about the construction of major hydropower projects in Chin and Rakhine states, and the impact of dams on ethnic minority villages.\n\nShe noted that the independent mission said the government \"is making a concerted effort to fundamentally alter the landscape of northern Rakhine state in the name of development.\"\n\nLee also sharply criticized the government's suspension of mobile internet services on June 21 in parts of Rakhine and Chin to more than a million people, saying the government \"has failed to justify the blanket shutdown as being necessary.\"\n\nShe said the shutdown, in the context of the conflict between the government and the Arakan Army, is impacting a huge population's rights to food, safety, health, education, shelter and livelihood, and \"is likely to amount to collective punishment\" in violation of international law.", "description": "The U.N.'s independent investigator on Myanmar says it's not safe for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh to return because Myanmar has failed to dismantle its \"system of persecution\" of Rohingyas.  \"While this situation persists, it is not safe or", "authors": ["Edith M.
