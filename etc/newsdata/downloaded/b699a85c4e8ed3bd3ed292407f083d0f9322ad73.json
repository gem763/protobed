Lukas (\u201cLullSiSH\u201d or \u201cLull\u201d) was a main-tank for the Angry Titans. Although Team Envy lost to Fusion University in the next and final round, the competition was a success for Elli. He beat his best friend and he won\u2019t let him forget it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe did play each other,\u201d Elli said when asked how to scout Lull. \u201cAnd I just want to reiterate that I won.\u201d\n\nLull\u2019s comeback was weak: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThis is mine and @LullSiSH setup right now.

They will soon move to the United States to compete with the Washington Justice, D.C.\u2019s professional esports team, for the 2020 season in the same way they were recruited and how they have done practically everything else: together.\n\n\u201cWe like this idea that we\u2019re moving towards of having pairs of people that work really well together,\u201d said Aaron \u201cPRE\u201d Heckman, the assistant general manager of the Washington Justice. \u201cIt cleans up a lot of our communication, so players don\u2019t have to be explicit about asking for help or saying what they\u2019re about to do. It leaves more room for the rest of the team to talk.\u201d\n\nThe Justice is a mixed-language roster, so Heckman said clear communication and \u201ceasy English\u201d is an essential skill for its players. Elli and Lull received positive feedback from their new Justice teammates during tryouts and were recognized for the intangible compatibility they had with each other, a trait that makes them especially effective tank players.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think in real life and in tryouts they have a natural synergy that takes a long time to develop,\u201d said Ethan \u201cStratus\u201d Yankel, a Flex DPS player on the Justice. \u201cOr it\u2019s something that is just really special where it clicks between people.\u201d\n\nThe tank positions, which often require the most synergy of any two players, were a natural fit for Elli and Lull.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that I know where ELLIVOTE is without thinking about it,\u201d said Lull. \u201cAny sport we played in school - it could be floor ball or soccer, anything \u2014 I don\u2019t even have to look at the field. I pass the ball and he\u2019s there. It\u2019s just subconscious. It\u2019s the same in gaming. I don\u2019t know where he is, but subconsciously I know already.\u201d\n\nRecruiting longtime friends like Elli and Lull is not yet standard practice across the Overwatch League (OWL), but the 2020 season could serve as a trial for the type of paired structure the Justice is moving toward. Although they were recruited together, Heckman said Elli and Lull were individually qualified to join the roster, and will hopefully add depth and flexibility to the team. He said one of Elli\u2019s biggest strengths is his diverse hero pool, while Lull is a communicative shot-caller.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth players have also had the advantage of competing together in the Contenders Division. They played on the Germany-based Angry Titans for a year before Elli moved to Team Envy, the academy team for the OWL\u2019s Dallas Fuel, last March. Following their faceoff at the Overwatch Contenders Atlantic Showdown, Lull made a temporary transition to Team Envy, rejoining Elli, before the two were picked up by the Justice in July.\n\n\u201cIt was actually super random from our point of view,\" said Lull of their recruitment to the OWL. \"Because we didn\u2019t have any connection [to the team] or hadn\u2019t talked with any of their players before. One day we just got a message from our general manger in Discord that they wanted to try us both out as a duo.\u201d\n\nThe move wasn\u2019t so random for the Justice, which had been scouting compatible players from the OWL and Contenders Division in attempt to recover from a shaky start to its first season. It took a single four-hour tryout for the team to confirm that Lull and Elli were a fit.\n\n\u201cWe know they perform well [in front of big crowds], which is something you really can\u2019t take for granted\u201a\u201d Heckman said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to slot in very quickly and very easily. They\u2019re kind of the poster-children for what the Contenders Division provides to the league in terms of getting players ready for being at this level.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce the two players make the move to the team\u2019s D.C. housing, they said they will take up their usual living arrangements as roommates, with Elli being messier and Lull being the \u201cmaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had an ongoing joke on the Angry Titans,\u201d Elli said. \u201cLull would always be late for practices because he was doing his dishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my dishes,\u201d Lull said. \u201cI had to keep the entire kitchen clean for everyone basically.\u201d\n\nThe teasing only serves to motivate Lull, who is just as competitive as Elli. Both players agreed that their competitiveness and ability to stay positive keeps them from tilting, or playing sloppy, during matches.\n\n\u201cEven if we lose very hard, we still give it a hundred percent,\u201d said Elli. \u201cWe don\u2019t blame anyone but ourselves.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe pair will continue to be tested on the world stage, with their next major tournament coming when they compete with Sweden\u2019s Overwatch World Cup team this weekend at Blizzcon in Anaheim. Maintaining this attitude will be important at the next level, in which the competition will be a far cry from their days of playing soccer or gaming with their grade school friends, but the pair knows this. They said there are still a lot of firsts to go, but at least they won\u2019t be facing them alone.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Professional gamers Lukas Wiklund and Elliot Vaneryd enter the OWL as part of the Washington Justice.
