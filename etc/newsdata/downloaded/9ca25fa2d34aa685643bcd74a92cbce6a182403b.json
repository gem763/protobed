He is just doing one thing at a time.\n\n'The man only has one role and that is going to work.'\n\nMs Bey said it's unfair to expect women to spend on their partners when they already shell out significant sums to maintain their appearance and wardrobe\n\n'And then after work, he eats his food that his woman has cooked for him, or he goes and does things while the woman is doing everything that she's obliged to do.\n\n'So for this reason, ladies, society is very unfair towards women. I do not call this fair feminism at all.\n\n'That's why I'm a traditional feminist, because I know that back in the day, although there was a lot of things that were not in favour of women, the man was the provider and the woman didn't have to stress about working or not.'\n\nViewers overwhelmingly agreed with Ms Bey, with one woman declaring that too many men are spoiled by modern society.\n\n'This is so true, men are so spoiled thinking that a woman is going to do everything for them, and pay half, while still carrying a lot on her shoulders,' one woman wrote.\n\n'If you want to be equal with me then you better be ready to do half the chores, if not than you either provide and I take care, or this relationship is not working out.'\n\nMs Bey sees herself as a traditional feminist and longs for a return to historic gender roles where men were the sole breadwinners\n\nAnother said it's unfair that women are expected to do it all while continuing to fight for equal pay.\n\n'Women have to do it all: cooking, cleaning, working, taking care of the children, taking care of herself and staying desirable for her husband, giving him attention and affection, and we are also not even paid equally,' she said.\n\n'Men have responsibilities too, but nowadays women are asked to do it all and be superwomen! What happens then? Their health goes down. It is logical to ask a man to be the provider - it is biological.'\n\nMs Bey's opinion received resounding support on social media, with a string of YouTube viewers echoing her calls for a return to traditional gender roles\n\nIt's not the first time Ms Bey has aired her views on modern feminism and paying her way.\n\nIn an Instagram post from October 2018, the outspoken etiquette expert vented her frustration at today's 'controlling society' which she believes frames her as a gold digger.\n\n'I have a multitude of women behind me, I speak on their behalf,' she wrote.\n\n'We are a community of women who are tired of being labelled in a particular way.\n\n'We are tired of being made to feel ashamed for who are and the choices we make.\n\n'Let us live the life and lifestyle we want. We are not hurting anyone, so why does it bother you so much?\n\n'I won't shut my mouth on this topic because I refuse [to let] society control me. I won't allow them to shut me up, shame me into a corner because of being afraid of getting the gold digger label.\n\n'I do this for feminism and I do it for my community. We are tired of this modern day witch hunt. Time to fight back!'", "description": "London-based matchmaker Anna Bey, 33, teaches women how to 'bag a billionaire', but her latest installment has ruffled feathers after she revealed why she never pays for a man on a date.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19375756-0-image-a-6_1570406213023.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
