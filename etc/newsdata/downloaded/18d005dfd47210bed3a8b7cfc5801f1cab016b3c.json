It\u2019s a complicated mess of a story made even worse by politicians getting out ahead of their skis to declare conviction or vindication, and even worse yet by news outlets seemingly determined to screw up the story. Over the past week, the goalposts have shifted so often that the Ukraine-Gate story resembles the late Al Davis\u2019 long-range business plans.\n\nThe media and some Democrats spent nearly a week breathlessly reporting that Donald Trump demanded explicit quid pro quos several times in in conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky. After the White House released the transcript, it became clear that there were no explicit quid pro quos in the conversation (although there was plenty to criticize otherwise). Still, CNN tried to construct one by using an ellipsis that removed more than 500 words between Trump saying \u201cI would like you to do us a favor\u201d and the first mention of the Bidens:\n\nCNN in this clip excises 540 words in between \"I would like you to do us a favor\" and his mention of Biden's son \"https://t.co/AdGrerPH2g \u2014 Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) September 25, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just CNN wielding ellipses either, Alex Griswold discovered:\n\nThe highlighted ellipsis in this NPR story represents 526 words https://t.co/8nPQT2gfuA pic.twitter.com/PX2f1Opz16 \u2014 Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) September 25, 2019\n\nAs anyone who read the widely available transcript knows, the \u201cfavor\u201d comment referred to Ukraine\u2019s cooperation in an investigation into the Russiagate investigation. That might not have been a very smart thing to ask as a \u201cfavor\u201d in the middle of Zelensky\u2019s discussion about defense needs either, but it had nothing to do with the allegation that Trump demanded a quid pro quo for aid by digging up dirt on the Bidens.\n\nSince the media couldn\u2019t find an explicit quid pro quo in the transcript, they began moving goalposts to produce one elsewhere. ABC News was certain they\u2019d found it with a former Zelensky aide named Serhiy Leshchenko, who asserted that the real quid pro quo was a demand to discuss the Bidens as a prerequisite for Trump\u2019s congratulatory call:\n\nWhen Ukrainians voted to elect comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy as their next president in the spring of 2019, the fledgling administration was eager to coordinate a phone call with Kyiv\u2019s most important benefactor \u2014 the United States, according to a former adviser to Zelenskiy. But after weeks of discussions with American officials, Ukrainian officials came to recognize a precondition to any executive correspondence, the former adviser said. \u201cIt was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,\u201d said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, who had been a former adviser to Zelenskiy but has recently been distanced from the administration. \u201cThis issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.\u201d\n\nWhen ABC first ran this story, they identified Leschenko as a current adviser. That turned out to be wrong, as other reporters quickly noted; Zelensky had let Leschenko go well before the July 25th call in question. That prompted this major correction from ABC:\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Serhiy Leshchenko as a current advisor to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Leshchenko advised Zelenskiy\u2019s transition team following his election in April but has since been distanced by the administration. He is no longer advising Zelenskiy.\n\nEr \u2026 how difficult would it have been to verify that before running the story in the first place? About as difficult as it would have been to ask Leshchenko where he heard this. Via Twitchy, both the BBC and Politico\u2019s European beat reporters found out that the ABC story was nonsense:\n\nSetting record straight: @Leshchenkos confirmed to me what those of us in Kyiv already knew\u2014he is NOT currently an advisor to Ukraine's Zelenskiy & wasn't at time of July 25 call. He said he DID NOT tell ABC insistence for leaders to discuss Biden probe was precondition for call. https://t.co/fNh5sMYj9i \u2014 Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) September 26, 2019\n\nLeshchenko is no longer a Zelensky adviser or Ukrainian official. Rudy Giuliani forced him out of the presidents inner circle.\n\nI spoke to him yesterday \u2013 he said something similar re \u201cquid pro quo\u201d but said he\u2019d learnt it only from media reports. https://t.co/N6rzVPjmRX \u2014 Jonah Fisher (@JonahFisherBBC) September 26, 2019\n\nLeshchenko heard it from media reports, and the media reported what Leshchenko heard from the media. Maybe they should just get a room and leave the rest of us out of it.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible that Trump committed some violation worthy of impeachment in regard to Ukraine. The Senate and House will take a serious look at the whistleblower complaint to see whether it has any merit and whether the facts line up with it. Until it gets made public, however, I would advise everyone to keep an open mind and not trust any unsourced or anonymously sourced analyses of what it says or means, not by partisans in Congress from either party, and certainly not from the American media. They are doing not just a terrible job but a dishonest job in covering Ukraine-Gate and simply can\u2019t be trusted to tell the truth in this case. Each morning I wake up and wonder, \u201cWhere will the goalposts be today?\u201d", "description": "Ellipses.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/goalposts.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
