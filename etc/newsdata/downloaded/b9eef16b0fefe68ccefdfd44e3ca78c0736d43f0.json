Rarely do my sartorial choices negatively affect others \u2014 but this one did. On my subway commute, snug between two women in black peacoats, I realized that their sleeves were turning white and sheepy. Mortified, I fled the train a stop early.\n\nLater that day, on the recommendation of my sweater-aficionado roommate, I ordered the Conair Battery Operated Fabric Defuzzer. The de-fuzzer, in both use and look, is a strange blow-dryer\u2013razor hybrid. Its head hides a whirring razor, which shaves the pills straight off your sweater. It has a sturdy \u2018easy grip\u2019 handle, and a detachable \u2018fuzz collector\u2019 compartment that slides out easily and which gives me a sort of grim cleaning-behind-my-nails satisfaction when I dispose of the pilly buildup. It is gentle, which means that the de-fuzzing is often slow going but which also means that I trust it on my oldest, most beloved \u2014 and most pilly \u2014pink cashmere sweater. But best of all, it really works. I no longer pick pills from my sweaters and inadvertently create holes. I get to go to the dry cleaners far less often. And I can sit on the train without feeling like a long-haired dog.", "description": "One writer, with a penchant for wearing winter sweaters that shed, writes about the Conair Battery Operated Fabric Defuzzer, which is the only fabric shaver she use on her favourite cashmere and wool sweaters.", "authors": ["Katy Schneider"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/03/03-conair-sweater-depiller-4.w1200.h630.jpg"}
