But, he continued, they were unaware that Sacoolas would even be in the building.\n\n\u201cIt was the President\u2019s intention for Harry\u2019s family to meet Mrs Sacoolas in the Oval Office in front of several photographers in what [was] obviously designed to be a press call,\u201d Seiger said.\n\nThe Dunns declined the meeting with Sacoolas. Seiger went on to reiterate that while the Dunn family wished to see a political and diplomatic solution to their dispute, \u201cand need one to happen quickly for the sake of their health,\u201d they hope to meet with Sacoolas \u201cone day in the future but in a neutral and appropriately controlled environment.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Wednesday, the Dunns admitted to feeling \u201ca bit [of] pressure\u201d from Trump, noting that \"he did ask two or three times\u201d but \u201cwe stuck to our guns.\"\n\nSeiger ripped the White House \u2014 singling out new national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien in particular \u2014 for the ham-fisted attempt at mediation.\n\n\u201cIt struck us that this meeting was hastily arranged by nincompoops on the run and in particular Mr O\u2019Brien who appeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well in this meeting which required careful handling and sensitivity,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Dunns said that they were shocked at the offer, they also expressed compassion for how Sacoolas was handling the situation.\n\n\"To be thrown into a room together with no prior warning, that's not good for her mental health, it's certainly not good for ours. You know, none of us know how we were going to react to have that sprung on us,\" Charlotte Charles said.\n\nSeiger did praise Trump\u2019s attention to the issue, saying that Trump offered his condolences to the Dunns, and that they were \u201cwarmly received.\u201d And he added that it appeared Charlotte Dunn\u2019s emotional appeal had prompted Trump to reconsider his approach to solving their \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nOn CBS, Charlotte Charles detailed her interaction with the president.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the meeting, we all shook hands, and I ended up at the back of our little family queue and President Trump actually grabbed hold of my hand. So I squeezed it tight, and I just said to him, 'Please, you know, just do the right thing. You know, if you had a son, you'd be doing the same. You've said that,'\u201d she said. Trump responded in the affirmative, telling her \u201cI absolutely would,\u201d she added.\n\nTrump has publicly remained ambivalent on the situation. Last week, he said he was \u201ctrying to work something out\u201d regarding Sacoolas, and he\u2019s personally been lobbied by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the issue. At a White House event last week the president told reporters he was confident both sides could reach a solution.\n\nStill, he called the case \u201ccomplex\u201d and told reporters that he hated the conundrum. He added that he would speak to Sacoolas herself and \u201csee what we can come up with so that there can be some healing. There\u2019s tremendous anger over it. It\u2019s a terrible incident. There\u2019s tremendous anger, and I understand the anger from the other side very much.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, Trump did not comment on the Dunns' reaction to the meeting, but described it as \"beautiful in a certain way.\"\n\nThe president appeared to suggest that his British counterpart asked him to set the meeting up, but Trump said that when he offered to bring Sacoolas into the room, \"They weren't ready for it.\"\n\n\"They did not want to meet with the person in question, but we had a very good meeting,\" he said, adding that \"it was very sad, to be honest. They lost their son.\"\n\nAt the same time, as he has before when discussing the Dunns' case, Trump appeared to deflect some blame from Sacoolas, arguing that Americans driving in the U.K. are prone to confusion over reversed traffic lanes.\n\n\"You go to Europe and the roads are opposite. It's very tough if you are from the United States,\" he said. \"The roads are opposite. She said that's what happened. It happens to a lot of people, by the way.\"\n\nAsked whether he'd known if the Dunns had expressed interest in meeting Sacoolas, Trump replied that he'd guessed so. \"I thought they were, based on what I saw they wanted to meet. but now they say only want to meet if they were in the U.K.,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham confirmed that Tuesday's meeting was arranged at the request of the British prime minister, adding that Trump's \"intent was to do all he could to comfort the victims of a tragic accident.\"\n\nAn attorney for Sacoolas told CBS News her client, too, was unaware she would potentially be meeting the Dunns when she was invited to the White House on Tuesday.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/97/1cf00f07433c96211d8abff24b4f/191016-dunns-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
