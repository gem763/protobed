The fact that Mr Zuckerberg (or his minders) chose that phrase reveals a shocking lack of historical perspective.\n\nThat would not make them unique in Silicon Valley. The line reminded me of a \u201cfireside chat\u201d that former Google chairman Eric Schmidt gave in Davos back in 2014, in which he laid out the future as he saw it.\n\nMassive technology-related job destruction would require more people to become more entrepreneurial, he predicted. When asked about whether Big Tech companies should pay higher tax rates to help out with that whole \u201cdisruption\u201d thing, Mr Schmidt said he thought that would squelch innovation.\n\nI guess neither Franklin Roosevelt nor his New Deal had come to mind as the marketing material for the \u201cfireside chat\u201d was being written. In California, it is the future that matters, not the past.\n\nBut back to Mr Zuckerberg. It is, of course, absurd to posit that a company with a half-trillion dollar market capitalisation in any way represents the counterculture.\n\nBut it is also untrue for both Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to suggest they simply couldn\u2019t have imagined how big and powerful Facebook would get, and how much control it would wield over consumers, companies, and even countries.\n\nTo imagine it, all you have to do is go back and read the original paper on search written by the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google was the first company to practise surveillance capitalism at scale, creating the targeted advertising business model.\n\nThe founders had initially viewed tracking people\u2019s behaviour and selling the information to advertisers as anathema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they wrote back in 1998, \u201cwe expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers. Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search-engine bias is particularly insidious\u201d.\n\nWhat that means is that the targeted ad-based business model that has enriched both Google and Facebook, as well as many other platforms, is uniquely vulnerable to misuse. It is a fact that could not have escaped the leadership at Facebook, particularly Ms Sandberg, who actually helped perfect the Google ad model before moving to Facebook.\n\nNo wonder Facebook does not want to do more vetting of political advertising. Surely, once there is more transparency, even more areas of concern would begin to appear.\n\nIt is not surprising to me that Mr Page and Mr Brin, in that same 1998 paper, said they believed: \u201cThe issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.\u201d\n\nThat seems close to an admission that the largest technology platforms in areas like search, social media and ecommerce are, in fact, like public utilities \u2014 networks that are as essential as water, heat, or electricity \u2014 and should be regulated as such.\n\nGiven all this, it is stunning that Mr Zuckerberg continues to push ahead with plans for Libra, a private payment system. I\u2019ve argued that faster cross-border digital currency flows may be counterproductive to financial stability at this particular moment, as they could encourage hot money flows.\n\nBut the most galling point of the Capitol Hill testimony was when Mr Zuckerberg told Congress that if the US didn\u2019t roll out a plan like Libra, China would \u201cmove quickly to launch similar ideas\u201d. The notion that Facebook is not only a patriotic defender of US free speech, but a protector of its competitive place in the world is too much to take.\n\nFacebook is a giant advertising company that would love to be in the Chinese market itself. It has, in its short life, done more harm than good.\n\nEvery time Mr Zuckerberg appears in public, it becomes more obvious that his company will need to be curbed by regulation. In the EU, internet users now have a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. I bet some Facebook investors wish they could press the delete button on Mr Zuckerberg.\n\nrana.foroohar@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "It is, of course, absurd to posit that a company with a half-trillion dollar market capitalisation in any way represents the counterculture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.203%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_69/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9f3ab86d85b3615d6c55cccda218b8cb1c61ec27", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
