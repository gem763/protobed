Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York will be formally endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the 2020 Democratic nomination, The Washington Post and NBC News reported on Tuesday.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's endorsement is a huge boon for the campaign. Democratic primary voters polled by Insider in July said they value her 2020 endorsement the most out of all non ex-Democratic presidents.\n\nAs part of our recurring 2020 primary polling with SurveyMonkey Audience, Insider polled 1,105 respondents from July 9 to July 10. Of those, 421 said they would likely participate in their state's Democratic primary or caucus.\n\nInsider asked those respondents: \"Setting aside those already running for the presidency, which of the following figures' endorsement would you most value when it comes to the Democratic primary?\" allowing respondents to select up to five figures.\n\n70% of respondents said they valued former President Barack Obama's endorsement.\n\n28% valued former President Bill Clinton's endorsement.\n\n27% valued former President Jimmy Carter's endorsement.\n\n25% valued Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement.\n\n24% valued former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's endorsement.\n\n22% valued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's endorsement.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's performance is well within the margin of error in this case, meaning that it's entirely possible among the total population of Democratic primary voters that Pelosi and Clinton are more highly prized, and it's also entirely possible the freshman congresswoman from New York's support means more than Presidents Carter or Clinton. The takeaway is that this is now the company she keeps.\n\nRead more: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorses Bernie Sanders for president\n\nOther high performers among those asked include philanthropist and billionaire Bill Gates (23%) and climate activist and former Vice President Al Gore (24%). There was then a considerable drop off, but other valued endorsements included:\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry (13%)\n\nStacey Abrams, who was the Democratic nominee in a tough Georgia gubernatorial election (12%)\n\nFormer Ambassador and National Security Advisor Susan Rice (8%)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (7%)\n\nAlthough Ocasio-Cortez's support is valued in league with presidents and former presidential nominees, she's also handily surpassing fellow members of Congress and fellow New Yorkers with decades more political experience.\n\nNew Yorker and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein both notched 7%.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pulled in 5%.\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, Rep. Steny Hoyer and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who all hold leadership positions within Congress, each fail to surpass 2%.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is set to endorse Sanders on October 19. Screenshot via Face The Nation/CBS\n\nProgressive Senators courted Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement for months\n\nWhile former presidents and House Speakers typically don't weigh in to take sides in partisan primaries, a number of senators running for president clamored for the opportunity to collaborate with Ocasio-Cortez on legislation to bolster their credentials among progressives.\n\nCNN further reported that two other highly prominent freshman congresswomen Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan also plan to endorse Sanders. Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts all make a high-profile progressive group known as \"The Squad.\"\n\nIn July, Ocasio-Cortez indicated that her endorsement would come down to either Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren in an interview with CNN.\n\n\"What I would like to see in a presidential candidate is one that has a coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,\" she told CNN's Ryan Nobles in May. \"I think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez has partnered with Sanders, who she affectionately nicknames \"t\u00edo\" or Uncle Bernie, on climate issues, holding town halls to promote her Green New Deal resolution and more recently, partnering on legislation to cap credit card interest rates and drawing up a resolution to declare a national emergency over climate change.\n\nRead more: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got 2020 Democrats talking about climate change, but their plans to address it diverge wildly\n\nIn April, Ocasio-Cortez had lunch in DC with Warren, with the two later teaming up to shoot a video sharply criticizing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin over his role in the demise of department store Sears \u2014 and joked about their disappointment over the series finale of \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nOn July 10, Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 who has faced scrutiny over her record on criminal justice \u2014 announced that she and Ocasio-Cortez were collaborating on legislation to allow Americans with criminal records to apply for government-subsidized housing, and eliminate the so-called \"no-fault eviction\" rule, which allows the government to evict entire families if someone in the unit, including guests, commits a crime.\n\nWarren also wrote a blurb about Ocasio-Cortez for TIME Magazine, which named the young lawmaker as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019.\n\n\"A year ago, she was taking orders across a bar,\" Warren wrote. \"Today, millions are taking cues from her... she reminds all of us that even while greed and corruption slow our progress...in our democracy, true power still rests with the people.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nBernie Sanders is running for president in 2020.
