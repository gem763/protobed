As we've said since the moment he was fired, his abuses should never have happened,' wrote Oppenheim at the start of the memo, which was obtained by DailyMail.com.\n\n'Ronan Farrow's book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie \u2013 alleging we were a \"company with a lot of secrets.\"'\n\nHe then added: 'We have no secrets and nothing to hide.'\n\nOppenheim told staff that 'Farrow\u2019s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind. It is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies.'\n\nFarrow responded to this memo in an interview on Monday with CBS This Morning, saying: 'Look, this book is an extraordinarily meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting. One of the senior fact-checkers did it and I think people have seen it for what it is.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHe said, he said: NBC News president Noah Oppenheim (left) took aim at Ronan Farrow (right with Rose McGowan) and the 'lies' he made about the network in his new 'smear' book Catch and Kill\n\nDiscredit: Oppenheim states that Farrow never had Rose McGowan admitting she was raped by Harvey Weinstein or identifying him as her attacker in his interview (transcript above)\n\nOppenehim then went on to 'fact check' a number of the claims made by Farrow in the book and during recent interviews, including his claim that he had a number of women ready to go on the record and say that they were assaulted by Harvey Weinstein.\n\nA transcript of Farrow's interview with Rose McGowan shows that the actress never stated that she was raped by Weinstein or identify the disgraced mogul as her attacker.\n\nThe memo also noted that McGowan later revoked her consent for NBC to air any part of the interview.\n\nOppenheim pointed out that the none of the seven women who Farrow did get to speak on the record about Weinstein in his New Yorker piece - Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Lucia Evans, Emma de Caunes, Jessica Barth, and Sophie Dix - was included in his reporting while at NBC.\n\nFarrow responded to this memo in an interview on Monday with CBS This Morning, saying: 'Look, this book is an extraordinarily meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting. One of the senior fact-checkers did it and I think people have seen it for what it is'\n\nThere is also a timeline that reveals NBC had initially hoped to have the story ready to air by February of 2017, to coincide with the Academy Awards.\n\nThat date was ultimately not feasible, and a month later Farrow took a hiatus according to the memo, abandoning his reporting for four months while he worked on his book War on Peace.\n\nFarrow was away from April until July, during which time he 'periodically checks in with his NBC News editors'.\n\nOppenheim said that Farrow was later upset that he would be scooped by The New York Times on the story despite taking that extended break.\n\nCatch and Kill hits bookshelves on Tuesday\n\nHe ultimately was, and in multiple interviews Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor have revealed that they spent the entire summer working to put their story together ahead of its publication.\n\nOppenehim suggested Farrow was lying as well in an interview with Ken Auletta, the New Yorker reporter who had tried to publish a piece in 2002 detailing allegations against Weinstein.\n\n'I mean, unlike me, you have real evidence. You have people who are gonna come forward, and if you have the names and people willing to come forward by name \u2013 a lawyer should step aside, and applaud, and just say, \"You've done your job,\"' said Auletta to Farrow in an NBC interview.\n\nAuletta later spoke about the interview with ReCorde, stating: 'He comes out, does a three-hour interview with me, he tells me in the course of that interview as I remember, \"I have eight women, three of them on camera, accusing Harvey and five of them off camera. So I had eight women and I have the police tape of Harvey grabbing the breast of the Italian model.\" I said, \"oh my god, that\u2019s unbelievable.\"'\n\nThat was not the case at all though according to Oppenheim, who noted that 'there was not a single victim of \u2013 or witness to \u2013 misconduct by Weinstein who was willing to be identified.'\n\nHe went on to say: 'The only victim willing to be interviewed on camera and name Weinstein was a woman who spoke anonymously in shadow and alleged he subjected her to verbal sexual harassment.'\n\nThe only other person Farrow had on tape, said Oppenheim, was Auletta.\n\nIt was Auletta who then pitched Farrow's story to New Yorker editor Dave Remnick, who agreed to work with the reporter when NBC decided that the piece was not ready to air.\n\nThere is also a good deal of the memo devoted to Farrow's reporting on Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.\n\nFarrow 'neglects to point out that she had already publicly accused Weinstein of groping her in 2015 and it had already been widely reported,' Oppenheim told staff.\n\nHe then added that the model also 'declined NBC News\u2019 request for an interview as Farrow said she continued to be bound by her settlement with Weinstein.'\n\nAs for the 'bombshell' recording of her and Weinstein that was made after the alleged groping when the two met at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, it was' 'the same recording the NY DA\u2019s office deemed insufficient to press charges, and NBC News still had not heard it in its entirety,' explained the memo.\n\nOppenheim then made an point of noting that the New Yorker did not run that story until a month after the initial exposes broke in the magazine and The New York Times.\n\n'Did the tape establish the story we were all seeking \u2013 that Harvey was a sexual serial predator?' asked Oppenheim\n\n'We concluded the same thing the New Yorker apparently did (because they didn\u2019t report on the tape until it appeared in Farrow\u2019s story 53 days later alongside on-the-record victims) which was that the tape was best used to support that larger claim, alongside on-the-record accounts from at least one victim or witness, which we never got.'\n\nOppenheim also went into the allegations that Farrow made about Matt Lauer, and the suggestion that the Today anchor's sexual misconduct was somehow leveraged by Weinstein to kill any reporting about the mogul. Weinstein is pictured above in August\n\nThat being said, Farrow had seen a settlement agreement between Weinstein and the model, which provided definitive proof of the mogul's predatory behavior with at least one woman.\n\nOppenheim said that 'in order to protect his source he was unable to name Gutierrez as the party to the agreement' and that 'the agreement included an affidavit stating that the acts he referred to in the recording never happened.'\n\nThis fact certainly bolstered Farrow's case against the network, since a signed legal document would be incredibly difficult for Weinstein to spin and almost impossible for him to dispute.\n\nOppenheim also went into the allegations that Farrow made about Matt Lauer, and the suggestion that the Today anchor's sexual misconduct was somehow leveraged by Weinstein to kill any reporting about the mogul.\n\nRonan Farrow's book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie \u2013 alleging we were a \"company with a lot of secrets\". We have no secrets and nothing to hide NBC News president Noah Oppenheim\n\n'Now that we\u2019ve read Farrow\u2019s book, it\u2019s clear \u2013 his smear rests on the allegation that NBC\u2019s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017,' Oppenheim told staff.\n\n'Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory - that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer.'\n\nThe NBC news president then presented what a team of internal investigators discovered after conducting a probe of the network in the wake of Lauer's termination.\n\nThese findings have been dismissed by some who believe NBC should have hired a team of external investigators to look into the company as opposed to individuals already on the payroll.\n\n'Farrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer\u2019s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them,' wrote Oppenheim.\n\n'Not only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny.'\n\nHe then went on to address each individual claim, and prefaced them by stating: 'Kim Harris and the NBCU Legal Team have reviewed both the book and the referenced agreements and I\u2019d like to share their analysis.\n\n'The only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine.'\n\nFirst was the woman who Farrow said 'disclosed her allegation to Ann Curry in 2010, and asked her not to share it'.\n\nOppenheim claims that 'by her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer\u2019s \"problem\" regarded any specific workplace misconduct.'\n\nHe then stated: 'NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this. At the time of the employee\u2019s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer.'\n\nCurry had however made it clear she said there was something amiss, and there is no mention by Oppenheim if this was ever investigated by the network or if the internal probe looked in the steps taken by producers after Curry relayed whatever information she did share at the time.\n\nNext up was an 'on-air personality' who 'received inappropriate messages from Lauer, and showed them to \"colleagues\" in 2012 prior to her departure from the network.\n\nThat women 'made no report' and 'signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract' wrote Oppenheim.\n\nIt is noted however that there was 'no evidence' of a report, so it is again unclear if this was relayed to producers at the time who chose not to address the allegation.\n\nLook, this book is an extraordinarily meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting. One of the senior fact-checkers did it and I think people have seen it for what it is Ronan Farrow\n\nFinally, there is the 'senior member of the Today show team' who walked out with a 'seven figure payout' in 2017 and said that she had 'mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment' to a 'senior producer.'\n\nOppenheim responded to this claim by stating that the network's 'records indicate only one exit that matches this description and we can state unequivocally that no claims related to Lauer or sexual harassment of any kind were raised in that process.'\n\nThe memo frames a number of the claims made by Farrow in a different light as well, including the 15 calls between Weinstein, Oppenheim, NBC News chairman Andy Lack and MSNBC president Phil Griffin.\n\n'Intentionally omitted \u2013 of those calls, only one was to Oppenheim, one was answered by Lack, and thirteen were to Griffin,' revealed Oppenheim.\n\nThe memo then detailed Lack and Oppenheim's calls with Weinstein.\n\n'Lack, completely unaware of Farrow\u2019s work when reached by Weinstein, told him that. The only call with Oppenheim took place in August,' said the memo.\n\n'In it, Weinstein ranted about Rose McGowan\u2019s credibility and was told, again, only that he\u2019d be given the chance to comment when we had a story ready for air.'\n\nNot mentioned in this account is that Weinstein had sent over a bottle of vodka, reportedly to congratulate the network ahead of Megyn Kelly's debut, and that the story was dropped by the network shortly after this conversation.\n\nThere is also a portion of the memo devoted to a claim made by in a recent Vanity Fair story by Rich McHugh, who worked with Farrow on the story at NBC.\n\n'McHugh writes in Vanity Fair that he was called into Rich Greenberg\u2019s office on August 18 2017 and told to \"stand down,\"' read the memo.\n\n'He intentionally omits the fact that one day prior, on August 17, Farrow had asked to take his reporting to a national magazine that he claimed was ready to publish immediately and NBC had agreed to that. McHugh was told to stand down because Farrow had chosen to leave the previous day.'\n\nFarrow spoke about his NBC colleagues in his interview on Monday with CBS This Morning.\n\n'There's been an outpouring of support from journalists and sources saying they, too, have stories,' said Farrow.\n\n'That's very common. All of this is honestly very common with these kind of investigative stories.'\n\nThings then turned slightly uncomfortable when he added: 'When I reported those stories about CBS that you mentioned, similar campaign to undercut the reporting that revved up, and similar support that ultimately carried the day.'\n\nFarrow was later asked about Lauer specifically, and if the two spoke before he published his new allegations in Catch and Kill.\n\n'Look, very often without talking to Matt Lauer specifically, as you know in our profession, people will fact check or have conversations and give you the responses in an off-the-record capacity or under some other ground rule that prevents them from answering a question like that,' said Farrow, skirting the question.\n\n'I will say that every single individual - where there's a serious allegation described against them in this book - had an ample, fair window to fact check them.'\n\nHe went on to say that he was not all that surprised by the letter Lauer released last week after the details of his alleged assault of former NBC employee Brooke Nevils became public.\n\nFarrow told Gayle King that 'there was nothing surprising in that letter except obviously - as many survivors commented on - the tone, which was angry and had menace in it.'\n\nThat 'menace,' said Farrow, was 'surprising to some people.'\n\nHe also disputed NBC's disputing of those secret settlements paid out to employees who were subject to sexual misconduct.\n\n'Tony, they had a euphemism at this company called enhanced severance. And we talked to multiple people, including executives on the NBC side, who were involved, saying these were explicitly arrangements to shut up women with allegations of misconduct in the company,' claimed Farrow.\n\n'That's something we saw at CBS, other media companies. It's a practice that correctly is being called into question by journalists.'\n\nOppenheim said that 'enhanced severance' was common, but not because of sexual misconduct.\n\nHe claimed in his memo that it 'was a standard option for departing employees prior to May 2014, and the severance amount paid was based on years of service.'\n\nThis 'was the norm' according to Oppenheim, and 'paid to hundreds if not thousands of employees regardless of whether the employee had any claim against the company.'", "description": "NBC News president Noah Oppenheim discredited a number of the claims made in Ronan Farrow's new book Catch and Kill in a vicious memo sent to staff members on Monday.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19694272-0-image-a-26_1571083244413.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
