The high court has yet to rule on that request.\n\nTigar initially blocked the policy nationwide, but a Ninth Circuit panel pared back that injunction to cover only the Ninth Circuit states. The district court judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, restored the nationwide scope of the injunction on Monday after receiving new evidence from opponents of the policy change.\n\nTrump and Attorney General Bill Barr have railed against Tigar\u2019s rulings, particularly because of their nationwide scope.\n\n", "description": "The ruling essentially restores the situation that existed last week.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5c/c7/9d3cdce34c3084d263843e376f66/190516-ninth-circuit-court-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
