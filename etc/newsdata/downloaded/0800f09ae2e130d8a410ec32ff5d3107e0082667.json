The judge\u2019s decision means that the Save James website will have to be shut down.\n\nMr. Younger and his ex-wife, Dr. Anne Georgulas, were in court last week fighting over custody and decision-making abilities for James and his twin, Jude. Dr. Georgulas wants to continue to \u201ctransition\u201d James \u201cinto\u201d a girl called \u201cLuna.\u201d Mr. Younger wanted to take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach rather than start the child on puberty blockers.\n\nEleven out of 12 jurors decided Monday that Mr. Younger should not be granted Sole Managing Conservatorship over his twin boys. Dr. Georgulas admitted in court she is not actually the twins\u2019 biological mother and used in-vitro fertilization via an egg donor to gestate them.On Monday, a jury ruled 11-1 that the current Joint Managing Conservatorship should be replaced by a Sole Managing Conservatorship \u2013 and that Mr. Younger should not be that person.\n\nJudge Cooks\u2019 ruling was originally scheduled for Wednesday afternoon but was delayed. When a seasoned civil court journalist from the Dallas Morning News asked the court clerk for the ruling schedule and provided her with the specific case number, she confirmed the day but refused to share the time of the ruling.\n\nSince kindergarten, Dr. Georgulas has enrolled James in school as a girl under the name \u201cLuna.\u201d She began telling him he\u2019s a girl when he was just three, and testified in court that she began to believe that when he liked a McDonald\u2019s toy meant for girls. James\u2019 pediatrician records also indicate Dr. Georgulas has met with GENECIS, a medical \u201ctransition\u201d clinic in Dallas and is considering \u201chormone suppression\u201d when James is closer to eight or nine years old.\n\nWatch this exclusive video with Jeffrey Younger given right before the judge issued the gag order:\n\nPrior to this case, Dr. Georgulas had exclusive rights to make decisions regarding psychological and psychiatric care for James and Jude. She needed to inform Mr. Younger of her decisions, but he couldn\u2019t weigh in on or change the decisions. GENECIS wouldn\u2019t begin James on puberty blockers without Mr. Younger\u2019s consent.\n\nDr. Georgulas and Mr. Younger\u2019s messy custody dispute entailed, in part, the latter filing a counter-petition to the court requesting sole managing conservatorship in order to obtain the ability to make decisions on psychological and psychiatric care. This would have given him the ability to prevent James\u2019 from starting puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones.\n\nMr. Odeneal told supporters that an appeal \u201ctakes about a year\u201d and it would be very difficult to overturn a jury ruling.\n\nThere were only three news agencies present throughout the trial: LifeSiteNews, The Texan, and Channel One (a Russian News Agency). After the jury ruling, the public outcry has been immense. Blogger Matt Walsh started the hashtag #protectjamesyounger on twitter. It has been used in tweets over 41,000 times. Additionally, other conservative news agencies are beginning to pick up the story.\n\nA petition created by LifeSiteNews in support of Jeffrey Younger\u2019s efforts to protect his son from being transitioned into a girl has been signed by over 65,000 people.\n\nFollow all LifeSiteNews coverage of the James Younger case here.\n\n_____\n\nFamily court records aren't easily accessible like those of civil court \u2013 journalists must be there or \"be square.\" Because of the financial support from our readers, we have been able to be in the courtroom reporting on this important case.
