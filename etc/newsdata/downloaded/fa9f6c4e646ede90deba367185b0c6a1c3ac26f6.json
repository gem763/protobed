I didn\u2019t expect to be in this position so I\u2019m very happy.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest wins that I\u2019ve had after everything so I\u2019m very proud.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Andy Murray beat Stan Wawrinka 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the European Open final in Antwerp, his first ATP Tour title since 2017.
