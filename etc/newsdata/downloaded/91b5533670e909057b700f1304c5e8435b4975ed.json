The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\u201d\n\nThe two progressive leaders formed a close friendship which continues to be a popular topic on social media several years after Obama left the White House. They were spotted having dinner together at an Ottawa restaurant earlier this year.\n\nTrudeau was the first Canadian prime minister the United States honored with a state dinner in almost two decades, when Obama invited him and his wife to Washington in March 2016 after the prime minister won power the previous October.\n\nThe Canadian leader faces a much tougher fight this time, and polls strongly suggest he will lose his majority in parliament after the Oct 21 election.\n\nThis is not the first time Obama has endorsed a foreign leader. He tweeted his support for Emmanuel Macron ahead of France\u2019s 2017 presidential election.\n\nThe American embassy in Ottawa declined to comment on the endorsement on the grounds that Obama is a private citizen.\n\nThe Liberals, the Conservatives and the New Democrats \u2013 the three main parties contesting the vote \u2013 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nElections Canada, the country\u2019s nonpartisan elections administrator, said Obama\u2019s tweet did not contravene regulations on foreign interference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s free speech. The only issue would be if Mr. Obama started to spend money on Mr. Trudeau\u2019s campaign,\u201d spokesman Pierre Cadieux said by phone.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Obama-election.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
