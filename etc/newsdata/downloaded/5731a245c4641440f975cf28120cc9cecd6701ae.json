The company also took over the catering at mines in Krugersdorp, Randfontein and Carletonville.\n\nVan Zijl contracted a friend, Paulus Vorster, better known as Oom Vossie, who owned a dry-cleaning business in Randfontein, to do the laundry at the hostels.\n\nVorster\u2019s son, Frans, who joined Bosasa as head of security (and would become Gavin Watson\u2019s go-to man when politicians, government officials or the Watson brothers needed cars or car repairs), recalled: \u201cAt the time I worked as a policeman in Krugersdorp and later as station commander at Tarlton police station. We [Meritum] saw a business opportunity \u2013 a space to hold foreigners who were arrested.\u201d\n\nThe West Rand, with its proximity to the gold mines, saw a lot of undocumented foreign nationals being arrested by the police.\n\n\u201cA number of police stations simply didn\u2019t have enough space in their holding cells to keep foreigners and feed them. So we started to negotiate with home affairs.\u201d\n\nVan Zijl had another idea \u2013 to establish youth centres for awaiting-trial juveniles, who at the time were kept with adults in the same prison.\n\nDriven by a personal belief that children shouldn\u2019t be kept with \u201chardened criminals\u201d, Van Zijl converted some of his empty hostels into youth-friendly prisons.\n\nVan Zijl was passionate about his project to remove children from adult prisons \u201cwhere they could be sodomised\u201d.\n\nNegotiations took place with the police and the department of correctional services, which had a major overcrowding problem in the early 1990s.\n\nA senior prison official called Patrick Gillingham represented the department.\n\n\u201cPatrick and my father were good friends; at that stage he [Gillingham] wasn\u2019t corrupt,\u201d said Frans Vorster.\n\nAs a result, Meritum youth hostel was launched in 1995 as a project with the department of social development; and a year later Lindela opened its doors as the country\u2019s first repatriation centre where undocumented migrants awaited determination of their legal status in the country.\n\nIn 1996 everything changed. Although black economic empowerment wasn\u2019t yet an official policy of the ANC government, there was pressure on companies doing business with government to include black shareholders in their companies and in doing so change the face of business in South Africa.\n\nVan Zijl and Smith knew they had to change the ownership structure of the company. Enter the Watsons and a group of ANC Women\u2019s League (ANCWL) leaders.\n\nAt the centre of the initial introduction was the Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC), which was started in 1981 by Anton Rupert and his son Johann, as a public-private partnership to support small, medium and micro businesses.\n\nAt the time Smith, a co-owner of Meritum, was a senior member of the SBDC, and Eastern Cape businessman Danny Mansell headed up the provincial branch of the corporation.\n\nGavin Watson was looking for new business opportunities after the family\u2019s clothing business had folded, and ended up knocking on the door of the SBDC.\n\nWe concluded the deal. We had a contract. I gave them a big discount. I figured this was my contribution to the ANC.\n\nMansell helped Watson to assist emerging black businesses in Port Elizabeth. But something went wrong, and Mansell was paid out by the corporation to leave \u2013 details about Mansell\u2019s sudden departure from the SBDC are sketchy and those who know are either dead or refuse to talk.\n\nHaving met Smith during his time at the SBDC, Mansell, Watson and Port Elizabeth accountant Tony Perry put together a bid to buy Meritum.\n\nVan Zijl recalls how the three men drove from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg to discuss the purchase.\n\n\u201cWatson was representing the ANCWL. He said: \u2018Let\u2019s go to Johannesburg to see the ANC Women\u2019s League.\u2019 When we got there, it was only Nomvula Mokonyane at the meeting. I didn\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Mokonyane was the Gauteng MEC for agriculture, conservation and environment.\n\n\u201cWe concluded the deal. We had a contract. I gave them a big discount. I figured this was my contribution to the ANC.\u201d\n\nBosasa was never an ANC front company. Gavin may have wanted it to seem that way, but the ANC never endorsed Bosasa. Angelo Agrizzi\n\nBut Meritum was never sold to the ANC.\n\nThe deal was done with Dyambu Operations (which later became Bosasa Operations), a facilities management company of which Watson and Mansell owned 90% of the shares in equal parts.\n\nThe other 10% was owned by a group of ANCWL leaders through their company Dyambu Holdings.\n\n\u201cBosasa was never an ANC front company. Gavin may have wanted it to seem that way, but the ANC never endorsed Bosasa,\u201d said Angelo Agrizzi, who lifted the lid on Bosasa\u2019s continuous support of the ANC through donations of money, resources, facilities, food parcels and even birthday cakes.\n\nAgrizzi recalled that Van Zijl and Smith sold Meritum to Watson and co for \u201cabout R6 million or R7 million\u201d.\n\nMansell used his payout from the SBDC to buy the shares in Dyambu Operations.\n\nWatson left his family in Port Elizabeth and moved to Johannesburg to be close to the action.\n\nMansell ran Dyambu, and Watson was responsible for marketing. Watson also had a consultancy job with Sun International to help them win casino licences.\n\n\u201cGavin arrived without a house or a car. He drove plenty of Sun International cars, but he didn\u2019t have his own,\u201d Frans Vorster remembered.\n\nAgrizzi recalled that Watson essentially \u201clived out of his boot\u201d.\n\nSmith stayed on at Dyambu (and then Bosasa) until his death in 2016, but Van Zijl left much earlier.\n\n\u201cFanie and Doc Smith fought,\u201d Agrizzi explained.\n\nREAD: The Bosasa billions: Smoke, mirrors and Agrizzi\n\n\u201cHe [Van Zijl] didn\u2019t know Lindela [the repatriation centre] was part of the transaction. He [had] wanted to retain the properties. For years, Smith and Van Zijl never spoke to each other.\n\n\u201cVan Zijl was still trying to run the business after Watson arrived [as an employee], but Watson would have none of it. There was a major breakdown, there was snot en trane [heavy crying].\n\n\u201cWatson told Van Zijl to go home and retire and rest.\u201d\n\nIt was evident to me that Van Zijl was sad and upset about what had become of the company after he left in the late 1990s.\n\nTalking about the allegations of corruption, bribery and state capture levelled against Watson and his peers, he said: \u201cWhy must you do business like this? How much money do you want to make? There are plenty of ways to do honest business.\u201d", "description": "Taking centre stage at the Zondo commission, the wheelings and dealings of late Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson gripped the nation.
