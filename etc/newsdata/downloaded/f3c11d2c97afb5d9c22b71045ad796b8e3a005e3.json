It's the latest setback for a company combating thousands of lawsuits claiming the talc-based powder contains the cancer-causing mineral.\n\nAccording to the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company, the recall is limited to just one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the U.S. last year. Regardless of the precautionary measure, the pharmaceutical company said the baby powder does not contain asbestos.\n\n\"[J&J] has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA's own testing on prior occasions \u2014 and as recently as last month \u2014 found no asbestos,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos. Our talc comes from ore sources confirmed to meet our stringent specifications that exceed industry standards,\" the statement continued.\n\nJ&J also said that independent laboratories have tested the company's talc and confirmed that it is asbestos-free.\n\nAccording to the company, independent laboratories have tested the company's talc and confirmed that it is asbestos-free. J&J also said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found small amounts of asbestos in one bottle, which the company is currently investigating to determine how the contamination occurred and whether the bottle is counterfeit.\n\nJohnson & Johnson hit with $8B verdict over drug linked to boy growing breasts\n\nJ&J shares fell $5.65, or 4.1%, to $130.52 in morning trade.\n\nThe recall comes amid a rash of lawsuits against J&J's baby powder. Last year, the company won several court cases alleging harm from the product and is appealing other judgments, including a $4.6 billion settlement awarded in July to 22 women who claimed its product caused their ovarian cancer.\n\nIn February, Johnson & Johnson disclosed that the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the company over allegations that Johnson's Baby Powder is contaminated with asbestos. The company's shares plunged last December after a Reuters report alleged that J&J knew about asbestos contamination in talcum powder for decades but failed to alert regulators or consumers.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Consumer products giant said the recall is limited to a single batch made and shipped in the U.S. in 2018", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/ff5b20b6-be16-41fc-85b1-b456a58da18d/thumbnail/1200x630/6659c603ebc7a68d7aa3eb45b18695b1/gettyimages-998003060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
