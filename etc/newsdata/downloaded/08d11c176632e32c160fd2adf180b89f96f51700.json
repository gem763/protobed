Johnson's government has appealed the decision and the case is set to be heard in the Supreme Court next Tuesday.\n\nNorthern Ireland's High Court on Thursday dismissed several lawsuits filed there that argued the prorogation was illegal and a no-deal Brexit breached the terms of the province's 1998 peace accord.\n\n- Parliament recall demanded -\n\nParliament will for now stay shut, despite calls from opposition lawmakers for its immediate recall -- intensified by the release of the Yellowhammer documents.\n\n\"It is also now more important than ever that parliament is recalled and has the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal,\" Labour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said.\n\nHowever, a government source told AFP on Wednesday that \"nothing is changing\" until the case was concluded.\n\nAhead of the shutdown lawmakers passed a law aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit, but Johnson has insisted Britain will still depart the EU on October 31.\n\nThe British leader wants to renegotiate the divorce terms struck by his predecessor Theresa May, which MPs have repeatedly rejected.\n\nBut European leaders accuse him of offering no viable alternatives.\n\nJohnson insisted he was \"very hopeful\" of getting a deal.\n\n\"We can see the rough area of a landing space, of how you can do it,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be hard, but I think we can get there.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday Britain will be ready for a no-deal Brexit on October 31 despite his own government's assessment warning that planning remained \"at a low level\".
