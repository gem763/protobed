Designed with a layered architecture philosophy, and built with cutting edge trusted execution environment (TEE) technologies, Taxa aims at enabling the killer apps of Web 3.0 to develop and thrive.\n\nCocos-BCX is a public blockchain platform aiming to create a complete run-time environment for games with multi-game system compatibility, providing game developers a user-friendly platform for blockchain game development.\n\nThe global gaming market is expected to be more than USD$150 billion this year, and there are about 2.3 billion gamers across the globe, according to market researcher Newzoo.\n\nGames of incomplete asymmetric information such as card games and eSports make a great portion of the global gaming industry. Due to the limitations with privacy, response latency, time and space resources on individual smart contracts, it was difficult for developers to build such games on public blockchains.\n\nBy introducing the highly developable, computationally powerful trustless third party powered by Taxa\u2019s cutting edge trusted execution technologies, game developers on Cocos-BCX can now create those fun classic games on blockchain. By integrating Taxa onto the Cocos-BCX platform, Cocos-BCX shall strengthen its developer-first initiative with TEE-enabled developer tool kits.\n\nRegarding the collaboration, Esther Hu, Co-founder of Taxa said \u201cWe are very excited to work with the top minds in the gaming industry. Cocos-BCX\u2019s vision of building the world\u2019s best-in-class developer experience for blockchain games resonates with us deeply. We are very impressed by their obsession with developability. When creativity meets powerful technology, there will be a lot of fun for developers, and ultimately for all the gamers.\u201d\n\nIn the words of Reed Hong, Head of Research & Development of Cocos-BCX, \u201cTaxa is a leading project that offers developer-friendly TEE-enabled solutions to the pain point of many public blockchains. As a layer 2 infrastructure, Taxa bridges the developability and usability gap between public blockchains and DApps with Taxa\u2019s high-performance, privacy-preserving, highly developable smart contract engine. Cocos-BCX is excited to kick off the partnership with Taxa. We believe it will bring lots of benefits to the Cocos-BCX ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAbout Taxa Network\n\nTaxa Network is a privacy-preserving, computationally powerful, highly developable, blockchain agnostic layer-2 infrastructure. Designed with a layered architecture philosophy, and built with cutting edge trusted execution environment (TEE) technologies, Taxa aims at enabling the killer apps of Web 3.0 to develop and thrive. With Taxa, developers are able to unlock whole new possibilities in privacy-centric, data-intensive or computation-heavy scenarios such as gaming, AI/machine learning, DeFi, digital rights management, etc.\n\nTo know more about Taxa, please visit:\n\ntaxa.network\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nDiscord\n\nMedium", "description": "Taxa Network, a leading layer-2 project focusing on highly developable confidential compute, announced to collaborate with Cocos-BCX to co-create seamless exper...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9iNGRmYzkxOWYwOWU4YTEwOWUxZDk4ZTk1OGFhNTdjOS5wbmc=.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
