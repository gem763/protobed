Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that president Donald Trump had recently dreamed up a meeting with Taliban leadership at Camp David, the presidential retreat famous for being the background of international negotiation, but ultimately cancelled it after the group killed an American soldier just before the proposed meeting.\n\nAccording to that report, the goal of the meeting was to present Mr Trump as a brilliant negotiator able to find a peace plan with the Taliban, and end the 18-year-old war in Afghanistan, which the president has focused on as a potential triumph of his presidency.\n\nBut the plan apparently imploded almost immediately. The president then tweeted about the decision to cancel the meeting, placing the blame on Taliban leadership, who, according to the New York Times, had never fully accepted the invitation to Camp David.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Mr Pompeo appeared to be presenting a ruthless ideal of America that was not weakened by the perplexing and ultimately discarded attempt at peace talks, which ended with the Taliban promising more American deaths.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump scuppered Taliban peace plan 'by trying to take credit for deal'\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been negotiating while they\u2019ve been killing us and we\u2019ve been standing still,\u201d he told Jake Tapper on CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been takin' it to the Taliban as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that UN report, they described the Al-Qaeda leadership as being happy about the conditions of Afghanistan,\u201d he continued, referring to a report from the United Nations indicating that the group considers the country a safe haven.\n\n\u201cWell a lot of them are in their graves, and so make no mistake about it. We will continue to punish, we will continue to pound, we will continue to fight. We will continue to protect the American people.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump scuppered Taliban peace plan 'by trying to take credit for deal'", "description": "Mike Pompeo told multiple news anchors that American forces had killed \u201cover 1,000 Taliban\u201d in the last ten days, days after the president abruptly announced a failed would-be meeting with leaders of the group at Camp David.\u201cWe have been fighting and talking in a way that America often doesn\u2019t do,\u201d the", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LY.v05UfqeQScbBi9CfYLg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/d1e07fb4523d971c30f638006cc911eb", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
