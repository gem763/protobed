The winner will serve until 2024.\n\nThe interim budget targets a fiscal deficit of 2.2% of GDP, government officials have told Reuters. Official budget documents presented in parliament did not mention the 2020 deficit target.\n\nFinance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in his presentation of the interim budget that Sri Lanka could still see 3% economic growth in 2019 despite challenges including subdued growth following the Easter Sunday bombing attacks by Islamist militants in April, which killed more than 250 people and hurt the important tourism industry.\n\nThe $87 billion economy's growth eased to a 17-year low of 3.2% in 2018 and the International Monetary Fund expects the pace to slow to 2.7% in 2019 this year.\n\nA Reuters poll has predicted 2019 growth will be the lowest in nearly two decades.\n\nParliamentary elections are likely early next year under a new president. The new government could then decide the full year budget, officials said.\n\nThe government had originally aimed at a budget deficit of 3.5% for 2020. However, the government is compelled to revise down the target after a political crisis and the bombings.\n\nInvestor confidence nosedived last year after President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly sacked his prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and dissolved parliament. That was later ruled unconstitutional, and Wickremesinghe was reinstated.\n\nThe crisis created panic and uncertainty among investors, who dumped Sri Lankan government bonds and other assets, sending the rupee currency to record lows.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; editing by Grant McCool)", "description": "The Sri Lankan parliament on Wednesday passed an ambitious interim budget weeks before a presidential election, with 1.47 trillion rupees ($8.11 billion) in spending for the first four months of 2020.
