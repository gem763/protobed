Liza Dougherty, Navy spokeswoman, told Warrior Maven.\n\nAlthough South China Sea territorial disputes have been lingering beneath the radar amid growing tensions with North Korea, U.S. military officials confirmed to Warrior Maven that the Freedom of Navigation exercise did take place - and that the issue of China\u2019s \u201cexcessive maritime claims\u201d has by no means gone away.\n\nNavy officials were clear to describe the carrier group deployment as part of normal routine operations and not specifically tied to tensions in the region in any way. However, both the carrier group arrival and the U.S. FONOP are taking place within the broader context of continued U.S.-China disagreements over island structures and territories in the South China Sea.\n\nNavy official described U.S. operations in the area and the new carrier-strike group deployment as part of a normal \u201cvariety of operations around the globe, regardless of current events.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, China\u2019s provocative actions have not gone unnoticed and the Pentagon has consistently said the U.S. is committed to demonstrating that U.S. forces can fly, sail and operate anywhere in the world according to international law.\n\n\u201cFONOPs are not about any one country, nor are they about making political statements. The United States takes a strong position on protecting the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all countries and that all maritime claims must comply with international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention,\u201d Lt. Cmdr. Nicole Schwegman, Navy Pacific Fleet official, told Warrior Maven in a statement.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "They are for the U.S. Navy.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UdREhlsu5bUGQDkkF3Czyw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/8bb6828b60e03c6b4103f2df0266dbdd", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
