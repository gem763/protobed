It owns most of the mainstream \u201cnews\u201d outlets, the universities and the public-school curricula. Its members are the faces of popular entertainment.\n\nBut its march is not over, for now the left is coming for you. It\u2019s coming for your wallet, wealth, values and free speech. And it is coming for President Trump, for he is the only one standing in its way. He is not intimidated by the partisan national media, political correctness, identity politics, or the politics of victimization and resentment.\n\nNow the left is preparing to take down Mr. Trump with Russia hoax 2.0 \u2014 the Ukraine hoax. As the Democratic-controlled House replaces the American spirit of bipartisanship, fair play and transparent investigation with restricted access, secret meetings, duplicity and planned leaks to its media accomplices, where are the nation\u2019s \u201cstatesmen\u201d calling out this travesty? They are cowering in the dark, intimidated by the machine of the left, too afraid to support the only national leader focused on the real needs of the American people. Yes, these are very dark and scary times, indeed.\n\nKEN BECKERT\n\nAbingdon, Md.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
