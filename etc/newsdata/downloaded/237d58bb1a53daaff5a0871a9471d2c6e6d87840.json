Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have both endorsed Medicare for All, while frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden has laid out a plan to expand the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Biden slammed Sanders' and Warren\u2019s endorsement of Medicare for All -- which he said was too costly, challenging how they would be able to pay for it.\n\n\u201cI know [Sen. Warren] says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack. I think ObamaCare worked.\u201d\n\nBut Warren, who co-sponsored Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill in the Senate, defended the plan, which she said would ultimately cut costs for middle-class families by raising taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. She declined to say whether taxes would raise for the middle-class in order to fund the bill, despite facing past criticism for dodging specifics on her health care proposal.\n\n\u201cThose at the very top, the richest individuals and corporations, are going to pay more,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd middle-class families are going to pay less. That\u2019s how this is going to work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the plan Sanders unveiled in 2017, the federal government would, via taxes, finance health care costs for people across the board (although individuals would still be on the hook for some out-of-pocket costs).\n\nDuring the first Democratic debate in June, he admitted that middle-class taxes would rise in order to pay for the proposal -- but defended the increase, saying insurance premiums were essentially another type of tax.\n\nA family that currently pays $20,000 for private insurance would no longer have to pay that cost in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he said. Instead, their taxes would increase by roughly $10,000.\n\nSanders argued the hefty price tag for the plan -- it could cost $50 trillion over 10 years, he said -- was worth it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most cost-effective approach to every man, woman and child in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI wrote the damn bill, if I may say so, and it eliminates all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, co-payments.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cI know [Sen.
