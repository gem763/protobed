REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nLast year 30% and 24% of economists in the federal government were women and minorities, respectively, compared to 23% and 21% of economics faculty in academia, the study by the think tank\u2019s Hutchins Center of Fiscal and Monetary Policy found.\n\nEconomics as a profession has repeatedly been criticized for being too male and white. The number of women, for example, who were awarded PhDs in economics in 2018 was 32%, a level that has barely shifted in 20 years.\n\nThe biggest employer of women and minority economists is the U.S. Federal Reserve, which employs 37% of all economists who work for the federal government, the report said.\n\nYet the share of women and minorities there remains mostly unchanged since 2013. The share of women economists at the Federal Reserve, which includes its headquarters and 12 regional Feds, has not budged at 24% of the workforce while the share of minority economists has risen to 25% from 22%.\n\nAmong other federal government institutions the percentage of women rose to 33% of the workforce in 2018 from 27% in 2010 and for minorities to 24% from 18% over the same period. The study defined economists as those holding PhDs.\n\n\u201cThe lack of diversity harms the field because it wastes talent,\u201d former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead the world\u2019s most powerful central bank in its more than 100-year history, said when announcing the findings. \u201cIf economists are mainly of one gender or race, they\u2019re likely to miss things that matter.\u201d\n\nThe Government Accountability Office and the Department of Health and Human Services employed the largest share of women, at 55% and 48%, respectively, while the Army employed the least with 8%.\n\nMinorities comprised 50% of economists at the Department of Defense excluding the Army and Air Force.\n\nUPS AND DOWNS\n\nDuring her time as Fed chief from 2014 to 2018 Yellen pledged to increase diversity at the Fed, a mantle that has been taken up by her successor Jerome Powell.\n\nPowell has called diversity a hallmark of successful organizations and in a speech to Fed staff last year said \u201cthere is plenty of room for us all to do better.\u201d\n\nThe Fed did not have any further comment Monday when contacted by Reuters.\n\nThe rate-setting institution came under fire in 2016 when 127 lawmakers wrote a letter to the Fed urging more varied faces among its ranks while Fed Up, a network of community organizations and labor unions that wanted a more diverse and transparent Fed, was also very vocal around the same time.\n\nDespite that, the three most powerful positions at the Fed are still held by white men while currently only two of the central bank\u2019s 17 policymakers are non-white and all but five are men.\n\nThe central bank had never had a black district president until 2017, when Raphael Bostic was chosen to head up the Atlanta Fed\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had the largest jump in women economists employed, to 43% in 2018 from 30% in 2013, the study found. But the share of women economists at the Dallas Fed fell over the same period to 16% from 20%.\n\nMinorities employed at the regional Fed offices also varied. They comprised 43% of the workforce at the St. Louis Fed but only 12% at the San Francisco Fed.", "description": "The U.S. federal government employs a higher percentage of women and minority economists than universities and colleges but the pace at which they are being added remains slow, a report by the Brookings Institution published on Monday showed.", "authors": ["Lindsay Dunsmuir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433115548&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M276", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
