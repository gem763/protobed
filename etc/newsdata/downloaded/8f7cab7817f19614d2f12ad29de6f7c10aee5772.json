It would be the fifth initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange for the man who sold his first, the Asian clone of domain.com.au known as iProperty, to REA Group in a deal worth $741 million.\n\nHowever iflix would be his largest IPO, if rumours of a 10-digit valuation prove anywhere near true.\n\nIt's a sensitive time for the south-east Asian answer to Netflix, which Mr Grove founded in 2015. It was watched by 16 million people in April, and has more than $400 million in backing from media giants such as Sky TV (UK), and Hearst Group (USA).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Grove owns roughly one-third of iflix through his Catcha Group, which he runs with a friend from his Sydney University days, Luke Elliott.\n\nImpressed by its production of content tailored to locals, and its ambition to reach the 350 million people in the region who watched TV last month, the big-name backers have pushed iflix's valuation to the point where it is the biggest line item on Mr Grove's valuation on the 2019 Rich List.\n\nIflix's business model is not so different to that of his iProperty triumph, according to the the Singapore-born entrepreneur.\n\n\"It's a learning curve in some ways, making sure we get the best scripts pitched to us,\" he said.\n\n\"Perserverance,\" he wrote on his Instagram page, \"is the hard work you do after you're tired of doing the hard work you already did.\" \u2014 Patrick Grove\n\n\"But in another way it's the same as we were doing before. Get something on the internet and get as many people as possible to look at it \u2013 whether it's a house listing or a movie, get it out fast, far and wide, and make sure people like what they see and come back.\"\n\nGrove isn't resting on his laurels. He has been running between investors and potential investors in iflix \u2013 he hit Manila, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur on the day he spoke to The Australian Financial Review last week \u2013 against a backdrop of wariness toward technology floats.\n\nWhile the likes of WiseTech and Xero are trading at sky-high valuations, tech businesses far from profitability have starred in several underwhelming IPOs recently, including Lyft and Uber in the US, and tracking app Life360 on the ASX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a rumour published by News Corp in April that such pessimism had forced iflix to pause its ASX debut, and undertake a $40 million pre-IPO raise instead.\n\nMr Grove would only say that Macquarie and UBS had been appointed to explore an IPO \"at some point in the future\", with going public \"just one of the possibilities\" iflix was reviewing. In May it took on MNC, which controls half of Indonesia\u2019s free-to-air TV, as a new investor.\n\nIt took Mr Grove 120 meetings before an investor said 'yes' to iflix initially, and there is little doubt he has the will to do as many meetings as required for it now.\n\n\"Perserverance,\" he wrote recently on his Instagram page, \"is the hard work you do after you're tired of doing the hard work you already did.\"\n\nMr Grove was keen to talk about his second ASX IPO, Asian Carsales clone iCar Asia, whose share price has doubled since the announcement of March quarter revenues up 30 per cent year-on-year to $2.6 million.\n\nHowever 24 cents at Friday's close is only just above where iCar listed in 2012, and after a high of $1.73 in 2014 the online classifieds company \u2013 of which Catcha Group owns 29 per cent \u2013 has not traded above 30 cents since 2016.\n\nRask Group analyst Andrew Schonberger expected iCar to stay in that range for the time being, given the likelihood it will need to raise more capital and lingering doubts that south-east Asians will ever embrace second-hand cars in the way Australians do.\n\nHowever Mr Grove said an inflection point would be reached when iCar broke even by the end of the year.\n\n\"That is a huge milestone for the company and market,\" he said.\n\nMichael Bailey's feature on Patrick Grove appears on www.afr.com and in the Rich List issue of The Australian Financial Review Magazine out Friday, May 31.", "description": "Australia's most successful entrepreneur in south-east Asia is facing down frustration on several fronts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_423%2C$y_1869/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/af469c26d4ee6075c22216be2418098cf2c269d6", "published_at": "2019-05-24"}
