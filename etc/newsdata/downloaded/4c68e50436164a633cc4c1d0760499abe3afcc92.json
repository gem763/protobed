'Elijah Cummings reached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits, and Mitch McConnell was one of the persons he reached out to.'\n\nBobby Rankin refused to shake Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's hand at a memorial service for the late Elijah Cummings in the Capitol on Thursday (pictured) because he 'refused to help' his Marine brother Jerry before he died of cancer in October 2016\n\nHis brother Jerry (right), died in October 2016 from cancer after being exposed to contaminated water while serving in the Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

He added: 'I couldn't do it, because I was thinking about my brother.'\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell appeared stunned by the refusal to shake hands at the late congressman's memorial service.\n\nFootage of the moment has been viewed 2.1 million times since it was uploaded to Twitter on Thursday.\n\nMcConnell's reps have not responded to the Washington Post's request for comment.\n\nIt's unclear why Charlotte, North Carolina man Jerry didn't get the benefits.\n\nRankin was also listed as a pallbearer for Cummings's funeral on Friday.\n\nHe told the Post: 'When I carry him to his grave, if I could say something to him, I would say something I said to him many, many times before.
