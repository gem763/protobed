When the Lakers landed the No. 2 pick, everything was seemingly falling into place. Ball just had to ace his workout.\n\nHe didn\u2019t.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBall looked out of shape, though it was unclear at the time whether those reports were just smokescreens. Ball passed his second workout, and the Lakers took him No. 2.\n\nBut that first workout really was that bad, according to Ball. Ball \u2013 who has since been traded to the Pelicans \u2013 provided all the ugly details, including meeting then-Lakers assistant coach Brian Shaw.\n\nBall on LightHarted Podcast:\n\nThe workout with the Lakers was the worst workout I\u2019ve ever had. Ever.\n\nIt has to be the worst workout for a number two pick. It has to. That\u2019s how bad. It was terrible. They had to come to Chino to watch me work out again.\n\nI was by myself. But I got sick, and I didn\u2019t tell nobody. So, I had drank a whole bottle of codeine. I mean, not codeine, but cough syrup.\n\nI couldn\u2019t move. Ask B Shaw. B Shaw will tell you. He was like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d That was the first time I met B Shaw, and he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think he it.\u201d I could see it on his face. I would take two steps. I couldn\u2019t dunk. They were like, \u201cGet up.\u201d I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t dunk.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t move, bro. I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn.\u201d\n\nAfter the workout, I\u2019m like, this ain\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to do another one. We scheduled a second workout, and it was all good from there. But that first one, man. If those tapes ever get released, it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s real bad.\n\nThis should serve as a lesson for draft-eligible players. They don\u2019t have to do workouts if not advantageous. The draft gives teams massive control over the process. Players should seize power wherever they can.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would the Lakers have done if Ball postponed the workout? They might have griped, but they almost certainly would have attended the re-scheduled workout and drafted him. By trying to prove himself while sick, Ball risked not getting to his desired team.\n\nThere are probably Lakers fans who wish the team never granted Ball that second workout. Ball\u2019s style \u2013 high on passing and defense, low on individual scoring and shooting \u2013 goes unappreciated. Yes, the Lakers could have drafted better players. But Ball still looks like a fine pick, especially considering what we knew at the time.\n\nBall impressed at UCLA. A single bad workout shouldn\u2019t override that much larger sample.\n\nGood process sometimes leads to bad results. I\u2019d rather have good process in place. It\u2019ll lead to good results more often.\n\nBut did the Lakers have a good process in place here? Lakers owner Jeanie Buss reportedly pushed Magic Johnson to draft Ball over De'Aaron Fox, who has turned out better. I wonder whether the Lakers were just going to give Ball as many workouts as he needed until he got one right.", "description": "Lonzo Ball \u2013 as close as there was to a consensus No. 2 prospect in the 2017 NBA draft \u2013 wanted to join the Lakers.
