He\u2019s not as much of an underdog, but being an underdog, coming up fighting someone with a lot of experience, fighting a veteran, and I understand how you can make a name off of that. So I\u2019m very committed to not letting that happen to me on Friday night.\u201d\n\nLauzon (27-15 MMA, 14-12 UFC) is currently on a three-fight losing skid, and admitted Friday might be his last fight. His most recent loss to Chris Gruetzemacher in April 2018, in which his corner stopped the fight at the end of the second round, didn\u2019t sit well with him.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t about to let that be his last memory in the sport, so he decided to take some time off, which he believes is exactly what he needed.\n\n\u201cWe always take it fight by fight,\u201d Lauzon said. \u201cI can think of a whole lot of things that are worse than having my last fight in Boston, so we\u2019ll see how it goes. I feel really good. I don\u2019t feel old. Everyone\u2019s always saying, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re old.\u2019 I\u2019m 35, but I understand I had a lot of fights in the UFC. But I think we\u2019re a little bit smarter than most people.\u201d\n\nLauzon, who runs his own gym filled with some of New England\u2019s best talent, like featherweight contender Calvin Kattar and Rob Font, thinks he\u2019s set without fighting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to fight,\u201d Lauzon said. \u201cI was just really unhappy how the last fight went. That couldn\u2019t be the last one. This is maybe the last one \u2013 but not necessarily.\n\n\u201cWe have a really good stable of guys there \u2013 all good training partners \u2013 so I don\u2019t have to come here and fight. I could focus on my gym more. My gym would probably do a little better if I did focus on my gym more, but for like the last 10 months or so, I\u2019ve been so focused on fighting. But I\u2019m doing it because I want to do it, not because I have to.\u201d\n\nHe takes on Pearce (9-3 MMA, 0-0 UFC), who secured a UFC contract on Dana White\u2019s Contender Series, and is riding a five-fight winning streak \u2013 all by finish.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a long, rangy kickboxer,\u201d Lauzon said. \u201c(He has) a lot of volume \u2013 (the) kid\u2019s tough, super tough. Anyone who gets to this point is super tough. (He) had a great fight on the Contender Series.\u201d", "description": "Veteran Joe Lauzon might be stepping into the octagon for the last time at UFC Boston, and won't let Jonathan Pearce make a name off of him.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joe-lauzon-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
