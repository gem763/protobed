But in the annals of Washington\u2019s deeply troubled relations with Putin, that\u2019s code: They were discussing sanctions.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Congress and the Obama administration imposed financial and travel restrictions on some of Putin\u2019s closest allies because of mistreatment\u2014or worse\u2014that lead to the death of a whistleblowing tax lawyer in a Russian prison. The lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, had exposed a massive $230 million fraud committed by officials.\n\nThe Magnitsky Act, as the law is known, bars dozens of Russian officials from entering the U.S. or using its banking system because of their alleged involvement in Magnitsky\u2019s death and other human rights violations.\n\nPutin retaliated against the U.S. by blocking American adoption of Russian children, many of whom were physically or mentally impaired.\n\nSince then, the Russian campaign to discredit the narrative of Magnitsky\u2019s death, and get the sanctions overturned, has been one of Putin\u2019s obsessions. What could be better than a report by a critic of his regime who suddenly saw the light and changed his views entirely?\n\nThis is the story of Andrei Nekrasov, a man who previously made documentaries saying that Putin\u2019s rise to power was cemented by government-orchestrated bombings of apartment buildings in the dead of the night.\n\nNow, Nekrasov appears on Russian TV saying that he investigated Magnitsky and saw the light, that the Magnitsky affair is one big hoax.\n\nNekrasov is central to the story of the Magnitsky sanctions because it is his film that was used to try to recruit Rep. Dana Rohrabacher to the Russian cause. And Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. to talk adoptions, paid for and attended a screening of Nekrasov\u2019s movie in D.C. just days later.\n\nIn Magnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes, Nekrasov tells the story of how he was planning to put together an expos\u00e9 about the whistleblower\u2019s death at the hands of Russian authorities. Instead, he says he uncovered a massive lie by Magnitsky\u2019s employer, American-born businessman Bill Browder, who became a leading proponent of sanctioning Russian officials after Magnitsky\u2019s death in a Russian prison in 2009. Nekrasov questions not only the narrative of Magnitsky\u2019s death by beating, but that of a Russian tax theft more broadly.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when Nekrasov filmed key parts of Magnitsky Act, but he absolves the Russian government of any responsibility for Magnitsky\u2019s death. The film follows Nekrasov as he supposedly figures out the truth that has eluded everyone else.\n\nBrowder told The Daily Beast that most of the interview footage of him used in the movie was filmed in 2010 after a talk in Finland, when Nekrasov\u2019s then-girlfriend, a Finnish member of the European Parliament named Heidi Hautala, asked Browder to sit down with the filmmaker.\n\n\u201cBecause he was validated by such an important politician, I had no concerns about his intentions,\u201d Browder said.\n\nYears went by before Browder said he heard from Nekrasov again. Browder said he chalked up the silence to thinking Nekrasov was \u201ca disorganized artist guy who couldn\u2019t get his project done if he wanted to.\u201d\n\nNekrasov was by this point an award-winning filmmaker.\n\nThey ran into each other again in 2015 at the Oslo Freedom Forum. Nekrasov told Browder he had big funding for the movie and asked him to collaborate, Browder says.\n\n\u201c There was something a bit odd about it, I didn\u2019t feel right about it,\u201d Browder says of the meeting, which appears in the film.\n\nNekrasov appeared again at a book party for Browder, and got the financier to agree to a final interview. Browder said his suspicions weren\u2019t allayed.\n\n\u201c I said to him, on tape, it sounds like you\u2019re part of the FSB,\u201d Browder recalled. \u201cThose are FSB questions.\u201d\n\nIn the tense scene from the film, Browder gets up to leave and advises Nekrasov that his questions sound like the FSB party line, akin to the claim that there are no Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine.\n\nNekrasov also interviewed Magnitsky\u2019s mother, Natalya Magnitskaya, while still presenting himself as exposing the men responsible for her son\u2019s death.\n\nNekrasov sent The Daily Beast a five-page memo responding to questions for this article, and accusing the media of bias against him simply because of his Russian background. He reiterated that the film had begun as a laudatory documentary about Magnitsky, but that his views changed, in particular after he interviewed the author of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe report on Magnitsky\u2019s death, Andreas Gross.\n\n\u201c Mr. Gross told me that Magnitsky had not been murdered, but that he died because the jailers did not look well enough after him,\u201d Nekrasov said.\n\nBut Gross disavowed Nekrasov\u2019s final product, and called some of Nekrasov\u2019s claims \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d In particular, the men disagree over whether Magnitsky implicated police officers in his June 2008 testimony.\n\n\u201c This is NOT true,\u201d Nekrasov responded.\n\n\u201c Once again Katie, do you trust someone, who himself confesses to having no Russian, and not me?\u201d Nekrasov wrote. \u201cDo you seriously think I would spend years making this internationally produced film and misrepresent these key documents for anyone to look at?\u201d\n\nNekrasov railed against Browder as a man who used the political climate of instability to become \u201ca rich guy (who made all his money in the corrupt Russia).\u201d\n\nIn one of the film\u2019s eureka moments, Nekrasov points to testimony given by Magnitsky in October 2008 as proof that the theft was actually reported not by him but by a pensioner who accused Browder\u2019s companies for wrongdoing.\n\nBut Browder\u2019s employees had filed another document with police five months before the pensioner\u2019s supposed statements, saying they feared the documents seized in a search of their office were used to perpetrate the fraud.\n\n\u201cWho is the person who reported the crime first?\u201d Nekrasov asks rhetorically in the film.\n\nBrowder says he didn\u2019t find out about the movie until promotions started in 2016. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher was invited to an exclusive screening at the Newseum, funded by Veselnitskaya\u2019s group. Browder and his team worked up a response to the nearly three-hour film, which claims to capture Nekrasov\u2019s realization that Browder\u2019s claims of Magnitsky\u2019s death at the hands of Russian authorities were all lies.\n\nThe movie is so flattering to the Russian narrative that Pavel Karpov\u2014one of the police officers accused of being responsible for Magnitsky\u2019s death\u2014plays himself.\n\nThe Daily Beast asked Nekrasov about how he got Karpov to agree to participate in an in-line question in the lengthy statement he sent responding to initial questions. He first declined to open the attachment for fear of hacking.\n\n\u201cWhen I at last got hold of [Karpov\u2019s] number and rang him up, he set no preconditions for being interviewed. He did listen carefully, though, to my long speech on the phone, about wanting to give his version of the story a fair chance,\u201d Nekrasov later wrote. \u201cAs for my own state of mind at that point in time, I was mainly after the scoop production value of having the guy in my show. I also wanted, ideally, to get some strong reaction from my actor on camera. Someone playing a villain, meeting the real thing.\u201d\n\nBrowder says Europe\u2019s strong anti-defamation laws, which often apply to both living and dead people, helped stop the screening in Brussels after his legal team pointed out the factual flaws. But Nekrasov and his allies claim that the billionaire Browder bullied their little film into near-obscurity.\n\nExcept not quite. The film was still shown in Norway\u2014and in D.C. at the Newseum in the screening was introduced by veteran journalist Sy Hersh.\n\nBut Browder says he doesn\u2019t think Nekrasov is an agent of the Russian state.\n\n\u201cIn my view, he has no political views whatsoever,\u201d Browder told The Daily Beast.\n\nNekrasov says he remains independent.\n\n\u201cI am a consistent critic of oligarchic capitalist system that has robbed the Russian people and have introduced a \u2018culture\u2019 of neo-slavery in the country,\u201d Nekrasov said. \u201cBill Browder is, or at least, most certainly was, a part of that oligarchic-capitalist system.\u201d\n\nBefore Nekrasov began working on the Magnitsky film, he agreed to work on a documentary about the fall of the Soviet Union with American journalist David Satter. It was supposed to be based on Satter\u2019s book, Age of Delirium. Satter had no filmmaking experience, so he reached out to Nekrasov for help.\n\nThey\u2019d gotten to know one another when Nekrasov based his documentary about 1999 apartment building bombings in Moscow heavily around a recorded interview with Satter. In the documentary, Nekrasov advances the idea that the bombings, which killed 293 people and were blamed on Chechen extremists, were actually orchestrated by Russian security services to cement Putin\u2019s grip on power. (Nekrasov told The Daily Beast he stands by those films.)\n\n\u201cWhy is it important [to the FSB] that he made a movie about the bombings?\u201d Satter asked. \u201cBecause they can later use him later for other purposes, and he'll have high believability.\u201d\n\nSatter says they were connected for that taping by Alexander Goldfarb, a Russian opposition figure close to oligarch Boris Berezovsky. (Attempts to reach Goldfarb for comment were unsuccessful.)\n\nGoldfarb asked if a German film crew could tape Satter at a book talk, Satter told The Daily Beast. Nekrasov holds German citizenship, according to Satter.\n\nThe story of Berezovsky and Nekrasov is a tale of post-Soviet intrigue.\n\nBerezovsky rode the wave of post-Soviet privatization to wealth and power. He was even a booster of Putin in his rise to power, and won a seat in the Duma, or Russian parliament, on a pro-Putin platform in 2000. But the men had a falling out shortly after Putin became president.\n\nBerezovsky was soon living in the U.K. in exile, hurling accusations at Putin, including the claim that the 1999 bombings were orchestrated to help Putin cement his grip on power. Berezovsky got asylum in the U.K. in 2003.\n\nBerezovsky was also linked to another of Nekrasov\u2019s projects: a film on the poisoning of ex-FSB lieutenant colonel Alexander Litvinenko.\n\nLike Berezovsky, Litvinenko was a man of the system who\u2019d fallen out with it. In 1998, Litvinenko claimed to have uncovered a plot within the FSB to kill Berezovsky. Litvinenko subsequently fled to Britain, where he joined Berezovsky in allegations that the 1999 Moscow apartment building bombings were a government plot, and wrote other books criticizing Putin and the FSB.\n\nIn 2006, Litvinenko was killed by Russian assassins in London with a lethal dose of radioactive polonium in his tea.\n\nNekrasov began to work on a film about Litvinenko\u2019s murder. The movie, which like much of Nekrasov\u2019s work, features the filmmaker as a main character, starts with an apparent threat to Nekrasov\u2019s life because of his work on Litvinenko\u2019s death.\n\nSatter entered into an agreement with two of Nekrasov\u2019s production companies in 2005 to produce the film based on his book, according to an arbitration statement filed as part of a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court. The Hudson Institute, where Satter works, contributed $300,000 for the project and Nekrasov agreed to contribute \u20ac76,500, according to the statement. Satter hoped to put out the film in 2011, for the 20th anniversary of the collapse of the USSR.\n\nBut five years later, Satter said he still hadn\u2019t even gotten a draft from Nekrasov. The lawsuit accuses Nekrasov of faked illnesses, broken promises, and evasive statements, after which Satter was left to finish the film on his own.\n\n\u201cHe dragged out the process of making the film for years, constantly finding other things to do, spending the film\u2019s money, and finally disappeared,\u201d Satter told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd went to work on another film of the same subject.\u201d\n\nThe suit adds that Nekrasov would not account for the $300,000 in funding that had gone into the project. And it claims that the grant which Nekrasov said his portion would come from \u201cdid not exist.\u201d\n\nA New York judge confirmed the arbitration finding in July 2013, ordering Nekrasov\u2019s companies to pay Satter $94,340. Satter says he hasn\u2019t seen a penny of it. He also says he connected Nekrasov with dissidents only to later see their interviews in a film that spoke positively of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nNekrasov said he disputed many of Satter\u2019s claims, and said he often worked for free on the underfunded project. He also said he was unaware of the suit and any other legal action against him.\n\nWhen provided with a copy of the ruling in the case, Nekrasov said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable opening documents sent via email attachment.\n\n\u201cThey are NOT my companies! Absolutely not,\u201d Nekrasov wrote. \u201cSo I was right, the law suite involved companies, not myself. That is why they can\u2019t enforce that ruling, I suppose.\u201d\n\nThe website for one of the companies, Dreamscanner, loads to a page for Nekrasov\u2019s late wife.\n\nBerezovsky, the key figure behind at least two of Nekrasov\u2019s films, died in 2013. He was found hanging in his Berkshire home.", "description": "Andrei Nekrasov made a movie accusing Putin of bombing Moscow, then a \"documentary\" accusing Sergei Magnitsky of being the real criminal.
