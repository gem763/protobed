The Craziest Theory of the Trump Era, Explained", "language": "en", "text": "Plotters in the deep state tried to shoot down Air Force One and foil President Trump\u2019s North Korea summit. A cabal of global elites, including top figures in Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the intelligence agencies, are responsible for nearly all the evil in the world. And now Trump is going to fix it all with thousands of sealed indictments, sending the likes of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama straight to Guantanamo Bay.\n\nOr at least that\u2019s how the world is going for the believers of QAnon, the complex pro-Trump conspiracy theory that\u2019s starting to having unpredictable effects in real life. The real news can be bad for Trump, but in QAnon-world, the president and his supporters really are getting sick of winning.\n\nWho Is \u201cQ\u201d?\n\nQAnon springs from a series of cryptic clues that started to be posted online in October 2017. Starting on 4Chan before migrating to the even more fringe 8Chan, the anonymous person behind the clues goes by \u201cQ,\u201d a reference to a high-level government security clearance. The \u201cAnon\u201d in \u201cQAnon\u201d refers to both Q himself, and to Q\u2019s nameless supporters, the \u201canons.\u201d\n\nQ is supposed to be revealing this top-secret information via the clues, which QAnon fans have dubbed \u201cbreadcrumbs.\u201d They\u2019re written in a short bursts, in a reference-heavy style that\u2019s part poem, part ransom note. Here\u2019s one example from June:\n\nThink SC vote to confirm (coming). No Name action. Every dog has its day. Enjoy the show. Q\n\n\u201cNo Name\u201d is Q\u2019s nickname for John McCain, and \u201cSC\u201d is obviously the Supreme Court. As for \u201cevery dog has its day\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of cryptic Q remark that has spawned a cottage industry of PDFs and 24/7 livestreams analyzing the crumbs.\n\nSince Q could be anyone with internet access and a working knowledge of conspiracy theories, there\u2019s no reason to think that Q is a member of the Trump administration rather than, say, a troll or YouTube huckster. But incredibly, lots of people believe it.\n\nIn April, hundreds of QAnon believers staged a march in downtown Washington, D.C. with a vague demand for \u201ctransparency\u201d from the Justice Department. \u201cQ\u201d shirts have become frequent sites at Trump rallies, with one QAnon believer scoring VIP access. In June, an armed man in an homemade armored truck shut down a highway near the Hoover Dam and held up signs referencing QAnon. And celebrities like comedian Roseanne Barr and former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling have signed on.\n\nQAnon is unusual, according to University of Miami professor Joseph Uscinski, because it offers Republicans an alternate view of the world when they already control nearly the entire government. Usually, \u201cconspiracy theories are for losers,\u201d Uscinski said,\n\n\u201cNormally you don\u2019t expect the winning party to use them, except when they\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Uscinski said.\n\nThe Origin Story\n\nSince Q\u2019s \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d are so vague, it\u2019s impossible to nail down exactly what the storyline is supposed to be. But the general story, outlined in a pro-QAnon video endorsed by Schilling, is that every president before Trump was a \u201ccriminal president\u201d in league with all the nefarious groups of conspiracy theories past: the global banking elite, death squads operating on orders from Hillary Clinton, deep-state intelligence operatives, and Pizzagate-style pedophile rings. In an effort to break this cabal\u2019s grip, according to Q, the military convinced Trump to run for president.\n\nNow Trump and his allies in the military are poised to arrest all these wrongdoers, shipping many of them off to Guantanamo Bay. That coming purge has been dubbed \u201cThe Storm\u201d by QAnon fans, who claim Trump referenced it when he referenced \u201cthe calm before the storm\u201d in October.\n\nWhile the Storm is at the center of the QAnon narrative, it\u2019s also flexible enough to fold in just anything that makes the news. Q is fond of hinting that each mass shooting is a false-flag attack organized by the cabal, and he used a blurry webcam picture of a flash of light near the Puget Sound to claim that the deep state had tried to shoot down Trump\u2019s plane.\n\nQAnon fans are obsessed with finding proof that whoever is behind Q is actually connected to the Trump administration. During one Trump trip to Asia, Q posted some pictures of islands, which supporters seized on as proof that Q was on Air Force One. Q is also fond of predicting Trump tweets that, in retrospect, don\u2019t exactly require top-secret clearance \u2014 that Trump will tweet \u201cSaturday\u201d on Small Business Saturday, or \u201cJuneteenth\u201d on June 19th.\n\nFans also point to Trump using phrases \u201cpredicted\u201d by Q as proof of the story\u2019s legitimacy. After one supporter requested that Trump used the phrase \u201ctip top\u201d in the State of the Union Address, While Trump never said \u201ctip top\u201d in that speech, QAnon supporters felt vindicated three months later when Trump said it instead at the White House Easter Egg Roll. QAnon supporters have even claimed Trump uses his hands to make a \u201cQ\u201d sign as a signal to them.\n\nQAnon supporters love to speculate about Q\u2019s identity, predicting that it\u2019s either a highly placed White House staffer or even Trump himself. Other, more mundane theories about Q\u2019s identity abound, but there\u2019s not much compelling evidence pointing in any direction.\n\nEven when Q\u2019s predictions disappoint, the QAnon community keeps going. Q hyped up the release of the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general report on the FBI\u2019s Hillary Clinton email investigation, for example, promising that it would contain the promised \u201cStorm\u201d of revelations about top Democrats and the deep state. When the report fizzled, however, Q promised that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a frequent target of QAnon jabs, had tampered with the report. Trump had the real report, Q claimed, and that report\u2019s release would solve everything.\n\nDecoding It All\n\nWhile QAnon has been the breakout conspiracy theory of the Trump era, not everyone on the right is on board. The farcical nature of QAnon\u2019s clues has tended to alienate many younger, more internet-savvy people on the right, including members of the alt-right. QAnon also alienated a swathe of the right-wing conspiracy theory internet after Q denounced other internet personalities who had been speculating about the clues, accusing them of trying to profit off the movement. But QAnon has been a hit with older Trump supporters, leading to tech-illiterate baby boomers looking to spread the QAnon gospel asking for help in internet forums on \u201chow to meme.\u201d\n\nNine months after it started, QAnon world has accumulated an internal language of its own. The moderators of the QAnon forums and the interpreters of the clues call themselves \u201cbakers,\u201d a reference to the \u201cbreadcrumbs.\u201d QAnon followers are fixated on which public officials are \u201cwhite hats\u201d or \u201cblack hats,\u201d meaning whether they\u2019re really working for Trump or are agents of the cabal. They urge one another to \u201cfollow the white rabbit,\u201d which made Trump delivering his \u201ctip top\u201d speech next to the Easter Bunny all the more portentous.\n\nQAnon believers even have a slogan, \u201cWhere we go one, we go all,\u201d which they often abbreviate to \u201cWWG1WGA.\u201d It\u2019s become a rallying cry for QAnon fans that Q has attributed to President John F. Kennedy, although it actually appears to come from the 1996 action movie White Squall.\n\nThat community of people deciphering the clues seems to be as important to QAnon believers as Q\u2019s message itself. On QAnon forums, believers talk about the idea that the cabal they believe is responsible for most of the trouble in the United States will soon be swept away has given them hope. Despite obviously being fake, then, it doesn\u2019t look like QAnon is going to go away anytime soon.", "description": "From celebrities to the grassroots, the right is obsessed with the idea there is a secret conspiracy where Hillary is headed for Gitmo.
