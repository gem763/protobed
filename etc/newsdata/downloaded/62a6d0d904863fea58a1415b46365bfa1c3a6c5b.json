A key event was the shelving of the WeWork IPO on September 30.\n\nWeWork, which was seeking a market valuation of about $US12 billion, has since been rescued by its major shareholder, Japan\u2019s Softbank. The demise of its IPO hurt confidence.\n\nThe WeWork debacle was a key event this week in market sentiment. Bloomberg\n\nSentiment is one of the many nebulous things in financial markets. It can turn bullish to bearish very quickly.\n\nLatitude Financial, which was seeking total offer proceeds of $1 billion in its IPO this month, is a case study of the speed of change in sentiment among large institutional investors.\n\nChanticleer has previously argued that the market turned away from Latitude because of a change in attitude towards sustainable business models.\n\nThe death throes of the Latitude IPO, which occurred in the week beginning October 14, exposed another issue of major concern to equity capital market bankers.\n\nOn the morning of October 14, the Latitude issue price was slashed from a range of $2.20 to $2.25, to $1.78 in a bid to get the deal away. At midday the bankers handling the float told the owners and management the book was covered sufficiently to support the stock in the aftermarket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe general rule of thumb is a successful IPO needs to have 30 per cent excess demand on top of the proceeds. In Latitude\u2019s case this was about $1.3 billion.\n\nBut between midday and 4pm, the Latitude IPO died. This tells you the communication or feedback loop between institutional investors and the bankers broke down.\n\nOne plausible explanation is that the structural changes in the market caused by the introduction of stricter rules on IPO research by analysts working for the investment banks handling the sale may have left the bankers in the dark about the mood in the market.\n\nLast year the securities regulator changed the rules for IPO research. As a result, IPO research cannot contain stock valuations. Instead, the IPO research has become lengthy summaries of the information in the prospectus.\n\nPreviously, analysts were the conduit for conveying institutional investor views on market valuations. Latitude went from having its share price slashed by 20 per cent to being unsaleable in the space of four hours.\n\nAnother big factor in Latitude\u2019s failure was the complete evaporation in foreign demand. When Latitude first tried the IPO in 2018 it had about $500 million in firm foreign demand. This time around it barely reached $50 million.\n\nPotential foreign investors were said to have baulked at the regulatory risks posed to the business from an aggressive Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nThe demise of the PropertyGuru IPO can be explained as a company specific problem and not a symbol of broader problems in the market for raising primary capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt had two things going against it. First, it was overpriced. Its valuation was in line with some of the absurd prices that have been paid for other loss-making tech companies.\n\nSecond, Australian investors have always been wary of Asian-based property plays. Parochialism has served fund managers well in the past because offshore ventures have a particularly high failure rate.\n\nMarket cynicism towards sky-high valuations is reflected in the sell-off over the past six months of previously high-flying tech stocks. Many tech stocks have fallen significantly even without attacks on their business models by short sellers.\n\nThe other trend that has changed sentiment in financial markets is the return to favour of value stocks. This has occurred in equity capital markets overseas as well as in Australia.\n\nValue investors have long argued that they would once again have their time in the sun. That appears to be happening now.", "description": "Investors have become more selective, but there is not an investment strike.The poor IPO market has not stopped Australia having the third best stockmarket.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d8906ffb605c535942e9a69a03f185ccf89b2cc1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
