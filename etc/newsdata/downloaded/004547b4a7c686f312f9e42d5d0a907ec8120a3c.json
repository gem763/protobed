The purchase of each kit will see a minimum donation of $3.75 made to the Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF), a non-profit founded by Rihanna, to help fund research and support for breast cancer survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSavage X Fenty is also raising awareness by spotlighting a group of four women living with breast cancer, dubbed the \"thrivers.\" The social campaign sees them share their own personal stories of strength and resilience in relation to the disease.\n\n\n\n\"I want to raise awareness for under-served breast cancer communities and the Savage X Thrivers represent young women of all walks of life living and thriving with cancer,\" Rihanna told British Vogue.\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time Rihanna has used her brands to support important causes -- her \u2018Fenty Beauty by Rihanna' label has also contributed to the Clara Lionel Foundation in the past. Last year, the brand launched a special \u2018Diamond Ballout' version of its \u2018Killawatt Highlighter,' which saw 100% of the proceeds directed towards helping to fund health, education, and emergency response programs throughout the world.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see https://www.savagex.com/sxfthrivers", "description": "Rihanna's lingerie brand Savage X Fenty is joining the fight against breast cancer this October.
