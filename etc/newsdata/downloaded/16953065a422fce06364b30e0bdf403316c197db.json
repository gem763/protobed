The new device creates a map of your home for more effective cleaning. Shortly after the launch of the Roomba i7, SharkNinka launched the Shark IQ Robot, which utilizes a very similar home-scanning system, at a much lower price.\n\niRobot has asked a judge to issue an order, which would require SharkNinja to remove the Shark IQ Robot from the market. iRobot claims that SharkNinja has infringed on many of its patents.\n\n\u201cWhile it may have been easy for Shark to rush its copycat product in time for the holiday sales season, it will be impossible for iRobot to recoup its losses\u201d if the case drags out for a year or more, iRobot said in a complaint against SharkNinja.\n\nThe Roomba i7 retails at $999.99 and and the SharkNinja IQ Robot retails at $449.40. SharkNinja filed a counterclaim on Friday in a Delaware court in which it argued that it did not infringe upon iRobot\u2019s patents. The company claims that its product was developed through its own proprietary research and development process.", "description": "The maker of the Roomba robotic vacuum has filed a lawsuit against a startup company called SharkNinja, claiming it is infringing on its patents for smart home cleaning devices.
