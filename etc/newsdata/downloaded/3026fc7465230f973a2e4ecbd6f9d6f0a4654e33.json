That comes with a bit of experience and learning about yourself.\n\n\u201cI probably worried too much about things when I was younger. You probably expect things a lot more to go your way, expect things to happen the way you thought they would happen, whereas rugby's not a game like that. Anything can happen on Saturday and you want to be open enough to be ready for that.\n\n\u201cI think nerves play a part but when you walk out there, get out there and it's about to kick off, you can't wait. You're into the game, you're 100 per cent what's happening at that time and nerves, when you start thinking about what could happen or what could be... when you're in it, you're in it. That's the way you want to try to practise to be all the way through the week.\u201d\n\nThe questions surrounding Farrell\u2019s form and leadership dissipated into the Oita atmosphere last weekend as he produced his best showing for England so far this campaign, though not far behind him were two of his Saracens teammates. It is no surprise that a number of players within this squad of 31, who collectively have never appeared in a World Cup semi-final before, look to the six long-serving Saracens players for that big-game experience in the hope of following the example they have set at domestic and European level.\n\nThat certainly applies to Mako and Billy Vunipola. The two have that same big-game experience as Farrell behind them, but they also have the individual memories of what it took to get to Japan. Both suffered long and multiple injury lay-offs over the last two years that leaves them knowing they cannot pass up a chance like the one in front of them.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view it was a journey I was on and I have just tried to keep my head down and try and get back into this team,\u201d Billy said on Thursday. \u201cIt was a case of getting over the injuries and trying to get back into the team and that has been driving me all along. It is part and parcel of the sport to get injuries but I seemed to get them in one go, not one at a time.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, older brother Mako will watch on as his sibling leads England out against the All Blacks in recognition of what will be his 50th cap. Unsurprisingly, Billy has not given the landmark much time at all, explaining that \u201cit isn\u2019t something I have put a lot of thought into yet because my focus has been on trying to help the team\u201d, but there was even less coming his way from 62-cap Mako. This weekend, brotherly love is definitely off the menu.\n\n\u201cThere have been some bumps along the road and it is a great achievement, although I didn\u2019t realise it was his 50th cap until I was told on the way in,\u201d said Mako. \u201cIt\u2019s nice for him but we are just both looking forward to going out and helping the team and it\u2019s not a small feat, not many people achieve that, and it is something we can celebrate after the game.\u201d\n\nBut what the Vunipolas do recognise is how important each other are to what England will try to do to the All Blacks. Billy spoke glowingly last week of how he plays better when Mako is able to be his \u201cshield\u201d on the pitch, and though he was still keen to joke with his brother\u2019s words, he knows exactly how important the No 8 is to England\u2019s chances of reaching the World Cup final.\n\n\u201cIf I am the shield, he must be talking himself up as the sword,\u201d Mako added. \u201cHe gives us a lot in terms of momentum as well as helping stop the momentum in the other team, and that is going to be key against the All Blacks because teams find it difficult to do to stop them. It is going to be a big battle.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not one that either got to experience last autumn due to injury, but when the decisive moments arise on Saturday, England will be hoping to see Farrell, Billy and Mako leading the charge.", "description": "Owen Farrell believes England\u00a0have learned the ability to adapt within a match that has proven to be their biggest hurdle during the Eddie Jones era, with Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final with New Zealand\u00a0the perfect platform to put that claim to the ultimate test.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/17/owen-farrell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
