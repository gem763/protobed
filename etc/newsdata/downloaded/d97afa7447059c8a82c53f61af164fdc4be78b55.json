also known as gum disease.\n\nHe said she needed some teeth out and extractions were planned for her next appointment - but she didn't come in for another four years.\n\nThe patient came back June 5 2017, complaining of her \"teeth falling out\".\n\nShe told him she was taking Warfarin to treat a condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes blood clotting.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe GDC heard how Mr Patel did not carry out checks in line with industry-standard guidelines to assess the patient's risk of post-operative bleeding.\n\nMr Patel extracted five of the patient's teeth on July 13 and five teeth on July 18.\n\nHe however failed to discuss or record discussions, about her bleeding history and failed to advise her of the increased risk of bleeding following the extractions, the panel heard.\n\nAccording to the GDC's report, Warfarin has been widely used for more than 50 years and the risk of postoperative bleeding complications is of concern to dentists.\n\nAfter having the final five teeth removed by Mr Patel in June 2017, the patient experienced extensive bleeding from the extraction sites, the report said.\n\nHer wounds were not packed or sutured following the treatment, on July 13 or July 18 it added.\n\nThe patient attended A&E at King's College Hospital in London, on July 18, but was discharged following treatment to attempt to stop the bleeding.\n\nBut after collapsing at home during the early hours of July 19 she was taken to King's College Hospital by ambulance but medics were unable to save her life, and she was pronounced dead at 9.26am on July 19.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Blend Images)\n\nOn March 21 2018 a coroner ruled the medical cause of death was haemorrhage from the tooth extraction site and Warfarin treatment and dental extraction.\n\nA registered dentist provided evidence at the GDC hearing to give opinion on whether Mr Patel's conduct fell short during the patient's treatment.\n\nThe dentist, Ms Glass, said Mr Patel should have paced and/or sutured the wounds and should have \"taken steps to manage Patient A's risk of bleeding\".\n\nMr Patel accepted \"the most serious consequences of your actions\" and admitted the allegations put to him, the report said.\n\nThe GDC charged Mr Patel and found a total of eight charges relating to his treatment of Patient A.\n\nThe panel found all of the charged were proved.\n\nThey relate to his treatment of the patient and how he failed to properly consider her medical history and increased risk of bleeding.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe panel found him impaired to work, the report said.\n\nIt added: \"The committee takes a serious view of the findings against you.\n\n\"There were multiple errors and a failure to follow the appropriate guidance.\n\n\"These were basic errors which placed the patient at significant risk of harm.\n\n\"This was not a single error, but a catalogue of errors.\n\n\"Patient A was a vulnerable patient and you failed to recognise this situation.\n\n\"Public confidence would be undermined if a finding of impairment were not made.\n\n\"The committee has determined that your fitness to practice is currently impaired by reason of your misconduct.\"\n\nA GDC hearing report ruled Mr Patel breached clinical care and decided his behaviour is \"fundamentally incompatible with remaining on the register\".\n\nMr Patel's registration to practice was suspended for the maximum period available to the panel - 12 months.\n\nHe has expressed remorse and has apologised to the patient's family, the GDC report said.\n\nPending an appeal by Mr Patel, the suspension will start on November 11, 2019.\n\nMr Patel graduated from Sheffield University in 1986 with a degree in dental surgery and was a dentist at Confidential Clinics in Purley, Surrey.\n\nHe has no previous fitness to practice history.", "description": "Tushar Patel, a dentist at Confidential Clinics in Purley, Surrey, breached clinical care and ignored guidance \"well-known to dentists\"", "authors": ["Jack Longstaff", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Paul Davey", "Swns", "Google", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Blend Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20680867.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_TUSHAR_PATEL_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
