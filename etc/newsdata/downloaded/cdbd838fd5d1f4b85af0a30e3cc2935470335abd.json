(Michael Dwyer)\n\nDavid Ortiz will return to Fox as a studio analyst for Major League Baseball\u2019s 2019 postseason \u2014 nearly four months after he was shot in the back at a nightclub in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe beloved slugger spent the majority of his 20-year playing career with the Boston Red Sox and retired in 2016. He joined the Fox broadcast as a guest analyst for the 2014 World Series and has been a staple of the network\u2019s MLB coverage since. The three-time World Series champion has had some memorable moments on-air; such as when he and Alex Rodriguez recounted the 2004 American League Championship Series in 2018.\n\nBoston famously rebounded from a 3-0 series deficit against Rodriguez\u2019s Yankees that year and would go on to win their first World Series since 1918. Ortiz was named Most Valuable Player of the series after a pair of walk-off hits to keep the Red Sox in it.\n\n\u201cThis is the most torturous segment I\u2019ve ever done in my Fox career; thanks Papi,\u201d Rodriguez joked.\n\nOrtiz, a native of the Dominican Republic, hinted at his own return in a tweet Tuesday, which included a photo of him, Rodriguez, Kevin Burkhardt, Alex Rodriguez and Frank Thomas in the studio.\n\nSpeaking to the the Boston Globe on Sept. 7 \u2014 his first interview with an English-language publication since he was shot \u2014 Ortiz described the calamity that took place at the scene of the Santo Domingo bar in June. A bullet struck Oritz in the back at close range and rendered him unable to flee or move. It tore through his gallbladder, intestines and liver, requiring a six-hour emergency surgery to save his life.\n\nSince then he\u2019s been through two more surgeries, including treatment for a nearly-lethal bacterial infection that affected his digestive system. He was unable to keep food down for seven weeks and received nourishment through feeding tubes. Though he has made strides in recovery and several suspects were arrested in connection with the attack, Ortiz told the Globe his physical and psychological wounds have lingered.\n\nAuthorities later said Ortiz was a victim of mistaken identity and the shooter intended to target a friend, who wore similar clothing.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand, this isn\u2019t a movie where you get shot in the street and you\u2019re back two minutes later,\u201d Ortiz told the Globe. \u201cNo, I got shot and almost died. I only have one life to live. I can\u2019t just go to the pharmacy and buy another one.\u201d Ortiz has said he expects to make a full physical recovery by Thanksgiving.\n\n[David Ortiz opens up about near-fatal shooting: \u2018I started losing hope\u2019]\n\nOn Sept. 9, Ortiz threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park in his first public appearance since being hospitalized.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to thank God for giving me a second opportunity in my life to be able to be here with all of you,\u201d Ortiz said, addressing a raucous crowd. \u201cI want to thank the Red Sox, my real family. They have always been there for me, supporting me. They were aware of what happened to me and they were the first ones there supporting me.\u201d\n\nJacob Bogage contributed to this report.\n\nRead More MLB:\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nSaddest Nats fan was destined to become a meme.
