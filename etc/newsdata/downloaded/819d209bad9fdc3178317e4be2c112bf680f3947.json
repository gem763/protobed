It isn\u2019t even decorative gourds. When fall comes around, I most look forward to one thing: wearing a turtleneck every day.\n\nTwo years later, my turtleneck wardrobe has only grown, and my compulsive habit of buying them shows no signs of stopping. From the moment the temperature drops below 60 degrees to the day it rises above 60 again, my neck stays safely ensconced in a turtleneck. To my mind, a turtleneck epitomizes a perfect union between utility and style. It can convey bookish charm, as when worn by shopkeeper Kathleen Kelly (played by Meg Ryan) in You\u2019ve Got Mail. It can suggest cool severity, as on Liv Ullmann in Persona. It can express sporty preppiness, as on Renata Adler, whose turtleneck-under-oxford look is as iconic as her long braid. And all the while, it keeps your neck warm. If there\u2019s such a thing as a \u201cface-framing\u201d haircut, I\u2019d say a turtleneck is a face-framing shirt. It\u2019s like a pedestal for your face. Any turtleneck collection should be broken into three categories: staying-in turtlenecks, leaving-the-house turtlenecks, and going-out turtlenecks. Below are my latest favorites.\n\nStaying-in turtlenecks\n\nStaying-in turtlenecks are the white T-shirt of these tops \u2014 simplicity is the point. I buy them in neutral colors and layer them under crewneck sweaters (and under turtleneck sweaters, for that matter).\n\nUniqlo 1*1 Ribbed Cotton Turtleneck Long-Sleeved T-Shirt It\u2019s the classic! And it seems to sell out every year, so stock up on your favorite colors early, then pick up some of the leftover colors when they\u2019re marked down at the end of the season. $15 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nJ.Crew Perfect Fit Turtleneck Another classic, with some brighter colors available. $40 at J. Crew Buy\n\nJ.Crew Tissue Turtleneck T-Shirt in Stripes I bought a navy micro-stripe turtleneck like this at J.Crew years ago, and it\u2019s still surprisingly one of the items I reach for most in fall and winter. It can be read in a lot of ways: \u201970s retro, slightly kooky art teacher, New England preppy, French casual. And when layered under a sweater, it looks a little less staid than a solid might. $40 at J. Crew Buy\n\nUniqlo Women's Heattech Fleece Turtleneck Long-Sleeved T-Shirt This would be useful if you find yourself making that apple-picking pilgrimage to Dutchess County on a particularly chilly day. I\u2019ve always thought the beige has a slight Eckhaus Latta look to it, too. $20 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nEverlane The Air Turtleneck This is another basic option that would be ideal for layering under sweaters, and thanks to the \u201cair\u201d weight, it won\u2019t make you overheated when your radiator kicks on. $30 at Everlane Buy\n\nLeaving-the-house turtlenecks\n\nA cozy staying-in turtleneck gives you an excuse to putter around the house, but if you must venture outside, a leaving-the-house turtleneck is ideal. While a solid Uniqlo turt can absolutely be worn anywhere, these are a bit more substantial and interesting as stand-alone tops.\n\nEntireworld Turts and Caicos Sweater If you\u2019ve seen Something\u2019s Gotta Give, you know the iconic power of beige and ivory turtlenecks like the ones Diane Keaton wears on the beach in all temperatures. We would guess hers are from Eileen Fisher, but this beige Entireworld one captures the look too. $95 at Entireworld Buy\n\nEntireworld Turts and Caicos Sweater Light Green If you prefer something that will give you some color, this light-green version is spring-y. $95 at Entireworld Buy\n\n& Other Stories Stretch-Rib Mock-Neck Top A similar (and less expensive) option, with just the slightest ruffle, that also comes in black and white. $39 at & Other Stories Buy\n\nJ.Crew Tissue Turtleneck in Floral $35 (was $40, now 13% off) A pretty, dark floral that would layer nicely under a blazer. $35 at J. Crew Buy\n\nCOS Roll-Neck Ribbed Top When I saw the neck on this one, I said, \u201cWow.\u201d $99 at COS Buy\n\nHidden Forest Market Colorblock Turtleneck Top A turtleneck the color of an actual turtle with a charming contrasting neck. $84 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Madewell Turtleneck Bodysuit If you want to ensure that your tucked-in turt doesn\u2019t budge, try a turtleneck bodysuit. $50 at Madewell Buy\n\nGoing-out turtlenecks\n\nTwo years ago, when I first admitted to a turtleneck obsession, the going-out turtleneck seemed like a newly emerging category. Now, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in something of a going-out-turtleneck boom, with plenty of fun, bright, sheer, and slinky options. It may sound counterintuitive to wear a shirt that conceals the entire upper half of your body when you\u2019re trying to look hot, but a going-out turtleneck has a smart allure that the typical going-out top lacks.\n\n& Other Stories Fitted Stretch Turtleneck The spandex in this one gives it a little sheen; imagine how nice it would look on the dance floor. $39 at & Other Stories Buy\n\nBCBGMAXAZRIA Geometric-Print Turtleneck Top If M.C. Escher were into turtlenecks, we bet he would have liked this one. $88 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nOur Legacy Slim Turtleneck in Red Airwool This gauzy number from Our Legacy\u2019s women\u2019s line could be layered with a bodysuit or bra, depending on how much you want to show (and if you wear it with a shirt underneath, it would probably be fine for work, too). $215 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\nNanushka Madi Printed Mesh Tee in Latte Animal This wavy-mesh turtleneck brings to mind a composition book, and the pattern is called the \u201cLatte Animal.\u201d What\u2019s not to like? $195 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\nJ.Crew Tissue Turtleneck in Leopard A less expensive animal print. $40 at J. Crew Buy\n\nDries Van Noten Hasker Turtleneck in Purple If one were to splurge on a turtleneck, this gorgeous autumnal one from Dries Van Noten would be a worthy candidate. $252 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\nH+M Modal Turtleneck Top A much less expensive dark floral turtleneck. $10 at H&M Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
