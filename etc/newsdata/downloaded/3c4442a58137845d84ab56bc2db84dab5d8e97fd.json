Is it just there to collect lint and fluff or is there a greater purpose for that button on my belly? And why does mine poke in while my friends' pokes out?\n\nWell hold onto your belly buttons because we\u2019re going to learn everything there is to know about them!\n\nInnie or outie?\n\nAn innie belly button and an outie belly button. (innie: Wikimedia/G.dallorto; outie: Photo credit: Kid Gibson on VisualHunt / CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nLook down at your tummy.\n\nYou might notice that your belly button pokes out and makes a little bump on your tummy (an outie).\n\nOr it's a dark hole that seems to go on forever into your belly (an innie). But is it just there for decoration?\n\nWhy do I even have a belly button?\n\nWhy am I stuck with this hole in my stomach? Good question!\n\nYour belly button is actually there for a very important reason. It goes all the way back to before you were even born!\n\nWhen a baby is growing inside a mother\u2019s womb, they are connected to their mom by a soft, bendy rope called the umbilical cord.\n\nThat cord is how the baby eats, breathes and gets rid of waste to help them develop.\n\nWhen the baby is born, they can drink milk, breathe air and get rid of their waste in a diaper. So they don\u2019t need the cord anymore!\n\nA doctor cuts the cord, so the baby is no longer connected to their mom. They tie or clamp the cord close to the baby\u2019s tummy.\n\nSince there are no nutrients going to the cord anymore, after a few weeks it dries up and falls off, leaving a belly button in its place!\n\nSo I can untie my belly button?\n\n(Kwanchai Chai-udom/123RF)\n\nNo! The belly button is kind of like a scar. You can't reopen your belly button.\n\nDepending on how the scar tissue forms will decide whether you have an innie or an outie!\n\nInnies are much more common. Only about 10 per cent of people have an outie! But 100 per cent of people have a belly button!\n\nDoes my belly button do anything?\n\nDoes it help me do more sit-ups? Can I breathe more with it? Can you untie it and see inside my tummy? All great guesses, but no.\n\nNow that you're older, the most your belly button does is collect bacteria.\n\nMicroorganisms (bacteria so small you can\u2019t see them) live all over your body. But a popular hangout spot for them is in your belly button.\n\nScientists are finding new species of microorganisms in belly buttons all the time.\n\nBut don\u2019t stress! The bacteria in your belly button isn\u2019t all bad.\n\nJust remember to wash your belly button to keep it sparkly clean.", "description": "Hold onto your belly buttons because we\u2019re going to learn everything there is to know about them!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidscbc2/content/the_feed/_848/innie_header.jpg"}
