She gained almost 40 places on the rankings ladder, climbing to No88, which should earn her direct entry into the Australian Open.\n\nWhile Johanna Konta has led the British challenge this season, clocking up 40 wins to date, Watson had made almost no impact at tour level before arriving in Tianjin. Along with seven first-round exits, her only victory had come against 17-year-old American Caty McNally in front of a supportive crowd at Wimbledon.\n\nBut as Watson explained after yesterday\u2019s 6-4, 6-4 defeat at the hands of Sweden\u2019s Rebecca Peterson, her form finally came together in last week\u2019s second-round match against Qiang Wang \u2013 the world No 22 and top seed in Tianjin.\n\n\u201cThat was some of the best tennis I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d said Watson of her 6-3, 6-0 upset win over Wang. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get this far as I hadn\u2019t had great results in Wuhan or Beijing, but it\u2019s been a great week for me. I\u2019m just in a really good place and I think that\u2019s showing in my results.\u201d", "description": "Heather Watson was defeated on Sunday in the final of China\u2019s Tianjin Open, but this was still a huge week for the British No 2.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212917449-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
