Your financial contributions support the organization\u2019s infrastructure, augment its political influence, and, in turn, legitimize all of its activities \u2013 not just the ones you like,\u201d she wrote.\n\nGoogle declined to offer new comment on the letter, and referred to previous statements on the issue.\n\nCastor closed her letter by pointing to Google\u2019s own website, and its declaration that the company was striving to \u201cbuild sustainability into everything we do\u201d.\n\n\u201cI urge you to apply this mantra when you make decisions about which thinktanks and organizations to support in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was not the only public response to the Guardian\u2019s report last week, which was part of a broader investigation into the fossil fuel industry, the structures behind it, and the climate emergency.\n\nActivists with Extinction Rebellion staged a protest in front of Google\u2019s London headquarters on Wednesday, with more than 100 mothers \u2013 and babies \u2013 staging a \u201cnurse-in\u201d to protest the company\u2019s funding of climate deniers.", "description": "Kathy Castor\u2019s letter to Sundar Pichai says it\u2019s hard to \u2018overstate the detrimental impact\u2019 groups have had on the climate debate", "authors": ["Stephanie Kirchgaessner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0e45b7e7583593edf92277fc0a37a5a3623026/0_199_4246_2549/master/4246.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71bba52b239b6ea8a2046f9ac070df52", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
