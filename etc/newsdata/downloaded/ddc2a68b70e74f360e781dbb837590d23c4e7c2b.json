(Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nIf you\u2019re planning a getaway, you might want to head to Siargao in the Philippines.\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s just been voted the best island in the world by Conde Nast Traveler readers.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going abroad, you might as well go to the best possible place.\n\nWe can see why Siargao is so popular. Just a quick look at photos reveals gorgeous white sand beaches and peaceful forests with a remote, untouched feel.\n\nThe island has a population of 200,000 and isn\u2019t overrun with tourists, making it a paradise for anyone keen for a genuine escape.\n\nThat does mean it can be a little tricky to get to.\n\nDoesn\u2019t it look dreamy? (Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nSiargao doesn\u2019t have an international airport, so to visit you\u2019d need to go to Manila, Singapore, Seoul, or Hong Kong, then get a little propeller plane flight which takes around two hours. You can find reasonably priced flights, but prepare for a full day and night of travel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s all worth it, though. As well as being absolutely stunning, the island is perfect for anyone who loves to surf.\n\nSiargao is known as the surfing capital of the Philippines, with 15 spots that are dreamy for catching a wave. There are plenty of surfing schools and places to rent boards so newbies can join in, too, and the crystal clear water also provides the perfect place to try paddle boarding or snorkeling.\n\nSiargao is known as the surfing capital of the Philippines (Picture: Getty)\n\nIf you don\u2019t fancy doing any water sports, you can just hike through the woodlands, laze on one of the many beaches, or snap pics by the rock pools at Magpupungko.\n\nIf for some reason none of this appeals, don\u2019t stress.
