After their latest loss, quarterback Baker Mayfield made some pointed public comments regarding mistakes that are causing too many penalties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just non-disciplined,\u201d Mayfield told reporters regarding the rash of penalties, \u201cguys not being focused on doing their job. It starts first and foremost with me, to be a leader every single down. Get our guys lined up, make sure that we\u2019re set, we\u2019re paying attention because if we can\u2019t use cadence we\u2019re hurting ourselves. Any time we try to use a double count, it seems like we\u2019re false starting a little bit, but we\u2019ll get the discipline part fixed, the accountability. Like I said, we\u2019ve pointed out the problem, now we have to execute it on Sundays. Once again, I feel like we had a great week of practice, we just didn\u2019t translate it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly simple concept, and it\u2019s unclear why it\u2019s happening. As Mayfield said, part of it falls to him. Part of it also falls to the coaching staff. Regardless, Mayfield has had enough of it.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cStuff that we\u2019ve already pointed out the problem and haven\u2019t fixed it? Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cVery frustrating. I hate to keep saying it again, but everything is in front of us. But to get to where we want to go, we\u2019ve got to take care of business one week at a time, and it starts tomorrow. It starts [with] preparation for the Broncos.\n\nSo what needs to happen to erase the mistakes?\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI just think everyone has to be singular focused on doing your job, not worrying about what\u2019s going on on the outside,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWe have to be willing to sacrifice the ultimate price to get to what we talked about preseason, our ultimate goals. We have to be able to sacrifice stuff each and every day. Time, focus. It\u2019s going to be a long stretch, but our guys are capable of doing that, and so it\u2019s my job to make sure we do that each and every day. Like I said earlier, it starts tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMayfield thinks that, ultimately, the indiviuals need to commit to doing what needs to be done.\n\n\u201c[W]e just need to be harder on ourselves,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cThe accountability thing is making sure everybody\u2019s locked in each and every play. I can\u2019t have eyes on everybody at every single time, neither can the coaches. It\u2019s got to be within the position groups in making sure everybody\u2019s in the right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s Mayfield, the coaches, or the makeup of the individual players, something is wrong with a Browns teams that entered the year with unreasonably high expectations. These lingering mistakes show just how unreasonably high the expectations were \u2014 and how badly the Browns failed to get them under control.\n\nUltimately, the Browns didn\u2019t accidentally become one of the worst teams in football. While much progress has been made, years of dysfunction can\u2019t quickly be wiped away, just because the team won some games it wasn\u2019t expected to win after ownership fired coach Hue Jackson. The team still needs the right collection of players and coaches to become what it was presumed to be \u2014 and the more players they acquire with a mindset like Mayfield\u2019s, the sooner they\u2019ll get to where they\u2019re trying to be.", "description": "The Browns have lost five of seven games.
