After all, when it comes to classic American food, the cheeseburger occupy a very special position, right up there with hot dogs and apple pie.\n\nBut which US fast food franchise offers the best-tasting version? We tried four famous examples.\n\nIn terms of flavor, ingredient quality, and overall satisfaction, can any of these quickie burgers really stand up to their exalted reputations? To determine the best cheeseburger, we sampled four from some of America's leading burger joints; namely Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s and Five Guys.\n\nBurger King Cheeseburger\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the fast-food chain so confident in its burgers that they chose to put that food item right in the name. The Burger King cheeseburger, priced at US$1.99, includes a \u201cflame-broiled\u201d patty, a slice of American cheese, two dill pickle chips, and a healthy swirl of ketchup.\n\nHaving not tried a Burger King burger in over a decade, I was (not-unpleasantly) surprised to discover that the \u201cflame-broiled\u201d patty does, in fact, have some smokiness in the flavor.\n\nThe burger\u2019s bun, however, pushed itself to the forefront and took over the entire eating experience. Burger King uses sesame-seed buns, which are a great idea \u2026 in theory. In actuality, in my opinion, the somewhat spongy bread made for a challenging mouth feel while also dampening the effect of the other ingredients.\n\nWendy's Jr. Cheeseburger\n\nThe Wendy\u2019s Jr. cheeseburger can be purchased for just US$1.49, making it the cheapest burger I purchased. And for less than a buck-fifty, you could do a lot worse in terms of flavor. I\u2019m a sucker for the classic Wendy\u2019s square-shaped beef patty, and the cheeseburger keeps it simple in terms of toppings; you\u2019ll just get a slice of American cheese, ketchup, dill pickle chips, and a ring of onion.\n\nLike the cheese used at Burger King, the cheese at Wendy\u2019s doesn\u2019t boast much flavor of any kind beyond a slightly salty kick, in my opinion. The ketchup on Wendy\u2019s burger brings a pleasant sweetness, and the round onion sliver and the pickles add textural contrast and an acidic brightness.\n\nOverall, this is a crushable burger.\n\nMcDonald's classic cheeseburger\n\nThis compact burger was my childhood go-to treat and the most familiar to Australians. Although I hadn\u2019t sampled one in many years, I imagined that returning to this cheeseburger paradise for this story would make for a lovely trip down memory lane.\n\nEven setting nostalgia aside, the McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger is a solid pick. It has the well-done patties, pickle chips, mild cheese, and squishy buns so popular among fast-food burgers, but McDonald\u2019s has two things working majorly in its favor: its ketchup and its onions. McDonald\u2019s ketchup possesses a unique flavor profile and texture that sets it apart from other versions; in my opinion, it\u2019s slightly tangier.\n\nAs for its onions, McDonald\u2019s uses diced onions rather than sliced ones, which brings that sharp onion funk to every single bite. This is a massive benefit, giving the McDonald\u2019s burger more personality than its closest competitors.\n\nFive Guys Five Guys single-patty cheeseburger\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that distinguishes the Five Guys Cheeseburger from the other sandwiches in this taste test. First, Five Guys isn\u2019t really a \u201cfast-food\u201d burger joint. Instead, it straddles the line between fast food and \u201cfast casual.\u201d\n\nEverything\u2019s made fresh, you can customize your burgers with numerous veggies, condiments, and other add-ons, and the price point \u2013 my simple single-patty cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and pickles set me back US$7.15 \u2013 puts it in a different category than the under $2 versions at Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, and McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe Five Guys cheeseburger has honest, unconditional foodie cred. The freshly-grilled patty packed plenty of umami and a welcome hint of smoke, the cheese had a strong taste, the tomatoes were juicy, the lettuce crunched when we bit into it, and the ketchup and pickles brightened the other flavors rather than overwhelming them.\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter trying the four cheeseburgers, I decided Five Guys was the best and worth its higher price tag. It\u2019s a quality burger at a relatively-gentle price, and it\u2019s the one I\u2019d actively seek out for future noshing.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Business Insider.", "description": "If you ever end up in the US for a holiday or work, it pays to try one of their iconic cheeseburgers.
