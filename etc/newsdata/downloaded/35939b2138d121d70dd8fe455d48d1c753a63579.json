Photo: Netflix/Netflix\n\nLight spoilers for The King \u2014 including the fate of Robert Pattinson\u2019s character \u2014 below.\n\nCasting Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Robert Pattinson in a movie \u2014 the very same movie! \u2014 can only be understood as a targeted attack. A movie with two razor-sharp jaws; two tall, lanky boys; two alabaster complexions. And yet: here comes The King, a movie basically committed to sending stan Twitter into cardiac arrest. The King is mostly fine, occasionally good, but: It features one incredible, hilarious Robert Pattinson performance.\n\nIt seems like we\u2019re all in agreement these days, believing that Robert Pattinson is one of his generation\u2019s most versatile actors. Every Pattinson performance \u2014 be it Twilight, Good Time, High Life, or something else \u2014 is a little different, but they all have a similar whiff of mischief. This year he has two movies in which he gives otherwise diametrically opposed performances: In The Lighthouse, a movie that a friend described as \u201csorta like Paul Dano and Daniel Day-Lewis yelling at each other in There Will Be Blood, but, like a whole movie of that,\u201d he\u2019s a demented Willem Dafoe\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, slowly losing grip with reality, stuck on a rock and having sexual fantasies about mermaids. In The King, he\u2019s the playfully obstinate Dauphin, the rival of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Henry V.\n\n\u201cI just had a feeling he would make it fun,\u201d Mich\u00f4d said during the movie\u2019s press conference at the Venice Film Festival in September. \u201cI needed that. He is a supporting character. He doesn\u2019t appear in the movie until an hour in. It was very, very important to me that when he did appear it was with razzle-dazzle.\u201d A razzle has never been dazzled like this since Richard Gere opened his mouth to (not really) carry a tune in Chicago. Robert Pattinson twirls and pirouettes on top of the (capital V, capital S) Very Serious King. Let everyone else scheme and scowl; the Dauphin knows he has to do it to \u2019em.\n\nNearly a year ago, Pattinson teased the details of his performance, and he did not undersell it: \u201cI\u2019m playing a kind of effete prince with a much more glamorous outfit,\u201d he told Vulture at High Life\u2019s New York Film Festival U.S. premiere. \u201cThere are all these kind of rugged men and I\u2019m in this little frilly frock.\u201d True, The King is extremely full of dudes, and many of them are sinewy and strong. This is a movie where daddy issues resolve themselves not in therapy but through international diplomacy, where men constantly try to kill each other, where men constantly wear dark, earthy tones. And then the Dauphin arrives, and sure he\u2019s in those same blasted earth tones too, but at least he\u2019s having a little fun with it.\n\nHal and his crew \u2014 that crew being the \u201cEnglish\u201d \u201carmy\u201d \u2014 travel to fight the French. One night, the two kings meet in Dauphin\u2019s tent. Until this point, The King has given us scene after scene of torment and backstabbing. Hal is surrounded by men he doesn\u2019t really trust, wearing a crown no one thinks he deserves, doing a job he doesn\u2019t really want. When the Dauphin arrives, the king can deflate, if only a little. Pattinson holds his two fists together. \u201cWhat giant balls!\u201d he says to the younger king. He pokes out his thumb, and wiggles it around. \u201cAnd a tiny little penis!\u201d\n\nHere is where I will pause to ask you: Name one other historical drama this year that has Robert Pattinson and Robert Pattinson\u2019s fists imitating a human ballsack? Conceptually, alone, we\u2019re on an upswing. That\u2019s c\u1ec9n\u00e9m\u00e2, baby!\n\nBack to the scene: Gleefully, the Dauphin describes in vivid detail what he has in store for our hero, Hal. \u201cI\u2019ll drain your body of its blood and bury it under a little french tree,\u201d he promises. His face is brimming with maniacal faux-concern. He enjoys acting like he gives a shit. He tucks a lock of his greasy, scraggly blonde lace-front behind his ear. It takes long enough for The King to trudge its way to this scene but it\u2019s worth it! Nothing could prepare me for it. By the time we get to Pattinson\u2019s final moment \u2014 I don\u2019t think this is a spoiler since Henry V was published in 1875? \u2014 it\u2019s a completely comic performance. He\u2019s slipping and sliding in the mud, wearing oversize armor that cannot shield him from the utter indignity of fighting his own battle. The Lighthouse is a study of horror and obsession and insanity; in The King the guy just gets to have a good time.\n\nPattinson\u2019s razzle-dazzle is the only way this would work. Any other actor would wrestle with the French accent, and maybe trip over it. The way Pattinson sells it \u2014 even as he seemingly stumbles to remember to use it \u2014 only adds to the sum of this part. The King gives us Pattinson at his zaniest, with an accent that is a total mismatch, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. It\u2019s almost like Natalie Portman\u2019s Texas accent in Lucy in the Sky, or Daniel Craig\u2019s drawl for Logan Lucky. Do I love it? Do I hate it? I\u2019m unsure on both, but a bog witch cursed me at birth to at least respect it, so here I stand.", "description": "The King is mostly fine, occasionally good, but: It features one incredible, hilarious Robert Pattinson performance.
