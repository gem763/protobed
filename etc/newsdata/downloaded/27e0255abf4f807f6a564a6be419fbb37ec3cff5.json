Creator and writer Roy Clarke then wrote Pearl into the TV series as one of the permanent characters.\n\nImage caption Robert Fyfe played Pearl's husband Howard\n\nThe actress was born in Bournemouth but moved around as a child as a result of her South African father's job in the Navy.\n\nShe told the Summer Winos fan site in 2012 that having lived in South Africa and New York, her mother wanted to refine her daughter's accent, \"so she sent me to elocution lessons\" at drama school.\n\nShe went on to pursue an acting career and worked in theatre. She married and had three children, but her husband died in 1981 when she was 42.\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock Image caption Juliette Kaplan worked as an actress throughout her life\n\nKaplan also appeared in TV shows including EastEnders, Brookside and Doctors, but the role of Pearl was the most enduring of her career. She said she helped create her character's distinctive look, complete with wig and glasses.\n\n\"They actually gave me a wig from stock, and it used to flap at the back,\" she said. \"So every time the wind blew, my wig came off! So it was my idea to anchor it with either a turban or a beret.\"\n\nImage caption She was in a 2005 Christmas special with (left-right) June Whitfield and Kathy Staff\n\nShe also appeared in a show written by Clarke called Just Pearl, which toured the UK in 2003, telling the story of Pearl's life before she met Howard.\n\nShe told Summer Winos: \"My show starts with me turning into Pearl in front of the audience.\n\n\"I put the make-up on, put the coat on, and say 'There you are\u2026 there's Pearl'. And the audience likes that sort of thing.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
