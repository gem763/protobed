Ladies and gentlemen, The Surjury (no, really) awaits us in 2020.\n\nHosted by Love Island contestant wrangler Caroline Flack, this new televisual abomination has a new and freshly appalling premise \u2013 as the Channel 4 press release describes it, \u201ca 12-strong jury of the public must decide if people get to undertake the cosmetic surgery they\u2019ve always dreamed of.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccandidates\u201d will make their argument for a chosen procedure to a group of strangers, apparently allowing them \u201cto explore the choices more thoroughly and to take measured advice from their peers, some of whom may previously have gone under the knife themselves and will happily share their views and experiences.\u201d Ahem.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt feels somewhat reminiscent of that infamous Michael Gove quote, that Britons \u201chave had enough of experts\u201d. You want to a Brazilian butt lift (aka \"the BBL\")? Well here's AN Other Random Punter to tell you about their experience with getting a nose job, and whether they think your derriere is in need of improvement. Whether any of these 12 jury members pass on the important information that the BBL has been dubbed \u201cone of the deadliest aesthetic procedures\u201d by both the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons remains to be seen.\n\nThe nationwide obsession with Big Brother, following its debut on our screens in July 2000, heralded an era of dominance for reality television. Its rise in popularity coinciding with the advent of social media created a huge cultural shift and, in turn, a whole new genre of celebrity. Big Brother\u2019s diary room confessional became a medium available to us all with the introduction of Facebook, Twitter and, latterly, Instagram. Our interaction with strangers changed completely; we shared our triumphs, our defeats, our hopes and dreams in a new, removed way \u2013 less and less through face-to-face conversation with the people we knew and with whom we shared our lives, more and more with strangers through the porthole of digital communications.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Jade Goody and her journey from obscurity to infamy, and her eventual death from cervical cancer; the tragic suicides of Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, after participating in Love Island. These events provoked a genuine concern for reality TV \u201cstars\u201d, and a rightful expectation that producers of such shows adopted a responsible approach, a duty of care, once stars were cast back into the real world.\n\nI sense that as a society, in response, we are shifting in our common understanding of what is acceptable \u2013 in terms of the language we use to describe ourselves and each other, and in the way we treat one another, in our social behaviour online and in person. Social media has highlighted and amplified division where it exists, but we are, in general, becoming kinder to one another. Oddly, that has done nothing to improve our own view of ourselves. This is one area where we seem unable to adopt a softer tone.\n\nThe phrase \u201cthe surgery they\u2019ve always dreamed of\u201d is telling: many of us still really wish that we looked different on the outside, and that we were different on the inside. But the responsibility to change on the inside lies within \u2013 it can\u2019t be outsourced or taken care of by a surgeon \u2013 so the easier route seems to be changing the exterior and then to expect everything else to fall into place thereafter.\n\nThis latest incarnation of the reality television grotesque feels like a regressive step, cynical and ill-judged. I used to work in TV and, after the cancellation of The Jeremy Kyle Show, my mind boggles that it even made it through the (extensive, lengthy, often tedious) commissioning process. It is saddening reminder that there are still so many 15-year-olds going to cosmetic surgeons and asking for the \u201cKylie Jenner package\u201d (also known as \u201crich girl face\u201d) which includes cheekbone and jawline fillers as well as \u201cchin sculpting\u201d.\n\nSurely if surgery something you\u2019ve \"always dreamed of\", you don't need to argue your rationale in front of a group of strangers just to convince yourself it's worth going through with it. It will be interesting to see whether any of the candidates are talked out of their heart\u2019s desire \u2013 if I can bear to watch.", "description": "Just when you think reality television has reached its peak and done it all,\u00a0a TV producer somewhere pops up clutching a novel idea to remind us there are still new depths left to plumb.\u00a0Ladies and gentlemen, The Surjury (no, really) awaits us in 2020.", "authors": ["Lucie Mcinerney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/27/14/love-island-sr5-02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
