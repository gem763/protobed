The ECBcut its key interest rate by 10 basis points to minus 0.5% and launched an open-ended bond-purchasing program, known as quantitative easing, that will add to the bank\u2019s \u20ac2.6 trillion ($2.876 trillion) mountain of eurozone debt.\n\n\u201cSuch a far-reaching package was not necessary,\u201d Jens Weidmann, head of Germany\u2019s central bank, told the Germany daily Bild in Saturday\u2019s advance edition. The paper on Friday featured a doctored photo of Mr. Draghi as a vampire and a headline saying, \u201cThat\u2019s how Count Draghila is sucking our accounts dry.\u201d\n\nThe revolt, coming just weeks before Mr. Draghi steps down as ECB president, reflects growing skepticism and fatigue with his policies and leadership style\u2014problems his successor, departing International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, must contend with when she takes over on Nov. 1.\n\nMr. Draghi talks with his successor, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, at a eurozone finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Luxembourg in 2015.

It was a second birth for the ECB.\u201d\n\nBut the ECB\u2019s aggressive monetary policy generated bitter opposition, particularly from Germany. With a robust economy and an antipathy to expansive monetary policy, Germany worried that the ECB\u2019s massive purchases of government debt essentially subsidized spendthrift governments, particularly Italy\u2019s, and spared them the painful work of reforming their economies. Moreover, negative rates hurt Germany\u2019s cautious savers.\n\nMr. Weidmann, a member of the rate-setting committee, compared ECB policies to drugs and testified against the ECB at Germany\u2019s top court.\n\nMr. Draghi hit back, complaining in public about colleagues who said \u201cNein zu Allem\u201d\u2014German for \u201cNo to everything\u201d\u2014while offering no alternative strategy.\n\nIn June, Mr. Draghi publicly accused some national eurozone central banks of stirring populist feelings against the ECB. The next morning, Mr. Weidmann told Mr. Draghi he was surprised by the remarks and asked if they were directed at him, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cYou and Klaas,\u201d Mr. Draghi shot back, referring to Klaas Knot, head of the Dutch central bank head and another longtime critic of the ECB\u2019s easy-money policies.\n\nMessrs. Draghi, Knot and Weidmann declined to comment. In a statement Friday, Mr. Knot said QE was \u201cdisproportionate to the present economic conditions\u201d and could be ineffective.\n\nFor most of his tenure since 2011, Mr. Draghi has effectively squelched resistance to his policies. His speeches often became platforms to set the bank on course for action and pre-empt debate. Officials say Mr. Draghi has also been less concerned than his predecessor, the Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet, about having all 19 eurozone central banks support key decisions.\n\nDinners before the meetings, which stretched into the night under Mr. Trichet, now end by 10 p.m. That reflects the hyper-efficient style of Mr. Draghi, a former Goldman Sachs banker who trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a desire to avoid leaks, said one former ECB official. \u201cAt six o\u2019clock at every Eurogroup meeting [of eurozone finance ministers], he just gets up and leaves,\u201d said one eurozone official.\n\nGerman Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has been a vocal critic of the ECB\u2019s easy-money policies under Mr. Draghi.

The ECB\u2019s rate-setting committee meets one floor up, in a room featuring a sculpture of Europe on the ceiling, nicknamed the \u201cJedi chamber\u201d by one international official for its cloistered atmosphere.\n\n\u201cHe gave the governing council little choice,\u201d said Panicos Demetriades, who sat on the ECB\u2019s governing council from 2012-14 as governor of Cyprus\u2019s central bank. \u201cThe way [the ECB\u2019s bond-buying] programs came about had a lot to do with Mario.\u201d\n\nMr. Draghi has, however, quietly made efforts to win the support of the German government. He met nine times with German government officials in the 12 months through May, more than twice as often as he did with officials of any other nationality, according to his official diary.\n\nWith his final blast of easy money, the tensions between Mr. Draghi and the Germans have again come to the fore. At his press conference Thursday, he pointedly called out Berlin for its fierce resistance to loosening fiscal policy, a move that he says could help revive a flagging German economy that is weighing on the rest of the eurozone.\n\n\u201cAlmost all the things that you see in Europe, the creation of more than 11 million jobs over a short period of time, the recovery, the sustained growth for several quarters were by and large produced by our monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThere was very little else.\u201d\n\nFormer Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who famously sparred with the ECB over the country\u2019s debt bailout, both praised and criticized Mr. Draghi, giving him credit for taking action when eurozone governments were unwilling to enact reforms, but saying that his bond-buying program was closer to fiscal policy than monetary policy.\n\nHe \u201cbought time for Europe\u2019s politicians to get their act together, via means that were smart and terrible,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said. \u201cBut they did not take advantage of the time he bought them.\u201d\n\nIn leaving the ECB with an enormous balance sheet and the prospect of years of negative rates, Mr. Draghi\u2019s legacy is in doubt.\n\nHis policies may fare better under Ms. Lagarde than a more hawkish successor like Mr. Weidmann, who was considered a favorite to win the job. Ms. Lagarde has indicated she will continue Mr. Draghi\u2019s easy-money policies while possibly fine-tuning them and reassessing their costs.\n\nBut one eurozone official who has been critical of Mr. Draghi compared his legacy with those of former Federal Reserve chairmen Paul Volcker\u2014widely credited with ending the high levels of U.S. inflation during the 1970s and early 1980s\u2014and Alan Greenspan, whose policies have since been criticized for contributing to the dot-com bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\n\u201cGreenspan was revered at the time and Volcker was hated, but now it\u2019s Volcker who has the stronger reputation among economic historians,\u201d the official said. \u201cDraghi\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t assured.\u201d\n\nWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "description": "A revolt among ECB rate setters didn\u2019t stop President Mario Draghi from delivering a last stimulus, but their skepticism and fatigue with his policies and leadership style suggest the far-reaching changes he instituted aren\u2019t guaranteed to stay.", "authors": ["Tom Fairless", "Tom.Fairless Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106533/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
