Go big\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nPeople pick birthdays. And anniversaries. That means the more numbers over 31 there are in a draw the lower the chances of you sharing your jackpot with anyone else.\n\nFor example, on January 17 2017, there were 5 numbers over 31 and no winners. On November 22 all the numbers were under 30 and 4 people won.\n\nDr John Haigh, emeritus reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex, said players should ensure their selection extended across all numbers up to 50.\n\nHe said choosing six numbers entirely at random with a combined total adding up to at least 200, to make the average above 30, mean any prize money would be shared with fewer people.\n\n2. Go ugly\n\nIn general, people are tempted to spread out numbers evenly on the form and pick nice lines or patterns. So don't.\n\nCluster two or three together instead.\n\n3. Go stupid\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIf 1-2-3-4-5, plus 1 and 2 in the Lucky Stars, ever came up (and there's no reason it couldn't) hundreds of people would win the jackpot. All of them thinking they were being clever.\n\nAnother common trick is to pick last week's numbers. Again it's an attempt to be clever and so many people do it you're wasting your time.\n\nOh, and in case you think adding \u201c13\u201d to the mix will help because people don't like it.. You're wrong, it's the 7th most-picked number. (The 10 most picked numbers, in order, are 7, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 13, 9, 11, 12)\n\n4. Go online\n\nYou might be shocked to fund out how often winning tickets go unclaimed.\n\nLast year alone there were \u00a3122.5million of unclaimed prizes. Looking a bit further back, an exceptionally unlucky player left a \u00a363.9million EuroMillions win unclaimed in 2013.\n\nThat means if you're going to play, play online . It also means you won't forget one week (when your numbers are BOUND to come up) if you use a direct debit .\n\nYou will also be automatically notified of winnings if you forget to check the draw and \u2013 even better \u2013 there's no way to lose your ticket.", "description": "After a run of weeks on end where no one has won it, the EuroMillions jackpot has hit a staggering \u00a3169million - meaning a single winner would walk away with the biggest result in its history", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Pa", "Getty", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6154206.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Couple-celebrate-with-champagne.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
