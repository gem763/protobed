In the last five days, the Blonded team rolled out a new party, a new radio mix, a new single, a bounce remix of Blonde\u2019s \u201cNights,\u201d and more. Co-produced by German house DJ Boys Noize, Ocean\u2019s new \u201cDHL\u201d is a psychedelic floss track rooted in the cryptic swag rap of 2016\u2019s Endless. The lyrics range from devilishly conceited (\u201cNiggas think it\u2019s new, it ain\u2019t new, boy / Old files just turned two, yeah / Still sound like it\u2019s coming soon, yeah\u201d; \u201cIndependent juug, sellin\u2019 records out the trunk / I\u2019m already rich as fuck, so the product\u2019s in the front\u201d) to mysterious (\u201cThis ain\u2019t no fuckin\u2019 hopes and dreams prophecy / How\u2019d he sleep? Faith is in the coffee bean\u201d) to just plain horny (\u201cBoy toy suck me like a Hoover / Boy toy ride me like an Uber\u201d). The hook flexes about drugs, sex, diamonds, and coming back from trips around the world to new mail at home, name-checking the international express shipping company DHL and the Japanese motor-vehicle company Kawasaki, while geeking over Starbucks and trade, like a queer rendering of the woozy dream sequences of A$AP Rocky\u2019s Testing. Eagle-eyed fans are convinced the single\u2019s artwork \u2014 which contains a series of 13 icons in the bottom right corner, the fourth of which corresponds to the \u201cDHL\u201d cover \u2014 is a hint that there\u2019s an album on the way. Snippets of new songs called \u201cDear April\u201d and \u201cCayendo\u201d suggest more is in the pipeline.\n\nThe single was well-received by press and fans, but Blonded\u2019s new queer club night PrEP+ is drawing a mixed response. Announced on short notice (and attended by an exclusive list of guests that included musicians, television personalities, members of the press, and more), the event took its name from the pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment (the brand-name drug is called Truvada) designed to help prevent new HIV infections in high-risk communities, and set house rules banning discrimination of all sorts. Ocean intended for PrEP+ to celebrate vibrant New York City queer culture, an \u201chomage to what could have been of the 1980s\u2019 NYC club scene\u201d if PrEP had been around to head off the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the pass. The last bit has been the source of some consternation, since, as the storied New York activist organization ACT UP put it on Twitter, \u201c\u201880\u2019s nightlife was revolutionary because of people living with HIV and their caretakers.\u201d The comfort of a New York queer space can\u2019t be pried off of the experiences that necessitated it. The joy came from pain, pain that none of us should forget, as the nation endures a dangerous bout of cultural and historical amnesia.\n\nA few attendees came home from PrEP+ wanting more. SXYLK \u2014 a local DJ and producer who has worked with gifted rappers like Big Momma, bbymutha, and Cakes da Killa \u2014 spun at the event, then told Fader the party needed more queer DJs and warned that \u201cBrooklyn is becoming the new Portland.\u201d (Talent for the night included New Orleans DJ Bouffant Bouffant, Seattle DJ and producer Sango, and London\u2019s Sherelle. French house titans Justice headlined.) Out senior editor Mikelle Street lamented that the party \u201cdidn\u2019t feel queer,\u201d noting that event staff manning cameras ran at cross-purposes with the idea that PrEP+ was, on some level, kind of a sex party with a dedicated dark room. Twitter criticism ran hot, drawing a rebuttal from Frank Ocean himself, who defended the theme of the party on Tumblr, stating that his idea had really been to shine a light on the benefits of PrEP and the barriers to access for people who can\u2019t afford it, after polling friends and discovering that even people in his own orbit had more to learn: \u201cThis pill was approved by the FDA in 2012. The pricing strategy behind it is malicious in my opinion, and so it\u2019s (sic) public perception is marred, and rightfully so. But the fact remains that despite price being a very real barrier to this potentially life-saving drug for some, the other very real barrier is awareness.\u201d\n\nACT UP member and PrEP+ attendee Jason Rosenberg \u2014 who gave a withering report about door security at the event not recognizing Truvada by sight \u2014 wondered over the phone to me on Friday whether the party\u2019s mission of creating a dialogue went much deeper than the name and the language in the press release: \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything remotely involving HIV or PrEP [inside the party] at all. People knew that the party was called \u2018PrEP+,\u2019 but nothing else.\u201d Going forward, Rosenberg hopes Ocean will reach out to groups working on the ground to increase the awareness and availability of drugs like PrEP. (ACT UP suggested routing funds from the party\u2019s commemorative T-shirt to the appropriate service providers and justice organizations, if Ocean hasn\u2019t already.) If the aim was to assemble a constellation of queer media and celebrities and force a conversation through them, then everyone is talking. As it is now, though, PrEP+ shares the same setbacks as its namesake: It could do more good by being less exclusive.", "description": "Is Frank Ocean circling album mode again?
