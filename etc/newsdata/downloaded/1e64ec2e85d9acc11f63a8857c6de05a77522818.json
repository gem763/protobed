CPI achieves this via an index coin linked to the average value of the top 200 crypto assets. CPI has recently won the full endorsement and support members of Emirati Royal Families through their direct participation on the company's board, bringing a global level of stability and recognition to the emerging class of DeFi protocols which market commentators expect to disrupt the financial industry.\n\nThe CPI project will democratise access to crypto assets by allowing non-technical users to acquire exposure to the broader crypto asset market via the ownership of a single index token called the CPI200 token. Participants in the CPI protocol will perform an integral function in the governance of the protocol through a governance token referred to as the CPI token ensuring that the protocol\u2019s ruleset is aligned with the community\u2019s interests at all times.\n\nHerbert Law, CEO of Crypto Price Index, was keen to welcome Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Rashed Al Sharqi as well as His Excellency Khalfan Saeed Khalfan Al Mazrouei to the board, and issued the following statement: I feel what we have is an amazing event which has happened by forming this partnership with the royal family. Our CPI project has one of the more powerful platforms ever created in the crypto industry.\n\nThe CPI project has appointed ICO Launch Malta as technical partners, with the CPI platform being built on the ICO Launch Malta DeFi Product Stack. By building upon this proven and heavily audited technology layer, CPI offers its users full transparency and auditability of their holdings. Jan Sammut CEO of ICO Launch Malta issued the following statement: We are thrilled to be part of the CPI project, who\u2019s ethos is congruent with our objective to democratise the financial industry by disintermediating it to a purely trust less P2P market.\n\nCPI has selected the ZB Group as exchange partners for their upcoming IEO, which is scheduled for launch by end of year. David Pulis, CEO of ZBX issued the following statement: The Crypto Price Index is a much-needed vehicle that will enhance our product offering for both institutional and retail investors worldwide.\n\nContact: Herbert Law CPI Dev Team\n\nPhone: +01503-740-7264\n\nmail: herbert@cpiindex.io", "description": "Crypto Price Index (CPI) is an emerging Decentralised Finance (DeFi) project which aims to allow users to participate in the crypto markets in a stable and less...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNThjZGEzMjU1ZWI0MzE1M2YwZDNkMGNlODQyMDZhMjMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
