Now, they've begun full-scale manufacture of the iPhone XR here.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nThe company just announced that the XR has gone into commercial production at Foxconn's plant near Chennai, after several weeks of test runs. It's a big deal for Apple, given that they've been trapped in negotiations with the government for months to nail down approvals and the like.\n\nAt the moment Apple hasn't specified which other models will be manufactured in India. Recent reports had indicated both the iPhone XR and XS would be assembled here in time to ship in August, but that's clearly not the case anymore.\n\nDon't Miss 4.3 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 129 SHARES\n\nAccording to other tidbits, Apple might also soon begin manufacturing the iPhone 11 in India, but it's unclear if that also includes the 11 Pro, and Pro Max as well.\n\nAnd it's clearly a big operation because the iPhones assembled here are apparently not just for the Indian market. Supposedly the plan is to export at least some of the product units to other markets, including Europe.\n\nOn the one hand, the easily available labour and low taxes in India will allow Apple the chance to perhaps drop the prices of its iPhones in the region, which is great for fans. They used to manufacture the iPhone 6S and SE with Wistron here in India for just that reason. If they source components locally after all, they can save about 20 percent of their production costs on the iPhone XR\n\nBut it also helps Apple diversify its interests outside of China, probably a smart move given the recent trade tensions they're having with the US.", "description": "Apple has over time learned that it has a vast potential market here in India, but only if it can lower its prices.
