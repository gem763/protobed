REUTERS/Crack Palinggi\n\nThe Corruption Eradication Commission, known by its Indonesian initials, KPK, has prosecuted hundreds of politicians, officials, and businessmen since its formation in 2002, becoming one of the country\u2019s most respected agencies.\n\nAnalysts and rights groups say the agency has helped boost governance and transparency in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and improved the country\u2019s investment climate.\n\n\u201cWhen the revisions are set in motion, corruption in regional areas will run amok,\u201d said Muhammad Isnur of the Foundation of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute.\n\nHe said there was a plot \u201cto weaken and amputate the KPK\u201d and noted the approval had been done in a matter of days by a parliament that usually spends months debating changes.\n\nThere have been previous attempts by politicians and police to undermine the agency, which has widespread public support but has often been a thorn in the establishment\u2019s side.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s vote marks the first time revisions to the 2002 law have been approved.\n\nTuesday\u2019s revisions also mean that an external board will now have oversight and have the power to authorise whether the KPK can carry out wiretaps.\n\nUnder the changes, independent investigators will also become civil servants and need to be seconded from state bodies, including the police.\n\nThe KPK has at times clashed with senior police officers, including in 2015 when it said President Joko Widodo\u2019s sole candidate to become police chief was a graft suspect. His appointment was later overturned amid a public outcry, though the legal case against him was later dropped.\n\nMember of parliament Johnny G. Plate defended the changes, saying all state agencies needed oversight.\n\n\u201cThere is no state institution in the world that does not have a supervisory board, without checks and balances,\u201d Plate told Reuters.\n\nBut activists fear the revisions are designed to weaken the agency, and have led a series of \u201csave the KPK\u201d rallies with protesters gathering in front of parliament before Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nMany of the KPK\u2019s investigations have involved members of parliament. A former speaker of the house is among those who have been convicted of graft.\n\nWidodo, who has 30 days to sign the law, has defended the changes and stressed that he would not compromise in the fight against graft.\n\nWidodo said on Friday that a supervisory board was necessary for \u201cgood governance\u201d, though he said he would pick the members and they would include researchers and anti-corruption activists, not politicians or bureaucrats.\n\nMP Teuku Taufiqulhadi said on Tuesday that the external board would be selected by Widodo, instead of parliament as initially planned.\n\nThe government has also faced questions from rights groups over the makeup of the KPK\u2019s new board of commissioners.\n\nThe KPK\u2019s chief, whose term is ending, will be replaced by police inspector general, Firli Bahuri, who has been accused of ethical violations during a previous attachment at the KPK.\n\nBahuri has said the alleged violations were an internal matter for the KPK.", "description": "Indonesia's parliament on Tuesday approved changes to a law governing the country's anti-corruption agency, sparking alarm among activists who say revisions that include curbing its freedom to wiretap suspects will hurt the fight against graft.", "authors": ["Agustinus Beo Da Costa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430728931&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0EC", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
