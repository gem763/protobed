Police bodycam video showed that Aaron Dean did not identify himself as an officer and fired a split-second after shouting at the woman to show her hands.\n\nInterim Police Chief Ed Kraus said Dean would have been fired if he had not quit. He said a criminal investigation is underway and he expects an update by Tuesday on whether the officer \u2014 a member of the force for 1\u00bd years \u2014 will be charged.\n\n\u201cNobody looked at this video and said that there\u2019s any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,\u201d Kraus said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Jefferson\u2019s family had demanded that Dean be fired and arrested.\n\n\u201cWhy this man is not in handcuffs is a source of continued agitation for this family and for this community,\u201d family attorney Lee Merritt said.\n\nPolice went to Jefferson\u2019s home about 2:25 a.m. after a neighbor called a non-emergency line to report that her front door had been left open. In a statement over the weekend, the department said officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his gun and fired after \u201cperceiving a threat.\u201d\n\nThe body camera video released by police showed Dean shouting, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d and immediately firing.\n\nThe video included images of a gun inside a bedroom. The police chief on Monday said he had no information on whether Jefferson was holding it when she was shot. And he said that in hindsight, releasing the images was \u201ca bad thing to do,\u201d noting that many Texas homeowners keep guns nearby for self-defense.\n\nThe family lawyer said Jefferson was staying up late, playing video games with her nephew, when she was killed.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside Jefferson\u2019s home Sunday night for a vigil after earlier demonstrations briefly stopped traffic on Interstate 35. A single bullet hole was visible in the window of the single-story, freshly painted purple home, and floral tributes and stuffed animals piled up in the street.\n\nThe police chief said that Dean could face state criminal charge and that he has also submitted a case to the FBI to review for possible federal civil rights charges.\n\nDean has not yet hired an attorney but will have one provided with financial support from the state\u2019s largest police union, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, according to Charley Wilkison, executive director.\n\nFort Worth is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) west of Dallas, where another high-profile police shooting occurred last year.\n\nIn that case, white Dallas police officer Amber Guyger shot and killed her black neighbor Botham Jean inside his own apartment after Guyger said she mistook his place for her own. Guyger, 31, was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison.\n\nRelations with the public have been strained after other recent Fort Worth police shootings. In June, the department footage of officers killing a man who ignored repeated orders to drop his handgun. He was the fourth person Fort Worth police had fired upon in 10 days.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the department\u2019s 1,100 officers are white, just over 20% are Hispanic, and about 10% are black.\n\nKraus took over as interim police chief in May after the previous chief was fired.\n\nJefferson was a 2014 graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology. She was working in pharmaceutical equipment sales and was considering going back to medical school, according to the family\u2019s lawyer.", "description": "(AP) \u2014 A white Fort Worth cop who shot dead a black woman in her home while responding to a call about an open front door has resigned.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19287577681401-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
