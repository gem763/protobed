Russia, Iran and a top EU official urged Turkey to act with restraint amid concerns that renewed chaos in Syria would lead to a jihadist resurgence and push the Kurds, America\u2019s allies in the fight against IS, into the arms of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTurkey has battled Kurdish separatists for years and had repeatedly warned it would not allow the creation of a Kurdish proto-state on its immediate border. Once it seizes the area, Turkey plans to resettle 2 million Syrian refugees, most of them Arabs, in the border zone, further complicating a combustible situation.\n\nA small forward group of Turkish forces first entered Syria early Wednesday at two points close to the Syrian towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, according to a Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Turkish planes and shells pounded the towns as the incursion began. Residents fled though Kurdish forces had vacated positions before the attack, which is expected to involve tens of thousands of soldiers backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers from NATO\u2019s second-largest army.\n\nThe Turkish lira weakened on the news, nearing a low for the day.\n\nTurkey\u2019s advance follows a dramatic reversal of U.S. policy. Trump told Erdogan in a phone call on Sunday that dozens of American troops who\u2019d been working closely with Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State would pull back, effectively clearing the way for a Turkish incursion.\n\nThe White House statement appeared to surprise allies at home and abroad. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said they would defend their \u201cown people,\u201d potentially relegating the battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG militia that forms the backbone of the SDF has been one of America\u2019s closest partners in the fight against Islamic State and is holding thousands of jihadist fighters and their families in camps and detention centers in northeastern Syria.\n\nWhile Trump said Turkey would become responsible for the detainees, who include foreign fighters from Europe, it was not clear if there was a mechanism in place to transfer them to Turkish custody. Trump was criticized at home for a decision that could see Islamic State fighters escape or regroup.\n\nA number of Trump allies, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, said the move was \u201ca shot in the arm for the bad guys.\u201d Analysts said a U.S. pullback could ultimately play into the hands of Russia, whose military intervention helped turn the tide of the Syrian civil war in favor of Assad. As the Turkish offensive got underway, the Associated Press reported that the YPG had asked Russia to mediate talks between them and the Assad government.\n\nTrump Whipsaws on Turkey as Threat Follows Green Light on Syria\n\nTurkey sees the YPG as a threat due to its link to the separatist PKK, another Kurdish group the Turkish government been battling for decades. It\u2019s considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nIts offensive into northern Syria first aims to surround towns in a strip of border territory, before pushing further south in an effort to dismantle any chance of a Kurdish state emerging on its doorstep, according to two Turkish officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning.\n\nTrump\u2019s Confounding Syria Moves Again Spur Policy Confusion\n\nThe first targets will be the Syrian towns of Kobani, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, all held by the YPG and located along the former Berlin-Baghdad railway that for hundreds of miles forms the frontier with Turkey, according to the officials.\n\nThe military aims to penetrate at least 30 kilometers (19 miles) deep into Syrian territory and secure the M-4 highway that runs parallel to the frontier all the way to Iraq in the east, they said. Erdogan was keen to act before winter set in and made it difficult for tanks to operate in muddy terrain.\n\n\u201cWhat aggravates the operational risks is the deep-running mistrust between Turkey and the U.S.,\u201d said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara. \u201cTurkey is very much worried about whether the U.S. will share intelligence with the YPG over Turkish troop positions to help them defend themselves.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Turkey has begun its military offensive into northeastern Syria to force back Kurdish militants controlling the border area, days after President Donald Trump said the U.S. wouldn\u2019t stand in the way.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the start of the operation, code-named Spring", "authors": ["Selcan Hacaoglu", "Onur Ant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/brKq3JbMQLi7xHoe_2KnHw--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ce026804fafda4918816778e50aaf17d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
