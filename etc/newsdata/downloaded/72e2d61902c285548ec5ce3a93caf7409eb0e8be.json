It\u2019s no joke,\u201d Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. \u201cHe\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s announcement came one day after the White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden\u2019s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll.\n\nFOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT\n\nAnd, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.\n\nWith those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely.\n\n\u201cIt gets his sea legs under him,\u201d noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser and fundraiser. \u201cIt gives everybody more energy.\u201d\n\nRasky, who\u2019s not directly involved in Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, predicted, \u201cit\u2019s definitely going to help fundraising.\u201d\n\nHe added that donors \u201care happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.\u201d\n\nBiden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming \u201che\u2019s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.\u201d\n\nVeteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president.\n\n\u201cHis remarks yesterday came across as an \u2018enough is enough\u2019 call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,\u201d said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.\n\nAdding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no \"quid pro quo\" and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES\n\nThe president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on Biden and his son.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u2013 who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office \u2013 later was dismissed.\n\nBiden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.\u201d\n\nBiden also accused the president of throwing \u201clies and distortions and smears\u201d at him and his son, \u201cbecause he thinks he\u2019ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.\u201d\n\nWhile the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own.\n\nMAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL\n\nThirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats.\n\nLongtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that \u201cthe discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.\u201d\n\nReed emphasized, \u201cI think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right or left.\u201d\n\nAnd, Biden\u2019s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the former vice president was speaking in New Hampshire, the president took to Twitter to return fire.\n\n\u201cSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d Trump wrote.", "description": "While the president has been front-and-center in the Ukraine\u00a0controversy\u00a0that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, Biden\u2019s another key player, and with the impeachment push overshadowing the 2020 White House race, the Democrat has\u00a0grabbed outsized attention over his rivals for the presidential nomination.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/09/694940094001_6093559886001_6093554705001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
