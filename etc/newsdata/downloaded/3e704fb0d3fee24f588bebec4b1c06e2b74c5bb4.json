But like last summer\u2019s similarly pitched Amazon series Forever, Undone keeps its cards close to the vest in the first episode, focusing on developing the protagonist as a singular human being before taking her on a truly surreal journey.\n\nSo if you came into the Undone premiere expecting, I don\u2019t know, Bob Odenkirk floating through outer space, you might be a little puzzled. But here\u2019s the good news: Even if Undone kept its feet firmly planted in kitchen-sink realism for the entirety of its first season, it would still be a terrific new TV series, full of dazzling animation, well-drawn characters, and razor-sharp dialogue.\n\nAfter a brief flash-forward depicting a car crash that will come at the end of the episode, Undone formally introduces us to Alma (Rosa Salazar), a 28-year-old day-care worker whose mischievous sense of humor is a paper shield against her feelings of existential despair. The episode offers a few hints that there might be deeper, more external reasons for Alma\u2019s malaise \u2014 but for now, her main frustration seems to be the sheer mundanity of day-to-day existence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so bored of living,\u201d Alma says in voice-over near the beginning of the episode. The subsequent montage is a routine that will look familiar to \u2026 well, to most of us, as Alma half-sleepwalks through a boring, ordinary day in what\u2019s starting to feel like a boring, ordinary life.\n\nThe key to this montage is not that Alma\u2019s day is boring. It\u2019s that it doubles back on itself. In the morning, she wakes up next to her boyfriend, brushes her teeth, and drives from home to work. In the evening, she drives from work to home, brushes her teeth, and goes to bed next to her boyfriend. And if every day is just a mirror image of itself, it can start to feel like you\u2019re not doing anything at all.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, of course. Even someone who looks like she\u2019s standing still is growing in one way or another. But it\u2019s how Alma feels, and it explains the choices she makes throughout the premiere, which all stem from a desperate desire to shake herself out of a rut.\n\nFirst comes Alma\u2019s relationship with her younger sister, Becca (Angelique Cabral). Over drinks, Becca reveals that she\u2019s engaged to a guy named Reed Hollingsworth, who has the bank account to match his comically upper-crust name. Alma half-heartedly feigns support for about five seconds before ticking off a list of \u201cgood\u201d qualities that ends with \u201chis family is really rich and well-connected and super-classist and racist.\u201d\n\nBecca\u2019s news is enough to shake the foundations of Alma\u2019s own relationship with her live-in boyfriend, Sam (Siddharth Dhananjay). Returning home drunk later that night, she makes Sam promise that they\u2019ll never become one of those couples who gets married, settles down, and \u201cis, like, all happy.\u201d Sam is low-key and amiable enough to agree, but it\u2019s still not enough for Alma. Following a small and uncomfortable dinner party to celebrate Becca\u2019s engagement \u2014 during which Reed delivers a sweetly awkward toast to his future bride that practically makes Alma gag \u2014 Alma breaks up with Sam on the drive home.\n\nAnd next, having blown up her own life, Alma decides to blow up Becca\u2019s life as well. Over another round of drinks, Alma indulges in a little playacting, taking Becca\u2019s engagement ring and pretending it\u2019s her own. That\u2019s enough to spark an interaction between the two sisters and the hunky bartender, which \u2014 with a little prodding from Alma \u2014 turns into a game of Truth or Dare that ends with Becca and the bartender making out while Alma quietly slips away.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what else happened with the bartender, though Becca\u2019s late arrival for church with their mother the following morning certainly implies that it was a late night. And when Alma teases her younger sister for her dalliance, it explodes into a full-on argument. \u201cWe\u2019re broken people, and broken people break people,\u201d Alma says, shrugging off both of their roles in a situation that would, at the very least, cause some pain for Becca\u2019s fianc\u00e9. \u201cYou\u2019re so insanely self-involved that you don\u2019t even know all the things that are wrong with you,\u201d counters Becca.\n\n\u201cNo, I do,\u201d says Alma, at the end of an episode that has shown exactly how self-consciously self-destructive she can be. And as she drives away, tears streaming down her face, she sees something that diverts her attention: Her father (Bob Odenkirk), who has been dead since she was a child, standing at the side of the road. The distraction is enough to cause a major car crash with Alma at the center. For better or worse, she got her wish: Her life isn\u2019t looking so boring anymore.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 Undone achieves its eye-catching animation style via rotoscoping \u2014 a process in which animators trace over frames of live-action footage, which has been used in films like Richard Linklater\u2019s Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly.\n\n\u2022 Undone was co-created by BoJack Horseman\u2019s Raphael Bob-Waksberg and Kate Purdy, and you can see a lot of Undone\u2019s DNA in their previous work \u2014 particularly in Bob-Waksberg\u2019s new short-story collection, Someone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory, and the Purdy-penned BoJack episodes \u201cThe Old Sugarman Place\u201d and \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d which all wrestle with temporality in unique and fascinating ways.\n\n\u2022 Alma is hearing-impaired and uses a cochlear implant \u2014 a condition that is depicted with refreshing matter-of-factness as a part of Alma\u2019s life but not her defining trait.\n\n\u2022 Alma\u2019s sense of nihilism is informed, at least in part, by her grandmother Geraldine, whom Alma describes as a schizophrenic who went through a miserable cycle of lithium and shock treatments.\n\n\u2022 Alma likes to mess with bartenders by ordering fake cocktails. (A \u201cFancy Familiar,\u201d for the record, is a \u201cMozambique Sambda\u201d without the sherbet.)\n\n\u2022 Alma\u2019s mother, Camila (Constance Marie), suggests that Alma bleach her upper lip before the engagement party. Alma responds by drawing a luxuriously curly black mustache onto her face.\n\n\u2022 Sam\u2019s (pretty good!) idea for a non-cutesy couples\u2019 Halloween costume: Batman and Bruce Wayne.\n\n\u2022 Sam also has some solid ideas for non-boring professional tracks he and Alma could embark upon: vagabonds, cat burglars, or hot-air balloonists. If you ask me: Why not all three?", "description": "Raphael Bob-Waksberg and Kate Purdy\u2019s terrific new series keeps its cards close to the vest in a deceptively realist first episode.
