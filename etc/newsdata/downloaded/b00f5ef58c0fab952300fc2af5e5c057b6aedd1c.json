Cummings, the former chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat will lie in state in the Capitol on Thursday ahead of a funeral in Baltimore on Friday. But debate over the fairness of the inquiry is continuing unabated, with Trump and his Republican allies airing grievances Thursday morning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are looking to make the proceedings public by mid-November as they build a case about Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden at a time when U.S. military aid was being withheld.\n\n\u25cfHouse Democrats look to take the impeachment probe public as soon as mid-November.\n\n\u25cfRepublicans storm a closed-door impeachment hearing as escalating Ukraine scandal threatens Trump.\n\n\u25cfU.S. ambassador to E.U. \u201cdoes not recall\u201d threatening Ukraine over funding, attorney says.\n\nAD\n\n9:30 a.m.: Pelosi accuses House Republicans of \u2018covering up\u2019 for Trump\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday accused House Republicans of \u201ccovering up for a president who abuses his power.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a tweet, Pelosi pointed to news coverage of a House bill passed Wednesday largely along party lines that seeks to provide additional protections of the country\u2019s elections from foreign interference.\n\nAmong other things, the bill would require candidates and political committees to notify the FBI if a foreign power offers campaign help. It also includes stricter rules for political advertisements on social media.\n\nRepublicans have argued that the bill raises concerns about free speech and is unenforceable.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe took action to protect our elections from foreign interference,\u201d Pelosi wrote. \u201cHouse Republicans, once again, voted against that \u2014 choosing instead to continue covering up for a president who abuses his power. It\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\n9:15 a.m.: Hoyer says Trump will have opportunity to defend himself at Senate trial\n\nAD\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday that Trump will have ample opportunity to defend himself once a trial is held in the Senate.\n\nHoyer, during an appearance on MSNBC, responded to Republican critics of the House impeachment process who have argued that it is unfair to Trump.\n\n\u201cFrankly, [Supreme Court] Chief Justice Roberts will preside over the trial,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s in America \u2026 where you get the chance to call witnesses, to present evidence, to cross-examine the people who are asserting wrongdoing. That\u2019s when you get that chance, not now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHoyer also dismissed GOP critics who have called for a vote to formally open the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get a vote. They\u2019re going to get a vote on the floor. That\u2019s the only way impeachment can happen,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nAD\n\n8:45 a.m.: Grisham says Trump \u2018very supportive\u2019 of GOP storming hearing room\n\nGrisham said Thursday that Trump was \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the Republicans who stormed the secure room where depositions are being taken and prompted a five-hour delay Wednesday in the testimony from a witness.\n\n\u201cIt was great, and the point was well taken,\u201d Grisham said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cI think this showed full support for the president.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe move came after Trump urged congressional Republicans this week to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d against his impeachment.\n\nUnder House rules, only members of the three committees involved in the impeachment inquiry are allowed to attend the closed-door depositions. Both Democrats and Republicans who are on the committee are being given opportunities to question witnesses, but Republicans have argued that the process should be more open.\n\nAD\n\nTheir protest Wednesday was intended to convey that message.\n\n\u201cHe was happy to see it happen,\u201d Grisham said of Trump. \u201cHe was very supportive of it, as he should be.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Grisham also said Trump did not regret using the term \u201chuman scum\u201d to describe Republicans who\u2019ve opposed his presidency known as \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo, no he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who are against him and have been against him and working against him since the day he took office are just that. \u2026 They deserve strong language like that.\u201d\n\n8:15 a.m.: Swalwell says \u2018very key witnesses\u2019 in inquiry have talked to one another\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that House investigators have \u201cdirect evidence\u201d that \u201cvery key witnesses\u201d in the impeachment inquiry have talked to another about their testimony.\n\nAD\n\nSwalwell made the comments during an interview on CNN in which he defended the use of closed-door depositions, which he described as \u201ca first pass\u201d at gathering information that will later become public.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have evidence, very recently, that there are witnesses in our case who are talking to each other,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we don\u2019t want to happen until we have that preliminary investigation. We don\u2019t want them to tailor their testimony to each other. We don\u2019t want them to manufacture alibis. So we\u2019re trying to protect the information as much as we can before we bring it forward to the public.\u201d\n\nPressed for elaboration, Swalwell said more could be said in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe have direct evidence that very key witnesses in this case have talked to each other about their testimony,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\n8 a.m.: House investigators pause depositions in honor of Cummings\n\nAD\n\nHouse investigators have postponed additional depositions until Saturday in honor of Cummings.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat will lie in state in the Capitol on Thursday ahead of a funeral Friday in Baltimore, where scheduled speakers include former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nDepositions resume Saturday with testimony from Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Monday, the three House committees conducting the inquiry expect to hear testimony from Charles Kupperman, former deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs.\n\nAD\n\nTimothy Morrison, special assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia in the National Security Council, is expected to appear in a closed session on Thursday. Morrison was on the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.\n\n7:20 a.m.: RNC chairwoman says impeaching Trump is \u2018all Democrats have wanted from the start\u2019\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Thursday sought to portray Democrats as having had designs on impeaching Trump long before the Ukraine scandal emerged.\n\nIn a tweet, she quoted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) saying, \u201cNone of us came to Congress to impeach a president.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really?\u201d McDaniel wrote in her own words, before citing two Democrats who called for Trump\u2019s impeachment long ago, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). Tlaib generated headlines in January after she expressed her desire to see Trump impeached on her first day in office, using a profane term.\n\n\u201cThis is all Democrats have wanted from the start!\u201d McDaniel wrote in her tweet.\n\nPelosi resisted calls from many in the Democratic caucus to formally launch impeachment proceedings until the details of the Ukraine controversy came to light.\n\n7 a.m.: Democrats eye Bolton as key witness\n\nAs Democrats prepare to hold public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, many are eyeing John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, as a key witness.\n\nBolton, who was ousted last month, made known around the White House his visceral opposition to the campaign to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was directed in part by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nTestimony from Bolton could be particularly devastating for the White House, though it remains unclear whether Democrats would subpoena him or when. After Bolton resigned, he told The Washington Post that he would \u201chave my say in due course.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian\n\n6:30 a.m.: Trump returns to Twitter for another post-midnight airing of grievances\n\nFor the second day in a row, Trump turned to Twitter after midnight to air grievances about the impeachment process, calling it a \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d and lashing out at the \u201cDo Nothing Dems\u201d who are leading it.\n\nTrump also highlighted the move by Republicans on Wednesday to storm the secure room at the Capitol where testimony is being taken from witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. That included a retweet of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who participated in the protest, which delayed a deposition for five hours.\n\n\u201cIf people scatter out of a room when you walk in & turn on the light, it begs the question: What are they hiding in there?\u201d Scalise tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened when my colleagues & I entered the backroom Schiff is trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump from to get the truth. Unacceptable!\u201d\n\n6:15 a.m.: House Republicans seek public testimony from whistleblower\n\nHouse Republicans are calling for public testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the inquiry.\n\nIn a letter Wednesday to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), three leading Republicans expressed concerns that he had backed away from publicly announced plans to have the whistleblower appear before House investigators behind closed doors.\n\nSchiff has since said it may not be necessary to hear from the anonymous U.S. intelligence official because other witnesses have corroborated information in his complaint.\n\n\u201cAs the so-called impeachment inquiry gathers information that contradicts the employee\u2019s allegations, we ask that you arrange for the Committees to receive public testimony from the employee and all individuals he or she relied upon in formulating the complaint,\u201d says the letter, signed by Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Devin Nunes (Calif.) and Michael T. McCaul (Tex.).\n\nThey are the top Republicans, respectively, on the Oversight and Reform, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\n6 a.m.: Sanders expressed hope for \u2018a fair trial\u2019 in the Republican-led Senate\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) expressed hope Wednesday night that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow \u201ca fair trial\u201d in the Republican-led Senate if Trump is impeached by the Democrat-led House.\n\nAppearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d Sanders, a Democratic presidential hopeful, said he thinks there is \u201ca strong case for impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the House will impeach him,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI hope they do. The trial comes to the Senate. And I hope, I just hope, that the Republican leadership allows for a fair trial, and lets the American people and the Senate make their decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope McConnell will do the right thing,\u201d Sanders added.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never done the right thing before, though,\u201d Kimmel interjected.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m being overly optimistic here, but bottom line is you have a president in my view who is probably the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.\u201d\n\nSanders said that many of his Republican colleagues have been \u201cintimidated and frightened by this president.\u201d", "description": "Stephanie Grisham\u2019s comment came as House investigators have postponed further testimony until Saturday in honor of the late congressman Elijah E.
