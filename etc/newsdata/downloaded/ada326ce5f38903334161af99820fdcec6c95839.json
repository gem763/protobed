There are Japanese three-Michelin star restaurants that are doing tempura, that are specialising in amazing pieces of fish that are deep fried and served and cost the earth.\n\nKerrridge owns the two Michelin starred Hand & Flowers (Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Why can\u2019t we get the best fish in the world and create the best batter, deep fry it and serve it with amazing potatoes?\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re coming around to the idea.\n\nThe fish and chips aren\u2019t actually on the a la carte menu at Kerridge\u2019s Bar and Grill at the moment, but it is available on the set lunch and pre and post theatre menus, where you can get two courses for \u00a324.\n\nBargain.\n\nKerridge, who has lost 12 stone in his healthy eating and fitness regime, is a big fan of the humble fish and chips, even choosing it as his dream meal.\n\nOn Ed Gamble and James Acaster\u2019s podcast Off Menu, Kerridge said that his dream starter would be calamari with mayonnaise, his dream main course would be classic fish and chips served with mushy peas, gravy and curry sauce, and his dream dessert would be a knickerbocker glory from the old eatery chain Berni Inn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chef, who has appeared on shows like Bake Off: Creme de la Creme and MasterChef, owns The Hand & Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which is the UK\u2019s only gastropub to have been awarded two Michelin stars.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
