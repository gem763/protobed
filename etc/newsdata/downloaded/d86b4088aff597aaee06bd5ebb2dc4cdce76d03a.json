Lagarde was in the audience for the speech.\n\n\u201cAs someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain, I could never have expected to lead the IMF,\u201d Georgieva said. She noted she had witnessed the devastation of bad economic policies when her mother lost 98% of her life savings during a period of hyperinflation in the 1990s in Bulgaria.\n\nShe said the world was in the midst of a slowdown with nearly 90% of the global economy experiencing weaker growth this year. The IMF this week projected that growth would only reach 3% this year, the weakest performance in a decade.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank meetings were expected to be dominated by the trade disputes triggered by the Trump administration\u2019s get-tough policies aimed at lowering America\u2019s huge trade deficits and boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs. So far those efforts have made little headway.\n\nIn addition to the battle between the United States and China, higher U.S. tariffs went into effect Friday on $7.5 billion in European goods coming into the United States in a dispute involving airplane subsidies.\n\nFrance\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said China probably would be the real winner in the U.S.-EU trade fight. He said the EU was ready to negotiate a settlement to avoid the tariffs but so far the U.S. has rejected those efforts.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning, we have made it very clear that we want to avoid a trade war,\u201d Le Maire said. \u201cThe response from the U.S. administration has always been a closed door.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva said Thursday a tentative U.S.-China trade agreement announced last week should lessen the damage slightly, but solid global growth would not return until the two countries resolved their differences.\n\nShe said she hoped this week\u2019s talks would focus on ways to ease trade tensions and begin the groundwork to update the rules of world trade. The Trump administration has repeatedly attacked the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, saying it is biased against the United States.", "description": "The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank appealed to their 189 member countries on Friday to resolve widening disagreements on trade...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT650_IMF_ge_ZG_20191019092336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
