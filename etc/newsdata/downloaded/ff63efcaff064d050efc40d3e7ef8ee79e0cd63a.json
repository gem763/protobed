Rick Chiarelli personally responded for the first time Thursday to allegations over the past month of inappropriate behaviour toward former staffers and job applicants.\n\nHe said that he has \"never treated a member of my staff (including job candidates) in a sexually harassing, discriminatory, or inappropriate 'gender-based' fashion.\"\n\nHis denial of the allegations was expected \u2014 the College ward councillor had done so through a lawyer last week, and earlier called the accusations \"spurious\" \u2014 but some of his statements warrant further examination.\n\nChiarelli argues allegations should be before rights tribunal\n\nAmong the various pronouncements Chiarelli made in his statement, he argued the allegations against him \"related to workplace gender discrimination or workplace sexual harassment are not matters that are properly placed before the city's integrity commissioner.\"\n\nHe said his own lawyer advised him that most of the complaints against him should be made to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, which would allow him to know the identity of his accuser, the particulars of the allegations, and allow his lawyer to cross-examine the complainants.\n\nCBC spoke with a dozen women who alleged that Chiarelli made inappropriate comments at work and in job interviews, and reported seven of their stories. Three of the women were named, including Victoria Laaber, who worked for Chiarelli for four years. She alleged that, among other things, Chiarelli sent her to a strip club to spy on another councillor and suggested she not wear a bra at work events.\n\nCouncillors Allan Hubley and Scott Moffatt are taking over some of the duties for Rick Chiarelli's College ward residents. (Kate Porter/CBC)\n\nExperts dispute Chiarelli claim\n\nHowever, an Ottawa human rights lawyer who regularly represents employees with workplace sexual harassment issues, said Chiarelli's attacks on the integrity commissioner are \"without foundation.\n\n\"I think that he is misinformed about the nature of the integrity commissioner's powers and responsibilities,\" said Paul Champ.\n\nChamp says under the Municipal Act, the commissioner has the power to summons witnesses and have them provide evidence under oath.\n\nOttawa's code of conduct for councillors, which is a city by-law, clearly states in Sec. 7 that members of council must treat members of the public and staff with respect and \"without abuse, bullying or intimidation, and to ensure that their work environment is free from discrimination and harassment.\"\n\nIt's clear from the code, said Champ, that \"this is within the integrity commissioner's jurisdiction and he has all the powers to conduct an investigation.\"\n\nHe added when there is a complaint about harassment in the workplace, \"there's no requirement to refer that immediately or directly to the human rights tribunal. Every employer has the duty to conduct that investigation at first instance on its own and with the city council, that responsibility lies with integrity commissioner.\"\n\nSt\u00e9phane \u00c9mard-Chabot agrees.\n\nThe municipal law professor \u2014 who was once an Ottawa city councillor \u2014 said while there's nothing to stop complainants from also going to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, \"the two processes are not exclusive. It really is up to the complainant to decide what they want to do.\"\n\nHe also pointed out the tribunal and the integrity commissioner have different roles and, \"if the allegations are proven, have different consequences.\n\n\"I don't see anything either in the code of conduct or in the Ontario Human Rights Code that would prevent the integrity commissioner from going ahead with an inquiry.\"\n\n\u00c9mard-Chabot said that Chiarelli may have a point about the fact that the complainants remain anonymous, adding the councillor \"raises a good point on the aspect of being able to defend himself.\"\n\nBefore each story was published, CBC sent Chiarelli and his lawyer emails fully explaining all allegations in the stories, including the names of the three women on the record. For the job applicants who complained that the councillor made inappropriate comments during their interviews, CBC gave the councillor identifying details about when and where job interviews took place, and what was allegedly said.\n\nThe integrity commissioner is expected to provide a similar level of detail to Chiarelli, although he would not reveal the complainants' names.\n\nEmilie Coyle, who ran against Chiarelli and placed second in last fall's municipal election, sent a text during the summer to a friend that she knew worked with a former employee of Chiarelli after she said she heard through the grapevine about a woman who had an inappropriate interview with Chiarelli. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\nPolitical opponent did sent text about Chiarelli\n\nChiarelli writes that he was \"made aware of one of my political adversaries attempting to persuade a number of women to join an organized group to speak negatively about me.\"\n\nCBC has learned that Emilie Coyle, who ran against Chiarelli and placed second in last fall's municipal election, sent a text during the summer to a friend that she knew worked with a former employee of Chiarelli.\n\nCoyle told CBC she had heard through the grapevine about a woman who had an inappropriate interview with Chiarelli. In the text, Coyle wondered if her friend's friend \u2014 the former Chiarelli employee \u2014 was interested in speaking with the media.\n\n\"There are a few other women who experienced the same thing from him,\" Coyle wrote in the text from late June. \"And we are looking for a critical mass.\"\n\nFormer College ward candidate Emillie Coyle sent this text in the summer to a friend who worked with a former staffer of Rick Chiarelli. (Provided.)\n\nAsked what she meant by the phrase \"looking for a critical mass,\" Coyle told CBC in an interview that in \"stories where women have come forward, that when one woman comes forward it's often not enough it's not believed, and we need to support each other as women.\"\n\nShe said her motivation for sending the text was to help women be heard, \"that they're taken seriously and their stories, when they come out, are investigated. And that's it.\"\n\nShe said she's no longer a political opponent of Chiarelli, and should his seat become vacant, says she has no intention of running in a byelection.\n\nCoyle said she sent the text to just one person, and never reached any former Chiarelli employees or job applicants. CBC asked each of the seven women whose stories were reported last month if they had ever met or spoken with Emilie Coyle, or knowingly ever spoke with anyone on her campaign team from last fall. They all said no.\n\nFormer staffer Victoria Laaber says she sent Coyle's text to Chiarelli in July. (Provided.)\n\nIn fact, the text was passed on to the former Chiarelli employee by Coyle's friend. That former staffer passed the text onto Laaber \u2014 herself a former staffer \u2014 who actually sent it to Chiarelli back in July.\n\n\"I genuinely had no clue how badly I had been manipulated,\" said Laaber, explaining why she sent Chiarelli the text.\n\nShe said since then, through therapy, she has \"come to more of a realization of how badly my situation actually was.\"\n\nLast week, Laaber told her story to CBC on the record, and said she is pursuing a formal complaint through the integrity commissioner.\n\n\"To claim that this is politically orchestrated by a seasoned political adversary is a ridiculous allegation, a purely protective assertion and untrue on various levels,\" Laaber said Thursday of Chiarelli's statement.\n\nChiarelli says he's being 'targeted'\n\nThe councillor also wrote that he retained formal legal counsel in July \u2014 the same month Laaber sent Chiarelli the text about a possible media story looking at his behaviour \u2014 because he said he \"learned\" he \"was being targeted\" over his attempts to bring greater transparency to the LRT procurement process.\n\nFor the last year or so, Chiarelli has been fighting to know more about the city's expropriation agreements for the LRT project, going so far as to file an access for information request against the city for which he is a councillor. He also voted against against the LRT Stage 2 contract .\n\nIt's unclear whether it's these actions that Chiarelli is referring to when he writes about his attempts to bring transparency to the LRT procurement process.\n\nHis office refused CBC's request for an interview to discuss his statement, so it also remains unclear what the councillor means when he says he's being targeted, or by whom.", "description": "Ottawa Coun.
