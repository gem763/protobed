Now we hope the great firewall falls in China.\u201d\n\nBut it was Mr Wong\u2019s meeting with Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, that appears to have particularly incensed Beijing.\n\nChina had repeatedly urged Angela Merkel's government not to allow the activist entry, and he was briefly detained in Hong Kong airport prior to his departure for Germany.\n\nBut shortly after his arrival in Berlin, Mr Wong shared pictures of himself with Mr Maas at an event in the German parliament on Twitter.\n\nChina is also angered at calls to name twin baby pandas in Berlin zoo Hong and Kong Credit: ZOO BERLIN HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX More\n\nBild, the German newspaper that sponsored the event, claimed its reporter had been barred from attending the Chinese ambassador\u2019s press conference in retaliation. The Chinese embassy claimed the journalist had not been admitted for reasons of space.\n\nChina also appears to have been angered by calls in Germany for twin baby pandas at Berlin zoo to be named Hong and Kong in honour of the protesters.\n\nThe Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper reported what it claimed were widespread calls for the pandas to be returned to China after the names topped an online poll.\n\nThe unofficial poll was organised by a German newspaper and had nothing to do with Berlin zoo. A spokesman for the zoo pointed out that the pandas will in fact be named by China.\n\nUnder China\u2019s \u201cpanda diplomacy\u201d policy, the animals are lent to zoos around the world on the understanding they and any young they produce remain Chinese property.\n\n\u201cThe young pandas belong to China and will be returned there in two to four years,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe final decision on naming the pandas will rest with the Chinese panda breeding institute in Chengdu.", "description": "China summoned the German ambassador on Wednesday amid a rapidly escalating row over a Hong Kong democracy activist's visit to Berlin.
