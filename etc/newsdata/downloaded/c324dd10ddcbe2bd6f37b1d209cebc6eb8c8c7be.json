But the transition to colder climes can be tough to dress for.\n\nFrom sunny but breezy days to colder rainy ones, you\u2019ll need a jacket that is versatile enough to withstand the unpredictable weather while being lightweight enough to avoid overheating.\n\nBeyond simply keeping you cosy, a good coat is a great way to show off your sartorial flair.\n\nA statement jacket can completely change an outfit from simple to special.\n\nWe tested pieces across the market, from more practical water-resistant jackets to woolen trenches.\n\nWe wanted to find options that were comfortable and that would work well with most outfits.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It has a very convincing faux-shearling that is incredibly soft to the touch, giving it an ultra-luxurious feel. We tried it in the black mix colourway and loved how the chocolate brown fur lining complemented the black faux leather. There\u2019s even an option to close the neckpiece clasp shut, giving it that authentic aviator jacket look.\n\nBuy now\n\nZara faux leather jacket: \u00a349.99, Zara\n\nEveryone needs a good leather jacket, it\u2019s a fashion staple. This one gets the job done, works with most outfits and made us feel like we could be in an Eighties music video. The double-breasted front and silver hardware makes it feel more expensive than the price-tag. It also comes with a belt, which is handy for colder days when you want to fully wrap up. The sleeves also zip open and closed beyond the wrist, depending on how much movement you want.\n\nBuy now\n\nTopshop camel soft borg coat: \u00a369, Topshop\n\nThis neutral-toned coat offers both comfort and style, with a fluffy finish that\u2019s bang on trend this season. The outer fabric is so soft it almost feels like you\u2019re wearing a blanket, and isn\u2019t that the ultimate goal? The inside, however, is lined with silk so you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re drowning in fluff, or sweat. There are also two lovely tortoiseshell buttons that close up the coat for colder weather. The two large pockets would easily store a phone and a wallet, giving you the option to go bag-free.\n\nBuy now\n\nFinisterre nimbus jacket: \u00a3165, Finisterre\n\nThis piece from eco-friendly brand Finisterre is the one you\u2019re going to want to wear on all your autumn country outings. It is windproof as well as water resistant, so you don\u2019t have to worry about getting caught in the rain. The down-free insulation makes the jacket incredibly light while being weatherproof at the same time. Even better, the fabric, fill and zip are all recycled, so although you may be paying a little more, this is a purchase you can feel good about.\n\nBuy now\n\nHobbs Saskia trench coat: \u00a3199, Hobbs\n\nA quality trench is an autumn must-have. Not only is it weatherproof, but you can wear it with anything. We chose this one from Hobbs because it is the ultimate classic: the cut, buttons and belt are all in line with the old Hollywood aesthetic. After all, the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Brigitte Bardot and Audrey Hepburn made them iconic. It comes in classic tan or a more daring burnt orange. It\u2019s also available in a petite variety, which will accommodate smaller frames.\n\nBuy now\n\nRag & Bone Rach reversible coat: \u00a3660, Rag & Bone\n\nIf you\u2019re a little uneasy about spending so much on a coat, think of it this way, you\u2019re really getting two for the price of one. We\u2019ve always loved the idea of reversible items \u2014 they take up less space in your wardrobe and you can inconspicuously wear the same thing two days in a row. The Rach has a loose fit and a thick, wooly texture, which will keep you warm well into December. The two colours it switches between \u2013 camel and pale grey \u2013 are neutral enough to pair well with a simple black outfit or a more colourful ensemble. One word of warning, though, our tester found the fabric to be a bit itchy, so you\u2019ll want a layer over exposed skin.\n\nBuy now\n\nWarehouse oversized aviator jacket: \u00a389, Warehouse\n\nWarehouse is another brand that has mastered the art of faux fur. The lining to this oversized aviator is plush and silky, and the outside features leather piping and accents, giving it a unique look compared to other similar jackets. We also loved the oversized collar and wide buckles on the sleeves, which gave it an edgy look. We tried it in black, but it also comes in brown and dark grey.\n\nBuy now\n\nBershka double sided biker jacket: \u00a349.99, Bershka\n\nThis cropped jacket was comfortable and easy to move in. It\u2019s not the warmest option of the bunch, but the fit allows room for a thick jumper underneath. It also has piping over the faux-shearling outside, giving it a more fitted look. The sleeves feature a zipper, making it possible to roll them up. At under \u00a350, we think this one\u2019s a bargain.\n\nBuy now\n\nBarbour x Alexa Chung Edith wax jacket: \u00a3379, House of Fraser\n\nBarbour holds the standard for quality English coats. The brand\u2019s wax jackets are water resistant and protect against wind, perfect for autumnal walks. Barbour has teamed up with fashion it-girl Alexa Chung for a twist on the classic. Though it\u2019s not that different to the original, this jacket has a large zipped pocket and oversized fit. We liked that it wasn\u2019t too heavy, and the dark colour meant we could pair it with anything.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Women\u2019s autumn coats and jackets\n\nFrom all the options we tried, we have to go with the M&S Collection aviator jacket. It looked great with our autumn wardrobe and the material felt soft and luxurious. If you\u2019re after a piece that\u2019s more weatherproof, we\u2019d recommend the Barbour x Alexa Chung wax jacket.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
