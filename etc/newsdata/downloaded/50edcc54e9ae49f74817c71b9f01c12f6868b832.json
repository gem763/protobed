For him to come to his first World Championships and defeat the Russian in front of his home nation crowd was a superb performance.", "description": "GB Boxing called for greater transparency from the International Boxing Association (AIBA) after Frazer Clarke was stripped of a semi-final spot at the World Boxing Championships following a successful appeal from his Russian opponents camp.", "authors": ["Pippa Field", "Gareth A Davies"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/09/19/TELEMMGLPICT000209962057-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7CvHEPXYp9AzSNFeusvDx_4.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
