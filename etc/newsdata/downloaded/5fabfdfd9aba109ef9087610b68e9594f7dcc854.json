Tonsillitis is contagious, meaning Miley's latest make-out buddy Cody Simpson should probably take a trip to the doctor\n\nCody's complete poem read: 'The moon's souvenir, the boulevardier, a ballerina on the promenade.\n\n'We open our curtains to the domesticated world for a natural hour, spinning Elvis records and making love in the soft jewelled morning.'\n\nCody first started sharing his musings as Prince Neptune in 2016, and he will shortly be releasing his own book of poetry.\n\nIn 2018, he officially revealed himself as the creative mind behind the anonymous Instagram account, tweeting: 'I am Prince Neptune, poet.'\n\nMeow: Earlier today the Aussie singer shared a sexually-charged poem inspired by the pop star to one of his alternate Instagrams\n\nMiley previously hit back at critics who knocked the Slide Away songstress for moving on from her relationships with Liam Hemsworth and Kaitlynn Carter 'too fast.'\n\n'I know the public feels invested in my past relationship [with ex Liam Hemsworth] because they felt like they saw it thru from the beginning,' the star began her longer confessional.\n\n'I think that's why people have always felt so entitled over my life and how I live it because they've watched me grow up.'\n\n'But I am grown now,' Cyrus continued, 'and make choices as an adult knowing the truth/details/reality.' People only \"know\" what they see on the internet.'\n\nMiley also addressed the inequity of how famous women are portrayed in their pursuit of love and intimacy, as compared to famous men.\n\n'Men (especially successful ones) are RARELY slut shamed. They move on from one beautiful woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are referred to as \"legends\", \"heart throbs\",' she continued, 'where women are called sluts/whores! I am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a \"mans\" world.'\n\n'If we can't beat em, join em!' Miley concluded the section. 'If our president can \"grab em by the p***y...\" can't I just have a kiss and acai bowl?!?!'\n\nAfter specifically responding to being recently spotted kissing Cody, she addressed the budding relationship on the next screen of her Instagram story.\n\n'I refuse to recluse and \"date\" from home cause A. That's not fun B. Extremely uncomfortable/puts me in a vulnerable position,' the performer expressed.\n\n'I would like to share an activity with someone I am dating and not be stuck at home with pretty much nothing to do but \"Netflix and chill\".\n\n'This \"dating\" thing is new to me too. I've never been an \"adult\"/grown a** woman experiencing this... I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my a** off with not much R&R... and \"meeting/trusting\" people in my position is really tuff.'\n\n'Don't f***ing pity me, not what I'm asking for,' Miley concluded. 'I have a great life I wouldn't trade for \"privacy\" but PLEASE don't make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself/and the public's perception of me! Get used to me dating \u2013 this is where I am at!'\n\nClaiming what's hers: Another of Miley's adoring snaps of Cody on her Instagram story on Friday\n\nThis isn't the first time the singer has used social media to vent.\n\nShortly after her split from Liam Hemsworth was made public late this summer, Cyrus made a public statement on Twitter an Instagram that revealed some of her feelings about the split, and how it was important for her to set the record straight.\n\n'At this point I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind,' she tweeted on August 22.\n\n'I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking , foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar.'", "description": "Cyrus, 26, was typically brash while complaining about her illness, telling followers 'tonsillitis is a f***ing f***' in post.
