(Scrumhalf Faf de Klerk could be deployed in a truly emergency-related situation.)\n\nSteyn is an unpredictable character in that department, often renowned for putting over 55m goals with outrageous effortlessness, but strangely not being quite so razor-sharp from shorter ranges.\n\nIs it advantage Wales at tee time?\n\nThat may be something the Boks will have to work around, if they can ... and consistently good field position would be a good start.\n\nTeams: South Africa 15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira Substitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn Wales 15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Ross Moriarty, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones, 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones Substitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Aaron Shingler, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen Watkin\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "The Boks play second fiddle, at least on paper, to Wales for depth of place-kicking personnel in Sunday\u2019s RWC 2019 semi-final, writes <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2847/cf3ede1de1b0427bad6dd1b710ef97f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
