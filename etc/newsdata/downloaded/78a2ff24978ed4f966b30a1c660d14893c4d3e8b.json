The rest are withdrawing \u2013 with \u201cnobody shot, nobody killed,\u201d according to Trump \u2013 and everything is been patched up between Turkey and the US, which canceled all sanctions against its NATO ally \u201cunless something happens that we\u2019re not happy with.\u201d\n\nTwitter wasn\u2019t convinced by the Happily Ever After act. \u201cDid the US just steal Syria\u2019s oil?\u201d one user asked.\n\n\"WE'VE\" secured the oil. \"WE'LL\" be deciding what \"WE'RE\" going to do with it.\" I mean.... Did Syria become the 51st U.S. state and I missed it? \u2014 Bryan Smith (@bryrsmith) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen did the US ever get permission to enter Syria? What makes the US Govt/Military the authorized 'Keeper' of the sovereign oil fields of Syria?\u201d wondered another.\n\nAnswer me this:\n\n- When did the US ever get permission to enter Syria?\n\n- What makes the US Govt/Military the authorized \"Keeper\" of the sovereign oil fields of Syria\n\nIt is utterly amusing to see how simple concepts can be twisted by #MSM to make up look like down. #Syriapic.twitter.com/Q4rfMD1NOn \u2014 Richard T De Sousa (@RichardDeSousa) October 22, 2019\n\nOthers appreciated Trump\u2019s honesty, if not the intentions. The rest are probably busy cranking out a new set of memes.\n\nSecuring Syria\u2019s oil is about as far from a US national interest as securing Bhutan\u2019s yak population.\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t mean we couldn\u2019t do it, though. So don\u2019t get any ideas, Bhutan. pic.twitter.com/hRjkcCn8yk \u2014 ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) October 23, 2019\n\nLike this story?
