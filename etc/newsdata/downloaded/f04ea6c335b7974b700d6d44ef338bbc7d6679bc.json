I\u2019ve clocked my share of frankly heinous things that simply cannot be unseen, and holy hell sometimes I don\u2019t quite understand how things can get that bad \u2013 especially food. I spent the last while asking people what they\u2019ve found growing in various shared fridges, cupboards, lockers, and unfortunate places, and boy did they ever deliver.\n\nNothing is as traumatising as cleaning out a sharehouse fridge and finding food that doesn\u2019t even resemble anything edible. A memory that has seared itself into my brain was the time I was sorting through a vegetable crisper and picked up a rancid cucumber. It had the shape and colour of a telegraph cucumber in its original plastic casing but was entirely goo.\n\nTalking about this on Twitter brought up some frankly horrifying stories of shared fridges that included bowls of blood, a pair of brook meatballs in a ziplock bag, a literal human shit, and something so utterly putrid that a sign was simply stuck to the fridge that said: \u201cdon\u2019t open\u201d.\n\nI used to work with a dude who would eat tuna for lunch every day/ as a snack. He would leave the bowl \u201csoaking\u201d with tuna and water and while it wasn\u2019t in the rankest thing. \u2014 ???? karen karenson ????

The person who ate it just microwaved it for 2 minutes \u2014 Jordan (@JordanZac) July 5, 2018\n\nI didn\u2019t even get to see what was inside it. It had a sign that said not to open it and we were asked to throw it out. As we started lifting it onto a trolley, the door slightly unsealed and the most foul smell spread across the room \u2014 feed me bass drops (@emaciated) July 5, 2018\n\nA blood \u201csample\u201d in a bowl with glad wrap on it. \u2014 Christian McCrea (@christianmccrea) September 30, 2019\n\nthese meatballs were pretty high on the list pic.twitter.com/0ddf8dhtuZ \u2014 REEBOK PUMP (@SecretCommando) July 5, 2018\n\nThe wider Pedestrian offices have also had their fair share of kitchen horror stories including the one time we cleared out the pantry to move offices last year and found a container of brown rice with an expiry date of 2008. TEN. YEAR. OLD. RICE.\n\nAnother unnamed co-worker once chomped down on a piece of cold pizza from one of these shared fridges, wondered why it was a bit chewy, and realised they\u2019d just bitten into an old band-aid. That raises a lot of questions for me, firstly why don\u2019t you look at your food before you eat it and secondly, where was there a band-aid there?\n\nREAD MORE A Bloke Has Been Charged With Kicking Over 20 Wheelie Bins After Being Booted From A Pub\n\nOne workmate by the name of [REDACTED] took a plate of leftovers out of their fridge, wondered why there was pesto on everything, and then realised that a bag of salad mix on the shelf above had liquified and drizzled down onto their food. Sounds delish, and a rare classic moment in the history of shared fridges.\n\nI fondly remember a time of battling pantry moths in a sharehouse kitchen and in the quest to find what the fuck they\u2019d gotten into, came across a glass jar that was once filled with some kind of food but had clearly turned into Pantry Moth HQ and was filled with weird moth web (silk?) and larvae. We just threw the whole thing out.\n\nFinally, in what\u2019s possibly the most terrifying and visceral mental image to date, a workmate of mine found a tub of hummus at the back of one of these known cursed shared fridges one time, and when the house opened the 1kg tub the contents inside \u201cresembled a blue Furby.\u201d Now I firmly believe that\u2019s where all Furbies come from, and I will not be believing otherwise.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we can learn from this, please please clean out your shared fridges on the reg.
