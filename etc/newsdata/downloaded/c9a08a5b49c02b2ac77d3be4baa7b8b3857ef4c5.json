These appearances have left some of Trump\u2019s allies concerned that the former New York mayor is doing more harm than good, but according to those close to the president, Trump still trusts Giuliani and is unlikely to rein him in.\n\nA former Trump adviser told Yahoo News that the president views Giuliani\u2019s belligerent cable news appearances as \u201chighly entertaining\u201d and \u201cmust-watch TV,\u201d and some in the president\u2019s inner circle say Trump always expected Giuliani to be an attack dog.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the circumstances where we could get the president to distance himself from Rudy,\u201d the former adviser said.\n\nIn his cable news blitz, Giuliani loudly insulted anchors as he advanced a dubious allegation that Joe Biden, during his vice presidency in 2016, pushed to have a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating a company his son worked for ousted. There is no evidence to support this claim, however: Biden was among several international leaders who called for the prosecutor to be fired due to allegations of corruption. The investigation into the company had reportedly been closed before the push for the prosecutor\u2019s removal.\n\nThis questionable accusation is central to the Ukraine scandal. Democrats announced the decision to launch an impeachment inquiry after revelations that Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr on a potential probe of the Biden family\u2019s activities in that country. The Trump administration withheld about $400 million of military aid to Ukraine while pressuring Zelensky to pursue the investigation of Biden\u2019s son.\n\nJoe Biden is currently running to replace Trump, and critics have argued that Trump was clearly asking a foreign nation to intervene in the election by hurting his rival. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and said his phone call with the Ukrainian leader was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 19, hours after the first reports that Ukraine was the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the intelligence community, Giuliani appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cChris Cuomo Prime Time.\u201d During the half-hour interview, Giuliani repeatedly contradicted himself and branded Cuomo an \u201cenemy.\u201d The appearance generated widespread headlines and ended on a sour note when Cuomo said \u201cgood night\u201d to Giuliani.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have a good night because what you\u2019re doing is bad for the country,\u201d Giuliani snapped back.\n\nSome of the frustration with Giuliani in Trumpworld stems from the fact he has focused on the questionable claim that Biden sought the prosecutor\u2019s firing rather than the general unseemliness of the foreign business dealings of the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cRudy screwed the pooch,\u201d the former Trump adviser said.\n\nPrior to the drama over Trump\u2019s outreach to the Ukrainian president, critics raised eyebrows over the fact that Hunter Biden had a highly paid position on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father played a leading role in policy for that nation during the administration of President Barack Obama. The situation reportedly concerned White House officials at the time.\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s strategy to fight the impeachment inquiry has been an attempt to shift the focus to Biden. A former White House official said they believed questions about the propriety of Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign work are a potent line of attack and expressed exasperation that Giuliani has fixated on suspect theories about the fired prosecutor.\n\n\u201cRudy just ran with this,\u201d the former official said. \u201cHe went streaking on the field during the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nGiuliani and the White House did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
