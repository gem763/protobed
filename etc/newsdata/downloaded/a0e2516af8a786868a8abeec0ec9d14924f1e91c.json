Infuriated by the Spanish supreme court\u2019s decision to jail nine pro-independence leaders over their roles in the failed push for secession two years ago, thousands of young Catalans marched on Barcelona-El Prat airport in an attempt to occupy it.\n\nPolice responded with baton charges and fired rubber and foam bullets, and the clashes have been followed by three further nights of unrest in the region. Cars have been torched in central Barcelona, barricades set ablaze, buildings vandalised and police officers attacked with petrol bombs, fireworks and stones.\n\nFor some pro-independence Catalans, patience with traditional forms of protest appears to be running out. The court verdict compounded resentment still felt over the Spanish police\u2019s brutal attempts to halt the unilateral independence referendum in October 2017.\n\nTellingly, the airport occupation \u2013 with its echoes of the enduring protests in Hong Kong \u2013 was not called by the two biggest traditional pro-independence civil society groups, the Catalan National Assembly and \u00d2mnium Cultural. It was the brainchild of a secretive new group called Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic that is using apps and social media to control and co-ordinate the protests.\n\nTsunami Democr\u00e0tic announced itself across Twitter, Instagram and Telegram on 2 September this year. \u201cWe are not a new organisation, we are a continuing and inexhaustible campaign,\u201d it said at the time. \u201cWe can fight back. There\u2019s a strategy. A wave is beginning and you are the protagonist. You are the Tsunami.\u201d\n\nThe group, which was swiftly endorsed by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, has been among those opposed to the violence of recent days. \u201cWe never see violence as an option, primarily because it leads us away from our objectives,\u201d the group said in an emailed interview with the Guardian. \u201cNon-violence is the winning strategy and that\u2019s why we follow it.\u201d\n\nTsunami said it had three basic aims: the exercise of the right to Catalan self-determination, freedom for the jailed and exiled prisoners, and the full exercise of fundamental rights. \u201cOn the matter of achieving those aims, our demand is simple and direct: Spain, sit and talk.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters clashed with police outside El Prat airport in Barcelona on Monday.

To access it, the user needs a QR code that it scans from another, trusted user. The app already has more than 270,000 users.\n\nThe app made its debut on Monday with the call to occupy Barcelona airport \u2013 a call swiftly answered by many young Catalans. Irma, 19, was in class when she got the message. Marc and Anna, both 21, were at a demonstration in Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya in central Barcelona.\n\n\u201cWe were hanging around in Pla\u00e7a Catalunya and we didn\u2019t have any idea what to do when we got the message to occupy the airport,\u201d Anna told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThe plan was to paralyse the airport to get across our message that we\u2019re not happy with what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Marc, who, similarly to many others, reached the airport after a five-hour journey by public transport and on foot.\n\nMany had been able to download fake boarding passes for existing flights via Tsunami to enable them to cross police lines. \u201cAt first there was no violence where I was, just some people sitting on the ground,\u201d said Irma. \u201cThen suddenly the police starting beating people with their truncheons.\u201d\n\nAnna managed to get inside the airport via the roof and made for the parking area before the police began charging. \u201cWe hid behind the buses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe police were firing down on the crowd from above.\u201d\n\nTsunami\u2019s ability to direct events is impressive. On Wednesday night the tens of thousands of people who gathered near Barcelona\u2019s former bullring moved as one to another location when they received the word to do so, and an hour later after another signal from the app they dispersed.\n\nThe group said that like the Hong Kong protesters, it believed in Bruce Lee\u2019s famous mantra \u201cBe water, my friend\u201d. It added: \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing how to adapt, creatively and generously, to each new circumstance.\u201d\n\nWednesday night\u2019s march was called by the direct action group Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDR). It is not clear how much this group overlaps with Tsunami.\n\nTsunami said it had nothing to do with the CDR and said some people found it difficult to understand the \u201cenormous degree of collective will\u201d within the Catalan population. The group confirmed it had had one-off contacts with pro-independence parties and groups, although \u201cnever with the government of [the Catalan regional president] Quim Torra\u201d.\n\nAccording to Anna, Tsunami is not hierarchical. \u201cIt\u2019s more about people who trust each other taking action,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s linked to the CDR. Probably, because it\u2019s clearly people with experience in organising things. No one really knows. It\u2019s more that people like me and my friends share information.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters hold up their mobile phones during a demonstration in Barcelona.

Something new was needed, a new actor that could mobilise people.\u201d\n\nFumanal pointed out that the independence movement had always been extremely good at getting its message across, but argued that Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic was a misnomer. \u201cThey talk about civil disobedience, but that\u2019s like calling an economic crisis a recession,\u201d she said. \u201cYou skirt the negative fact that this is neither a tsunami nor democratic. A tsunami sweeps away everything in its path. But what we\u2019re seeing here are 20,000 very well-organised people in Catalonia.\u201d\n\nFumanal also wondered whether the violence of recent days was proof that Tsunami was losing its ability to keep some people on the path of non-violence. During Wednesday\u2019s rioting, groups of young people threw bottles and stones at the police while chanting \u201csom gent de pau\u201d (we\u2019re peaceful people).\n\n\u201cObviously you can\u2019t avoid the kind of violent scenes we\u2019ve seen because that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re dealing with a crowd,\u201d said Fumanal. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between a spontaneous act of violence and generating the kind of massive chaos we saw in Barcelona on Wednesday or at the airport on Monday.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s acting interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said intelligence services were looking into Tsunami and who was behind it.\n\nPacifism has long been the independence movement\u2019s trump card but after seven years of peaceful protest with little or nothing to show for it, frustration is giving way to acts of violence.\n\nMany thousands of Catalans are marching peacefully along the region\u2019s roads and motorways to congregate in Barcelona for a huge protest on Friday. However, others feel the road to independence has already proved too long and tortuous.\n\n\u201cIt would have been really lovely if the peaceful approach had worked but revolution \u2013 if that\u2019s the right word \u2013 has never achieved its goals without violence,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that our only reward for years of peaceful protest was to get beaten up.\u201d", "description": "Attempted occupation at airport was called by new group using an app to bring young people on to streets", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen", "Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7041b1c41d2426ce63d11a4de227339eba995f/567_142_2748_1649/master/2748.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=325516a48a3a2638be13fa0318ed9074", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
