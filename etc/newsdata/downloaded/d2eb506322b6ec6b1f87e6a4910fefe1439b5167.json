It's going to be impossible for Shiff to put this thing on the president when Biden actually did what he's claiming the president did,\" Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani's TV appearance came after Joe Biden's presidential campaign requested in a letter on Sunday that major news networks not invite Giuliani anymore. The president's lawyer spent Sunday aggressively highlighting what he called Biden's apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China, connected to his son Hunter Biden's positions on the board of Burisma Holdings and other companies.\n\n\"Although I've been banned, I'm glad to see you have the courage to have me on,\" Giuliani joked with Bartiromo. \"The reason they want me to be silenced is not because I'm unhinged.

I wrote about it, tweeted about it,\" Giuliani said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nHe accused the media of being corrupt and complicit in a coverup.\n\nFOX News' Gregg Re and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Giuliani's TV appearance came after\u00a0Joe Biden's\u00a0presidential campaign requested in a letter on Sunday\u00a0that major news networks not invite Giuliani anymore.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/rudy-giuliani-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
