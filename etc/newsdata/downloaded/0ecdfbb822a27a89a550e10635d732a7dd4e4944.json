(TSX: GUD) (\"Knight\") today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Knight will acquire a 51.21% interest in Biotoscana Investments S.A. (B3: GBIO33) (\u201cGBT\u201d or \u201cGrupo Biotoscana\u201d) from a controlling shareholder group that includes Advent International and Essex Woodlands, among others, for BRL 10.96 per share. This implies a 22.2% premium to GBT\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average share price as of October 18, 2019. Knight will pay approximately BRL 596 million or C$189 million(1) in cash consideration for the 51.21% controlling interest in GBT. Following completion of this transaction, Knight will launch a mandatory tender offer to acquire the remaining 48.79% interest in GBT from public shareholders on similar terms, for expected cash consideration of approximately BRL 568 million or C$180 million(1), assuming all public shareholders tender their shares.\n\nFollowing completion of the acquisition of 100% of GBT, Knight expects to pay an aggregate equity purchase price of BRL 1,164 million or C$369 million(1) and an enterprise value of BRL 1,318 million or C$418 million(1), including net financial debt as at June 30, 2019. This represents an attractive purchase multiple of 8.5x GBT\u2019s LTM adjusted EBITDA.\n\n\u201cThis transformational acquisition establishes Knight as a premiere pan-American (ex-US) specialty pharmaceutical company. With scale and a strong regional infrastructure, we will be well positioned as the pan-American (ex-US) in-licensing partner of choice,\u201d said Jonathan Ross Goodman, Chief Executive Officer of Knight. \u201cThe combination of Knight and GBT creates a compelling platform in large, fast growing markets. GBT is a natural strategic fit, with a similar business model to Knight and strong relationships with global partners.\u201d\n\nGrupo Biotoscana is a biopharmaceutical group that operates in the fast-growing Latin American region and focuses on rapidly growing market segments such as oncology and onco-hematology, infectious diseases and other specialty therapeutic areas. GBT is currently present throughout 10 Latin American countries where it operates under its companies Biotoscana, United Medical, LKM and DOSA.\n\n\u201cAfter an extensive search for opportunities and partners in Latin America, we are very excited to welcome GBT\u2019s team of talented people, who are fundamentally aligned with Knight\u2019s culture and core values\u201d, commented Samira Sakhia, President of Knight. \u201cGBT is a stand-alone successful business that we intend to add significant value to through our business development and operational expertise. We look forward to working with our new extended team to build a pan-American commercial solution for biotech and pharmaceutical companies with late-stage innovative therapeutics.\u201d\n\nTransaction Structure, Approvals and Closing Conditions\n\nKnight will acquire a 51.21% interest from a controlling shareholder group that includes Advent International and Essex Woodlands (the \u201cPrivate Transaction\u201d) for cash consideration of approximately BRL 596 million or C$189 million(1). The Private Transaction is expected to close by November 29, 2019, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, and will not be subject to anti-trust approval in Brazil. The Private Transaction will be fully funded from cash on Knight\u2019s balance sheet. Upon completion of this first step, Knight will become the controlling shareholder and will appoint its representatives to the board of directors of GBT.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Private Transaction, Knight will launch a mandatory public tender offer to acquire the remaining 48.79% interest in GBT from public shareholders (the \u201cTender Offer\u201d) on similar terms as the Private Transaction. Knight expects to pay approximately BRL 568 million or C$180 million(1) in connection with the Tender Offer, assuming all public shareholders tender their shares. The Tender Offer process is expected to take 4 to 8 months from launch to complete and is expected to be fully funded from cash on Knight\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nKnight will own a 51.21% controlling interest in GBT upon the close of the Private Transaction and public shareholders will continue to own the remaining 48.79% interest. Knight intends to acquire 100% of GBT following completion of the Tender Offer. Following completion of the acquisition of 100% of GBT, Knight expects to pay an aggregate equity purchase price of BRL 1,164 million or C$369 million(1) and an enterprise value of BRL 1,318 million or C$418 million(1), including net financial debt as at June 30, 2019.\n\nKnight has retained RBC Capital Markets as its exclusive financial advisor and Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP as its legal advisor.\n\nConference Call Notice\n\nKnight will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the transaction today at 8:30am EST.
