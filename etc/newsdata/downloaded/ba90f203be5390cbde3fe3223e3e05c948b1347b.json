I think that is because it serves that Trump counter-narrative quite well, where a lot of mud is being thrown in absolutely every direction.\u201d\n\nFor a proud monarchist, who would have dyed his blood blue if possible, such is Downer\u2019s distaste of Australia\u2019s political left and the red-branded Labor party that being labelled a leftist conspirator would hurt almost as much as being deliberately snubbed by the Queen. Maybe more.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos (@GeorgePapa19) I have been right about Downer from the beginning. A wannabe spy and Clinton errand boy who is about to get exposed on the world stage. Great reporting, NYTs! Mifsud is next.\n\nThe FBI reportedly launched its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election after Papadopoulos told Downer that Moscow had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to a report published by the New York Times, Papadopoulos made the revelation to Downer, the Australian high commissioner to the UK, \u201cduring a night of heavy drinking\u201d. Papadopoulos reportedly told Downer that Russian officials possessed thousands of emails that could harm Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot about what is already a strange story that we don\u2019t know, and may never know.\n\nDowner relaying whatever information he learned from his meeting with Papadopoulos back to Australia through diplomatic channels is business as usual. But, as reported by the Guardian this week, the fact that details of his Papadopoulos chat ended up with the then US charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in London, Elizabeth Dibble, did take Downer\u2019s Australian masters by surprise. The first Canberra knew about Downer\u2019s conversation with America\u2019s top diplomat in the UK was when the FBI asked for more information.\n\nFor those who know Downer, best known in Australia for his gaffes, use of words like \u201cunctuous\u201d in normal discourse and an ill-advised photo wearing a pair of fishnet stockings and high heels for a charity promotion, cock-up has always come before conspiracy.\n\nHe came by his born-to-rule mentality honestly, his conservative leanings passed on through the Downer line, along with height, high foreheads and clipped speech.\n\nJames Brown (@captainbrown) Someone needs to get @GeorgePapa19 up to speed on Australian politics https://t.co/UXOvN8O9mg\n\nHis grandfather, Sir John Downer, served two terms as the premier of South Australia \u2013 the Australian state which likes to boast of its free settler beginnings in a land colonised by convicts \u2013 before heading to the federal Senate in 1901.\n\nServing as a senator at federation was enough to have a Canberra suburb named after him, as well as spark a political dynasty. Sir John\u2019s son, Alick, went on to serve in the conservative Menzies cabinet as the minister for immigration between 1958 and 1963.\n\nThe second political Downer was best known for modifying the postwar White Australia policy, removing a loathed dictation test and providing a pathway for non-European spouses and children to be naturalised, while still arguing to preserve a \u201cpredominately homogeneous population\u201d. Leaving parliament, he became Australia\u2019s man in London, and a knighted one at that.\n\nThere was never any real question that at least one of his children would carry on what had become the family business. And so, Alexander, his only son and namesake, enthusiastically became the next Honourable Downer, via the diplomatic service.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos (@GeorgePapa19) I dedicated an entire chapter in my book to my bizarre meeting with Alexander Downer. Highly suggest to read it and to understand how similar the meeting with him and Stefan Halper, another UK spy, was.

He was elected leader of the opposition as it attempted to right itself after losing what had been dubbed the \u201cunlosable election\u201d. Just seven months later, his party was looking elsewhere.\n\nA speech re-emerged that he\u2019d made in the late 80s to a far-right group, the League of Rights, which, among its stated goals, included exposing who was behind the \u201cnew international economic order\u201d and pushing back against the Indigenous land rights movement. He was considered to have blundered on the Liberals\u2019 position on the newly established Native Title Act, which he considered repealing if in government, and by the time he made a \u201cjoke\u201d that his party, running on the slogan \u201cthings that matter\u201d, should name its domestic violence policy \u201cthings that batter\u201d, it was over.\n\nParty heavyweights arranged for a \u201cpeaceful\u201d leadership transition, which saw John Howard assume the Liberal leadership, and then the prime ministership, for just under 12 years. Downer served as his foreign minister throughout, having been given the portfolio of his choice for stepping aside.\n\nThe focus was on Australia\u2019s relationship with the Pacific, which Downer oversaw with mixed success. Then came the 11 September attacks, and the foreign minister led the charge to have Australia join with the US in the war against Iraq, becoming one of its fiercest supporters and then defenders, even as public sentiment turned against it.\n\n\u201cYet still many \u2013 particularly on the political left \u2013 shrug and say that the murder, torture, and rape of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis \u2013 by their own rulers \u2013 should go unchecked,\u201d he told parliament in 2003, adding: \u201cI cannot in conscience ignore the record of Saddam Hussein as a ruthless tyrant who tries still \u2013 in the face of concerted international pressure \u2013 to retain and develop the most evil of weapons.\n\n\u201cAs the foreign minister of our great country, I will not be remembered for turning my back on such evil and allowing the spectre of Saddam to haunt future generations.\u201d\n\nDowner continued to assert that weapons of mass destruction would be found, even as demands for evidence became deafening. He was later embroiled in the Australian Wheat Board oil-for-wheat scandal, emerging largely unscathed.\n\nIt was Downer who would retell a \u201cfunny\u201d story of seeing a respected foreign affairs mandarin, Dick Woolcott, who had publicly criticised Australia\u2019s involvement in Iraq, at an airport, yelling out \u201closer\u201d, then ducking down. He was foreign minister at the time.\n\nIt was also Downer who designed, at Howard\u2019s behest, one of the policies Trump most admires in Australia, the so-called Pacific Solution of detaining asylum seekers offshore, convincing the public it was the only answer to the \u201cboat people crisis\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump's bizarre logic damages US allies' trust in intelligence sharing | Daniel Flitton Read more\n\nAfter leaving federal parliament in 2008, Downer was parked back in the diplomatic service, before the conservative government was re-elected in 2014 and he replaced a Labor appointee as the high commissioner to London.\n\nThere, he continued to live his best life, as close to the crown as an Australian monarchist could hope. And then came the Kensington Wine Rooms conversation. Doing his job, he reported the titbit, which became the nugget on which the US special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation was built.\n\nThe man best known for rolling on fishnets now finds himself at the centre of an alt-right conspiracy, accused of attempting to bring down a president he would have supported as foreign minister.\n\nIt\u2019s left those who know Downer befuddled. It\u2019s left the Australian voting public, who have only ever known him as a staunch conservative, bemused. And it\u2019s left those watching Australia\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s requests uncertain about just how far it will go. And who might be left under the bus.", "description": "Conservative monarchist who led the charge to have Australia join the second Iraq war is now bizarrely at the centre of an alt-right conspiracy", "authors": ["Amy Remeikis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af272b150ec4cbe6ef3248f14d730d36fda32426/288_919_3129_1877/master/3129.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=933447a52c94cabe905e0ae4191521c5"}
