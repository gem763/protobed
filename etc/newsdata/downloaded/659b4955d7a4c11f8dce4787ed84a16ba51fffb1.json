Adam Schiff.\n\nThis is why Trump\u2019s \u201cpoll numbers are defying the impeachment mess,\u201d as CNBC recently wrote.\n\nHe\u2019s the \u201cjunkyard dog who digs\u201d out all the dirt on the government, as CNBC\u2019s Jake Novak recently put it.\n\nYep. He\u2019s the guy who doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t cave, doesn\u2019t back down \u2014 and doesn\u2019t sell out the middle-of-America fly-over country citizens to cut lucrative personal-albeit-shady deals with government\u2019s elites.\n\nWhat\u2019s more: He goes on the offensive and attacks when all the cards \u2014 all the cowards \u2014 say he should retreat.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 & lawyer \u2026,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d he said, in a follow-up tweet, \u201cand even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u2018Colluded\u2019 with them, must all be immediately Impeached!?\u201d\n\nPriceless.\n\nClassic Trump.\n\nNo wonder Sen. Kamala Harris, seeking the high White House office for 2020, wants Twitter executives to boot Trump from the social media platform. She wouldn\u2019t be able to stand his tweeting fire if she were to become the candidate of Democratic Party choice.\n\nAs it is, Trump took the calls for impeachment those on the left have been railing against him for years \u2014 and turned the tables. Flipped the accusations around. Pointed the same fuzzy impeachment finger back at his accusers.\n\nLegal? Lawful? Possible under the Constitution to officially impeach Pelosi and Schiff?\n\nWell, put it this way: It\u2019s more lawful than going after a president for impeachment when there are no crimes he\u2019s committed that are impeachment-worthy.\n\nIt\u2019s the messaging that matters.\n\nAnd on that, Trump is aces.\n\nHe\u2019s taken the cry for impeachment, flipped it around, and slung it right back at his political foes. Let Schiff and Pelosi feel some of the political heat for a while.\n\nLet Schiff and Pelosi face the uncomfortable \u2014 unAmerican \u2014 prospect of proving their own innocence over accusations that aren\u2019t even formally charged.\n\nWhat goes around comes around. Even in politics. Especially with Trump. And for those who\u2019ve still not caught on to the facts: That\u2019s why Trump was elected in the first place.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
