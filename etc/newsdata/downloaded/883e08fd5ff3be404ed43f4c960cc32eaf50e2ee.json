They also credited President Trump\u2019s guidance for making the law\u2019s insurance exchanges work better.\n\n\u201cThe president who was supposedly trying to sabotage the law has been better at running it than the guy who wrote the law,\u201d Azar said during a phone briefing for reporters, alluding first to Trump and then to his predecessor, President Barack Obama, who regarded the ACA as one of his main domestic accomplishments.\n\nThe marketplaces were created under the ACA for people who cannot get affordable health benefits thorugh a job. The 4 percent price drop is not for everyone; it is the average for premiums in 2020 for the popular level of coverage on which federal subsidies are based. The figure is calculated for both a typical 27-year-old and for a family of four. This premium drop comes after a smaller decrease for 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rates announced Monday are for the 39 states that are in the federal insurance marketplace or rely on the government\u2019s HealthCare.gov computerized enrollment system. The other states and the District of Columbia operate their own insurance marketplaces under the ACA.\n\nIn the Washington area, Virginia is the only state using HealthCare.gov, and the average premium there will decrease by 6 percent, according to federal data, which show that rates are going down in 27 of the states included in the analysis.\n\nThe data also show that the number of insurance companies willing to sell ACA health plans also has rebounded after widespread defections for a few years. Early in Trump\u2019s time in the White House, health officials often pointed to departing insurers as evidence the law was failing.\n\nAD\n\nVerma, the CMS adminstrator, told reporters that the administration has taken steps to appeal to insurers, such as making it more difficult for consumers to sign up for health plans outside of the annual enrollment season.\n\nAD\n\nNeither she nor Azar addressed the reason behind falling insurance prices, but they repeated an administration\u2019s refrain that premiums are unaffordable for Americans whose incomes are slightly too high for them to qualify for premium subsidies the law provides. Some ACA proponents have contended that premiums spiked higher than necessary early in Trump\u2019s tenure, after he eliminated a type of subsidy for insurers, so the rate decreases lately have been a sort of correction.\n\nACA health plans first became available for 2014, four years after Congress passed the sweeping law that revised large parts of the U.S. health-care system. During the first enrollment period starting the fall of 2013, HealthCare.gov debuted with computer defects so severe that many people could not sign up for coverage, but the bugs eventually were corrected, and the last few enrollment periods have been relatively smooth.\n\nAD\n\nSince President Trump\u2019s took office, the larger impediments, critics say, have been steps his administration has taken to try to thwart the ACA.\n\nAD\n\nFederal health officials have, for instance, slashed federal money that has paid for \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 people with nonprofit organizations that helped consumers figure out how to sign up for coverage. The administration also has nearly eliminated funds for advertising and other outreach activities focused on hard-to-reach people who are eligible for ACA health plans but remain uninsured. Verma has repeatedly said that neither forms of help were particularly useful.\n\nIn addition, a central requirement of the law \u2014 that most Americans carry health insurance \u2014 was neutralized starting in January because recent tax changes, passed at the end of 2017 by a Republican-led Congress and signed by Trump, eliminated the financial penalty for people who flout that requirement,\n\nAD\n\nStill, despite predictions of ACA supporters that such moves would reduce enrollment, the draw of the marketplaces has remained fairly sturdy. According to the most recent federal figures, 10.6 million consumers had ACA health plans as of early this year \u2014 a decline of less than one percent from a year before.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nIn contrast with the Obama years, Verma told reporters that the administration once again has not produced a forecast of how many consumers will sign up for coverage for 2020, even through the Government Accounting Office last year urged HHS to do so.\n\nThe next sign-up period, from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15, comes as a New Orleans-based federal appeals court is expected to issue its opinion soon in a lawsuit challenging the ACA\u2019s constitutionality. Asked whether a ruling against the law, as the administration has urged in the case, would dissuade people from enrolling, Azar predicted that it would not.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur message would be keep calm and carry on,\u201d Azar said, noting that the court\u2019s opinion almost certainly would be appealed to the Supreme Court. \u201cThere will be no immededicate disruption to anybody.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "After defecting from the marketplaces, more insurers are now selling coverage for 2020.", "authors": ["Amy Goldstein", "Reporter Covering Health-Care Policy", "Other Social Policy Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QR3GN93aAA_ONQoFoXWNZSJ0oOw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HOYJFKWPJYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
