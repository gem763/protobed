However, the officers checked her for weapons and other illegal items.\n\n\u201cIn Catlett\u2019s front pocket, police found a small plastic-wrapped bag that had small scraps of paper, a straw cut into a smaller length, and several plastic bags. She told police that the bag was not hers and that someone else had put it in there,\u201d according to KATV.\n\nReports said the officers also found what appeared to be methamphetamine residue inside the paper and straws.\n\nHowever, Catlett told police that if she \u201cpops hot\u201d in a sobriety test, it was because her brother \u201cfed her a sandwich contaminated with meth,\u201d according to the New York Post.\n\nWhen authorities asked Catlett if her brother gave her meth on a regular basis, she said he did and that she believed he put the drug in her drink during their recent visit at the hospital because she felt \u201clike she does when she used to use meth.\u201d\n\nReports said officers noticed that Catlett had needle markings on her arm from IV usage. She also failed a sobriety test and refused to submit to a chemical test.\n\nOnce Catlett was taken into custody, the officers questioned Furr, who told them that if there was anything illegal in the car, \u201cit would be in the console and it would be ICE.\u201d\n\nPolice reportedly found a glass pipe and a package of meth and Q-tips inside a zippered bag in the console.\n\nFurr was also taken into custody and later stated that the last time he used meth with Catlett was on Saturday night before they went to visit her brother at the hospital.\n\nBoth suspects are currently being held in the Garland County Detention Center and face charges of possession of methamphetamine or cocaine with purpose to deliver and four counts of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nThe two are scheduled to appear in the Hot Springs District Court on November 4.", "description": "An Arkansas woman who was arrested for allegedly having drug paraphernalia inside her car claimed her brother fed her a \"meth sandwich.\"", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Elizabeth-Marie-Catlett-Don-Russell-Furr-meth-sandwich-Hot-Springs-Police-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
