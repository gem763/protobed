Ron DeSantis pledged to raise for the event has yet to arrive. Event planners also couldn't land a keynote speaker for the dinner, which was scheduled for Nov. 9 in Orlando.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe postponement is a significant setback to the state Republican Party and potentially President Donald Trump, who will need to win Florida to secure his reelection in 2020. The annual dinner, which last year netted the party $500,000, is as much a pep rally as it is a fundraiser, serving to gin up excitement in a state where elections are decided on slim margins and voter turnout is critical. The snafu adds to the woes of a party already gripped by infighting over its leadership.\n\n\u201cSomeone dropped the ball, it is unprecedented to cancel such a high-profile dinner,\u201d said one member of the state executive committee. \u201cAnnouncing the cancellation without even giving a notice to the committee is even worse.\u201d\n\nSome officials are unconvinced the party is in a position to reschedule the Statesman\u2019s Dinner.\n\nState party Chairman Joe Gruters and DeSantis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe news was delivered via the party's Twitter account.\n\n\u201c2019 Statesman\u2019s Dinner and Fall RPOF quarterly meeting will be postponed for a later date this year,\u201d the party wrote on its Twitter account. \u201cMore information and exciting news about the rescheduled event will be released soon!\u201d\n\nRumors had circulated for weeks that planning for the party\u2019s major event was hitting snags. The problem was exacerbated by Gruters' original expectation that Trump himself would serve as keynote speaker.\n\nSo far, the only confirmed speaker for the event was DeSantis.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump's campaign in Florida did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs of Friday, the only table sponsorships that had been sold were bought by local Republican Executive Committees. No donor or corporate tables had been sold and DeSantis had not raised any money for the event, despite pledging millions of dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s another blow to a party that has been in turmoil in recent weeks.\n\nDeSantis Chief of Staff Shane Strum and first lady Casey DeSantis were behind the ouster of top party officials earlier this year and recently, with Trump's endorsement, installed a new executive director, Peter O'Rourke.\n\nLast week, O'Rourke was hit with a scathing report on at his leadership at the Department of Veterans Affairs' whistleblower office.\n\nThe department's Office of Inspector General said O'Rourke tried to bury whistleblower complaints and showed \u201cbias\u201d investigating complaints made against prominent Trump appointees.\n\nThe findings caught many in the state party by surprise, adding to the unhappiness over the ouster of O'Rourke's predecessor, Jennifer Locetta.\n\nFlorida Democrats seeking to unseat Trump next year have had their own difficulties, including trouble arranging a national speaker for their fundraiser earlier this month.", "description": "Ticket sales were lackluster, and Trump wasn't on the agenda.", "authors": ["Matt Dixon"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/6e/543f45d744748ad7596455c84952/191028-joe-gruters-ap-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
