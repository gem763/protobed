Sadly, this is not an isolated case.\n\nIt has become an increasingly common practice for refugees to be involuntarily returned to insecure countries of origin, in direct violation of laws and principles adopted by the international community over the past 70 years.\n\nFirst and foremost, such laws and principles assert that refugees should be able to make a free and informed choice about repatriation, and must not be pressed into going back. They also stipulate that repatriation must take place in a safe and dignified manner, with refugees allowed to return at their own pace.\n\nIn addition, the international community has agreed that the UN refugee agency, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, should actively encourage people to return home only in situations where fundamental changes have taken place, such as a change of government, democratic elections or restoration of the rule of law.\n\nAnother principle concerns the need for repatriation movements to be effectively coordinated, usually through the establishment of \u201ctripartite commissions\u201d involving the host state, country of origin and the UNHCR. In this context, the UN refugee agency is charged with representing the interests of refugees, ensuring that their return is conducted with full respect for their rights.\n\nBut while these principles are clear, they are coming under mounting pressure.\n\nThe international community now considers repatriation not only the preferred outcome but also, in many cases, the only possible outcome.\n\nThat is because host countries in developing regions do not want refugees indefinitely present on their territory. Donor states are keen to avert the need for long-term assistance programmes, while countries of origin are eager to bolster their legitimacy by demonstrating that exiled citizens are prepared to return.\n\nAs for the UNHCR \u2013 an agency funded and governed by states, and therefore highly sensitive to their concerns \u2013 it has become a primary objective to get as many refugees home as possible, demonstrating the organisation\u2019s value to its primary stakeholders.\n\nIn this context, the notion that repatriation should be voluntary, safe and dignified has been increasingly set aside, with varying forms of coercion being used to ensure that mass repatriation movements take place.\n\nAs seen with respect to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Somalis in Kenya, Afghans in Pakistan, Syrians in Lebanon and Burundians in Tanzania, measures used include the threat of camp closures, reductions in assistance levels, the closure of refugee markets and harassment by government officials.\n\nStates now insist that repatriation should take place more rapidly, even if there have not been fundamental changes in their country of origin. In November 2017, for example, Bangladesh, Myanmar and key donors such as the EU began to prepare for the return of an estimated 700,000 Rohingya refugees, even though large-scale displacements were still taking place.\n\nSimilarly, over the past two years there has been a growing international effort to prepare for refugee returns to Syria, despite the Assad regime remaining in power, the continued military presence of its Russian allies and the widespread prevalence of human rights abuses.\n\nThe forces that have undermined the established principles of refugee repatriation are deeply entrenched and seem highly unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future. Even so, there are a number of steps that could be taken to halt the recent deterioration in standards.\n\nFirst, the UNHCR should uphold the principle that repatriation must be voluntary, safe and dignified, even if this complicates its relationship with host and donor states. If the organisation is put under pressure to engage in repatriation operations that do not meet such standards, it must either decline to do so or be completely transparent about the rationale for its involvement.\n\nUN communications chief under fire for tweeting refugee's details Read more\n\nA more diversified approach to refugee solutions is also needed, with situations in which some refugees might benefit from local integration more systematically identified and efforts made to find additional resettlement places.\n\nThird, the repatriation process should become much more participatory. While it will not be an easy task, the UNHCR should try to convince states to establish \u201cquadripartite commissions\u201d, in which refugees are directly represented by democratically selected leaders.\n\nFinally, there is a need to ensure that refugees who choose freely to repatriate have every opportunity to rebuild their lives in their homeland. For that objective to be attained, short-term humanitarian assistance must be complemented by longer-term development initiatives, designed to support the economy, infrastructure and environment of areas that have received large numbers of returnees.\n\nThis is a task that lies well beyond the competence of the UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, one that will require the full engagement of development actors such as the World Bank and the UN Development Programme.\n\n\u2022 Jeff Crisp is a research associate at the refugee studies centre, University of Oxford, and former head of policy development and evaluation at the UNHCR.
