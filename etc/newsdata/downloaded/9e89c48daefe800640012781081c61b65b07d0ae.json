Both plaintiffs were enrolled in the LA branch and paid tuition fees of $300 each month.\n\nThe lawsuit suggests there was another masterclass including a separate class for intimate scenes for $750 and the students were taped during the auditions so that James Franco could select after reviewing the recordings. Gaal and Tither-Kaplan also alleged they were asked to sign away the rights to these recordings.\n\nRelated: India\u2019s #MeToo movement takes aim at alleged sexual misconduct\n\nThe suit claims Franco and his partners were \u201cengaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior towards female students by sexualizing their power as a teacher and an employer by dangling the opportunity for roles in their projects\u201d.\n\nGaal said she was not allowed to join these classes after she spoke of the distress she experienced in the auditions. However, Tither-Kaplan confessed that her involvement in the audition got her a role in one of James Franco\u2019s films which is yet to release.\n\nThis is not the first time someone has accused Franco. The Spiderman 3 villain had been accused of misconduct in 2018 by five women including Tither-Kaplan. However, his lawyer rejected the allegations.\n\nIn an interview with Seth Meyers, he had said, \u201cI have my own side of this story, but I believe in these people that have been underrepresented getting their stories out, enough that I will hold back things that I could say, just because I believe in it that much. If I have to take a knock, because I am not going to try and actively refute things, then I will, because I believe in it that much.\u201d\n\nWhat are your views on the story?
