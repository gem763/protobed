(File picture)\n\nThe study by Smart Energy GB found that Brits were increasingly rowing over 'eco' issues, such as turning lights off when they were not needed and wasting food.\n\nCommon causes of family arguments 1. Messiness (dishes, clothes, bath) - 42 per cent 2 . Chores/Housework rota - 27 per cent 3. Leaving lights on- 26 per cent 4. Food waste - 20 per cent 5. Household budget/overspending - 19 per cent 6. What to have for dinner - 19 per cent 7. When to put heating on/correct temperature - 17 per cent 8. What to watch on TV - 17 per cent 9. Leaving loo seat up - 14 per cent 10. Taking the bins out - 13 per cent\n\nThe study also found that 11 per cent of the particpants were unhappy with how long a family member took in the bath or shower while 10 per cent continued to argue about who should load and unload the dishwasher in the household.\n\nOther bugbears include leaving the toilet seat up and not taking the bins out.\n\nRobert Cheesewright, of Smart Energy, said today: 'It's great to see so much passion and consideration when it comes to energy saving and sustainability amongst modern families.\n\n'We are facing a climate crisis, but fortunately there are lots of small changes households can make to help, and getting a smart meter is one easy option.\n\n'A smart meter is the first step towards taking control of our energy usage, reducing waste and upgrading our energy system to pave the way for a cleaner, greener future.\n\n'If every household took the energy efficiency measures available right now, together we could achieve 11 per cent of the UK's 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target.'", "description": "According to a poll of 2,000 Brits by Smart Energy GB, the biggest cause of family squabbles is people leaving a mess behind, followed by rows over chores and leaving the lights on.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20331966-0-image-a-4_1572361814545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
