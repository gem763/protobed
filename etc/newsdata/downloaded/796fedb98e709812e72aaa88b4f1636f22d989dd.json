The Mostyn family moved onto the land in the 15th century, several decades before they became the proud owners of the title \u201cbaronet.\u201d They were friends of the Tudors and flourished under Henry VIII, which helped earn them more than a few pounds sterling and a bump in class status that eventually led them to build this beauty in 1825. Now, for a couple thousand a night, you can call this castle your (temporary) own.\n\nWhen it came to their new family home, the Mostyn\u2019s threw any inclination towards modesty out their late-Regency windows. Between the main Castle Mansion, the Abbey Suite, and the Tower Apartment, this lavish estate sleeps 38, which means its time to plan that family reunion you\u2019ve been putting off or the big friend gathering you\u2019ve always wanted to host. Send out the invites, wrangle the obligatory crazy uncle, but remember: when it comes to the twentieth-century upstairs/downstairs lifestyle, it\u2019s BYOB\u2014bring your own butler.\n\nThe 19th-century castle built by the Mostyn baronets is a paragon of Tudor-Gothic architecture. It has the crenelated roofline, the army of rectangular windows, the sumptuous interiors\u2026and don\u2019t forget the obligatory suit of armor. (Check the reception room to find the metal man of your dreams.) The result of the four-year building project earned the Westbury Castle a Grade II designation (the \u201cbaronet\u201d of British architectural honors).\n\nBut it\u2019s not all 19th-century crown moldings and tiara-worthy chandeliers in this Welsh countryside. The beauty of living the aristocratic life without actually being a member of the nobility is that you can throw out the social rules (sorry, Lord Grantham) and just have some fun. Pour yourself a Pimm\u2019s Cup and start taking bets on the family billiard tournament or organize a game of cricket on the vast lawn. When it\u2019s time to dine and dance, invite your motley crew to repair to the grand dining room or the banquet hall, after you first issue them a stern warning to remember the wise words of the tart-tongued Dowager Countess of Grantham, \u201cPrinciples are like prayers; noble, of course, but awkward at a party.\u201d\n\nAs several guest reviews attest, this castle is swimming in that \u201cwow factor.\u201d The architectural design and distinguished interiors are swoon-worthy, but the property has an extra dose of that special sauce from on high thanks, no doubt, to one particular group of former residents. In 1920, the Mostyn family relinquished their keys and turned their estate over to the Benedictine nuns, who had the run of the palace for several decades.\n\nWith Westbury Castle back in private hands and open to the well-paying public, now is your time to finally take your rightful place in the English social hierarchy\u2026or at least live like you\u2019re a titled citizen. As the days of your vacation pass by and the memories of hourly wages, exasperating bosses, and weekday work schedules start to fade, you may just find yourself echoing everyone\u2019s favorite Dowager Countess and asking yourself, \u201cWhat is a weekend?\u201d\n\nBook Your Stay: Westbury Castle in North Wales: $1800/night via Vrbo", "description": "The Daily Beast presents a look at one of the most insane houses in the world.", "authors": ["Allison Mcnearney"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569106104/190917-mcnearney-omg-i-want-to-rent-this-house-welsh-castle-01_imgauz", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
