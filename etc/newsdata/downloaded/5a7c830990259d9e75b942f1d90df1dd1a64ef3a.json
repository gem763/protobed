His loyal following has included actress Rosamund Pike, Jerry Hall and the late Princess Diana, who became a friend. He lives in Kensington, West London, with his dogs Baz and Boo.\n\nEvery woman, no matter what her age or persuasion, wants to look and feel her best \u2014 that much I know after nearly half a century working as a couturier and fashion designer and completing thousands of fittings.\n\nI\u2019ve dressed women young and old, from Charlotte Rampling to the Princess of Wales, Faye Dunaway to Queen Rania of Jordan.\n\nMy clients trust my instinct and honesty. I\u2019m a sounding board \u2014 the good friend a woman can tell everything.\n\nDesigner Bruce Oldfield, 69, (pictured) says after nearly half a century of working as a courtier, he's learned that every woman wants to look and feel her best\n\nSo if their bum looks big in something, I tell them. If a bride and her mother want a short, sexy wedding dress with cleavage or one that follows an outr\u00e9, flash-in-the-pan fashion trend, I remind them the wedding photographs will be on mantelpieces in 20 years\u2019 time and they don\u2019t want to look like idiots. They always thank me in the end.\n\nWomen now no longer just want to look thin. Since Kim Kardashian \u2014 a Vogue cover girl, no less \u2014 the goalposts for what a woman wants her figure to be have changed. They want curves. In the old days, you\u2019d cover up a big bum. Now, young It girls and influencers display theirs with pride in figure-hugging clothes. It\u2019s great that we\u2019re moving away from one prescribed body shape; it\u2019s more democratic and realistic.\n\nI grew up in a poor household in County Durham in the 1950s, with a foster mother called Violet Masters and four foster siblings. Violet was a strong, independent woman and a dressmaker by necessity rather than choice. I\u2019d watch her cutting out patterns and making our rugs \u2014 hooky mats \u2014 by tearing up shreds of fabric and crocheting them onto big frames.\n\nI would make clothes for my sisters\u2019 Barbies. Violet instilled in me a love of technique and the knowledge that it\u2019s integral to design, not superfluous to it.\n\nMy birth mother was half-Irish and my father Jamaican, though I never met either. But I\u2019ve never thought of myself as black. I just don\u2019t consider it.\n\nDon\u2019t let life pigeonhole you. That was a life lesson taught to me by another strong woman: the Princess of Wales. We were friends. She had such grace and charm and also taught me another thing I\u2019ve come to live by: not to let the brutes get you down.\n\nThe most content, confident women know themselves better than anyone else. They know what suits them. They have a touch of Grace Kelly elegance and good taste, too. And, of course, a very organised wardrobe.\n\nbruceoldfield.com", "description": "Designer\u00a0Bruce Oldfield, 69, whose loyal following included late Princess Diana, says his years working as a couturier has taught him that all women want to look and feel their best.", "authors": ["India Sturgis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19810856-0-image-a-10_1571265147663.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
