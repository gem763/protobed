Others are attempting to carry out their carefully planned and coordinated scheme to hijack the NRA, the premier civil rights organization in America.\n\nSome attackers, including some of the NRA\u2019s own members, have created an outfit that calls itself \u201cSave the Second.\u201d\n\nThe organization is most definitely not about saving the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt is about destroying the National Rifle Association. Save the Second has never done anything to save the Second Amendment. It was created to oust NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and take control of NRA.\n\nSave the Second maliciously encourages the harassment of NRA board members who oppose attempts to oust NRA leadership.\n\nLet me be clear: I support Wayne, who is America\u2019s pre-eminent guns-rights leader, because I know he did nothing wrong. As an NRA board member and a former president of the association, I have fought alongside Wayne for more than a quarter century to keep the crazies and the charlatans from taking over, and to stave off the forces that want to deny law-abiding citizens the means to protect themselves.\n\nBehind the latest attack is a former NRA contractor who has made Wayne LaPierre the subject of a malicious, deceptive campaign.\n\nWhy? Because Wayne ordered the contractor to comply with a financial review.\n\nThe contractor refused.\n\nPeople questioning Wayne\u2019s leadership might want to take the time to read beyond the anti-NRA propaganda. They\u2019d learn that some of this contractor\u2019s other large clients are also reviewing their bills following NRA\u2019s lead.\n\nIn April of this year, this same contractor, in an effort to keep the NRA from pushing for the financial review of the contractor\u2019s billings to NRA, delivered to Wayne LaPierre an ultimatum in the form of this threat: Either resign immediately or the contractor would attack him publicly.\n\nThis information is all available in the public realm. People seeking the truth should read the court documents rather than listen to people who have an agenda to take down Wayne.\n\nAgain, let me be clear, neither Wayne nor any other officer is compromising away our gun rights. In my personal opinion, the only people who would compromise away our gun rights are no longer at NRA.\n\nI support Wayne LaPierre but not because of his monumental and significant accomplishments on behalf of the NRA and our cause in the past.\n\nI support him because of what I know he can do for our cause moving forward and because of what will happen to the NRA if he leaves \u2014 especially during this critical time.\n\nLeaving the NRA in the hands of a bunch of novices who haven\u2019t done 1 percent of what Wayne has helped the NRA accomplish is a pure recipe for disaster.\n\nYou may think they\u2019re well-meaning but they likely couldn\u2019t figure out how to run the NRA or a 50-state legislative operation, period.\n\nFrom all appearances, Save the Second is just an extension of the 22-year-old failed coup attempt against Wayne by led by the late NRA board member Neal Knox, whose son is gun-rights supporter Jeff Knox of the Firearms Coalition.\n\nIt\u2019s the NRA that has been fighting and winning against gun bans, ammo bans and gun registration schemes, and has helped pass numerous pro-self-defense and pro-gun laws.\n\nWhere would we gun-rights defenders be without the NRA and Wayne LaPierre? You really don\u2019t have to go that far back to find that there was a supposed pro-gun group \u2014 Alan Gottleib\u2019s Citizen\u2019s Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms \u2014 that agreed to Barack Obama and billionaire gun-confiscator Michael Bloomberg\u2019s terrible scheme for a universal background check after Sandy Hook.\n\nUniversal background checks prevent common, innocent acts like a grandfather giving a family firearm to his 12-year-old grandson without the absurdity of a background check.\n\nAnd, while that group put out sweeping press statements and declarations, the reality is that it can do so only because no one of consequence takes the group seriously.\n\nThe only pro-gun group that really has the wherewithal to protect our Second Amendment rights is the NRA. So, I would advise everyone to think long and hard before siding with anyone else.\n\nWe need the NRA. Our country needs the NRA. And Wayne LaPierre is the only person who can lead us through this hate-storm.\n\n\u2022 Marion Hammer served as the first female president of the National Rifle Association.
