He wanted to be baptized to signify the decision he already made. This is something he wanted. He became tearful as he talked about it. Time was of the essence. He was not expected to live through the day.\u201d\n\nHowever, the request was going to be a challenge because Roberts\u2019 doctor said he could only be off oxygen for a few moments.\n\n\u201cDr. Nichols made it clear he would only be able to be off oxygen for a few seconds, which meant we couldn\u2019t roll him down the ramp in the pool wheelchair, so we had to use the chairlift to place him in the pool,\u201d Agricola noted.\n\nReports said that after Romans 6:4-11 was read aloud, Roberts\u2019 oxygen tubes were removed and the chaplain held him his arms and proceeded to baptize him.\n\nUAB posted photos of the special moment to Twitter this week.\n\nWith only days left to live, a @UABSOM patient in the Palliative Care and Comfort Unit who was dying from lung cancer, was baptized in the pool at Spain Rehabilitation Center. @uabmedicine https://t.co/yzVH44OVfZ pic.twitter.com/oLvvSptJcG \u2014 UAB (@UABNews) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cI have served in the ministry over 20 years and seven of those at UAB. This is the greatest day of my career,\u201d Agricola said.\n\n\u201cThomas, you never thought you would preach a sermon in your life; but you preached today. You made an impact on people who you do not even know,\u201d the chaplain said during the ceremony.\n\nHis sister, Gina Gibson, told reporters that her brother\u2019s decision to be baptized gave their family much comfort and peace.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow there will be great joy just knowing where he is going. He is at peace. He was born again. You could see that on his face after the baptism. He was born again.\u201d", "description": "A wheel-chair bound man dying of lung cancer made one final request before his death on September 10th in Birmingham, Alabama.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-460936773-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
