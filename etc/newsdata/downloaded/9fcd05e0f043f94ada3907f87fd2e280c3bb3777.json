The explosion comes alongside reports that Turkish forces shelled their US counterparts in their anti-Kurdish offensive.\n\nNo US personnel were injured in Friday\u2019s blast and the cause of the explosion is unclear, Reuters stated, citing an unnamed US official. The information on the apparent explosion coincided with a Newsweek report that Turkish forces allegedly shelled American special ops in the same area. According to the report, the shelling was accidental, as Turkish artillery targeted Kurdish fighters positioned there.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish Defense Ministry said that \"all measures\" were taken not to hit the US base while its troops were responding to \"harassment fire\" originating from near the installation. A US official later told Reuters that reports its service members were attacked are \"not accurate.\"\n\n#BREAKING and an exclusive developing story \u2014 #Turkey bombs U.S. Special Forces in #Syria attack, apparently by mistake https://t.co/AyVPNxQM91 \u2014 James LaPorta (@JimLaPorta) October 11, 2019\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said that the Turkish military is \u201cfully aware down to explicit grid coordinate detail, of the locations of US forces.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Turkey launched a military offensive in Northern Syria against Kurdish forces it considers terrorists. Meanwhile, the Kurds are Washington\u2019s allies in the fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and US President Donald Trump has been criticized for \u201cabandoning\u201d them by withdrawing US troops.\n\nTrump has deflected the criticism threatening to \u201chit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions\u201d if Ankara refuses to show restraint. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that his campaign against the Kurds will continue \u201cno matter what anyone says.\u201d He stressed the mission is aimed only at \u201cterrorists\u201d and not at Kurds who are Turkey\u2019s \u201cbrothers.\u201d\n\nBoth General Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeated calls on Turkey to halt its offensive on Friday, yet Milley told reporters that based on his conversations with counterparts in the Turkish military, he has \u201cnot seen any indication or warnings\u201d that the offense will cease.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
