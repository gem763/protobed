If you want to make your dinner prep a little bit easier for the holidays, the Cuisinart Food Processor is the perfect cooking assistant, and for today only, you can get it for one of the lowest prices we've ever seen.\n\nWhile it normally retails around $150, Amazon is currently selling the Cuisinart 14-Cup Food Processor in brushed stainless steel for just $100, which is a cool $50 in savings. We've only seen its price dip this low once before, when it was a Lighting Deal during Prime Day earlier this year. And while the price may drop again on Black Friday, that won't be much help since Thanksgiving lands before that, and you'll want as much assistance as possible to chop, shred, and mix ingredients on Turkey Day.\n\nWhen we tested the best food processors, the Cuisinart unsurprisingly took the top spot and bested its competitors due to its ease of use, quiet operation, and impressive performance. No matter what task we threw at it\u2014from chopping onions to slicing tomatoes to kneading pizza dough\u2014the Cuisinart tackled each job like a champ. Plus, each of the parts is dishwasher-safe, which you'll be thankful for come clean-up time.\n\nIncluded with the processor are a stainless steel slicing disc, medium shredding disc, and stainless steel chopping/mixing blade. It also features seven food prep functions, such as emulsify, knead, and puree, so the sky's essentially the limit in terms of what you can use it for.\n\nIn fact, my coworker Courtney Campbell was particularly excited to see the Cuisinart on sale because she loves hers so much. She explained, \"While a food processor isn't essential, it speeds up your chopping and shredding time and allows you to create foods like cauliflower rice, hummus, and pesto in minutes. Once you figure out all the things you can do with it, it will be in your everyday cooking arsenal.\"\n\nWith over 2,000 reviews and a 4.2-star rating on Amazom, this machine is a beloved kitchen staple in so many households. If you want that extra help chopping carrots, mashing potatoes, or mixing cranberry sauce this Thanksgiving, act fast and snag the Cuisinart at this amazing price while you still can.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
