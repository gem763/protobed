Abortions in the U.S. have been declining for years, and researchers attribute the trend to fewer pregnancies and falling birth rates.\n\nThere were 13.5 abortions for every 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 in 2017, an 8% decline from 2014. In 1973, there were 16.3 abortions performed per 1,000 women within that same age range. The abortion rate in 2017 is also less than half of what it was in the early 1980s, according to the institute\u2019s research.\n\nThe number of abortions has dropped in recent years, too, falling beneath 1 million in 2013 for the first time since 1974 and remaining under that threshold in subsequent years. Clinics performed around 862,320 abortions in 2017\u2014the latest year for which data is available\u2014marking a 7% drop since 2014 and the lowest number since 1974.\n\nThe fewest abortions on record were performed in 1973, at about 744,600, before rising to roughly 898,600 the following year and 1.03 million in 1975, according to the organization\u2019s reports.\n\nAbortions undertaken with medication, rather than through an in-clinic procedure, are also growing more popular among those who have terminated pregnancies. These types of methods made up 39% of all abortions in 2017 and 29% in 2014.\n\nResearch from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also shows a decline in the rate and number of abortions over the years, but its reports exclude data from a few U.S. states.\n\nFewer pregnancies in the U.S. were the main reason for the decline in abortions, researchers from the Guttmacher Institute said. In 2018, the number of babies born in the U.S. and the overall fertility rate hit new lows.\n\nThe report found no clear link between the declining abortion rate and new restrictions on the procedure enacted in a number of states.\n\n\u201cIf abortion restrictions were the main driver across the board, we\u2019d expect the birth rate to increase,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nRelated Video With the recent appointments of two conservative justices to the Supreme Court, conservative state lawmakers are working to overturn Roe v.
