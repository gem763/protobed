(AP) - Kentucky is known for lots of cool stuff. Bourbon, Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, bluegrass, the Kentucky Derby, Muhammad Ali and zombies.\n\nThat\u2019s right, zombies.\n\nAnd not to incite an apocalypse, but even if you don\u2019t care a lick about comic books or the \u201cundead,\u201d we\u2019ll bet a dumpster full of rotting flesh that you\u2019ve heard of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nTold in comic books and on a long-running television series (Season 10 premiered on AMC earlier this month), \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d follows a cop named Rick who wakes up out of a coma in the middle of a zombie battleground. He goes on to lead an unlikely group of survivors as they search for a safe place to hold out until the apocalypse blows over.\n\nFans of this pop culture phenomenon range from geeky teenage boys to successful middle-aged women. And in case you\u2019ve been living under a tombstone, the co-creators of this post-apocalyptic tale are a couple of school friends from Cynthiana, Kentucky, about 90-miles outside of Louisville.\n\nOn Oct. 23, Kentucky native Tony Moore, the original illustrator of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d comics, will be the featured guest at the next Kentucky To The World event held at the Kentucky Center for Performing Arts, 501 W. Main St. The annual speaker series highlights the excellence of outstanding men and women with strong Kentucky ties.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like the spirit of support you get from Kentuckians, we love goin\u2019 out for Kentucky,\u201d Moore told The Courier Journal ahead of the October event. \u201cIt\u2019s a support that I haven\u2019t seen anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nWe assure you, this Kentucky success story has a lot more to it than just a world overrun by zombies, including how growing up on a dairy and tobacco farm in the Bluegrass State shaped his world view. He says the long stretches of solitude made the perfect environment for cultivating a creative young mind to explore the dark and disturbing depths of the gory and grim as well as superheroes and other warriors of the world.\n\nAfter graduating from Harrison County High School in 1997, Moore wasn\u2019t sure he could follow his artistic passion staying put in the Commonwealth.\n\n\u201cI thought I would have to move to New York City or Los Angeles until I realized that a guy named David Mack who was doing a book called \u2018Kabuki, Circle of Blood\u2019 lived in Florence, Kentucky,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I realized that he could do that from there, I knew I could do what I wanted to do from wherever.\u201d\n\nMoore went on to nearly complete his BFA in drawing from the University of Louisville\u2019s Hite Art Institute before abandoning his studies to pursue his career illustrating comics.\n\nWithout question, this comic book artist is best known for his work on \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d which he co-created with fellow Kentuckian Robert Kirkman. There\u2019s a holiday in Cynthiana, where they grew up, called \u201cThe Walking Dead Day\u201d and a large green sign on the side of the highway celebrating the comic book artist and writer.\n\nBut there is a lot more to Moore\u2019s career than the stumbling and lurching world of zombies.\n\nAlthough he ended his regular interior artist duties on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d with issue six, he continued to contribute to the title as the cover artist through issue 24 and also illustrated the covers for the first four collected volumes of the series.\n\nMoore was twice nominated for the comics industry\u2019s prestigious Eisner Award, and Steve Beshear made Moore a Kentucky Colonel, following in the footsteps of his grandfather.\n\n\u201cThe honor is important to me because I feel I have achieved something within my state\u2019s cultural identity,\u201d Moore said, \u201cI like being able to say that\u2019s who I am. It\u2019s where I am from.\u201d\n\nSince \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d Moore has moved on to his own co-created properties illustrating \u201cThe Exterminators\u201d and \u201cFear Agent.\u201d He\u2019s also lent his hand to bombastic runs on Marvel\u2019s \u201cGhost Rider,\u201d \u201dPunisher,\u201d \u201dVenom,\u201d and \u201cDeadpool,\u201d and has drawn covers for countless others.\n\nHis artistic success has made him a sought after celebrity in Kentucky, but the world wants Moore, too.\n\nAlong with his wife, Kara, and their 9-year-old daughter, it\u2019s not uncommon for the Kentucky artist to travel to 15 comic book conventions a year. Many are located in alluring locations like France, The Netherlands, Chile, Sweden and Australia.\n\n\u201cNot too bad for drawing guys who punch each other with their underwear on the outside of their pants,\u201d said the illustrious illustrator.\n\nHaving never left the country himself until he was in his 30s, Moore hopes the family\u2019s travels will allow his daughter, who the couple homeschools, to develop a sense of empathy for people and cultures different from her own.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect that she\u2019ll become an artist, but I want her to see that her dad was able to make a living drawing comic books and whatever her passion may be, I want her to know that she can chase her dreams too, wherever she happens to live.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Courier Journal, http://www.courier-journal.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kentucky is known for lots of cool stuff.
