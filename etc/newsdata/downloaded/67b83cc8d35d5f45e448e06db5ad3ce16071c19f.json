Mr Mahaffy added: \u2018SAM\u2019s data is extremely complex and takes time to interpret. But we\u2019re all eager to see what we can learn from this new location, Glen Etive.\u2019\n\nAbout 984 feet (300 meters) behind the rover is Vera Rubin Ridge, which Curiosity departed nearly a year ago.\n\nBeyond the ridge, you can see the floor of Gale Crater and the crater\u2019s northern rim. Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall mountain inside the crater.\n\nClay-based rocks are good at preserving chemical compounds, which break down over time when bombarded by radiation from space and the Sun.\n\nThe science team is intrigued to see if any organic compounds \u2013 the building blocks of life \u2013 have been preserved in the rocks at Glen Etive.\n\nUnderstanding how this area formed will give them a better idea of how the Martian climate was changing billions of years ago and hopefully provides clues about whether the Red Planet ever supported life.", "description": "Martian influencer is on a mission to find traces of alien life on the Red Planet.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92180281_1572014613.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
