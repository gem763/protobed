REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo/File Photo\n\nCuban officials have accused Twitter, a social media firm based in the United States, of mass censorship. Critics of the government say this is ironic, coming from a one-party state which itself practices censorship.\n\nTwitter has not explained specifically how it believes the accounts were breaking its rules. However, a Twitter spokesman said users may not artificially amplify or disrupt conversations by using multiple accounts.\n\n\u201cTwitter has finally given us back our accounts,\u201d Mariela Castro, Raul Castro\u2019s daughter and director of Cuba\u2019s National Center for Sex Education, tweeted on Friday.\n\n\u201cThanks to those who expressed their solidarity in the face of the media aggression against Cuba.\u201d\n\nOther accounts were not restored. State-run website Cubadebate said all its accounts in several languages, as well as those of its directors and journalists, remained blocked.\n\n\u201cIt is well known that on various occasions, Twitter has put itself in the service of intelligence and foreign policy operations of the U.S. government,\u201d it said. \u201cIt would not surprise us if this was the case on this occasion\u201d.\n\nSocial media companies globally are under pressure to stem illicit online political influence campaigns.\n\nThe Cuban state has a monopoly on public spaces and traditional media. While the top state-run media outlets have different profiles, they frequently publish similar if not identical articles.\n\nMany Cuban state media, journalists and officials limit themselves to retweeting official statements. Government critics complain of \u201ccybercatfishes\u201d - fake accounts pretending to support the government and attacking those who do not.\n\nCubans on Twitter noted that some of the \u201ccybercatfishes\u201d who had bothered them in the past were now blocked.\n\n\u201cWhen are we going to start the conversation about the use of bots farm in Cuba, initiated and financed by the government?\u201d wrote Elaine Diaz Rodriguez, founder of independent Cuban news outlet Periodismo de Barrio.\n\nOthers, like political scientist Harold Cardenas Lema, said Twitter should go after anti-Castro U.S. bots as well as Cuban government ones. Not doing so suggests it is politically biased, he tweeted.\n\nIndependent journalism in Cuba is tolerated but not legal, and the websites of several alternative outlets that are critical of the government are blocked on the island.\n\nCuba was featured on the list of 10 most censored countries worldwide released this week by the Committee to Protect Journalists, headquartered in New York.", "description": "Twitter Inc has restored some of the accounts of Cuban state-run media, journalists and government officials it had blocked on Wednesday, although others like that of Communist Party leader Raul Castro remain suspended.", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429519631&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1ZD-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
