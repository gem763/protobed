It\u2019s the latest sign that the dockless scooter industry is intent on shoring up its losses by introducing more rugged vehicles that are safer to ride and last long enough to recoup their cost.\n\nThe original scooters deployed by companies like Skip, Bird, and Lime \u2014 mostly sourced from Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot \u2014 weren\u2019t built for shared use, so they were prone to breakdowns, often within weeks of being rolled out. As they struggle to keep afloat, the startups have each rededicated themselves to building a better scooter. Bird and Lime each rolled out new vehicles they claim can last months in the field.\n\n\u201cthis is going to take that to another level.\u201d\n\nSkip is one of two companies authorized to operate in San Francisco as well as Washington, DC, San Diego, and Austin. In an interview, the company\u2019s CEO, Sanjay Dastoor, said that the new S3 scooter\u2019s modular design allows for easy repairs as well as reductions on wasted parts. \u201cWe end up throwing away less of the vehicle when something is damaged by wear and tear, or vandalized,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the vehicle can last much longer.\u201d\n\nDastoor couldn\u2019t predict the length of the new scooter\u2019s lifespan \u2014 a key metric in scooter unit economics \u2014 but he claimed that the S3 would prove its sturdiness in the field. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a huge improvement in sustainability over the industry standard with the current model we have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is going to take that to another level.\u201d\n\nThe S3\u2019s handlebars are much thicker than previous models, measuring about 24 inches and encased in a hard blue plastic. The deck is wider, and the 615Wh lithium-ion battery is swappable, meaning Skip\u2019s team of freelance chargers can just replace it with a fully charged battery rather than move the entire scooter every night. Dastoor said he envisions people using electric bikes to transverse the city, swapping scooter batteries, rather than vans or trucks \u2014 which would have the added benefit in reducing the carbon footprint of Skip\u2019s overall service.\n\nDastoor said the new scooter is more stable to ride than previous models, which should improve safety for riders. The scooter\u2019s internal sensors monitor the battery as well as the functionality of other components, and they can quickly identify problems when they arise and upload that information to Skip\u2019s servers.\n\nSkip plans to stay independent\n\nThe need to identify a malfunctioning battery arose for Skip earlier this year when one of its scooters in Washington, DC caught fire. The company grounded its fleet in both San Francisco and DC as it investigated the issue, and it only recently resumed operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the scooter industry is getting smaller. Scoot, the other company authorized to operate in San Francisco, was recently acquired by Bird. The city had previously declined to award Bird a permit to operate scooters, but the acquisition of Scoot allowed Bird to sidestep that obstacle.\n\nDastoor said Skip plans to stay independent, even as many experts predict that money woes will force smaller scooter companies out of business. \u201cIf the hardware and the operating system works, well, these vehicles can be quite profitable,\u201d he said.", "description": "Skip has unveiled a new scooter model that\u2019s \"purpose built\" for heavy fleet use.
