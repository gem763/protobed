For example, the president attended a United Nations luncheon with African leaders a couple of years ago, at which he praised the health care system in Nambia. There is no such country.\n\nA year later, the Republican told his foreign policy advisers that he knew Nepal and Bhutan were parts of India, despite the fact that neither is part of India. Trump has also reportedly struggled to understand different time zones.\n\nBut during remarks at a shale-energy conference in Pittsburgh yesterday, Trump\u2019s difficulties with geography came into sharper focus.\n\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, you can\u2019t get under. And we\u2019re building a wall in Texas. And we\u2019re not building a wall in Kansas, but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned.\u201d\n\nThere were a handful of problems with this, including the fact that Trump really isn\u2019t making much progress when it comes to new border-barrier construction. The idea that people \u201ccan\u2019t get over\u201d the fences may not be altogether true, either.\n\nBut the funny part, of course, was the president\u2019s assertion that he\u2019s \u201cbuilding a wall in Colorado,\u201d which is not a border state. (The fact that Trump\u2019s audience cheered this comment was probably my favorite part of the story.) Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) had a little fun at the Republican\u2019s expense, taking a Sharpie to a map of the United States to make Trump\u2019s falsehood true.\n\nThis likely would\u2019ve been a half-day story that generated a few laughs, but he couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. A little after midnight, Trump thought it\u2019d be a good idea to explain why he got this wrong.\n\nAccording to a presidential tweet, he made the comments \u201ckiddingly,\u201d and in this part of his speech, he \u201crefered [sic] to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!\u201d\n\nFirst, the video of Trump\u2019s comments is online, and he obviously wasn\u2019t kidding. Second, we\u2019re apparently supposed to believe there were a bunch of people from Colorado who traveled to western Pennsylvania for the president\u2019s remarks, and he wanted to let them know about the border barriers he\u2019s not building anywhere near their state.\n\nIn case this isn\u2019t obvious, Trump didn\u2019t need to say anything at all about his mistake. If pressed for an explanation, he or his team could\u2019ve simply said he misspoke, referencing Colorado when he meant to say Arizona.\n\nBut to take this sensible course would involve the president acknowledging a harmless and inconsequential error \u2013 which is something Trump simply isn\u2019t prepared to do.\n\nIf recent history is any guide, White House officials will quietly direct the Army Corps of Engineers to issue an unsigned statement today, explaining that Trump was right about wall construction in Colorado, reality be damned.", "description": "After falsely claiming he's building a border wall in Colorado, Trump couldn't let it go.
