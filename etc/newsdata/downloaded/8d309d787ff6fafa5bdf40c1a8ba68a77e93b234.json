For approximately two minutes, in a series of stumbles reminiscent of when he lied to the American people about the size of the crowd at Trump\u2019s inauguration, he danced an ostensible version of the salsa. To the tune of \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d by the Spice Girls, Spicer engaged in twists and turns as though, in the opinion of one judge, his hips were \u201cset in cement.\u201d He ended the routine smiling, on his knees, with confetti raining down upon him.\n\nThe judges were largely critical of the performance, but praised him for a \u201cstrangely entertaining\u201d showing, and for bringing \u201cfun\u201d to the ballroom. Final scores from the judges? 4, 4, and 4 \u2026 or second-to-last out of the 12 pairs. Sure, it could be worse, but next week Spicer\u2019s future on the show will hinge not just on judges, but on what the show\u2019s viewers think of him. The popular vote may be less forgiving.\n\nPress secretaries these days should have plenty of time to figure out their post\u2013White House careers\u2014even if it\u2019s not shimmying on national television. The daily news briefing, a key part of the job, isn\u2019t as essential as it once was. With the tweeter-in-chief in the Oval Office, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t held a briefing in more than six months.\n\n\u2014 Elaina Plott\n\n*\n\nSnapshot\n\nA group of protesters gathers around the climate activist Greta Thunberg in front of the U.S. Capitol after a news conference with members of Congress.

The Democratic primary battle really begins in Iowa, but democratic socialists there have turned their focus to grassroots projects and tenants\u2019-rights work rather than campaigning for one of the movement\u2019s most visible faces, Bernie Sanders, Elaine Godfrey reports.\n\nReminder: Latinos aren\u2019t a monolith. The crowd that assembled at Trump\u2019s rally in New Mexico last night was \u201csimilarly dissimilar,\u201d Richard Parker reports from Rio Rancho. Members were Libertarians, Democrats, and Republicans. They were evangelicals, suburbanites, and yes, Latinos. But the Trump campaign\u2019s bet that he might help flip the state will be a tough one to win.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s fans aren\u2019t naive. Russell Berman spoke with some of the thousands of Warren supporters gathered in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park last night. They told him they know \u201cit\u2019s a system and she\u2019s only a part of it.\u201d But they\u2019re still optimistic for the \u201cbig, structural change\u201d Warren is proposing.", "description": "Sean Spicer makes his debut on Dancing With the Stars.
