The Home Office says the decision does not.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nMr Hickman said the court also had to decide \u201cwhether the deprivation decision gave rise to a real risk of death or degrading and inhuman treatment\u201d.\n\nIn his written case, the Home Office\u2019s barrister, Jonathan Glasson QC,\n\nargued that Ms Begum \u201cwas a Bangladeshi citizen by descent, in accordance with Bangladeshi law, and so was not rendered stateless by the deprivation decision\u201d.\n\nMs Begum, was one of three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green Academy who left their homes and families to join IS.\n\nKadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, then 16 and 15 respectively, and Ms Begum boarded a flight from Gatwick Airport to Istanbul, Turkey, on February 17, 2015, before making their way to Raqqa in Syria.\n\nMrs Justice Elisabeth Laing is expected to reserve her judgment.", "description": "Ms Begum, now 20, is bringing proceedings against the Home Office at the High Court following the decision to strip her of British citizenship after she fled to Syria", "authors": ["Tom Pettifor", "Image", "Itv", "Pa", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700122.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sham7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
