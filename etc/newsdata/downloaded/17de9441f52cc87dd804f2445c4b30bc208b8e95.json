The Results Report 2019 shows great progress against some of the biggest challenges in the fight against the three diseases, while highlighting new threats.\n\nThe report includes key annual results achieved in countries where the Global Fund invests:\n\n18.9 million people received antiretroviral therapy for HIV;\n\n719,000 HIV-positive mothers received medicine to keep them alive and prevent transmitting HIV to their babies;\n\n5.3 million people tested and treated for TB;\n\n131 million mosquito nets distributed to protect families from malaria.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Results Report shows clearly why we must step up the fight against HIV, TB and malaria,\u201d said Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund. \u201cWe\u2019ve made extraordinary progress, but we still face very daunting challenges that we have to overcome to reach the SDG 3 target of ending the epidemics.\u201d\n\nThe Results Report 2019 demonstrates strong progress that was achieved on several fronts in 2018.\n\nTo provide more people with lifesaving access to antiretroviral therapy, the Global Fund\u2019s market shaping strategy has led to enormous savings in ARVs, including multi-year framework agreements with suppliers of HIV medication that will save US$324 million by the end of 2021 and secure the supply of lifesaving drugs for over 4 million people.\n\nTo fight the gender inequalities that have made adolescent girls and young women in Sub-Saharan Africa twice as likely to be HIV positive compared to their male peers, the Global Fund has increased its investments fivefold.\n\nTo address the challenge of \u201cmissing\u201d people with TB \u2013 people who go undetected, untreated and unreported and who can continue to transmit the disease \u2013 the Global Fund\u2019s catalytic initiative found an additional 920,000 TB patients compared to the 2015 baseline.\n\nTo fight growing insecticide resistance, the Global Fund piloted new mosquito nets. Responding to the threat of increasing drug resistance in the Greater Mekong region, the Global Fund launched Phase II of its largest regional grant, the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI), to accelerate malaria elimination in the region.\n\nTo make health programs sustainable and increase access to quality health care, the Global Fund\u2019s co-financing policy catalyzed an additional US$8.9 billion in domestic investments in health in the period 2017-2019, and the Global Fund invested US$1 billion to help build resilient and sustainable systems for health.\n\nWhile the Global Fund partnership continues to have huge impact, the report also shows that new threats, including drug and insecticide resistance, and stalled funding, have pushed the world off the trajectory needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target of ending the epidemics by 2030.\n\nThe Results Report 2019 is being released just three weeks before French President Emmanuel Macron hosts the Global Fund\u2019s Sixth Replenishment Conference in Lyon 9-10 October. The Global Fund is seeking to raise at least US$14 billion for the next three years to help save 16 million more lives, cut the mortality rate from HIV, TB and malaria in half, and build stronger health systems by 2023.\n\nThe achievements outlined in this year\u2019s report are the result of efforts by a wide array of actors comprising the Global Fund partnership, including implementer governments, multilateral agencies, bilateral partners, civil society groups, people affected by the diseases, and the private sector.\n\n\u201cDespite our great progress, the challenges ahead require us to collaborate and coordinate even more if we are to reach the SDG 3 target of ending the epidemics by 2030,\u201d said Sands. \u201cNone of this can achieved by the Global Fund alone, but by working together we can succeed.\u201d\n\nResults Report 2019 Our Results Report 2019 delivers a summary of the results achieved through the end of 2018 in countries where the Global Fund invests.
