REUTERS/Tasos Katopodis/File Photo\n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden in Washington said in a written order that under U.S. law, there was \u201conly a narrow set of cases that must skip to the front of the line,\u201d and that the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee had not shown its lawsuit was one of them.\n\nMcFadden said that while he was not prejudging the case, Trump\u2019s defenses \u201cseem unlikely to be so trivial as to justify a rush to the merits of the case.\u201d\n\nIn an Aug. 20 filing, the Democratic-led House Ways and Means panel said that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d in resolving the case it brought last month seeking to compel the Treasury Department to hand over years of the Republican president\u2019s individual and business federal tax returns.\n\nIn the filing, lawyers for the committee said the current Congress would end on Jan. 3, 2021, and that a prompt resolution of issues in the case was needed to give the committee enough time to investigate Trump\u2019s tax returns and pass any legislation in response.\n\nJustice Department attorneys, in coordination with Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, had proposed a staged approach to hearing arguments in the case that drew objections from the House panel\u2019s legal team.\n\nThe committee filed the lawsuit after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defied congressional subpoenas seeking the returns, despite a federal law that says the department \u201cshall furnish\u201d such records on request.\n\nThe lawsuit began what is widely expected to be a lengthy legal battle likely to end in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Justice Department said in an advisory legal opinion in June that the committee lacked a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d in seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns, and that Mnuchin therefore did not violate the law by refusing to provide them.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, Jay Sekulow, called the committee\u2019s efforts \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d last month.\n\nBefore Trump, modern U.S. presidential candidates customarily disclosed their tax returns during their campaigns.\n\nWays and Means is one of half a dozen House committees conducting investigations involving Trump and his administration.\n\nThe White House is refusing to cooperate with most of them, setting up several legal battles unfolding in the courts.", "description": "A U.S. judge refused on Thursday to fast-track a congressional lawsuit seeking to force disclosure of President Donald Trump's federal tax returns, saying it was a complicated and important matter that should not be rushed.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424239828&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7S2A2"}
