Here we go, back to square one all over again, writes HENRY DEEDES", "language": "en", "text": "On TV the other day there was a showing of Tom Cruise\u2019s Edge Of Tomorrow, a pacey sci-fi thriller in which our hero must save the world from aliens.\n\nHe is forced to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.\n\nEventually, on his umpteen-millionth attempt, Cruise emerges victorious. He and Emily Blunt have a passionate clinch. Job done. Fade out. The end. Roll credits.\n\nOver the past three months, a similar plotline has played out in the House of Commons on almost a weekly basis. Except, as yet, it\u2019s not job done. No fade out. No end. No roll credits.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May poses with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during a summit between Arab league and European Union member states (file photo)\n\nWhat we have seen is Theresa May returning endlessly with minute changes to her Brexit plan, looking for just a hint of approval from MPs. Then splat! Back to square one we go again.\n\nThe trouble is, however many times she tries, she seems to get no closer to reaching her goal.\n\nYesterday\u2019s announcement of a Commons vote, which could lead to Brexit being delayed until June, undoubtedly buys her time. But time\u2019s not what she needs. She needs a deal.\n\nWe could be in for another three months of this hoo-ha.\n\nSadly, the pattern of these PM statements is eerily predictable. She insists she remains committed to securing the best deal possible. She says she\u2019s making progress with her EU counterparts. Everyone is \u2018genuinely worried\u2019 that time is running out to get a Brexit deal approved etc etc.\n\nIn Tom Cruise\u2019s Edge Of Tomorrow Cruise emerges victorious. He and Emily Blunt have a passionate clinch. Job done. Fade out. The end. Roll credits. Over the past three months, a similar plotline has played out in the House of Commons on almost a weekly basis. Except, as yet, it\u2019s not job done. No fade out. No end. No roll credits.\n\nThe Tories\u2019 Peter Bone (Wellingborough) captured the mood perfectly when he sarcastically pointed out that the PM \u2018has said 108 times we will leave the EU on March 29\u2019.\n\nAnd there was a vaudevillian moment when Mrs May was mocked for uttering the \u2018Simples\u2019 meerkat catchphrase from the TV comparison site advert after she called on the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader to vote for her deal.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, fresh from thrashing out his own awkward deal with his party by opening the door for a second referendum, was a gale of overblown jibes. \u2018Incompetent\u2019, \u2018shambolic\u2019 and \u2018grotesquely reckless\u2019 were among those he lobbed in for good measure.\n\nThen he sat down and fiddled with his mobile phone for the rest of the session. At one point, his redoubtable education spokesman Angela Rayner (Ashton-under-Lyne) perched next to him, making an urgent lunge for a piece of Parliamentary writing paper from the table in front.\n\nDid she need to scribble a billet-doux to her Dear Leader? Alas, no. She was (ugh!) looking for somewhere to put her chewed bubblegum.\n\nElsewhere, all was tediously predictable. Jess Phillips (Lab, Birmingham Yardley) hissing and barracking the PM with shrieks of \u2018Spineless!\u2019 Hilary Benn (Lab, Leeds Central) twisting and contorting like a constipated dowager.\n\nOut front, 87-year-old Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover) dozing, a model of detachment and disinterest.\n\nThe only novelty was a surprisingly short new mop for Boris Johnson (Con, Uxbridge and South Ruislip). At the other end of the Tories\u2019 EU spectrum, Ken Clarke (Rushcliffe) made the reasonable point that by delaying matters for three months, Parliament would continue in the \u2018present pantomime\u2019.\n\nOh yes, and there was another group who will be desperate for a mention. The newbies from The Independent Group were out in force.\n\nSalty Anna Soubry (Ind, Broxtowe) enjoyed the new geography of the Commons seating plan and noted: \u2018Some of us who were sitting over there are now sitting over here.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you want her back?\u2019 roared a mischievous Labour heckler. Response: \u2018Noooo!\u2019\n\nLa Soubry\u2019s turncoat colleague Heidi Allen (Ind, South Cambridgeshire), an excitable tomcat last week, now sat glum and cross-armed throughout.
