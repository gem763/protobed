And ring the famous person nuptial bells! Jennifer Lawrence and New York City art gallerist boyfriend, Cooke Maroney, tied the knot over the weekend with a colossal celebration at a gilded mansion in Rhode Island on Saturday night.\n\nThe wedding was a spectacularly star-studded occasion, with Emma Stone, Kris Jenner, Sienna Miller and Cameron Diaz all making the journey to Newport's Belcourt Mansion to see the pair give it the old \"I do\".\n\nReportedly, J Law wore a Dior gown and partied with her new husband and guests until around 5am on Sunday morning (presumably she nursed her hangover with a day of Come Dine With Me and cups of strong Yorkshire Gold... or maybe not). The incredible Belcourt mansion was decorated with an autumnal theme including carved seasonal vegetables, which probably looked more glamorous than it sounds. But perhaps our favourite detail to emerge in the last 24 hours is that Jennifer and Cooke confiscated their guests phones.\n\nReportedly, the pair hired a company named Yondr, which specialises in creating \"phone-free spaces for artists, educators, organisations and individuals.\" As guests arrived, they were required to turn in their phones in order to prevent pictures of the event leaking to the public. The phones were stored in locked pouches, which could only be opened at specific Yondr unlocking bases.\n\nIn fact, the whole event involved a lot of security: as celebrities began arriving for the several-day-sesh on Thursday last week and gossip began circulating, lots of hotel staff in the area were asked to sign NDAs, according to The Daily Mail. Black curtains were attached to windows and fake hedges and privacy screens were put up to stop onlookers, while the venue was surrounded by burly security guards.\n\nSometimes the neighbours cat stares at me so, hey, I get it.\n\nLike this article?
