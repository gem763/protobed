(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit (all times local):\n\n3:50 p.m.\n\nBritain's House of Lords has approved a bill designed to prevent the country leaving the European Union next month without a divorce agreement.\n\nParliament's unelected upper chamber voted Friday for the bill, which has already been passed by the elected House of Commons.\n\nIt will become law within days once it gets the formality of royal assent.\n\nThe law, backed by opposition lawmakers and Conservative rebels, compels Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask the EU to postpone Brexit if no divorce agreement is in place by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson says the U.K. must leave the bloc on the currently scheduled date of Oct. 31, even if there is no deal.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nThe European Union says it is still waiting for proposals from the British government on how to end its political impasse on Brexit, while talks about their stalled withdrawal agreement continue in Brussels.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said that \"for progress to be made in the talks, it remains crucial that the EU does receive concrete proposals on all changes that the United Kingdom would like to see, of course in compatibility with the withdrawal agreement.\"\n\nU.K. negotiator David Frost on Friday held the second round of technical talks this week with EU officials at the European Commission's headquarters. The commission is supervising Brexit negotiations on behalf of Britain's 27 EU partners.\n\nTwo more sessions are set to be held next week.\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nBritain's opposition parties say they won't support Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for an election when it comes to a vote next week.\n\nThe parties have been mulling whether to agree to a mid-October poll, which can only be triggered if two-thirds of lawmakers agree.\n\nJohnson says an election is the only way to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nBut opponents don't want to agree unless they can ensure that Johnson can't take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a divorce agreement, as he has threatened to do.\n\nAfter discussions Friday, opposition lawmakers said they would not back an election until the government had asked the EU to delay Brexit.\n\nA bill compelling the government to do that is set to become law, but opposition lawmakers say Parliament needs to be sitting next month to make sure it happens.\n\n___\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nA senior British government minister has apologized for comparing a doctor who warned about the risks posed by Brexit to a discredited anti-vaccine campaigner.\n\nHouse of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said Dr. David Nicholl \u2014 who had suggested people might die because of medicine shortages if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal \u2014 was \"as irresponsible as Dr. Wakefield.\"\n\nAndrew Wakefield produced discredited research in 1998 linking the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine to autism. The study was later retracted.\n\nThe British Medical Association called the comparison \"disgraceful\" and Britain's chief medical officer said it was \"frankly unacceptable.\"\n\nRees-Mogg apologized late Thursday. He said \"I have the utmost respect for all of the country's hardworking medical professionals and the work they do in caring for the people of this country.\"\n\n___\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nSenior European Union officials say Britain's position on leaving the bloc is confusing and that it seems increasingly likely the country will depart without an agreement.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, said Friday that \"the situation in Britain is quite a mess now and we don't know what is happening there.\"\n\nHe says, \"it seems very obvious that we are not getting Brexit with an agreement.\"\n\nEuropean Parliament President David Sassoli says \"everything seems to be rather confused. It's very difficult to understand what the British government and parliament want to do right now.\"\n\nThey add that the EU is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands united in defending the divorce agreement.\n\nU.K. and British negotiators are holding a second round of technical talks in Brussels aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nBritain's High Court has rejected a claim that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is acting unlawfully by suspending Parliament for several weeks ahead of the country's scheduled departure from the European Union.", "description": "Britain's House of Lords has approved a bill designed to prevent the country leaving the European Union next month without a divorce agreement.
