The Tasmanian senator\u2019s comments come as Labor leader Anthony Albanese prepares to deliver a speech in Perth on Tuesday, where he will push the case for a 'clean energy revolution' that promotes job creation, without jeopardising traditional industries like coal. Despite Anthony Albanese\u2019s first vision statement as opposition leader, Mr McKim said \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot to see here\u201d from Labor. \u201cThe climate science is abundantly clear - we need to stop digging up coal and burning it to generate electricity,\u201d Mr McKim said. \u201cUntil Labor have a policy that actually reflects and responds to that climate science, they still cannot claim to be taking action on climate change.\u201d Image: Getty", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
