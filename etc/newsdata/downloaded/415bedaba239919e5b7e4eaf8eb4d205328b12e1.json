And the rear crane, the back portion came down right outside the building where we already had a partial collapse and stuff in the street.\u201d\n\nFollowing an initial assessment, the explosion shattered three windows at the city\u2019s historic Saenger Theatre and one of the falling cranes damaged a sewer line, which they had anticipated and was \u201cthe least of our worries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re going to be fine, and that\u2019s really, really good,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re going through with engineers and assessing the building.\u201d\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell said the city was in a better state now than eight days ago when the 18-story building that was under construction collapsed, killing three people and injuring 30 others. Over 100 workers were at the site when the incident occurred.\n\nAnd now that the site is more stable, the next task will be to remove two bodies still stuck within the building\u2019s rubble to bring closure to their families, she said.\n\n\u201cMy timeline is right now. It\u2019s today,\u201d she told reporters on when she hopes to retrieve their bodies. \u201cWe have our firm that is on the ground \u2026 with the mission being to remove the victims from the site.\u201d\n\nShe said the next step following the explosion of the cranes was to retrieve the bodies, which were protected during the implosion.\n\nAuthorities located the bodies and coordinated the explosion to prevent them from being moved in order to aid their recovery, McConnell said.\n\n\u201cWe do believe both victims are exactly where they were prior to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was our goal \u2014 to make sure we could get to them and not let it drop in that area\u2026 That was our goal and we succeeded at that.\u201d\n\nAfter the bodies are removed, the next step will be to demolish the rest of the building, and a timeline will be determined following a more thorough assessment of the area.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I don\u2019t want anything salvaged,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cWe want a complete demolition.\u201d\n\nThe area around the site was under an explosion order, which was lifted following the detonation while an evacuation order has been reduced, the city said on its website.\n\nThe evacuation zone has been reduced. If you are not in the red zone on the map, you are allowed to return. Individuals in the red zone must remain evacuated.
