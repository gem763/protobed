She is believed to have befriended the pair and may have had a role in their escape from the maximum security jail.\n\nPeter Shumlin, Governor of Vermont, warned people to stay aware.\n\n\u201cIf you see suspicious people, don\u2019t go near them. Call law enforcement. Lock your doors, make sure that you are being vigilant and let\u2019s work together to get these two dangerous men locked up once again,\u201d he advised.\n\nUPDATE: More identifying info on the two NY Escapees, David Sweat & Richard Matt. Again, if seen, Call 911 #Dangerouspic.twitter.com/bkFf1osr7p \u2014 Blue Alert (@BlueAlertUs) June 9, 2015\n\nMatt, 48, had been serving 25 years to life for beating a man to death in 1997, while 34-year-old Sweat had been given life without parole for murdering a county sheriff.\n\nWhile behind bars, they are believed to have discussed heading to Vermont. Police say the pair may consider this a \u201ccooler\u201d place, with fewer officers looking for them.\n\nVermont is known for having a number of second residences, or summer homes. In June, the season hasn\u2019t yet started, so many of the homes may be lying vacant, as local resident Kaydel Davis explained:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our summer people coming back. But there\u2019s still a lot (of houses) that aren\u2019t open, so who knows? They could be holed up in there.\u201d\n\nMatt and Sweat used power tools to break out of Clinton Correctional Facility. Reuters news agency reports their escape consisted of cutting through steel walls, squeezing through a steam pipe and surfacing out of a manhole.\n\nAuthorities say the pair have now set the record for the longest jailbreak in New York history. If they are caught, they face an additional seven-year sentence for escaping.", "description": "In the fifth day of a record-breaking manhunt for two convicted killers, US police extend the search eastwards into Vermont.", "authors": ["Sarah Taylor"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/307794/1000x563_307794.jpg", "published_at": "2015-06-11"}
