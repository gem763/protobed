The message, which can be seen below, shows the libertarian investor claiming that BTC\u2019s price chart \u201clooks horrible.\u201d\n\nSchiff, in fact, remarked that the \u201c(bear) flag that followed the recent breakdown projects a move to $6,000,\u201d which would imply a 25% drop from current levels if this move pans out. He even added that not only has Bitcoin fallen below a flag, \u201cbut we are [also] close to completing the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top \u2026 that projects a collapse below $2,000.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin chart looks horrible. Not only does the flag that followed the recent breakdown project a move to $6K, but we are close to completing the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top, with a $14K head, and neck line just below $8K, that projects a collapse to below $2K! \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 19, 2019\n\nAlthough Schiff\u2019s technical analysis might be right, many in the cryptocurrency community have been quick to rebut his sentiment that Bitcoin is inferior to gold.\n\nBitcoin Has (Dramatically) Outpaced Gold\n\nOver the past five-odd years, the chief executive of Schiff Gold, Peter Schiff, has been trashing Bitcoin. Over the years he has called it many things, but one of the bullion proponent\u2019s main theses is that BTC is an asset with no inherent value that will eventually trend to zilch.\n\nSo far, this hasn\u2019t been the case. In fact, analyst Rampage recently posted to Twitter that since one ounce of gold topped out at $1,800 seven years, Bitcoin has appreciated by 83,331%. In that same time frame, gold fell by 20%.\n\n$BTC v Gold Hey @PeterSchiff I just wanted to personally remind you that bitcoin is up 83,331.79% since gold topped out at $1800 seven years ago. What's it like hodling a -20% gold bag for seven years? pic.twitter.com/gmAgSwLpsl \u2014 Rampage (@Thrillmex) October 19, 2019\n\nRampage isn\u2019t the first to have drawn attention to what critics of Schiff see as flaws in the \u201cBitcoin is inferior to gold\u201d argument.\n\nAnthony Pompliano, a former Facebook team member that has since become a cryptocurrency investor, accentuated that Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the past decade, before adding that the asset\u2019s scarcity and relative lack of penetration is likely to allow it to grow rapidly in the years to come.\n\nOf course, there is no guarantee that the cryptocurrency market will continue to shoot higher in the years to come. Yet, critics have deemed Schiff\u2019s points moot due to his long history of hating BTC as it appreciated higher and higher.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "If you've been on Crypto Twitter over the past 24 hours, you have likely noticed one Bitcoin-bashing tweet from Peter Schiff.
