After Kershaw, used in relief, escaped a seventh-inning jam with a 3-1 Dodgers lead by fanning Adam Eaton, Roberts fell prey to the sentimentality card \u2014 sending Kershaw, the loser of Game 2, back to the mound in the eighth to face the heart of the Nats\u2019 order.\n\nThat lasted three pitches. Anthony Rendon blasted the second offering into the left field stands for a solo homer. Juan Soto disintegrated the next offering \u2014 also a fastball \u2014 more than halfway up the deep right-center field bleachers for a tying homer.\n\nJust as Soto had delivered the crucial hit in the Nats\u2019 wild-card win over Milwaukee just eight days ago, the 20-year-old instant legend had done it again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats\u2019 wave started building slowly. Perhaps tsunamis, far off shore, send warning tides far ahead of them, splashing then smashing against the shore. For the Nationals, in Game 5, the first sign of disaster for Los Angeles and joy for Washington came in the sixth inning, when Rendon doubled into the left field corner and Soto drove him home to cut the Dodgers\u2019 lead to 3-1. Then the rally fizzled.\n\nThis is Southern California, proud of being laid back and, except for those 31 years since the Dodgers\u2019 last World Series victory in 1988, generally hard to annoy. What was one run? After all, ace Walker Buehler had until that moment, held the Nats to a paltry three singles and no runs in 11 innings over two starts, including his Game 1 win.\n\nWhy worry? \u201cWhat could go wrong?\u201d say those who are naive to the menace lurking just below the surface of baseball.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA further diabolical sense of false security arrived in the seventh when Buehler finally exited after 117 pitches, by far the most of his career, leaving two Nats on base with two outs. Headed-for-Cooperstown Kershaw, a southpaw giant, arrived in relief and immediately fanned lefty Eaton on three pitches.\n\nThe Nats, toast, right? Just because the Nats had trailed the Milwaukee Brewers 3-1 in the eighth inning just eight days ago, and yet advanced, why give much weight to that.\n\nYou could see the wave coming, feel the sense of danger approaching for the Dodgers, as the eighth inning began with the best that the Nats had to offer \u2014 Rendon and Soto \u2014 due up against Kershaw, who as much as any legendary ballplayer of the past 50 years is the epitome of both his team\u2019s great regular seasons but just as much of their abysmally galling postseason flops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRendon and Soto didn\u2019t wait. Except in the sense that they waited for the first two fastballs they saw. Actually, they are not so fast anymore \u2014 akin to 89-mph cutters, not the old over-95-mph Kershaw smoke. Kershaw\u2019s status here is so quasi-mythological that the Dodgers dare not demote him in the scheme of things. Their fans won\u2019t stand for it. And, many here wonder, would Kershaw?\n\nRendon, a low-ball hitter, took a curveball low. Then he took a not-so-fastball \u2014 89 mph \u2014 into the left field stands for a gasp-evoking home run to cut the Dodgers\u2019 lead to 3-2. A silence \u2014 the \u201coh, no, this can\u2019t happen to noble Clayton again\u201d hush \u2014 fell over Dodger Stadium.\n\nSoto is a high fastball hitter. Kershaw threw him a first-pitch high fastball. Nice pitch selections. Who\u2019s calling\u2019 \u2019em, these back-to-back meatballs? Dave Martinez from the Nats\u2019 dugout? These were gifts \u2014 given to the greedy, grifted and desperate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe crowd\u2019s spooked silent \u2014 the Kershaw Curse Quiet \u2014 made it easier, so much easier to hear the crash, followed by a muted gasp, of Soto\u2019s titanic halfway-up-the-right-field-bleachers home run.\n\nThis was legendary stuff. Make that \u201cmore legendary stuff.\u201d Soto\u2019s two-run single in the eighth inning of the wild-card game turned into a three-run game-winning play for the Nats because of an outfield error. Soto\u2019s two-run homer also gave the Nats a brief lead in Game 3. Now, he had done it again.\n\nIn the annals of bad managing, Roberts will find a place for sticking with Kershaw after he had gotten out of the seventh intact. The Dodgers have a fine, deep bullpen. What\u2019s with the Kershaw Redemption Fixation?\n\nAD\n\nMake no mistake, the Dodgers deserved this victory, just as the Nats surely did, regardless of the heart-threatening manner \u2014 to their fans and themselves \u2014 by which they achieved it.\n\nAD\n\nSomewhere along the arc from a near-perfect Stephen Strasburg fastball that Max Muncy blasted into the right field bleachers for a two-run homer in the first inning to the catch-and-smash grab near the top of the center field wall by Cody Bellinger, the notion was born, then grew into adulthood, that the Dodgers \u2014 no matter the heroism of the Nats into extra innings \u2014 were a fitting team to advance to the NLCS. Perhaps a few inches \u2014 but not more \u2014 deserving than the Nats.\n\nThe sight of platoon infielder Kike Hern\u00e1ndez hitting a home run \u2014 his third in six career at-bats against Strasburg \u2014 added further to the Dodgers\u2019 argument.\n\nAD\n\nAs if more were needed, Buehler, just 22, only allowed one run in 6\u2153 innings \u2014 the only run he allowed in two starts.\n\nWhen the final grand slam OMG moment arrived, the Kendrick redemption instant, this stadium was limp with disbelief. Just as the Nats\u2019 dugout was aflame with joy. And, you are safe to assume, so was the entirety of Washington and considerable jubilant environs.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Veteran finds redemption after a rough playoff series, as his 10th-inning grand slam sets up a date with the Cardinals.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EvNrLza_hTunzeaCAzaf6h_hFJ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XRWRGDHLC4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
