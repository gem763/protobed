His funeral will take place on Monday and Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan will represent Morocco at the event.\n\nKing Mohammed VI has headed the Muslim world's longest-serving dynasty since 1999 when his father Hassan II died of a heart attack.\n\nAs head of state, Mohammed represents the supreme authority in Morocco. He devolved some powers to an elected government in reforms after the \"Arab Spring\" protests, but he is able to sack ministers and did so after protests in the Rif region.\n\nIn July he urged the government to carry out a reshuffle of cabinet posts and on September 21 he met Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani of the Islamist Justice and Development Party, part of the ruling coalition, to discuss it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ahmed Eljechtimi; Editing by Angus McDowall and Gareth Jones)", "description": "Doctors have advised Morocco's King Mohammed VI to rest for several days to recover from a viral lung infection that forced him to miss a remembrance ceremony in Paris for France's late president Jacques Chirac, the palace said on Sunday.
