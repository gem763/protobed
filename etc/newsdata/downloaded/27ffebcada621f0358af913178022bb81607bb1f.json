'He will know after one yellow card he has to be a little bit more careful for the second.\n\n'People say he has to play more minutes and I want to let him. But there are things he is still far away from compared to David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne.\n\n'He has to learn these situations, with a yellow card, be careful. The word 'experience' - it means that.\n\n'He is not going to get fined. I only fine players for stupid things, not for cards that are part of the game. Maybe I have to pay him for how well he played!'\n\nFoden was tenacious and impressed but soon found himself running close to a dismissal\n\nHe was unhappy at his cautions and protested to the referee at what he felt were small fouls\n\nOf his discussion with the fourth official, Guardiola added: 'He asked me not to say any more otherwise I would get a yellow card and they have the power!'\n\nIt was otherwise a good night for City with Raheem Sterling netting a hat-trick and Sergio Aguero adding two as City came from behind to keep their 100 per cent record in the Champions League. Sterling thought City had displayed the ruthlessness Guardiola had called for on the eve of the game.\n\n'I thought we were clinical today. It was a difficult game but we stayed patient, created chances and took them,' he said, later tweeting 'perfect night' about his first Champions League hat-trick.\n\nGuardiola added: 'Sterling is an incredible player for us. He is strong, fast. His physicality is incredible. The day after a game, he could play again.'\n\nThe City manager was unhappy that John Stones wasn't immediately ready to replace Rodri, who is a major doubt for Saturday's game against Aston Villa with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe England defender explained about the slight delay: 'I had them (shin pads) on, I just needed to fix them up properly. Time was of the essence and that is what the manager wanted.\n\nHis face was a source of frustration after the second booking saw him shown a first ever red", "description": "JOE BERNSTEIN AT THE ETIHAD STADIUM: Pep Guardiola insisted Phil Foden will learn from the first red card of his career after the England youngster soured his evening against Atalanta.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20059094-0-image-a-136_1571783533280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
