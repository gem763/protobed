Drivers have been having their say online this week: inevitably some might like a V8 rumble, but opinions ranged from Star Wars TIE Fighters to Rick Astley's 1980s hit, Never Gonna Give you Up.\n\nMaking plenty of sound: Transport bosses in the UK say electric car owners should be able to choose what fake noise their electric car makes. What would you select?\n\nAll brand new electric and hybrid models type approved from 1 July 2019 have been required to have one of the acoustic devices fitted under recent EU regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturers have until 2021 to make sure all brand new electric cars sold have the devices, not just new models coming to market.\n\nThese rules will be compulsory in the UK, no matter the outcome of Brexit, the Department of Transport has confirmed.\n\nIn the US, the rules are being applied a year earlier, meaning all electrified models will need to produce a noise at slow speeds from 2020.\n\nThe new laws make it compulsory for the devices to activate when vehicles are reversing or travelling at speeds up to 12.5mph.\n\nHowever, drivers will be able to switch the fake sound off if they deem it appropriate \u2013 for example in slow-moving traffic in a motorway jam.\n\nUntil now, it has been claimed that the noise devices make will mimic the sound of a conventional engine - though there hasn\u2019t been much evidence of this from different car makers.\n\nJaguar has already been working with Guide Dogs for the Blind to develop a tone for the I-Pace SUV that is easy for the trained K-9s to hear.\n\nMercedes-Benz - which had previously worked with rock band Linkin Park to produce bass-heavy sounds - has a totally different artificial humming noise that it will use across its EQC range and VW\u2019s recently-revealed ID.3 has just one fake tone that reportedly also has a different note.\n\nPorsche, somewhat cheekily, is offering a noise upgrade on its new \u00a3116,000 Taycan, with an \u2018Electric Sport Sound\u2019 part of the optional extras list at a staggering price of \u00a3354.\n\nJaguar has been working with Guide Dogs for the Blind to develop sounds that are easy for trained K-9s to hear\n\nThe noise is four years in the making and designed to be audible for pedestrians but not heard by those inside the vehicle, Jaguar says\n\nNow the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said that motorists should be able to choose the soundtrack their electric vehicle plays.\n\nIt is currently considering if manufacturers should be able to limit the number of fake sounds they can install as options in new models, and also if they need to prevent drivers from being able to upload their own tunes.\n\nAn NHTSA agency spokesperson told The Verge that it had \u2019requested public comment on amending the new Quiet Vehicle safety standard FMVSS No. 141, Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles\u2019 with the vision to \u2018allow multiple driver-selectable sounds so long as they meet the existing performance requirements\u2019.\n\nThey added: \u2018NHTSA is considering whether to allow hybrid and electric vehicles to be equipped with a suite of pedestrian alert sounds from which a driver may select a preference.\u2019\n\nOne popular electric-car sound was the high-pitched TIE Fighter from Star Wars films\n\nThe big question is, what fake noise would you want your electric car to produce? People have been sharing their favourites on social media.\n\nA couple of people tweeted they\u2019d want their vehicle's note to replicate the TIE Fighters from Star Wars, while another said they\u2019d choose the soundtrack of a stampede of bison.\n\nAnother opted for the Jetsons\u2019 spaceship while others chose screaming, blowing raspberries and even Fred Flintstone\u2019s Yabba DaddaDoo.\n\nThe most unusual choice, however, was someone wanting Rick Astley\u2019s 1987 number one hit, Never Gonna Give You Up, played on repeat each time they start the car up.\n\nElectric cars are a 'silent menace', say campaigners\n\nWhen discussing the introduction of Avas devices, Michael Ellis, the former roads minister, said back in July: 'The Government wants the benefits of green transport to be felt by everyone, and understands the concerns of the visually impaired about the possible hazards posed by quiet electric vehicles.'\n\nThe law was also welcomed by charities and campaigners including Guide Dogs for the Blind, which said electric cars are 40 per cent more likely to hit a pedestrian than a normal vehicle.\n\nSpokesman John Welsman said: 'There are two million children and adults living in the UK affected by sight loss and the rise in electric and hybrid vehicles pose a significant risk to them... We are delighted that from today it is now compulsory for new models to have an Avas built in.'\n\nHowever, Chris Hanson-Abbott, a vehicle safety campaigner and founder of Brigade Electronics said the government\u2019s recent 'Road Safety Statement for 2019 \u2013 A Lifetime for Road Safety' report failed to acknowledge the dangers electric cars loom until Avas devices are mandatory for all models in 2021.\n\nVehicle safety campaigners said the government should highlight the dangers of electric cars to pedestrians and those with visual impairments\n\nDescribing electric cars as a \u2018silent menace\u2019, Hanson-Abbott said: \u2018The fact there is no requirement to fit any system means there are hundreds and thousands of electric and quiet vehicles on Britain\u2019s roads which pose a danger to vulnerable road users.\n\n\u2018Owners of electric vehicles should think about fitting an AVAS themselves if they don\u2019t want to add to the toll of deaths and injuries on our roads.\u2019\n\nThere are currently around 227,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars on UK roads today, according to experts.\n\nAnd RoadPeace \u2013 the national charity for road crash victims in the UK - said the failure to mention the specific dangers of these near-silent vehicles was a \u2018very serious omission\u2019 in the government\u2019s statement on road safety.\n\nAcoustic vehicle alert systems will be compulsory for the electric cars in the UK from 2021 and will activate when they're reversing or travelling at speeds up to 12.5mph\n\nNick Simmons, chief executive of RoadPeace, said: \u2018We welcome the Government\u2019s commitment to reducing the numbers of people killed or injured on our roads and look forward to seeing some real action towards it being achieved.\n\n\u2018We hope it won\u2019t be empty words \u2013 but we are concerned that the statement didn\u2019t highlight the new dangers posed to pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users by quiet electric vehicles.\n\n'There are already around 200,000 vehicles on the roads that are not required by law to have any warning sounds.'\n\nTell us which fake sound you'd want you electric car to make in the comments section below.", "description": "In a move that could change the game for owners around the world, the NHTSA in the US says drivers should 'select the sound they prefer'.
