(Photo: Stephen Brashear, AP)\n\nBoeing, already having taken a $7 billion after-tax charge this year amid the ongoing fallout from two deadly 737 Max crashes, now has problems with a different line of planes.\n\nPer CNN, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is ordering inspections of 737 Next Generation models (737-600, 737-700, 737-800, and 737-900) after Boeing reported that it had discovered certain planes had developed severe \u201cstructural cracks.\u201d According to KOMO, the issue is specifically the pickle fork, a critical part that essentially keeps the wings attached to the plane and is designed to withstand the pressure of tens of thousands of takeoffs:\n\nA pickle fork is the part that helps attach a plane\u2019s fuselage to its wing structure. It helps manage the stress, torque and aerodynamic forces that bend the connection between the wings and the body of the jet. Engineers design pickle forks to last the lifetime of the plane, more than 90,000 landings and takeoffs, a term known as \u201cflight cycles\u201d in the aviation industry, without developing cracks. There could be dire results if the pickle fork system on the jet fails in flight.\n\nBREAKING: Cracks found in critical part (called a pickle fork) that keeps wing attached to 737-NG (not MAX) fuselage. One found earlier in month, now more on other planes. Found early in plane's lifespan. Boe & FAA scrambling to find extent of problem. @KOMONewsradio #KOMONews pic.twitter.com/iRT4luL5FW \u2014 Charlie Harger (@KOMOCharlie) September 27, 2019\n\nWorkers found a cracked pickle fork in one 737 NG plane \u2014 at a \u201crelatively young\u201d age of 35,000 flight cycles \u2014 and reported it to the FAA, after which inspections turned up similar damage in other 737 NG planes, KOMO reported. A retired engineer told the network, \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have a crack in the pickle fork. It\u2019s not designed to crack that way at all. Period.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how widespread the issue is, but so far inspectors have only found a \u201csmall\u201d number of cracked pickle forks in the 737 NG line, according to the FAA. According to KOMO, \u201clight cracking\u201d is sometimes found in pickle forks but it is considered \u201cvery unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cA crack like this is similar to when you see a crack in a coffee cup handle,\u201d the retired engineer told KOMO. \u201cYou can likely continue using the cup several more times, but there\u2019s always a risk that handle will break off and hot coffee will wind up in your lap.\u201d\n\nBoth the FAA and Boeing emphasised that the inspection process worked in this instance and repairs would be carried out where necessary.\n\n\u201cBoeing notified the agency of the matter after it discovered the cracks while conducting modifications on a heavily used aircraft,\u201d the FAA told CNN in a statement. \u201cSubsequent inspections uncovered similar cracks in a small number of additional planes. The FAA will instruct operators to conduct specific inspections, make any necessary repairs and to report their findings to the agency immediately.\u201d\n\nBoeing told CNN, \u201cNo in-service issues have been reported. Over the coming days, we will work closely with our customers to implement a recommended inspection plan for certain aeroplanes in the fleet. This issue does not affect any 737 MAX aeroplanes or the P-8 Poseidon.\u201d\n\nThe two Boeing 737 Max crashes \u2014 Lion Air Flight 610 in the Java Sea in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 near Addis Ababa in March 2019 \u2014 resulted in the deaths of 346 people. The entire 737 Max line was then grounded worldwide and will remain so until Boeing engineers carry out extensive modifications. Those include adjustments to its troubled Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software, updates to warn pilots of conflicting sensor information, fixes to processor failure that could cause horizontal stabiliser malfunctions, and improved emergency procedures.\n\nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board recently released a report that concluded the FAA did not properly evaluate MCAS and \u201cvariances in pilot behaviour are not being fully considered\u201d during the FAA\u2019s certification process, according to CNN. The NTSB also concluded that Boeing made erroneous assumptions about how pilots would react to flight problems arising from MCAS errors, as well as that test pilots never simulated a situation in which conflicting sensor data caused MCAS to trigger and push a 737 Max\u2019s nose down.\n\nThe key finding was that faulty sensor readings combined with erroneous MCAS activation \u201cproduced a cascading number of warnings that may have overwhelmed the pilots,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nBoeing had insisted that pilots were adequately trained to resolve those issues with standard emergency procedures. American Airlines pilot union spokesman Dennis Tajer disagreed, telling the Times, \u201cThey completely discounted the human factor component, the startle effect, the tsunami of alerts in a system that we had no knowledge of that was powerful, relentless and terrifying in the end.\u201d\n\nThe FAA has denied another finding by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel that its safety inspectors were underqualified and that it misled U.S. Congress about the issue, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe paper noted that there are multiple ongoing investigations into the crashes, including a U.S. Department of Justice criminal division inquiry, a congressional committee, and a U.S. Department of Transportation investigation.", "description": "Boeing, already having taken a $7 billion after-tax charge this year amid the ongoing fallout from two deadly 737 Max crashes, now has problems with a different line of planes....", "authors": ["Julie Muncy", "Andrew Couts"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ytyzgsxqdzuorzsq4aua.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
