In another she said: 'My belly is cramping, but I don't feel sick. It's weird - what is going on'.\n\nToday, a coroner investigating Ms Seymour's death returned an inconclusive open verdict after hearing she and her friend had brought an unknown over-the-counter medication\n\nThe traveller was concerned too about the colour of her vomit - yellow and dark green.\n\nThe inquest in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, heard how Ms Seymour, from Shefford, had flown out from Britain in November 2017 to Cambodia to meet up with Ms Amisola, who she had met a year earlier in Bali.\n\nMs Seymour had quit her job as an accounts manager and flew on a one-way ticket, hoping to fulfill her thirst for adventure. She provided daily updates to her family.\n\nAfter arriving in the south western city of Kampot, she and Ms Amisola booked into the Monkey Republic Guesthouse, but became ill soon after.\n\nOther backpackers brought them food and drink as their conditions deteriorated, but because of the hostel's remote location there was no hospital nearby.\n\nA local villager took the women in a car to a local doctor, but by the time they arrived they were unconscious and brought back to the hostel. They were found dead some hours after.\n\nMs Seymour's body was brought back to Britain and Hertfordshire Police opened an investigation into her death.\n\nPaul Myhill, a scene of crime officer with the force, said there was no evidence of ' foul play'.\n\nDr Rajiv Swamy, who carried out the post-mortem, told the latest inquest he had found evidence of damage to her liver caused by 'drug toxicity', and gave this as the cause of death. However, the coroner returned an open verdict. Pictured is Ms Seymour\n\nBlood samples taken by Cambodian officials from Ms Seymour's body could not be tested because there was no proper labelling on the vials, but a post-mortem was carried out at Lister Hospital in Stevenage.\n\nWhen the first inquest was opened into Ms Seymour's death in 2018, its cause could not be determined.\n\nDr Rajiv Swamy, who carried out the post-mortem, told the latest inquest he had found evidence of damage to her liver caused by 'drug toxicity', and gave this as the cause of death.\n\nHe said this was sometimes seen as a result of taking over-the-counter medication like paracetamol or anti convulsants used to treat seizures.\n\nBut Coroner Sullivan recorded an open verdict, meaning he could not be specific about what had caused her death.", "description": "Natalie Seymour, 22, had messaged her mother back in the UK to say she and her 27-year-old friend Abbey Gail Amisola had a severe stomach upset and were going out to get help.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/19/20341860-0-image-a-5_1572376650442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
