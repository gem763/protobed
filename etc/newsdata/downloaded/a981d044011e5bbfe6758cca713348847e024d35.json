Trump has repeatedly tried to turn the focus on Biden with vociferous attacks on his integrity.\n\nEvery Democratic candidate has voiced support for the impeachment inquiry. The debate will be Biden's first chance to fire back at Trump before a national audience.\n\nIt also will give Biden's rivals a chance to offer their support - or not. They will be closely watched to see how they talk about the issue and whether any of them use it as an opportunity to attack Biden.\n\n\n\n\n\nWARREN A TARGET?\n\nBiden has seen his once solid lead in opinion polls in the Democratic race diminished by Warren, a leader of the party's progressive movement, who has steadily risen over the past two months.\n\nThe two candidates have mostly refrained from directly attacking each other. But Warren's gains could make her more of a target this time, particularly for other contenders who are running out of time to make an impression.\n\n\"Warren tends to recede with so many people on the stage and that has been working for her,\" said Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus and debate expert at Northeastern University in Boston. \"But the other candidates will have an incentive to try to halt her rise this time.\"\n\nBiden recently took a swipe at Warren's extensive \"I have a plan for that\" campaign promises, telling a New Hampshire crowd last week: \"That's not enough. It takes proven ability to get things done. We're not electing a planner.\"\n\nEven Sanders, Warren's friend and progressive ally who has dropped into third place in the polls, signaled he was willing to draw at least some policy distinctions with her.\n\n\"Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not,\" Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, said on ABC's \"This Week\" program on Sunday.\n\nSanders will be watched closely in the debate for signs of fatigue or weakness after his heart attack, which highlighted his age and that of the other top White House contenders - Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73 - in a race featuring a debate about a generational change in leadership.\n\nYounger Democratic candidates, including Pete Buttigieg, 37, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, 44, have argued it is time for new leadership in a Democratic Party driven by the diverse, grassroots energy of younger activists.\n\nButtigieg, who has struggled to break into the top tier of Democratic candidates nationally, began running a new digital ad on Tuesday in Iowa contrasting his health care plan with that of more progressive rivals.\n\nWarren and Sanders are pushing \"Medicare for All\" proposals, which critics say will all but eliminate private insurance in favor of federal health insurance coverage for all Americans based on the existing government-run Medicare program for people aged 65 and older. Buttigieg proposes offering instead a low-cost public insurance option, which he calls \"Medicare for All who want it.\"", "description": "Twelve top White House contenders will take part on Tuesday in the first Democratic debate since the launch of an impeachment inquiry into Republican President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate leading rival Joe Biden.
