Representatives, also found 54 per cent of likely voters support an inquiry into Mr Trump, according to Politico.\n\nOn Sunday, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House, claimed that \u201cthe tide has completely changed\u201d on public support for impeachment.\n\nMs Pelosi also insisted that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d how the inquiry affects the Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the 2020 election, adding: \u201cOur first responsibility is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe research follows a number of polls showing a shift in support towards impeaching Mr Trump.\n\nA NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released last week found 49 per cent approved of impeachment compared to 46 per cent who disapproved, showing a 10-point surge in favour of impeachment since the same survey in April.\n\nA recent Morning Consult/Politico poll showed a lower number (43 per cent) in favour of impeachment.\n\nHowever, this result was also a 10-point increase from the same survey in April after the release of the Mueller report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn recent days, Mr Trump has raged against the prospect of impeachment and tweeted a quote on Sunday which threatened a \u201ccivil war-like fracture\u201d in the US if he is removed from office.", "description": "Most Americans now support an impeachment
