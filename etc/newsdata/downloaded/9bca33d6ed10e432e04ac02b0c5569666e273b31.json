No basic rights: \u25aa\ufe0fTo see & present evidence\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fTo call witnesses\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fTo have counsel present\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fTo cross-examine all witnesses\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fTo make objections\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fTo respond to evidence & testimony Obviously an illegitimate process. \u2014 Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 9, 2019\n\nBrit Hume says he doubts the White House\u2019s argument would hold up in court, but tying things up in court could also stall the impeachment fever that has overtaken the country:\n\nI doubt WH arguments for refusal to cooperate with House impeachment inquiry will win in a court of law. But court of public opinion may be different. If House Dems appear to be ignoring previous norms and procedures, it will make them appear more partisan than they already do. \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) October 9, 2019\n\nEven with elections coming up for many of them, we can\u2019t imagine House Democrats worrying about appearing more partisan than they already do.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, court arguments could hold up proceedings indefinitely, thus thwarting the blitzkrieg impeachment House Dems appear to be pursuing. The longer this drags on, the closer the election and more compelling the question: why not let the voters decide? \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) October 9, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad point. Do Democratic candidates actually want their cable news time taken over with televised impeachment hearings? Or would they prefer, as Pelosi seemed to favor, that her caucus just cool it with the impeachment talk?\n\nI suppose House Dems could simply add non-cooperation to their case and impeach on the basis of obstruction of their inquiries. But that would leave the quid pro quo Ukraine investigation unfinished and add to the appearance of a party willing to impeach for any available reason. \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) October 9, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the video supercut of Democrats talking impeachment since before the inauguration, so that isn\u2019t an appearance they can realistically avoid.\n\nIt will hold up in court, there is case law to support their refusal. Until the full house votes for the \"inquiry\" the democrats have no subpoena power in regards to an impeachment investigation. Re: Wilkinson vs United States \u2014 Gary Rowlls (@growlls1) October 9, 2019\n\n1) As announced in Wilkinson v. United States,[7] a Congressional committee must meet three requirements for its subpoenas to be \"legally sufficient.\" First, the committee's investigation of the broad subject area must be authorized by its chamber; \u2014 Gary Rowlls (@growlls1) October 9, 2019\n\n2) second, the investigation must pursue \"a valid legislative purpose\" but does not need to involve legislation and does not need to specify the ultimate intent of Congress; \u2014 Gary Rowlls (@growlls1) October 9, 2019\n\n3) third, the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the subject matter area that has been authorized for investigation. \u2014 Gary Rowlls (@growlls1) October 9, 2019\n\nYou really think a court is going to ignore the due process and Article 2 ramifications of a partisan impeachment where no questions are allowed from Republicans and witness testimony to be held in secret? Do Articles of Impeachment override other tenets of the Constitution? \u2014 Philip Morrill (@PHMorrill) October 9, 2019\n\nI disagree with your assertion that the WH would lose in the SCt. There are significant and righteous due process, right to the identification and confrontation of witnesses and kangaroo court arguments to be made here which are at the very foundation of our Constitution. \u2014 Sherry Kerdman (@sherry_kerdman) October 9, 2019\n\nI think one legal point that the President will argue is that the Constitution states that the House of Representatives has the sole discretion to open an impeachment. It does not say the speaker, or a committee. It says the House of Representatives. As in, the entire body. \u2014 Lucy Wigglebottom III (@wwmullin) October 9, 2019\n\nI think the end game here is for the Executive Branch to slow walk this to SCOTUS, where they will set down rules for impeachment so that future presidents are not dogged by this from day 1. \u2014 Lucy Wigglebottom III (@wwmullin) October 9, 2019\n\nThe power to declare an impeachment inquiry doesn't reside in the office of the Speaker. If it did, it would destroy the principle of executive privilege. The Speaker would declare an impeachment inquiry anytime she wanted to override executive privilege, which is the case here. \u2014 Deplorable ExWalmart Shopper with a Physics Degree (@Hierarchangel) October 9, 2019\n\nConstitutionally the \u201chouse of representatives\u201d has the power of impeachment, not Pelosi. I do not believe that Pelosi and Schiff can unilaterally start an impeachment inquiry without a house vote as they do not represent the entire house of representatives. \u2014 Divine Health (@DivineHealth6) October 9, 2019\n\nEven though the constitution doesn\u2019t specifically require a vote for impeachment inquiry, there is precident, due process and the spirit of the Constitution that should prevent one party from wielding unbalanced power over the other, especially when it comes to the presidency. \u2014 Divine Health (@DivineHealth6) October 9, 2019\n\nThere's no impeachment inquiry. The House needs to vote on it. \u2014 Guerrilla Magoo \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Guerrilla_Magoo) October 9, 2019\n\nI disagree, Brit, because there's a due process argument AND a separation of powers argument. I think those things are game-changers. \u2014 Gary Gross (@LFRGary) October 9, 2019\n\nRespectfully disagree. If a court of law asks what \u201ccrime\u201d is being investigated and the Dems, like now, have no plausible answer the courts may look askance at the Lefts requests. \u2014 Charles Browning (@ChasBrowning) October 9, 2019\n\nCourts rely heavily on precedent, and precedent says there should be a vote. That aside, my understanding under the current situation is that R\u2019s don\u2019t have same rights to call witnesses , etc as Dems and that will also play poorly in a court. However, maybe I\u2019ve been misled? \u2014 Joseph DeSouza (@Joe_DeSouza) October 9, 2019\n\nThat is completely my understanding as well. \ud83d\udc4d \u2014 Angie Tatum (@angeleenie070) October 9, 2019\n\nWhy would the courts enforce a kangaroo court proceeding? Doubt it. \u2014 Lars (@LarsUllern86) October 9, 2019\n\nAs has been argued by others, the Constitution leaves a lot open to interpretation on separation of powers, so precedent has a lot more legal weight than it might otherwise have. Precedent is 100% on the White House's side. \u2014 my pronouns: Her Highness & Your Majesty \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc78\ud83e\udd34 (@emilykholcomb) October 9, 2019\n\nGosh maybe a little accurate reporting from, I don't know, maybe Brit Hume, could show how the Democrats are following the previous \"norms.\" \u2014 Steve Michel (@pstevemichel) October 9, 2019\n\nThey are explained here by the son of the man who was counsel for the Nixon impeachment inquiry. https://t.co/98nVR1wHin \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) October 9, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re not going to court. \u2014 Proud Deplorable (@HKirsh1) October 9, 2019\n\nBrit, there isn\u2019t an official impeachment process until the House votes to move in to impeachment, right? If they vote to move forward then the Trump administration will be able to call witnesses and cross examine their witnesses. They will never vote. It\u2019s all one sided now. \u2014 davidalbrecht (@spursrock50) October 9, 2019\n\nIt is nowhere written in the Constitution that there must be a vote for the impeachment inquiry to be \u201cofficial.\u201d It is ultimately a political matter and that\u2019s why Dems must be careful not to appear utterly one-sided in pursuing this. \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) October 9, 2019\n\nHow on earth could they be more partisan? Those of us who strive to manage our lives from one 24-hr period to the next ignore them because they are just stupid. Stupid. Impeaching a president because your candidate lost is simply inane, insufferable, and insulting\u2026 \u2014 Tam (@cherokee1020) October 9, 2019\n\nThey\u2019ve moved from partisan to mean spirited. \u2014 Colorado (@Colorado_Right) October 9, 2019\n\nLongterm they'll lose both fights. \u2014 Pradheep J.
