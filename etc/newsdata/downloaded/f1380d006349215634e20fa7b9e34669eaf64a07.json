Among them is Jose Mourinho.\n\nIt was March 2015 and, after a first half of the season when Chelsea had been surging, they were very suddenly stumbling. Mourinho\u2019s side had just been knocked out of the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain to go with two poor home 1-1 draws against Burnley and Southampton, and had now squandered a 2-0 lead away to Hull City. To make things worse, Thibaut Courtois had gifted Abel Hernandez an equaliser after miscontrolling a backpass.\n\nIt was all going wrong. Mourinho had to offer something different. With 15 minutes left, the previously free-scoring Diego Costa was hauled off, and Remy was introduced. Within two minutes, and one touch, the French international had scored.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The pass came from Willian on the left, and\u2026 yeah.\u201d\n\nYeah, a classic piece of crucially instinctive goalscoring, and precisely what Remy was signed for. He immediately tuned into the rhythm of the match, and his own game, to score with his first touch.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cA super-sub,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWhen you give me my chance, I will take it.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t a stretch to say it was Chelsea\u2019s version of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, or Christopher Wreh. It was a juncture moment in that run-in, as they won five of the next six to win the title. Remy had fixed their form.\n\nThe 32-year-old comes up against his old team in the Champions League at Staude Pierre-Mauroy, occupying a relatively similar role in the upwardly mobile Lille team. Except he is now one of the senior players, offering some necessary balance as regards experience, at a club prioritising youth.\n\n\u201cYeah, very young. Most of them are between 18 and 23. I try to be one of the leaders now, to share our experience, try to help them in a good way and give them good advice.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to draw on in what was a well-travelled career involving two league titles, but Chelsea remains the highlight.\n\nRemy arrived at the end of the summer of 2014, one of those classic Mourinho windows - and possibly his last - where he forensically closed out a squad to be exactly what he wanted. And, having grown frustrated with his striking options in his first season back in 2013-14, the Portuguese wanted Remy as the reliable back-up to newly-signed Costa.\n\n\u201cHe trusted me,\u201d the striker says. \u201cI remember one time before a big match, it was Manchester City at home, and Diego Costa was injured and he grabbed me and said \u2018I know your quality. I know you can play these type of games, so just go and don\u2019t think too much.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened. I scored in this game as well. He trusted me, and even I think the market was open and some clubs wanted to buy me, but the manager said \u2018no, I want to keep this player, he\u2019s very useful for the squad\u2019. He knew Costa was the first choice, but that he could count on me as well.\n\n\u201cWhen the manager needed me, I was there to respond.\n\n\u201cOn the human side, he was very good with me. I have very good memories of this time. It\u2019s part of the story of the club, and for me as a player it\u2019s a big achievement as well. I really enjoyed my time there.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to sign for Liverpool. I went for the medical in Boston, then apparently I failed the medical. For me, everything happens for a reason, which means at the end of the day, Chelsea. We had a fantastic season. This year Liverpool had been in trouble, it was not the Liverpool of the previous season.\u201d\n\nRemy\u2019s personality was as suited to his rule as his particular skills.\n\n\u201cI want to play more but I\u2019m not this kind of guy who will try to disturb, or try to make the defender crazy. I\u2019m staying calm in every situation, trying to score goals because that\u2019s my job as well. I think that\u2019s part of me, and part of my nature. I don\u2019t stress for anything. Sometimes my teammates were laughing at me, saying I put reggae music because I was too calm\u2026 but that\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\nAlmost fittingly, Remy actually scored the last goal of Mourinho\u2019s time at Chelsea, the solitary strike in that fateful 2-1 defeat to Leicester City. He is reluctant to discuss what went wrong that season, as there remains an evident loyalty to \u201cone of the best managers in the game\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult time, many things can happen. The communication was not good. I was there to do my job. With every single club I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve never been part of the politics. So maybe I\u2019m not the right guy to ask the question. I didn\u2019t have this influence in the dressing room.\n\n\u201cFor me, honestly, I always remember when I was there, tactically he was very good. He knows football.\n\n\u201cPeople know Mourinho is a good manager, even if he had trouble in some clubs.\u201d\n\nThe protracted fall-out from all that means it is a very different squad from that which Remy played, although there are still Chelsea players he is close to.\n\n\u201cKurt Zouma, we talk over the phone sometimes. But, yeah, the team is quite different from the time I was there. Many players left the year after, but I am still in contact with Zouma. He\u2019s a good friend, we\u2019re from the same city, but on the pitch we fight for the win.\u201d\n\nZouma will know as well as anyone the qualities that Remy can offer, but particularly a sudden penchant for the spectacular.\n\nHe won the goal of the season in France last season for a brilliant volley on the turn against Bordeaux, to go with that stunning strike for QPR against Wigan Athletic in 2012-13. You can sense the joy as he discusses it.\n\n\u201cYeah, what a goal. What a goal. I remember this goal because I didn\u2019t score many goals like this, so yeah, it was a fantastic goal. I came from our box, that run, and shot. I was thinking \u2018OK, try this\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an insight into the instinct of such a striker, and one that led to one of Chelsea\u2019s most special memories.", "description": "Loic Remy may not be one of the players that immediately comes to mind when recalling Chelsea's list of champions, but there are many of them who would still express extreme gratitude to him for one of their medals.
