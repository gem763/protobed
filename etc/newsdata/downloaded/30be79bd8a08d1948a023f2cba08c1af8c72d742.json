(AP) \u2014 Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who set off a political firestorm by disputing U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion, died Friday, according to his ex-wife. He was 69.\n\nWilson died of organ failure in Santa Fe, according to former wife Valerie Plame, whose identity as a CIA operative was exposed days after Wilson\u2019s criticism of U.S. intelligence that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase uranium.\n\nThe leak of Plame\u2019s covert identity was a scandal for the administration of President George W. Bush that led to the conviction of vice presidential aide I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d B. Libby for lying to investigators and obstruction of justice.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned Libby in 2018.\n\nPlame, who is running as a Democrat for Congress \u2014 in part as a Trump adversary \u2014 called Wilson \u201ca true American hero, a patriot, and had the heart of a lion.\u201d Plame and Wilson moved to Santa Fe in 2007 to raise twin children and divorced in 2017.\n\nIn 2002, Wilson traveled to the African country of Niger to investigate allegations that Hussein was attempting to purchase uranium, which could have been used to make nuclear weapons.\n\nPlame\u2019s identity with the CIA was revealed in a newspaper column days after Wilson said in an opinion piece in the New York Times that the Bush administration twisted prewar intelligence on Iraq to justify going to war. Wilson later accused administration officials and political operatives of putting his family at risk.\n\nA Connecticut native and graduate of the University of California at Santa Barbara, Wilson\u2019s career with the Foreign Service included posts in a handful of African nations.\n\nHe was the senior U.S. diplomat in Baghdad during the first Gulf War, which lasted from 1990 to 1991, and was the last American official to meet with Saddam before the Desert Storm offensive.\n\nWilson drew intense criticism from Republican lawmakers over his statements regarding Iraq and weapons of mass destruction in the lead-up to the U.S. invasion. A report by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2004 pointed to inconsistences.\n\nWilson dismissed those claims, later authoring the book \u201cThe Politics of Truth.\u201d\n\nIn a 2003 interview with PBS, he said that the post 9/11 security mission went astray with the full invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe national security objective for the United States was clear; it was disarmament of Saddam Hussein,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have pursued that objective. We did not need to engage in an invasion, conquest and occupation of Iraq in order to achieve that objective.\u201d\n\nThe dispute vaulted Wilson and Plame into the glare of international celebrity, with Plame emerging as a professional public speaker and book author.\n\nPlame\u2019s book \u201cFair Game\u201d about her exposure as a CIA operative was made into a 2010 feature film starring actors Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.\n\nPlame is running in a crowded field for the Democratic nomination in an open race to succeed U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, as the No. 4-ranked House Democrat campaigns for an open Senate seat in 2020.\n\nIn an introductory campaign ad for Plame, her aborted CIA career and Trump\u2019s decision to pardon Libby figure prominently.\n\n\u201cMy service was cut short when my own government betrayed me. ... And Mr. President, I\u2019ve got a few scores to settle,\u201d she says.", "description": "Wilson set off a firestorm by disputing U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion, leading to the unmasking of his then-wife, Valerie Plame,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS258_wilson_ZG_20190927184047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
