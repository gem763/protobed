The strongest gain in sales was among homes priced between $1 million and $2 million.\n\nThe pace of sales continued to improve, with homes generally selling in 30 days, which is only five days slower than last year\u2019s 25-day median, according to the Compass report.\n\nAs far as price points that are doing well within the luxury market, the \u201c$2 million to $5 million range is doing pretty well, with $5 million to $10 million not doing as well,\u201d said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate professor and developer Paul Habibi.\n\n\u201cNorth of $10 million is still doing fairly well because there is a limited number of homes and a limited number of buyers,\u201d he said.\n\nInternational buyers have had a strong presence in the luxury market of late, Mr. Habibi said. \u201cThere has been a little bit of dearth of Chinese investment in L.A., but it hasn\u2019t really made a dent in pricing yet.\u201d\n\nAs far as looking at how the market will perform going forward, pending sales (homes currently in contract) are often a good indicator, Ms. Hepp said, noting that such sales in Los Angeles in July were up 11% compared to last year.\n\nThe luxury market \u201cwill likely continue to bounce around current levels,\u201d she said, \u201cas buyers have grown accustomed to financial market volatility and global and trade concerns.\u201d\n\nAbsent some unforeseen global event, \u201cdemand from luxury buyers should remain solid going forward,\u201d Ms. Hepp said.\n\nThe range of amenities being offered by developers keeps getting amped up, ranging from private elevators and urban parks with doggie water stations to Tesla-ready garages and wraparound rooftop terraces with views of the Hollywood Hills.\n\nBelow are a few luxury developments in Los Angeles that are launching sales this fall.", "description": "Highlights include the final phase of the Playa Vista urban community, and a group of townhomes in Santa Monica", "authors": ["Bill Cary"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110908?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
