And Javadekar himself agrees that they do need to be regulated.\n\n\"I have sought suggestions on how to deal with this because there are regular feature films coming on OTT -- good, bad and ugly,\" he said. \"So how to deal with this, who should monitor, who should regulate. There is no certification body for OTT platforms and likewise news portals also.\"\n\n\"While Press Council of India takes care of print media, the NBA monitors news channels, the Advertising Standards Council of India is for advertising and the CBFC takes care of films. However, there is nothing for the OTT platforms,\" he added.\n\nDon't Miss 684 SHARES 108 SHARES 635 SHARES\n\nIt's a fair point. Indeed, a bit of oversight is good in pretty much every case you can think of. The problem is when that oversight becomes too constricting, or ridiculously archaic.\n\nFor instance, when you go to the theater to catch a movie, it doesn't matter if its an A-rated movie or not. Either way, things like cuss words, and scenes even remotely alluding to sexual relations are just cut out. That's what happened with 'Deadpool', and there's so much of this in that flick it's a wonder moviegoers even caught up from scene to scene. On the other hand, it seems like Bollywood movies are often immune to this kind of scrutiny, as evidenced by the plethora of item numbers with leading ladies gyrating on male co-stars twice their age.\n\nThe point I'm making here is, it's important who is overseeing content on OTT platforms. If it's anything like the CBFC, there might be a noise raised about a lot of shows on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and even Hotstar.\n\nWould a Game of Thrones pass a censor board evaluation, probably not at all. What about Sacred Games, for which there was already some noise about?\n\nAt the very least, Javadekar insists the government is not taking a step that would curb the freedom of media. But just what that step is remains to be seen.", "description": "Kiss your favourite shows goodbye, because the central government is gunning for them.
