We have to look after him, make sure that he has a long successful career,\u201d said Potter ahead of Saturday\u2019s game at Aston Villa.\n\n\u201cBut he was great in the (Spurs) game for us, not just his goals, I thought his overall contribution to the team was really good, pressed well, defended well.\n\nAaron Connolly has had a rapid rise (Steven Paston/PA)\n\n\u201cAnd then just for him to get that international debut, it\u2019s fantastic for him \u2013 disappointed obviously for him and the Irish boys that the result wasn\u2019t what they wanted.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s part of life as well, he has to deal with that and it\u2019s now case of recovering him and seeing how he is for the weekend.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of Connolly and summer arrival of Neal Maupay, who claimed the other goal in the 3-0 win over Spurs on October 5, has restricted the first-team action of last season\u2019s top scorer Glenn Murray.\n\nPotter praised the attitude of 36-year-old striker Murray and feels he is an ideal mentor for Connolly and Maupay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been impeccable, to be honest. Really, really supportive of the lads,\u201d Potter said of Murray\u2019s response to being sidelined.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re two young guys but having someone like Glenn around helps them enormously and he\u2019s selfless in that regard, speaks to Aaron, speaks to Neal, wants them to do well.\n\n\u201cAll the guys in the group have got huge respect for him.\n\n\u201cThe way he\u2019s been amongst the players, the way he\u2019s been with the young guys has been fantastic. And you need those players around when you\u2019ve got a couple of young lads, it\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\nPotter also revealed winger Leandro Trossard has returned to training following a groin problem and could be involved at Villa Park.\n\nThe Belgian, signed from Genk in the summer, has not featured since the 4-0 defeat at Manchester City on August 31.\n\n\u201cWe need to be careful with him, he\u2019s probably not ready to start at the weekend, I think that\u2019s fair to say,\u201d said Potter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make a decision over this afternoon and tomorrow to whether he\u2019s in the group.\u201d", "description": "The 19-year-old played twice for the Republic of Ireland during the international break.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/wire-19840420-1571320510-904_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
