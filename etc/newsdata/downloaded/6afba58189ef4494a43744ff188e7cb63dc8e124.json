And all are drenched in corporate dollars. The Democratic Party, reliant on big-money donors, has little interest in bolstering the left-wing policies of progressive candidates. And the networks rely on advertisers; as Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) pointed out in the second debate, the healthcare industry ran advertisements during commercial breaks. The millionaire cable news hosts\u2014as much as they might protest that they\u2019re nobody\u2019s puppet\u2014know which questions will please their corporate owners and sponsors and which won\u2019t.\n\nAnalyses I did for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting show that the policy questions both NBC and CNN asked, especially on healthcare and the economy, leaned heavily on industry talking points and assumptions. For instance, NBC mentioned \u201cfree college\u201d in four questions, but focused entirely on whether the program would cost too much or be \u201cactually achievable\u201d rather than, say, the problem of student debt or socioeconomic disparities in access to higher education.\n\nOther models are available. The League of Women Voters used to sponsor general election debates, and typically tapped more sober print journalists, who lack the same pressure to generate ratings, to lead the questioning. But the Republican and Democratic parties effectively muscled out the League in 1988, forming the supposedly nonpartisan (but actually bipartisan) Commission on Presidential Debates, which demanded full control over choosing questioners, the audience, press access and more. The League minced no words upon its withdrawal:\n\nThe demands of the two campaign organizations [the DNC and RNC] would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter. \u2026 It has become clear to us that the candidates\u2019 organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and answers to tough questions. \u2026 The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.\n\nIn the primaries, the parties and their media accomplices try to winnow the field as quickly as possible. This year, Democratic candidates are already being knocked out of the debates for low polling numbers or fundraising dollars\u2014nearly five months before the Iowa caucuses. But early on, most candidates are largely unknown and expected to have low poll numbers; the whole point of the early primary debates ought to be to help people get to know the candidates and their ideas.\n\nWhich brings us to the next problem. With 30-and 60-second time limits, what can we expect beyond glossy talking points? Take the climate crisis. In the first debate, Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) was asked to explain, in 60 seconds, her plan for climate change. Gov. Jay Inslee (Wash.), the candidate with the most developed plan thus far, has around 200 pages outlining his proposals. Though Inslee has since dropped out, Bernie Sanders released in August a 13,000-word climate plan, and several of Warren\u2019s famous plans tackle different aspects of the crisis. Sixty seconds is absurd and insulting.\n\nThose in control might argue that we can\u2019t have it both ways, keeping an expansive field of candidates and giving them all adequate time to discuss those complicated issues. But there is an obvious\u2014and easy\u2014solution. Environmental activists, led by the Sunrise Movement, have been calling for a single-issue climate debate, but the DNC under Tom Perez voted down a proposed climate debate in August. In 2015, the Black Lives Matter movement called for a BLM-themed debate, which the DNC likewise rebuffed. We should also have single-issue debates on healthcare, gun control, women\u2019s rights and more.\n\nCNN recently agreed to host a town hall on climate, and NBC will be hosting a multi-day climate forum, but it\u2019s not enough. Town halls and forums don\u2019t get the same audience that debates get, though they will give Perez a way to claim the DNC is doing enough on climate\u2014even while we suffer debates like the one July 30, in which the CNN hosts asked more non-policy questions (e.g., are the candidates \u201cmoving too far to the left\u201d?) than climate questions.\n\nWhat it comes down to is this: We\u2019ll never get thoughtful, substantive policy discussions while the debates are controlled by organizations dependent on big money. We need to give the debates to the League of Women Voters or to another independent organization dedicated to democracy rather than dollars.\n\nWhat do you want to see from our coverage of the 2020 presidential candidates?
