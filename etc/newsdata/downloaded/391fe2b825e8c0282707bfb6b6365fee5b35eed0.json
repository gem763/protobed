It notes that, similar to how the Islamic State inspired and connected with potential recruits online, violent white supremacists link with like-minded individuals on the Internet. Conspiracy theories about the \u201cethnic replacement\u201d of whites as the majority ethnicity in Western countries are prominent on social media platforms such as Gab, 8chan and EndChan, it said.\n\n[Arrests in domestic terror probes outpace those inspired by Islamic extremists]\n\n\u201cDHS\u2019s new strategy represents a notable step forward in reflecting evolving threats of violence to Americans,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a White House senior counterterrorism director under President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThe clear recognition of today\u2019s white-supremacist threat in an official U.S. government strategy is significant,\u201d Geltzer said, noting recent mass shootings in Pittsburgh and El Paso that were allegedly fueled by anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. \u201cAddressing the threat demands candidly characterizing it \u2014 and this document is an important step in doing so.\u201d\n\nThe strategy also seeks to deal with mass attacks that are not driven by any apparent ideology, such as the October 2017 shooting rampage in Las Vegas that killed 58 people. A Secret Service study last year that reviewed mass attacks found most attackers used firearms, the strategy said.\n\nA former top counterterrorism adviser to President Trump, Christopher Costa, praised the department for \u201cembracing this notion of targeted violence \u2014 and acknowledging the problems with firearms and weapons.\u201d Such targeted violence \u201cdoes not fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism,\u201d he said, so \u201cDHS is trying to fill a gap with the term and say, \u2018Now we have to ensure we address that.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[FBI faces skepticism over its efforts against domestic terrorism]\n\nIn terms of prevention, the strategy advocates a \u201cwhole-of-society\u201d approach with federal, state and local agencies working together to boost societal resiliency and, it is hoped, reduce the number of individuals likely to radicalize. The aim is to intervene with potential extremists before they can commit violent acts, it said.\n\nMcAleenan first joined DHS as the head of Custom and Border Protection\u2019s counterterrorism office shortly after the 9/11 attacks. \u201cThen, as now,\u201d he said in his speech, \u201cour first priority is to defend the country against terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe became acting secretary in April and in his first week asked for a review of DHS\u2019s actions to counter domestic terrorism. In his third week, a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., killing one and injuring three others. And in the middle of efforts to develop a strategic framework to incorporate lessons learned from countering foreign terrorist organizations, gunmen struck again \u2014 in one weekend killing more than 30 people in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nIn El Paso, \u201cthe attacker sought to kill Hispanics, and his online manifesto was rife with references to multiple hate-based ideologies,\u201d McAleenan said, speaking at an event co-hosted by the Brookings Institution and Heritage Foundation. The tragedies \u201creinforced our confidence in the focus of the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe department will follow up with a public action plan, explaining in greater detail how it plans to accomplish its goals. For instance, it will support countermessaging efforts by technology companies and civic partners to steer people away from violent messages online.\n\n\u201cThis strategic framework is our formal recognition of the emerging threat of targeted violence in the United States,\u201d McAleenan said. \u201cAt the same time, this framework is a vision \u2014 a vision for how our nation will respond to the evolving threats we face.\u201d", "description": "As part of a new strategy, the Trump administration is focused on countering \u201ctargeted violence\u201d \u2014 attacks not linked to an ideology.", "authors": ["Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "September At Pm", "Ellen Nakashima Is A National Security Reporter For The Washington Post.
