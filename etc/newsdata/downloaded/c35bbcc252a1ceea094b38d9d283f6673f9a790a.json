The report also found higher rates of prescribing to women and older people.\n\nWhile prescribing of some drugs, like benzodiazepines and opioids, has dipped a little recently amid fears about the deadly opioid epidemic in the United States, others, such as the gabapentin, pregabalin, and some antidepressants, are being prescribed more often and for longer.\n\n\u201cThis means more people are at risk of becoming addicted to them or having problems when they stop using them,\u201d PHE said.\n\n\u201cIt also costs the NHS (National Health Service) a lot of money, some of which is wasted because the medicines do not work for everyone all the time, especially if they are used for too long.\u201d\n\nAn opioid epidemic in the United States has killed almost half a million Americans since 1999, and a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) policy forum earlier this year warned that the United States \u201cis by no means alone in facing this crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Paris-based OECD said deaths linked to opioid use were rising sharply in Sweden, Norway, Ireland, and England and Wales.\n\nResponding to the PHE report, Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it is watching the U.S. crisis closely and aiming to take avoiding action.\n\n\u201cWe take the experience in the U.S. of dependence and addiction to opioids very seriously and are following ... developments ... to learn from the actions other countries are taking to tackle this issue,\u201d it said in a statement.", "description": "More and more Britons are being prescribed potentially addictive medicines like sleeping pills, opioids and other painkillers, raising the risk of a drug crisis like the one in the United States, health officials said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428127358&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8900B", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
