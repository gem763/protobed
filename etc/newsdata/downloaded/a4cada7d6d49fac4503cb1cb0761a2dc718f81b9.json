Nobody\u2019s expectations were especially high, but somehow it managed to still live down to them.\n\nI was not prepared for how sad this event was going to be, or how unprepared the XFL seemed to be in holding a professional sports draft. I joined a crowd varying from 2,000-5,000 to check out the live stream.\n\nInstead of a studio show on deep cable we got a livestream of a spreadsheet, some dudes yelling \u201cCONFIRMED\u201d after every pick, and a stopwatch. There\u2019s a lot to digest here.\n\nThe official draft time was just the stopwatch built into Windows\n\nEvery time someone made a pick you\u2019d see the cursor scroll across the screen to set the timer again. The only way this could have been worse better is if there were a dedicated camera pointed at an actual stopwatch.\n\nThis whole thing played into how cobbled together the draft felt, which is astonishing for a sports league looking to carve out a place next to the NFL. You\u2019re seriously telling me nobody at the XFL thought it might be nice to have some graphics?\n\nWe got to see a spreadsheet unfurl \u2014 in real time!\n\nBig moment for people who love Excel. This was worse than literally every single website\u2019s fantasy football outlay. When fantasy football is handling its drafts more professionally than your real football draft, that should say something.\n\nThe XFL Draft was just a conference call.\n\nLook at the broadcast \u2014 it\u2019s got a Zoom watermark and everything. Zoom is like Skype for the business world. It\u2019s intended for business teleconferencing, not a live broadcast \u2014 but the XFL didn\u2019t care. As someone who is on multiple Zoom calls a week I can tell you that most of my experience is \u201ccan you hear me?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d \u201cHold on, let me check my mic.\u201d And that showed here too. There was like, one microphone per team tops and resulted in the league saying \u201cCONFIRMED\u201d loudly after every pick, just to make sure everyone knew what was happening.\n\nHands down, the best thing was the chat.\n\nAt one point during the lunch break (yes, we\u2019re going to talk about this), the draft show shifted to analysis. What followed was a 20-minute frozen image with audio that sounded like the analysts were talking through a communal kazoo. It was delightful and the chat made it even better.\n\nTHEY HAD A LUNCH BREAK!\n\nThis might be my favorite thing. You\u2019re telling me that nobody was like, \u201cI can just order a sandwich tray and we can draft through it.\u201d I eat from my desk every single day and I don\u2019t have thousands of people watching me on my Zoom call. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to play through the pain like that.\n\nAlso this is an eight-team draft. Now I know they\u2019re having a metric ton of rounds to fill out rosters, but like ... c\u2019mon.\n\nDespite all this, I\u2019m still totally into the XFL.\n\nGo Battlehawks!", "description": "We were not prepared for this.", "authors": ["James Dator", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhfKmWHrOCoPydbj3o_bT8A31lA=/0x19:960x522/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19289640/Screen_Shot_2019_10_15_at_1.01.53_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
