If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nThe Genesee County Medical Examiner initially ruled Christina\u2019s death an accidental heroin overdose\u2014despite claims from her family that she was never a drug user. But in 2016, a Michigan State Police crime lab tested three packages of the mother of two\u2019s frozen breast milk and found no previous traces of heroin. Her death certificate was amended in August to indicate she died of a homicide.\n\nDuring a preliminary hearing Tuesday, several witnesses testified about Harris\u2019 alleged plans to murder his wife and recalled the morning of the incident.\n\nDavid Groshon, a former co-worker at United Plastics, testified on Tuesday he sold Harris Xanax and Klonopin, alleging the 44-year-old said \u201che was going to crush up the pills to give to his wife so she would stop nagging him.\u201d\n\nGroshon added that Harris later told him his wife tasted the pills, which he\u2019d plan to put in her milk or water, according to WNEM.\n\nAuthorities said on Sept. 29, 2014, neighbors found Christina unresponsive in the master bedroom of her Davison home. One of the neighbors testified on Tuesday that she found Christina lying on the bed without a pulse and with \u201cfoam coming out of her mouth.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Harris told police his wife had been suffering from a cold and called a neighbor at around 10 a.m. to check on her while he was at work.\n\n\u201cShe, the neighbor, thought that was unusual,\u201d Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said in August.\n\nProsecutors allege Harris put heroin into his wife\u2019s cereal and milk the night before, believing the drug was undetectable after \u201cmultiple\u201d conversations with his co-workers. During a deposition for a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Christina\u2019s family after her death, Harris told authorities he made his wife the late-night snack at her request.\n\n\u201cShe got hungry. I made her up a bowl of cereal. That's what she asked for. I know she was sitting in the chair, dropped the spoon,\u201d Harris said, adding that his wife fell asleep while pumping milk for their newborn daughter.\n\nThe case remained untouched until October 2014, prosecutors said, when Harris\u2019 siblings reported to local police that Jason had previously made remarks about \u201cgetting rid of Christina\u201d and had been seeing other women just before her death.\n\nHarris admitted in the deposition that his wife knew he had sent \u201csexual messages\u201d to another woman\u2014including one from Rhode Island who moved into his house with her child just weeks after his wife\u2019s death.\n\nThe woman was reportedly still living with the 44-year-old at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe 44-year-old\u2019s co-workers also told investigators Harris admitted he \u201cjust needed to get rid of\u201d his wife of 11 years so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with a divorce, child support payments, or a custody battle. Instead, Harris allegedly asked a colleague to kill Christina for $5,000, admitted to spiking his wife\u2019s water with Xanax pills, and polled the office on which pills were \u201codorless and tasteless.\u201d\n\n\u201cJason paid $5,000 to a guy to kill Christina and while this alleged hit man was doing surveillance on her the hit man was caught by police with a firearm,\u201d Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said in August.\n\nLeyton added the failed murder attempt prompted Harris\u2019 quest for an undetectable fatal drug, allegedly making Christina suspicious enough to confide in a friend.\n\n\u201cShe told a friend that if something happens to me, look at Jason,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the deposition, Harris told investigators he received about $150,000 from his wife\u2019s life insurance\u2014which he used to pay off his student loans. A Legacy.com obituary for Christina also directs memorial contributions to be made out to Jason \u201cin lieu of flowers.\u201d\n\nHarris is expected to return to court on Nov. 5.", "description": "Jason Harris, who\u2019s accused of putting a lethal dose of heroin in his wife\u2019s cereal, allegedly bought Klonopin from a co-worker so his wife \u201cwould stop nagging him.\u201d", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572390072/191029-melendez-muder-wife-tease_shuer4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
