The chinchilla coat marks the beginning of another chapter in Ramona and Destiny\u2019s lives, one where the younger woman becomes second in command in this new hustle, which grows to include Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart). Travers explained that the gift is \u201cRamona\u2019s signaling to Destiny, We\u2019re similar. You\u2019re like me. We\u2019re taking care of this group together.\u201d But, like the duo\u2019s schemes, the coat isn\u2019t a comfortable fit for Wu\u2019s character. \u201cThat coat becomes a little bit of a burden on Destiny,\u201d Travers said.\n\nDestiny\u2019s commingling excitement about and discomfort with her new riches is evident throughout the film. Hustlers first teases out this tension with period-specific visuals that celebrate its characters\u2019 excesses. \u201cI worked to follow those trends of the early 2000s,\u201d Travers said. \u201cI wanted all of the jeans to have top stitching and rhinestones, chain belts, and too many bracelets, and big rings and heavy jewelry.\u201d There are individualized flourishes, too: Ramona dances in a metallic silver G-string; Destiny wears a rhinestone choker that informs club patrons (and viewers) that she\u2019s SEXY.\n\nMany of the scenes that follow the women\u2019s initial (noncriminal) successes show them shopping for luxury clothing and accessories designed to call attention to their newly acquired riches. In one especially amusing\u2014and very 2007\u2014sequence, Destiny pays for a Gucci bag entirely in singles. When the cashier raises an eyebrow at the bills tendered, it\u2019s Ramona who instructs the woman to mind her business and ring up the purchase. \u201cYou start to see that they are financially ascendant, and that they are trying to elevate their status with these flashy symbols early on,\u201d Travers noted. \u201cAnd you notice that the things they gravitate to are very logo-heavy items or things that really signal wealth in a pretty ostentatious way.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut even before the 2008 financial crash radically alters all the characters\u2019 relationship to money, Hustlers highlights how the women start to conceive of wealth differently when their spending is less driven by a fear of financial scarcity. \u201cAs the story develops and the novelty wears down, you can see that they start to spend their money on things that are a bit more serious. They pay off debts, they help the women around them,\u201d Travers continued. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid of a Louboutin purchase, of course, but now they\u2019re dealing with a larger level of wealth. They\u2019re buying new homes, they\u2019re buying new lifestyles for themselves instead of just new closets.\u201d\n\nWhen Ramona and Destiny are eventually arrested (along with the other members of their crew), the stakes of their sartorial choices are high. To craft looks that conveyed how each character would dress when faced with legal adversity, Travers turned to the film\u2019s source material, and to celebrity news of the recent past. \u201cThe wonderful thing about the early 2000s is that scandal was really celebrated,\u201d he said, noting that he studied what Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan wore to their court appearances. (Photos of Tila Tequila and Snooki were also helpful references.) \u201cAt that time, we were seeing images of what these women were wearing every single day in paparazzi photos on Perez Hilton and Just Jared and websites that documented their every move,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, when it came time to present themselves to court, we got these really virginal, guilt-free, perfect versions of them that had nothing to do with the images that we were so used to seeing.\u201d", "description": "The film\u2019s costume designer, Mitchell Travers, talks about fur, glitter, and the characters\u2019 changing relationships with wealth.", "authors": ["Hannah Giorgis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/hustlers_HUSTLERS_SG_00068CR_rgb/facebook.jpg?1568745070", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
