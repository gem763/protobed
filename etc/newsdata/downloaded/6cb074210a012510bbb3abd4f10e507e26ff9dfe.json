Things got tense. Then there was heckling.", "language": "en", "text": "But about 20 minutes in, things got awkward. As Woodward repeatedly interrupted the authors to ask questions or clarify facts, audible murmurs rippled through the crowd. Eventually, one attendee yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re interrupting her!\u201d as many applauded in agreement. The audience grew increasingly frustrated, particularly when Woodward told Twohey and Kantor that they were \u201cdodging\u201d his question about what might have motivated Weinstein\u2019s alleged abuse. \u201cSTOP!\u201d several crowd members yelled at Woodward as he continued to press the topic. Some people heckled and hissed; others left early.\n\nIt was a rare sight for Sixth & I, a popular Washington event space that frequently hosts book talks with high-profile authors. The bizarre scene in front of a sold-out crowd quickly made the rounds on social media as audience members voiced their displeasure with Woodward\u2019s questions and interruptions.

Jodi and Megan signed a copy of their book for me after the session, which I enjoyed very much, and said \u2018thank you for the fabulous questions.\u2019 So there may be a difference of opinion.\u201d When reached by phone, he said that he had simply been trying to move the conversation along. Twohey and Kantor had asked him to moderate the book talk, he noted, adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t praise the book more.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Kantor and Twohey wrote in an email: \u201cWe\u2019re just starting our book tour, and we\u2019re grateful to all the moderators \u2014 Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others \u2014 who have agreed to join us onstage. We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with MeToo as an example and test of social change in our time.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from Sixth & I declined to comment. (C-SPAN2 will replay the event Thursday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 1:40 p.m. and Sunday at 5:10 p.m.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conversation started out pleasantly as Woodward called the book \u201ca masterpiece\u201d and asked Kantor and Twohey about the origins of their reporting on Weinstein. Tension in the crowd started building during a discussion about Irwin Reiter, Weinstein\u2019s accountant, who ended up being an invaluable source. As Woodward broke in while Kantor was speaking, some people in the audience lost patience.\n\n\u201cLet her finish!\u201d a woman yelled from the balcony, as others started clapping.\n\nWoodward, Twohey and Kantor briefly paused, then quickly moved on. But the atmosphere became uncomfortable several minutes later when Woodward asked about the reasons for Weinstein\u2019s behavior.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you spent all the time on him, you have to ask the question, which you really don\u2019t address in the book, and that is: Why did he behave this way?\u201d Woodward asked. \u201cI know you\u2019re not psychiatrists or psychologists, but share with us the \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2026 because there\u2019s so many strange things he does.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question \u2014 I think we could spend days or weeks or even months trying to get to the bottom of his psychology,\u201d Twohey said, adding that the question applies to the psychology of Weinstein\u2019s enablers as well. This led into a discussion of his brother, Bob Weinstein, who begged Harvey to get help.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re artfully dodging the question,\u201d Woodward said, and the audience started rumbling.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what we know. It\u2019s that this story is an X-ray into power, and how power works,\u201d Kantor said, as the crowd erupted into loud applause.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also about sex, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Woodward asked.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d several attendees yelled at the same time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about sex in the romantic sense,\u201d Kantor said, adding that \u201cpart of the way it\u2019s about power is that it\u2019s about work.\u201d She noted that some of their sources were harassed as soon as their first day on the job.\n\nAD\n\nDespite the increasingly loud muttering of a frustrated audience, Woodward continued his line of questioning, asking about Weinstein\u2019s possible reasons behind his \u201cperverted sexual crime.\u201d \u201cSo, why? I\u2019m sorry, I know this puts you on the spot. What is driving him?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d someone else yelled.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get to the Q&A!\u201d hollered another attendee.\n\nBut Woodward kept going, and the audience kept calling for him to stop. At one point, Woodward asked \u201cWhat\u2019s Rosebud for Harvey?\u201d \u2014 a reference to the central mystery in the movie \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d \u2014 and wondered if his behavior was \u201csome kind of weird foreplay.\u201d\n\nTwohey and Kantor didn\u2019t want to play armchair psychologists, saying that making any judgments about Weinstein\u2019s motivations would be beyond the limits of their knowledge.\n\n\u201cI understand you\u2019re dodging that question,\u201d Woodward said to more groans from the crowd, before moving on to the lawyers in Weinstein\u2019s orbit who helped protect him over the years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conversation continued without incident until turning to the topic of Christine Blasey Ford, who talked to Twohey and Kantor about her September 2018 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford alleged that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school, while Kavanaugh denied the charge and was later confirmed as a justice.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s Washington: A smaller, colder world for a justice under a cloud\n\n\u201cDo you believe her?\u201d Woodward asked.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that Christine Blasey Ford is probably the most precise and diligent source subject that certainly I have ever reported on,\u201d Twohey said, adding that Ford refused to be coached by advisers for her testimony.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have some precise memory on when this happened or exactly where and so forth, and that has been used to undermine what she testified to and said,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cI think the interesting question now is: With all that\u2019s available about Christine Blasey Ford and that allegation, and Kavanaugh, if he were, say, a judge here in the District of Columbia, and somebody gave you that information, is it enough to publish a story?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll women deserve to be heard!\u201d yelled a woman from the balcony, as the crowd started to grumble once again.\n\n\u201cWas it sufficient?\u201d Woodward continued. \u201cWould it have met your standard in the New York Times to publish that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the reason your question is so interesting is it was your paper, The Washington Post, that did publish what really was exactly that story,\u201d Kantor said.\n\nKantor and Twohey didn\u2019t seem fazed by the audience reaction or Woodward\u2019s questioning. Later, as they waited for attendees to line up for their turn at the microphone, Kantor got her chance to ask Woodward a question: What investigation would he assign into the Trump administration? After she found his reply somewhat insufficient, Kantor good-naturedly responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re answering my question,\u201d to the audience\u2019s knowing laughs and applause.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the crowd wasn\u2019t done voicing their displeasure with how the conversation had unfolded. A woman approached the microphone, thanking Twohey and Kantor for their hard work before turning her attention briefly to Woodward: \u201cMr. Woodward, you\u2019re one of the legends of the profession, but hearing you repeatedly interrupt these women all night \u2026\u201d she started, before being drowned out by the audience clapping. She noted it was \u201cfrustrating.\u201d\n\nAfter the talk wrapped, the audience was still buzzing with frustration as they sat in the pews, complained to Sixth & I staff and stood in line to have their books signed. Roslyn Simpson, 49, said that as a moderator, Woodward \u201cinterrupted too often, which is what happens when women want to tell their stories.\u201d She pointed to a lack of self-awareness on his part. \u201cIt was very surprising, disruptive and rude,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nSarah Burgess, a 33-year-old consultant who was attending the book talk with her sister, was disappointed that Woodward steered the authors away from talking about their journalism and their sources \u2014 because he wanted to spend more time talking about Weinstein, the perpetrator. \u201cI think that it\u2019s been really clear in the news in the past couple of years that society doesn\u2019t take women\u2019s voices seriously, so I think it\u2019s really important that we make sure that we\u2019re making space for women to speak and that we\u2019re listening,\u201d Burgess said.\n\nIn the last minute of the Q&A, an audience member asked the authors: Who do you hope will read your book?\n\n\u201cI hope men read it,\u201d Kantor said.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018She Said\u2019 book review: How the New York Times broke Harvey Weinstein\n\nHow Lisa Bloom, feminist attorney, became just another complicit Aunt Lydia", "description": "The audience started to get uncomfortable when Woodward repeatedly interrupted Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, two New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct story.", "authors": ["Lisa Bonos", "Writer", "Editor For Solo-Ish", "Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2TBxexqYlbEDMTyyXgplOk325Q8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7RCHXBXRJGMBKE47HFMFNTQTY.jpg"}
