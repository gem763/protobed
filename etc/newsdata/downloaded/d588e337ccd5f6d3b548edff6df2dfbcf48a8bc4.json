But big kids in Chesapeake, rejoice: On Halloween, children of all ages can set out with their pumpkin pails, Stranger Things costumes and get their sugar highs.\n\nMayor Richard West has confirmed to TIME that he is \u201cabsolutely\u201d against the 1970 ordinance that has somehow remained on the books. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know it existed until it went viral last Halloween,\u201d he says.\n\nThe ordinance says that \u201cif any person over the age of 14 years shall engage in the activity commonly known as \u2018trick or treat\u2019 or any other activity of similar character or nature under any name whatsoever, he or she shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor.\u201d It clarifies that this does not apply to parents or guardians of younger kids, but also makes trick-or-treating later than 8 p.m. a misdemeanor, too, bringing to mind the age-old adage that nothing good can happen so late at night.\n\nWhile news outlets and talk-show hosts like Jimmy Kimmel have poked fun at Chesapeake for the ordinance in the past, West says he\u2019s hoping to get rid of it. \u201cI would anticipate us removing the ordinance all together,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Still, the severity of the crime for hunting candy as a 15-year-old has always seemed particularly strange to West. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it got to the ridiculous part of having it be a misdemeanor.\u201d\n\nThough the law is technically still in place, among other more typical laws like inhaling toxic drugs and receiving stolen goods, West wants any and all teenagers to go out there and have fun on Oct. 31. \u201cMy message is, have a good time, be safe,\u201d he says.\n\nSo don\u2019t worry, Chesapeake high schoolers \u2014 you won\u2019t land in jail for your enormous Kit-Kat collection.\n\nWrite to Rachel E.
