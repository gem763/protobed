Analysts had expected a forecast of 9.4 million. The company will release a new installment of 'The Crown' and Martin Scorsese film 'The Irishman' during that time.\n\nBut it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service from Walt Disney Co that will be stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney's popular Marvel, 'Star Wars', animation and other properties.\n\nApple Inc also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc's HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp, are expected to enter the market next year.\n\nNetflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.\n\n'The launch of these new services will be noisy,' Netflix said in its quarterly letter to investors.\n\n'There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.'\n\n'In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment.'\n\nNetflix acknowledged, however, that it was still taking a hit from price increases earlier this year in the United States.\n\n'Retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,' it said.\n\nThe most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+. Apple TV+ will debut at $5 per month.\n\nNetflix said its additional revenue would allow it to continue to invest 'to further strengthen our value proposition.'\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix's net income rose to $665 million, or $1.47 per share, from $403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nTotal revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion.\n\nThe debt that Netflix has amassed has sparked concern among some investors.\n\nThe company said in the earnings report that it expected free cash flow to improve in 2020 and annually beyond that. In the meantime, Netflix will continue to tap the high-yield market as needed, it said.\n\nIn the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions - Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said.", "description": "Shares of Netflix rose 9.2 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $312.69 after the streaming giant added slightly more paying subscribers than expected.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19811340-0-image-a-2_1571266655207.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
