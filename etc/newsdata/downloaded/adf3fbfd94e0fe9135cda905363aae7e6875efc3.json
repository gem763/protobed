The WEF noted that life expectancy in the U.S. is now lower than it is in China, with the U.S. having only the 39th highest life expectancy in the world amid its ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nSingapore, named the most competitive economy in the world, scored highly for its public sector, labor force, diversity and infrastructure. On life expectancy, Singapore was ranked number one, with newborn children expected to live until the age of 74.\n\nIn comparison, life expectancy in the U.S. is 66 years old, while in China it's 68.", "description": "In its Global Competitiveness Report, the World Economic Forum measured the strength of more than 100 key indicators, such as inflation, digital skills and trade tariffs, across 141 countries.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103467188-GettyImages-566329537.jpg?v=1529470951", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
