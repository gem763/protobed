Thunberg, who arrived in the US in August on a solar-powered yacht, was asked by Graves what she would do if she saw another boat throw rubbish into the sea.\n\n\u201cI would tell [the] other boat to stop dumping trash in the ocean,\u201d she said. She then told Graves: \u201cI am from Sweden, a small country, and it\u2019s the same argument: \u2018Why should we do something? Look at the US.\u2019 It\u2019s being used against you as well.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress heard from other young climate activists who explained the trauma of growing up in a world primed for greater floods, storms, heatwaves and unrest because of rising global temperatures.\n\n\u201cThis should fill you with shame. Youth climate activism should not exist,\u201d said Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old who told of choking wildfire smoke in recent summers in her native Washington state. Margolin said her fellow students suffer anxiety and a \u201cweird form of nihilism\u201d where they wonder if it\u2019s worthwhile making future plans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s depression and fear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating and scary and also feels like we\u2019ve been betrayed. It is shameful and cowardly to not take action. How can we call ourselves an example for the world if we are going to be cowards and not do anything?\u201d\n\nBill Keating, a Massachusetts Democrat who chaired the hearing, said he was sorry that young people had to come to Washington DC to plead for greater action.\n\n\u201cOur generation has failed to adequately address our climate crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThis failure isn\u2019t fatal, yet our failure to change will be. We wouldn\u2019t be in this situation right now \u2013 our witnesses would be safely and happily in school pursuing their dreams and not protesting and pushing their governments to act \u2013 if everyone was already doing their part.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference following the hearing, plaintiffs in a lawsuit that alleges the US government violated young people\u2019s rights by abetting activities that have contributed to global warming, called for legal action to force greater movement on climate change from the US.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate in this country that we have three branches of government so that when there are branches of government that are actively harming our children, and have done so knowingly over the last 50 years by creating an energy system based on fossil fuels, the courts can step in to protect the rights of our children,\u201d said Andrea Rodgers, a staff attorney at Our Children\u2019s Trust, which is representing the young people in the case.\n\nThe committee was the latest stop in a long series of events for Thunberg, who last year started to skip school every Friday in order to protest against inaction over the climate crisis. Her stance spawned a global strike movement that will escalate on Friday when adults, as well as students, will walk out of their workplaces over the emergency.\n\nThe protests come ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week where governments will be urged to strengthen their efforts to cut emissions.\n\nThe world is currently on track to surpass a warming limit of 2C agreed to in the Paris climate agreement, with major emitters such as the US and Brazil now headed by leaders who have questioned climate science and enthusiastically back mining and logging that causes the release of planet-warming gases.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greta Thunberg leaves after a gathering outside the US supreme court.

The teenage activist looked a little nervous at first as she took the lectern under a giant chandelier in a grand committee room, but then smiled as she resumed her call to arms against the climate crisis.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cIt is also the world\u2019s number one producer of oil. It is also the only nation to signal its intention to leave the Paris climate agreement because it was \u2018a bad deal\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking softly, she modulated her voice slightly to make clear she was quoting, disapprovingly, Donald Trump with the words \u201ca bad deal\u201d.\n\n\n\nThunberg invoked Martin Luther King\u2019s struggle for civil rights and John F Kennedy\u2019s goals that included landing a man on the moon \u2013 \u201cnot because they are easy, but because they are hard\u201d, \u2013 to plead with Washington to lead in the fight, even if it seems impossible. \u201cGiving up can never be an option,\u201d she said.\n\nThe speech was greeted with a standing ovation and followed by a panel discussion. Thunberg, due to take a train to New York on Wednesday night, was asked about her observations of the way Washington works. She replied: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more calm than I thought. Everything is just happening so slow and people are just repeating the same things over and over again.\n\n\u201cI have heard so many politicians here say the same things over and over again. If it continues like that, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d\n\nShe also had a message for those who feel depressed or paralysed by the scale of the crisis. \u201cI started to do something, take action, try to make a difference instead of sitting in despair. That changed my life. It gives your life meaning... To know you can have impact, it makes you feel a lot better.\u201d", "description": "Teen climate activists attend a hearing to address the climate crisis and its traumatic effect on the younger generation", "authors": ["Oliver Milman", "David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7094b503493c13c415eec2a29b33033a1d5575f/0_322_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=73cbd00856ddb5050dec3c6cf869c18a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
