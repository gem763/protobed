The jail conditions were unspeakable: 18 women in a 15-by-12-foot room. It was so overcrowded that women had to sleep on floor mats in front of the toilet. In those six years in prison, I was assigned to four different facilities. I can tell you from experience, staff matters. While the staff in Columbus County couldn\u2019t make the cell bigger, they took us out whenever they could, and came whenever someone needed them. They were visibly bothered by the condition we were in, and it made a difference to us that they cared. In prison, on the other hand, there was good staff and bad staff. Officers don\u2019t make the rules, but how they enforce them makes a huge difference. The ones that cared were worshipped and respected by inmates. You are at their mercy, and you know it. If I could institute a reform, it would be the hiring process and educational requirements of both police and prison officers.\n\n\n\nJoan Olsen\n\nWatha, N.C.\n\nThe gruesome vignettes compiled by Ken White depict not only profound suffering by people held in correctional facilities, but the callous disregard\u2014and in some cases criminal conduct\u2014of staff charged with their care. These 32 stories provide a glimpse into the closed and medieval world of incarceration in America.", "description": "After Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death, readers discuss the mistreatment of inmates in U.S. correctional facilities and state penitentiaries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_617722494/facebook.jpg?1566481005"}
