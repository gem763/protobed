And many observers do not share Esper/Esperanto's certainty that the cease-fire the Trump administration helped broker between Turkey and the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces is holding up as well as he and other White House officials have implied.\n\nSyria: Trump says Kurds are 'very happy' with U.S.-brokered deal and U.S. has 'taken control' of oil\n\nBlumenthal: Turkish offensive against Kurds in Syria 'on the cusp of genocide'\n\nMark Esperanto, Secretary of Defense, \u201cThe ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with the Kurds.\u201d USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo told ABC News on Sunday that his \"senior leaders\" had just informed him that \"there is relatively little fighting\" consisting of \"little sporadic small arms fire and a mortar or two.\"\n\nAnd Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has emphatically denied his forces were not abiding by the agreement, which Turkey has characterized as a \"pause.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re getting your news from. According to the news I received from my defense minister, there is no question of clashes,\" he told reporters in Istanbul on Friday, according to Turkey's official Anadolu news agency. \"These are all speculation, disinformation.\"\n\nBut SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said, \"Turkey is violating the ceasefire agreement by continuing to attack the town since last night.\"\n\nAnd soon after the deal was announced Thursday, a U.S. official who is not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that the cease-fire was not holding.\n\nDespite the agreement to halt the fighting, air and artillery attacks continue to target the positions of fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital in Ser\u00eakaniy\u00ea/Ras al-Ayn. Turkey is violating the ceasefire agreement by continuing to attack the town since last night. \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 18, 2019\n\nThe SDF announced Sunday that their fighters had finished evacuating the northern town of Ras al-Ayn as they had agreed to do under terms of the cease-fire.\n\nThough Trump has touted the five-day cease-fire as a foreign policy triumph, declaring its start to be a \"great day for civilization,\" many critics have condemned it as a capitulation that ceded Kurdish territory to Turkey while giving the U.S. little in return.\n\nPompeo said it was a \"hard fought negotiation\" that \"lasted hours\" and \"achieved the outcome that President Trump sent us to achieve.\"\n\nPompeo and Vice President Mike Pence were dispatched to Ankara late Wednesday for talks with Erdogan.\n\nTrump has stressed the need to bring the troops home as one of his rationales for pulling them out of Syria. At the end of his tweet on Sunday, he declared, \"Bringing soldiers home.\"\n\nBut Esper told reporters traveling with him to the Middle East that all U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq. He said they will continue to conduct operations from there against the Islamic State group to prevent its resurgence.\n\n\"We have secured the oil,\" Trump also stated in his tweet, apparently referring to oil fields in eastern Syria that had been under Kurdish control before the Turkish military incursion. It was not immediately clear how the oil had been secured as Iran, Russia, Turkey and the Syrian government under Bashar al-Assad scramble to fill the power vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal.\n\nTrump has fought to justify the move amid a surge of bipartisan opposition in Congress. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been one Trump's staunchest supporters, has condemned what he considers an \"impulsive\" move that left \"a stain on America's honor\" by abandoning a U.S. ally.", "description": "President Trump quoted \"Mark Esperanto, Secretary of Defense\" on Sunday.
