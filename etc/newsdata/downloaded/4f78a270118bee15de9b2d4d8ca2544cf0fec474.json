When Mr Walker then asked her she felt when hearing Mr Trump\u2019s attacks on the congresswomen, Ms Munchetty replied: \u201cFurious. Absolutely furious.\u201d\n\nThe BBC rules state no viewer should be able to tell the personal opinions of its journalists and presenters on a \u201cmatter of public policy or political controversy,\u201d Mr Jordan said.\n\n\u201cSo the line is not about calling out racist comments, which is perfectly acceptable where things are clearly framed in racist language, it\u2019s about how you go on then to discuss the person who made them and make assumptions or remarks about that.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This is ridiculous. It\u2019s perfectly understandable why she said what she did.\u201d\n\nSangita Myska, a news correspondent at the corporation, said there was \u201cbewilderment\u201d among ethnic minority staff at the BBC at the ruling, while radio DJ Trevor Nelson said every person of colour knew exactly what \u201cgo home\u201d meant\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019ve experienced it, it\u2019s hard to truly understand,\" he said.\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtag #IStandWithNaga began to trend, with many decrying the BBC's decision.\n\nJournalist Afua Hirsch, who is organising an open letter protesting the decision, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme she was \u201cshocked and horrified\u201d by the complaints unit\u2019s reprimand of Ms Munchetty.\n\n\u201cIt suggests the racist views she was commenting on were opinions which should be treated impartially,\u201c which would have a chilling and disproportionate effect on people of colour who worked in broadcasting, she said.\n\nBut Mr Jordan insisted the BBC\u2019s rules prohibiting personal opinions, even on racism, were even more essential in today\u2019s divided world.\n\n\u201cIt is a fine line but it\u2019s an important line isn\u2019t it? In the politics of the present where we are into a politics of name-calling and insult, I think it\u2019s probably unwise of the BBC to get ourselves into a position where we are calling out people for being liars or being racists and this and that.\u201d\n\nHe agreed that Ms Munchetty was unfortunately led down the path of expressing a personal opinion by her co-presenter Mr Walker, but said the complaints unit could only respond to complaints made by viewers, which had all focused on Ms Munchetty only.\n\nMost of the storm of criticism which followed the ruling was the result of misunderstandings of what the presenter had actually been told off for, Mr Jordan added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been widely misinterpreted, perhaps wilfully misinterpreted in some respects. If racist language is used by anyone, whether it\u2019s President Trump or anyone else, it should be described as such.\u201d", "description": "Presenters and journalists must not describe Donald Trump as a racist even when he makes racist statements, the BBC has clarified. Although it is acceptable to characterise racist comments made by public figures as such, staff are not allowed to then imply the person who said them is themselves a racist,\u00a0the BBC\u2019s director of editorial policy and standards David Jordan said.", "authors": ["Tim Wyatt"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/16/naga-munchetty-bbc-breakfast.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
