John Solomon, a journalist for The Hill, wrote that Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings, when in 2015, he was appointed to the board of directors of this company. Bank records showthat Hunter Biden's American company Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC regularly received transfers of more than $ 160 thousand per month. The money came from Burisma from the spring of the year 2014 to the autumn of the year 2015. During this period, Biden was the main official in the United States, who led the Ukrainian question.
