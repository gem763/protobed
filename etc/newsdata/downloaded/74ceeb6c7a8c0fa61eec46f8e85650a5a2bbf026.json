The calendar records show he was scheduled there the morning after his arrival at the hotel.\n\nTrump\u2019s calendar doesn\u2019t include anything about a meeting with Zervos. But her lawyer, Mariann Wang, wrote that the documents \u201cstrongly corroborate\u201d Zervos\u2019 account - and indicate that Trump was lying in a 2016 statement that said he \u201cnever met her at a hotel.\u201d\n\nTrump lawyer Marc Kasowitz said Thursday that Zervos\u2019 claims are \u201centirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents.\u201d\n\nZervos, a California restaurateur who was on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2006, was among more than a dozen women who came forward during Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign with allegations of sexual misconduct. Both she and Trump are Republicans.\n\nHe called the women \u201cliars\u201d trying to harm him with \u201c100 percent fabricated\u201d stories, and he retweeted a message specifically calling Zervos\u2019 claims \u201ca hoax.\u201d He also issued a statement denying her allegations, including the denial of meeting her at a hotel.\n\nZervos had approached lawyers in 2011 and sent Fox News an August 2015 email about her allegation, according to the filing.\n\n\u201cTrump Hit On Me,\u201d read the email\u2019s subject line. Sent two months into Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the message said he \u201cinvited me to a hotel room under the guise of working for him. He had a different agenda.\u201d\n\nRequests for comment was sent Thursday to the news network and to Gloria Allred, an attorney whom Zervos said she contacted in 2011. Allred was Zervos\u2019 lawyer when she went public in 2016 but no longer represents her.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have said his statements were opinions and he had a free-speech right to defend himself.\n\nZervos is seeking a retraction, an apology and damages.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Zervos said Trump also kissed her unexpectedly at his office in Trump Tower in December of 2007, before the alleged California encounter.\n\nThursday\u2019s court filing doesn\u2019t include any calendar items related to that alleged encounter, but it does include emails from that autumn between Zervos and Trump\u2019s secretary where they discuss a potential lunch date in New York.\n\nIn a Dec. 3, 2007, email, Zervos tells the assistant she was in town and wanted to come by. There\u2019s no reply email in the court filing.\n\nThursday\u2019s filing also has some redacted sections. Wang said they describe documents that corroborate Zervos\u2019 allegations \u201cwith even more granularity\u201d but that Trump\u2019s lawyers are blocking public release of the materials. The filing asks a court to declare they aren\u2019t confidential.\n\nA court order Friday set a Dec. 6 deadline for Trump to undergo a deposition, a legal term for sworn questioning conducted out of court.\n\nHis lawyers have tried to get the case dismissed, or at least delayed until he\u2019s out of office.\n\nAfter narrowly losing an appellate ruling in March, Kasowitz said he planned to appeal to New York\u2019s highest court. He hasn\u2019t thus far but made a technical filing last week that could signal an appeal is coming soon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump's private calendar helps support a former \"Apprentice\" contestant's claim that he subjected her to unwanted kissing and groping, her lawyer said in a court filing Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jennifer Peltz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/apprentice_contestant_trump_70760_c0-240-5760-3600_s1200x700.jpg?3b9a8ea0e82656f098dd6f7cd5420c99f93f2f69", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
