Some reported using both THC- and nicotine-containing products.\n\nThere was one death each in Illinois, Oregon and Indiana from lung illnesses that were possibly tied to vaping, the CDC said. Health officials in Los Angeles and Minnesota have also each reported deaths. Minnesota health officials say the person was over 65 years with a history of lung problems who had vaped illicit THC products and died in August.\n\nThe CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state partners are combining information about e-cigarette exposures, results from FDA testing of product samples, and clinical testing results to try to identify a cause or causes of these illnesses.\n\nThe lung illnesses are associated with use of e-cigarette products including devices, liquids, refill pods and cartridges. The FDA is analyzing more than 120 samples of products or substances that may be causing the illness.\n\n\"The FDA is analyzing these for a broad range of chemicals, but no one substance, including vitamin E acetate, has been identified in all of the samples tested,\" acting FDA commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless said in a release.\n\nNon-infectious pneumonia\n\nVitamin E acetate is found in supplements and skin creams but is not an approved vaping additive.\n\nDr. Daniel Fox, a pulmonary and critical care physician at WakeMed Health & Hospitals in Raleigh, North Carolina, described a cluster of five cases in the state in patients that were between the ages of 18 and 35.\n\n\"We found a certain type of a pneumonia that was non-infectious \u2014 it's called lipoid pneumonia \u2026 that can occur when either oils or lipid-containing substances enter the lungs,\" Fox said in a media briefing.\n\nA sampling of imaging findings in patients with lung disease associated with electronic cigarette use is provided. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecigs?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ecigs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaping?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vaping</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oBuGJv8YEX\">https://t.co/oBuGJv8YEX</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GU3KfJTcdy\">pic.twitter.com/GU3KfJTcdy</a> \u2014@NEJM\n\nDr. Daniel Croft, who treats and studies pulmonary disease at the University of Rochester, says he's seen patients with lipoid pneumonia among some who've vaped cannabis products, one of which is cannabis oil.\n\n\"When the oil is heated, it forms an aerosol and is able to travel into the lungs. From that very hot initial temperature, it can condense into the harmful droplets and stick to the walls and coat the walls,\" Croft told NBC News.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nDoctors have cautioned people to stop vaping until they figure out exactly why some are falling ill with serious breathing issues.\n\nWatch for symptoms\n\nHealth Canada said any Canadians who use vaping products should monitor themselves for symptoms of pulmonary illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, chest pain) and seek medical attention promptly if they have concerns about their health given the acute pulmonary illnesses in the U.S.\n\nNo cases of respiratory illness specifically linked to vaping have so far been reported in Canada, but health experts are still wary of the products.\n\n\"With new findings coming out, I'm more reluctant to say that vaping is less harmful than smoking,\" Robert Schwartz, of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit, said in an interview with CBC News on Friday.\n\nSeparately on Friday, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article on a cluster of cases in Illinois and Wisconsin as well as a letter on six cases in Utah.\n\nEpidemiologist Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer in Illinois, and her co-authors described 53 patients since July. About 84 per cent of them reported having used THC products in e-cigarette devices. Most were men, and half were aged 19 and under. They all had one thing in common when chest imaging was carried out: identifiable lung abnormalities.\n\nActive infection, such as bacterial contamination from e-cigarette fluids, does not appear to explain what doctors see in patients, but \"acute toxic lung injury does seem to fit,\" a journal editorial said.\n\nLayden told reporters the earliest case was reported in mid April.", "description": "The investigation into a lung illness tied to vaping now\u00a0includes up to 450 cases of serious lung illness\u00a0in 33 U.S. states and one territory, health officials said Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5189962.1561500382!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/global-vaping.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
