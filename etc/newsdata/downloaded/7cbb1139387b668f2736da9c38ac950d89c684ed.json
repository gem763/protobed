There were questions about the Braves\u2019 lasting power as the rest of the NL East beefed up, and the Cardinals would have to outlast the Cubs and Brewers.\n\nThe Braves ultimately showed that any concerns about them were for naught, emerging as the champions of the only division that had at least four teams at or above .500. Their dynamic lineup and strong starting pitching allowed them to claim a second straight division title, and they seem ready to add more crowns in the future.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Cardinals don\u2019t have the stars that the Braves possess and may not be elite in any one facet, but they are a well-rounded team. Their offense can get the job done, the pitching is solid, and they employ one of the NL\u2019s few non-flammable bullpens.\n\nManager Mike Shildt may win Manager of the Year for guiding this team to the playoffs.\n\nThe key to this series could be which team\u2019s young starters fare better in the postseason.\n\nAtlanta Braves second baseman Ozzie Albies (1) and right fielder Matt Joyce (14) and center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. (13) hold up the pennant after clinching the NL East division title on Sep 20, 2019 in Atlanta, Georiga. (Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nGame 1: Thursday, Oct. 3, in Atlanta, 5:02 p.m. ET (TBS)\n\nGame 2: Friday, Oct. 4, in Atlanta, 4:37 p.m. ET (TBS)\n\nGame 3: Sunday, Oct. 6, in St. Louis, 4:10 p.m. ET (TBS)\n\nGame 4*: Monday, Oct. 7, in St. Louis, TBD (TBS)\n\nGame 5*: Wednesday, Oct. 9, in Atlanta, TBD (TBS)\n\n* if necessary\n\nPREVIOUSLY\n\nThe Braves won the season series, claiming two of three in both sets. In the final game, the Braves rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the ninth inning to win, 4-3, in 10 innings. These teams last met in the playoffs in the 2012 wild-card game, a St. Louis victory. That game is remembered for a questionable infield fly rule that went against the Braves.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty (22) is set to start Game 2 of the National League divisional series against the Atlanta Braves. (Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPITCHING MATCHUPS\n\nGame 1: Dallas Keuchel (8-8, 3.75) vs. Miles Mikolas (9-14, 4.16)\n\nGame 2: Mike Foltynewicz (8-6, 4.54) vs. Jack Flaherty (11-8, 2.75)\n\nGame 3: Mike Soroka (13-4, 2.68) vs. TBD\n\nGame 4*: Max Fried (17-6, 4.02) vs. TBD\n\nGame 5*: TBD vs. TBD\n\nThe Braves are going to start with a former Cy Young winner and World Series champion who has started nine postseason games. While Mike Soroka had the best season of any Braves pitcher, he is noticeably better on the road, and thus will start at Busch Stadium. Mike Foltynewicz did not pitch well in his postseason debut last year, allowing five runs in six innings.\n\nThe Cardinals opted to have their ace, Jack Flaherty, pitch Sunday to clinch the division, and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll be getting the ball in Game 2. He can return on short rest for Game 5, if necessary. Dakota Hudson will pitch in the postseason for the first time and would likely get the ball for Game 3, though that hasn\u2019t been officially announced yet.\n\nBRAVES KEYS TO VICTORY\n\n\u2022 First baseman Freddie Freeman dealt with an elbow issue down the stretch, and produced his lowest OPS of any calendar month in September. If the Braves are going to make a deep run, they\u2019re going to need their team MVP to be at his best.\n\n\u2022 This will be the second time youngsters Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. and Ozzie Albies appear in the postseason, and perhaps last year\u2019s introduction will benefit them. The two combined to hit just .194 in last year\u2019s NLDS against the Dodgers. The two are instrumental to the Braves\u2019 lineup while hitting in the top two spots.\n\n\u2022 The Braves will need better starting pitching than they received last year. Atlanta\u2019s starters lasted just 13.1 innings while failing to complete five innings in any start, and posted a 6.08 ERA. Having Keuchel and Soroka should help this time around.\n\nAtlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman (5) has been dealing with an elbow injury lately. The Braves will need him to be at his best in their playoff series against the Cardinals. (Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCARDINALS KEYS TO VICTORY\n\n\u2022 The Cardinals led the NL with 116 steals this year, and they are set up well against a Braves team that doesn\u2019t control the game all that well. Atlanta\u2019s catching duo of Tyler Flowers and Brian McCann combined to throw out just 24.3 percent of runners. St. Louis may be able to increase their opportunities with runners in scoring position.\n\n\u2022 St. Louis finished with the second-best bullpen ERA in the National League, and is set up well should it have leads to protect. Andrew Miller can be quite helpful against Freeman and Nick Markakis, and Giovanny Gallegos had a breakout season. Closer Carlos Martinez does not yield many homers, which is helpful in October.\n\n\u2022 The Cardinals lineup is going to have perform better than it did during the regular season. St. Louis ranked in the bottom half in most categories, and they\u2019re going to need to score runs to keep up with a potent Atlanta offense. A strong postseason showing could be quite helpful to soon-to-be free agent Marcell Ozuna.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Atlanta's talented, young core will try to win the franchise's first playoff series in 18 years against a St. Louis team that emerged from a tough NL Central.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VHMiSKfAhSG96gRDZ42K.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KfWje7ZE.CRZeJ_ssodiPA--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d3ba3660-e3b6-11e9-a7f9-e1c3735c1492"}
