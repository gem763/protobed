Sir Richard also accused officers of indulging Beech, later exposed as a paedophile who lusted after young boys.\n\nOperation Midland, which destroyed the lives and reputations of a series of distinguished people, including former Armed Forces chief Field Marshal Lord Bramall, was launched after detectives interviewed Beech in the autumn of 2014.\n\nBarrister Geoffrey Robertson QC, acting for one of Beech\u2019s victims, former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, said there was never a shred of evidence. He added: \u2018Operation Midland was conducted incompetently, negligently and almost with institutional stupidity.\u2019\n\nThe real victims: Lord Bramall (pictured left) and Tory MP Harvey Proctor were falsely accused by Carl Beech in an operation which cost the Met \u00a32.5m\n\nBEECH\u2019S CLAIMS WERE \u2018A BIT SPOOKS\u2019\n\nIn the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, Beech contacted the Metropolitan Police in late 2012, alleging that he had been the victim of historic child sex abuse by a gang including his late stepfather Major Ray Beech and Savile. The case was referred to Wiltshire Police.\n\nCrucially Beech did not name any VIPs as being among his tormentors who, he said, were about 20 in number.\n\nHe did not allege any physical injuries and made no mention of witnessing any murders. But he did say he was picked up from school by men in a car.\n\nBeech\u2019s mother, a vicar, was later interviewed by Wiltshire and told detectives that she had no idea her son was sexually abused, and never suspected it.\n\nLord Brittan with Lady Brittan saw their home raided during Operation Midland when Mr Brittan was accused of raping Beech while holding his head under water\n\nWiltshire closed the case in May 2013, describing Beech\u2019s allegations as \u2018a little bit odd\u2019 and \u2018it all sounds a bit Spooks\u2019.\n\n\u2018NICK\u2019 RETURNS TO SPARK AN OPERATION\n\nBy the following year, Beech had not only submitted a claim for criminal injuries compensation (he received \u00a322,000) but had also started blogging about his supposed child sex abuse.\n\nThis caught the eye of now disgraced investigations website, Exaro, which published his fanciful claims which in turn attracted the attention of Scotland Yard.\n\nSir Richard says there were major inconsistencies between Beech\u2019s interviews with the Met in 2014, when he started naming VIPs, and his previous one with Wiltshire when only his stepfather and Savile were identified.\n\nHe says: \u2018It is unfortunate no attempt was made to question Nick on the numerous inconsistencies between his Wiltshire interviews, his blogs and his MPS (Met Police) interviews, until October 2015, allowing Nick to delay any such questioning until January 11, 2016.\u2019\n\n\u2018CREDIBLE AND TRUE\u2019 PRESS CONFERENCE\n\nOn December 18, 2014, DAC Steve Rodhouse decided to stage a now notorious Scotland Yard press conference to appeal for witnesses to come forward. Also at the event was Det Supt Kenny McDonald, who said he believed Nick, as he was known then, to be \u2018credible and true\u2019.\n\nSir Richard states: \u2018I find it an error for two very senior officers who have never met a witness and, in the DAC\u2019s case, not himself read either Nick\u2019s interview or blogs, to announce to the Press and public that they believe the witness.\n\n\u2018The two officers that had spent most time with Nick, namely his interviewing officers, had also not read Nick\u2019s Wiltshire interviews or his blogs.\n\n\u2018In the context of this case, I consider this to be a serious failure. A careful analysis of all the interviews and blogs would have demonstrated that Nick was neither consistent not credible.\n\n\u2018The decision to state that \u201cwe believe Nick\u201d was an error. The use of the words \u201ccredible and true\u201d and the accompanying text was inappropriate, prejudicial to any suspect and misleading to the public.\u2019\n\nBeech wiping a wear a tear as he tells police how he saw his friend 'Scott' run over and killed by the supposed paedophile ring. Scott never existed\n\nThe words \u2018credible and true\u2019 remained in the public domain uncorrected until September 2015. Sir Richard said the error should have been corrected far sooner.\n\nTHE \u2018INDULGENT\u2019 INTERVIEWS\n\nSir Richard stated: \u2018I have been assured by the senior investigating officer that before this investigation commenced, or very shortly thereafter, she had read Nick\u2019s Wiltshire interviews, Nick\u2019s blogs, Nick\u2019s MPS interviews and Nick\u2019s mother\u2019s statement to the Wiltshire Police.\n\n\u2018With very great respect, I am unable to understand how it is possible to positively believe Nick having read this material.\n\n\u2018The interviews of Nick prior to January 11, 2016, were unusually indulgent of Nick, partly by reason of his interviewer being unaware of earlier inconsistent statements and no doubt in an endeavour to avoid Nick disengaging from the process. The final interview, which was less indulgent, exposed much of Nick\u2019s implausibility.\u2019\n\nDISGRACE OF THE SEARCH WARRANTS\n\nIn February 2015, a decision was made to apply for search warrants. Sir Richard said: \u2018The warrants to search the premises of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Mr Proctor were, in my judgment, obtained unlawfully.\n\nIn the video of his police interview, played for the jury in Newcastle, Lord Bramall says: 'Please report to your superiors and say there is no evidence, there is no case to answer. Make it clear I am no longer a suspect'\n\n\u2018The written applications stated that Nick\u2019s account had remained consistent and he is felt to be a credible witness. Nick\u2019s account had not been consistent throughout. The magistrate was misled. He was not told of the Wiltshire interviews or Nick\u2019s blogs.\u2019 In a devastating rebuke, Sir Richard said: \u2018All these undermining factors should have been brought to the attention of the district judge. None of them were.\u2019\n\nTHE NON-EXISTENT VICTIM CALLED FRED\n\nOfficers wasted precious time and resources chasing a hoax \u2013 a victim called Fred.\n\nBeech led the inquiry a merry dance over this for two years. He introduced \u2018Fred\u2019 before Operation Midland was formally launched.\n\nDetectives officially applied for help in tracing the creator of a Swiss email address from which Fred was purportedly contacting Beech. One electronic communication from him had clearly been cut and pasted to fool the inquiry team and as early as October 2014 there were doubts about his existence.\n\nAt Beech\u2019s trial for perverting the course of justice earlier this year, it emerged that he had set up a fake, encrypted email account for Fred.\n\nWHY DIDN\u2019T THEY CHECK HIS COMPUTER?\n\nPolice failed to examine Nick\u2019s computers early in the investigation \u2013 because they thought he would feel threatened. In minutes from September 2015, DCI Diane Tudway felt this \u2018will cause Nick to disengage and does not want to do this too early as it may damage our relationship\u2019.\n\nSir Richard compared the treatment of Nick with those he had falsely accused: \u2018If Nick was genuine and truthful he would surely have no objection to this computer being examined. An objectionable and inappropriate imbalance has prevailed.\n\n\u2018Every piece of paper in the homes of the suspects has been perused and several computers seized whilst no request has been made to examine Nick\u2019s computer, his phone or his journals.\u2019\n\nFARCE OF SEARCHES \u2013 35 YEARS ON\n\nIn November 2015, Met officers carried out hundreds of house-to-house inquiries in central London to try to identify information on suspicious sexual activity that took place at the location around the time of Nick\u2019s allegations in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nSir Richard said: \u2018These steps appear to be bordering on the hysterical and disproportionate having regard to the state of Nick\u2019s credibility.\u2019", "description": "Sir Richard Henriques' report into Operation Midland reveals how the Met described fantasist Carl Beech as 'credible' until 2015 and failed to check his phone and computers.", "authors": ["Stephen Wright For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19315324-0-image-a-34_1570222762029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
