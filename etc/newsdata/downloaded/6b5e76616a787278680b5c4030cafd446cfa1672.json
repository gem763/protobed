(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nMedia columnist\n\nTwitter, we are often rightly reminded, is not real life.\n\nBut after Thursday night\u2019s debate, it seemed to inch closer to reality than what I was hearing in mainstream media.\n\nEspecially when it came to evaluating the performance of former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nFor CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza, Biden was \u201cstrong and presidential,\u201d though not flawless. Barack Obama\u2019s veep was particularly good when it mattered, said the cable network analyst: during the first few minutes of the debate, when the audience was the biggest.\n\nCillizza proclaimed Biden the main winner of the third Democratic debate, a three-hour marathon of mind-numbing bloviation in Houston.\n\nFor Mollie O\u2019Reilly, editor at large of Commonweal magazine \u2014 well, not so much.\n\nLinking to a transcript of Biden\u2019s incomprehensible answer to a question about reparations for slavery from ABC\u2019s Linsey Davis, O\u2019Reilly tweeted: \u201cBiden fans, please, read this. He can\u2019t do it. Your princess is in another castle.\u201d The Q&A link was to Ashley Feinberg of Slate who called it \u201cone of the top ten hardest things I\u2019ve ever tried to transcribe.\u201d\n\nBiden fans, please, read this. He can't do it. Your princess is in another castle. https://t.co/E808TEhxfl \u2014 Mollie W. O'Reilly (@MollieOReilly) September 13, 2019\n\nAnd, truly, the response belongs in some sort of Bizarre Answer Hall of Fame, drifting from an apparently unintended insult to low-income parents (\u201cthey don\u2019t know quite what to do\u201d) to a now-famous mention of record players as parenting tool to, yes, Venezuelan government leadership.\n\nNor was it just the high-profile tweeters with large followings making this point.\n\nMax Coleman, a PhD student in sociology at the University of Indiana, tweeted: \u201cWhen asked what to do about the legacy of slavery, Biden said we should bring social workers into black homes \u2018to help them deal with how to raise their children.\u2019 (!) How is this not disqualifying?\u201d\n\nBut back in the world of mainstream national media, Biden was looking solid.\n\nFrank Bruni at the New York Times had the highest praise for Elizabeth Warren but thought that Biden\u2019s performance would allow him to move on in good form: \u201cNothing on Thursday night broke his stride, such as it is.\u201d\n\nAnd Dan Balz of The Washington Post said Biden had \u201cthe kind of evening he needed.\u201d\n\nHe \u201cdelivered the kind of performance his supporters have been waiting for \u2014 combative when needed and in the thick of the action throughout.\u201d\n\nAnd over at Fox News, pollster and analyst Doug Schoen was effusive: Biden \u201cwas the night\u2019s big winner.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president \u201cexhibited a much-needed display of strength and preparedness,\u201d Schoen wrote. \u201cHe compellingly and convincingly delivered his core message of restoring, protecting and rebuilding the Obama-Biden record.\u201d\n\nMany viewers had moved on by the time Biden did some of his worst blathering.\n\nAs one close family member of mine texted, with more than half of the three hours left to go: \u201cRight on cue, 9:20 and I\u2019m checked out from the debate.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s ridiculous to describe Twitter, in all its ragged glory, as unified. Far from it. And, granted, there was far from complete agreement on Biden\u2019s Big Win even among the highest-profile mainstream sources opining on the biggest platforms:\n\nNate Silver, the data guru and editor of FiveThirtyEight.com, while calling the whole debate a bit of a letdown, offered this on the former vice president:\n\n\u201cAs was the pattern in the previous debate, Biden started out fairly strong and got worse as the night went along, and the evening will probably most be remembered for his rambling answer to a moderator\u2019s question about the legacy of slavery.\u201d\n\nMy theory for why Twitter was so much tougher on Biden than the big-time commentators is simple enough. It\u2019s the difference between caring most about who is winning the horse race, and who actually deserves to.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this: There\u2019s room for more extremes of opinion there, among the multitudes of hot takes.\n\nThe real answer, I suppose, is to have watched the whole debate yourself.\n\nBut that\u2019s an onerous assignment: a piece of homework most Americans are quite sensibly not prepared to take on.\n\nAnd because Biden certainly was not disqualified \u2014 or apparently knocked off his front-runner position \u2014 he lives to fight another day.\n\nAnd another. And another. (There are nine more Democratic debates to go.)\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of time, in other words, to make your own judgment. Or at least decide whom you want to believe.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan", "description": "The former vice president rambled, sometimes nonsensically \u2014 or worse \u2014 but many proclaimed his big win.", "authors": ["Margaret Sullivan", "Media Columnist", "September At Am", "Margaret Sullivan Is The Washington Post S Media Columnist.
