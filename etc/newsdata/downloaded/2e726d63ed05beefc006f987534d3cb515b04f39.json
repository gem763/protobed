Mr Netanyahu was holding a campaign rally at the time and was forced to flee the stage.\n\nStephane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said that any Israeli move to impose its administration over the Palestinian territory would be illegal under international law.\n\n\u201cSuch a prospect would be devastating to the potential of reviving negotiations, regional peace, and the very essence of a two-state solution,\u201d he added.\n\nThe plan sparked fury among Palestinian and Arab leaders, with the Arab League condemning Mr Netanyahu\u2019s remarks as \u201cIsraeli aggression\u201d that, if carried out, amounts to \u201can Israeli declaration for the end of the peace process\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia described the election promise as a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of international law and an \u201cextremely dangerous escalation\u201d.\n\nJordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, echoed Riyadh\u2019s strong condemnation, saying the move would fan the flames of conflict around the region.\n\nTurkey, meanwhile, said the \u201cillegal, unlawful and aggressive\u201d move proved Israel was a \u201cracist apartheid state\u201d.\n\nIt also sparked uproar in the UK. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said Mr Netanyahu was taking the opportunity to \u201ckill all hopes of a two-state solution\u201d while Labour MP Richard Burden urged the British parliament to \u201cstand up\u201d and implement a 2014 resolution to recognise the state of Palestine.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank in the 1967 war and has long said it intends to maintain military control there under any peace agreement with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Jordan Valley stretches from the Dead Sea in the south to the Israeli city of Beit Shean in the north and accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the territory in the occupied West Bank.\n\nOver 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 Israeli settlers are believed to live there.\n\nMr Netanyahu\u2019s map of the areas he wants to annex includes most of the eastern edge of the West Bank with a tiny pocket of land left for the Palestinians, connected only to other Palestinian areas and neighbouring Jordan via thin corridors of land.\n\nHe also hinted he would have the support of US President Donald Trump, who earlier this year controversially recognised Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan, which it captured from Syria during the war in 1967.\n\nThe Palestinians still hope for a future state that would encompass the entire West Bank.\n\nHanan Ashrawi, a leading member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, called the pledge \u201ca declaration of war against the Palestinian people\u2019s rights as well as the very foundations of the international rules-based order\u201d.\n\nA map shared by Mr Netanyahu shows Israeli annexation of Jordan Valley area in blue, while a patch of land and corridors left for the Palestinians are in orange (Handout from Likud Party ) More\n\nSaeb Erekat, the chief negotiator for the Palestinians who lives in the Jordan Valley, said it would amount to a war crime and \u201cbury\u201d any chance of peace.", "description": "The United Nations has blasted Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s promise to annex nearly a third of the occupied West Bank, calling it \u201cdevastating\u201d to peace with the Palestinians, as world leaders warned it would only spark more conflict in the war-torn region.Just a week before elections, Mr Netanyahu pledged to", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nhlGyyY9uJw8K0pTOnmozg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3b6a85ea6ccbecf51580c2b3eb84604c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
