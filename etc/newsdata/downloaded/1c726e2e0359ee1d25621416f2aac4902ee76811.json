Killer John Cannan, 64, (left) is the prime suspect in Ms Lamplugh's disappearance in 1986 and is eligible for release in 2022\n\nHe has already served more than 30 years for kidnapping and murdering Shirley Anne Banks in Bristol in 1986.\n\nCannan was named by police as the prime suspect in the Lamplugh case in November 2002, but prosecutors claimed they never had enough evidence to charge him.\n\nHowever he is believed to have told a former girlfriend that he strangled her and buried her body in concrete.\n\nAnd now he is claiming that police have 'smeared' his reputation by repeatedly linking him to the disappearance of Ms Lamplugh, 25.\n\nCannan was named by police as the prime suspect in the Lamplugh case in November 2002, but prosecutors claimed they never had enough evidence to charge him. Pictured is a field in Worcestershire where police are investigating for Ms Lamplugh's remains\n\nCannan told the Mirror: 'I am concerned that the police will use Suzy's disappearance to undermine my parole prospects. My concern is that smearing me has become the rule not the exception.\n\nMs Lamplugh's brother, Richard, 59, told the Mirror that the family believe Cannan murdered her\n\n'I had no involvement in the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh.'\n\nHowever, Ms Lamplugh's brother, Richard, 59, told the Mirror that the family believe Cannan murdered her.\n\nHe said: 'I don\u2019t know Cannan but I don\u2019t care for him at all.\n\n'He was convicted of the murder of another girl and I\u2019d be happy for him to be kept in prison for as long as they need to.'\n\nCannan was also jailed for the attempted kidnap of Jane Holman in Bristol in 1986 and the rape of a woman in Reading in 1985.\n\nAlthough it has never been proved, he is the leading suspect in a third murder case - that of Sandra Court in Bournemouth three months before Ms Lamplugh disappeared.\n\nMs Court, 29, vanished before her remains were found in the countryside.\n\nLast night retired Det Supt Jim Dickie \u2013 who spent six years investigating Suzy\u2019s abduction \u2013 said: 'If the Parole Board ever release Cannan into the general public again, the consequences of freeing a serial rapist and murderer must be on their heads.'", "description": "John Cannan, 64, has served more than 30 years for a murder in Bristol but claims police 'smeared' his reputation.
