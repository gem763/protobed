Another called the attack \u201ctotally unjustified\u201d and accused the troops of interfering with efforts to aid the injured.\n\n\u201cWe saw masked men dressed all in black and they fired live bullets toward the square. People fell dead and wounded right next to me. We tried to escape but when we fled into the alleys we ran into moving checkpoints set up by these forces. They arrested people and searched their phones for video of what had happened,\u201d a demonstrator said.\n\nSome eyewitnesses said they could not tell if the masked attackers were police, military special forces, or militia fighters linked to Iran. Uniformed Iraqi soldiers positioned around the protest area allegedly withdrew shortly before the masked men attacked. Some accounts said the assault began with a drive-by shooting from unknown assailants.\n\nThe Middle Euphrates Operations Command of the Iraqi army, on the other hand, insisted \u201cthere is no single martyr in Karbala\u201d \u2013 meaning there were no fatalities from the security action \u2013 and the situation in the city is \u201cvery good.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Karbala, Naseef al-Khitaby, also claimed there were no fatalities and denounced viral videos of slain and injured demonstrators as \u201cfabrications.\u201d The governor said he has banned the use of live ammunition by security forces.\n\n\u201cThere are fabricated and false news making the rounds on social media about events that have not happened and casualties that have not occurred,\u201d al-Khitaby said.", "description": "At least 18 protesters are killed in the Iraqi city of Karbala on Tuesday morning by an unknown unit of masked assailants.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/c56602_iraq-protests-27750-anti-government-protesters-light-fires-iraqi-security-e1572383107683-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
