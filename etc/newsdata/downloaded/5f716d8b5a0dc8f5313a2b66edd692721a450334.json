Earlier in the day he resigned from the force, and the police chief said he would have been fired if he hadn\u2019t.\n\nPolice bodycam video showed Dean approaching the door of the home where Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was caring for her 8-year-old nephew early Saturday. He then walked around the side of the house, pushed through a gate into the fenced-off backyard and fired through the glass a split-second after shouting at Jefferson to show her hands.\n\nDean was not heard identifying himself as police on the video, and Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus said there was no sign Dean or the other officer who responded even knocked on the front door.\n\n\u201cNobody looked at this video and said that there\u2019s any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,\u201d Kraus said.\n\nSgt. Chris Daniels read a statement Monday night after Dean\u2019s arrest in which he pledged that the department\u2019s major case and internal affairs units were working \u201caround the clock\u201d for justice in the case.\n\n\u201cTo the citizens and residents of our city: We feel and understand your anger and disappointment and we stand by you as we work together to make Fort Worth a better place for all of us,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Jefferson\u2019s family had demanded that Dean, a member of the force for 1\u00bd years, be fired and arrested.\n\n\u201cWhy this man is not in handcuffs is a source of continued agitation for this family and for this community,\u201d family attorney Lee Merritt said, hours before Dean was booked into jail.\n\nPolice went to Jefferson\u2019s home about 2:25 a.m. after a neighbor called a non-emergency line to report a door ajar. In a statement over the weekend, the department said officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his gun and fired after \u201cperceiving a threat.\u201d\n\nThe video showed Dean shouting, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d and immediately firing.\n\nJefferson was staying up late, playing video games with her nephew, when she was killed, according to the family\u2019s attorney.\n\nAs for what, exactly, led Dean to open fire, the police chief said: \u201cI cannot make sense of why she had to lose her life.\u201d The chief said Dean resigned without talking to internal affairs investigators.\n\nSgt. Chris Daniels read a statement from the department Monday night in which he sought to reassure the public that the department\u2019s major case and internal affairs units were working around the clock for justice in the case.\n\n\u201cTo the citizens and residents of our city: We feel and understand your anger and disappointment and we stand by you as we work together to make Fort Worth a better place for all of us,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nThe video included images of a gun inside a bedroom. Kraus said he did not know whether Jefferson was holding the weapon. But he said the mere fact she had a gun shouldn\u2019t be considered unusual in Texas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re homeowners in Texas,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cMost of us, if we thought we had somebody outside our house that shouldn\u2019t be and we had access to a firearm, we would be acting very similarly to how she was acting.\u201d Kraus said that, in hindsight, releasing the images of the weapon was \u201ca bad thing to do.\u201d\n\nMayor Betsy Price called the gun \u201cirrelevant.\u201d\n\n\u201cAtatiana was in her own home, caring for her 8-year-old nephew. She was a victim,\u201d Price said.\n\nTexas has had a \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d law on the books since 2007 that gives people a stronger legal defense to use deadly force in their homes. The law was backed at the time by the National Rifle Association and is similar to \u201cstand your ground\u201d measures across the U.S. that say a person has no duty to retreat from an intruder.\n\nFort Worth is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) west of Dallas, where another high-profile police shooting occurred last year.\n\nIn that case, white Dallas officer Amber Guyger shot and killed her black neighbor Botham Jean inside his own apartment after Guyger said she mistook his place for her own. Guyger, 31, was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside Jefferson\u2019s home Sunday night for a vigil after demonstrations briefly stopped traffic on Interstate 35. A single bullet hole was visible in the window of the single-story, freshly painted purple home, and floral tributes and stuffed animals piled up in the street.\n\nThe police chief said Dean could face state charges and that he had submitted a case to the FBI to review for possible federal civil rights charges.\n\nDean has not yet hired an attorney but will have one provided with financial support from the state\u2019s largest police union, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, according to Charley Wilkison, executive director.\n\nRelations with the public have been strained after other recent Fort Worth police shootings. In June, the department released footage of officers killing a man who ignored repeated orders to drop his handgun. He was the fourth person Fort Worth police had fired upon in 10 days.\n\nOf the nine officer-involved shootings so far this year in Fort Worth, five targeted African Americans and six resulted in death, according to department data.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the department\u2019s 1,100 officers are white, just over 20% are Hispanic, and about 10% are black. The city of nearly 900,000 people is about 40% white, 35% Hispanic and 19% black.\n\nCalling the shooting \u201ca pivotal moment in our city,\u201d the mayor said she was ordering a top-to-bottom review of the police force and vowed to \u201crebuild a sense of trust within the city and with our police department.\u201d\n\nJefferson was a 2014 graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology. She was working in pharmaceutical equipment sales and was considering going to medical school, according to the family\u2019s lawyer.\n\n___\n\nBleed reported from Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Adam Kealoha Causey in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor the latest updates: https://apnews.com/2dc677322c7f4d1fb7d1b94f119e1806", "description": "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 A white former Fort Worth police officer was being held in jail on a murder charge after shooting a black woman through a window", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/b4f89c_police-shooting-in-home-texas-36984-undated-photo-by-tarrant-county-jail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
