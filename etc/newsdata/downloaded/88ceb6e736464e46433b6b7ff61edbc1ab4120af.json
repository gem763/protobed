The centre will include major changes to the way population growth is predicted and planned for. Treasury's new Centre for Population will also be responsible for collecting data on how many people are migrating to Australia from overseas - taking over from the Home Affairs Department. Population Minister Alan Tudge - who will open the new centre on Friday - told Sky News it would change the way the government plans for the future. \u201cThe Centre for population will aggregate a lot of the different data sets that we already have, we want to have better forecasting capability and have greater transparency for everybody to see, so we can then integrate our population forecast,\u201d he said.
