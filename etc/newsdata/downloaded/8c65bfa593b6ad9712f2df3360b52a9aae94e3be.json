SPX held the remaining shares.\n\nWhen Termico bought that stake at the end of 2006, it was owned by four individuals.\n\nThe empowerment company paid R19.7 million for its shares, the SCA judgment shows, through a loan from the seller SPX.\n\nDespite trouble with the Eskom contracts, DB Technologies appears to have profited handsomely from its work in South Africa, with revenue shooting up from R250 million in 2007 to R2.4 billion by 2012.\n\nThe company paid virtually no dividends, from which the empowerment partners would have benefitted, but R1.26 billion did go to majority owner SPX \"as fees and other charges\", the SCA said.\n\nTermico was locked into its shares for seven years, after which it could sell them back to SPX at a multiple of six times ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) minus net debt. In June 2014 the BEE company tried to exercise that option \u2013 and things got strange.\n\nSPX first tried to argue about which financial year the ebtida numbers should come from, the SCA judgment shows. It then said it was exercising its own option to buy the shares, would not meet with Termico to figure out how much Termico still owed it on the original loan, and claimed Termico had repudiated its contract because Termico would not assist in a BEE evaluation for the company in which Termico no longer considered itself a shareholder.\n\nWhen arbitrators ruled in favour of Termico, and said SPX must pay it around R290 million (minus the outstanding loan), the American company went to court, and won an order that the whole matter must go back to arbitration in front of a new pane, in part on the basis that the value of the outstanding loan had not yet been determined.\n\nBut on Friday the SCA said it was clear that the roughly R20 million loan Termico took out to buy its shares was worth around R32 million by mid-2018. That amount should be deducted from what SPX owes, the court said, so Termico should be paid R256 million plus interest.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "A Supreme Court of Appeal judgment means BEE holding company Termico is due a payout of more than R250 million for its shares in DB Technologies, after years of legal action by American company SPX.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6966/eded67fae65c48569f77b579669993f5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
