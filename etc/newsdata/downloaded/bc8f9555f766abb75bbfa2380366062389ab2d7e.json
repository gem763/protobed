It had my UK Biometric Residence Permit and all my bank cards.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t have much identifying info in there so a good Samaritan got in touch with me via my bank account.\n\n\u2018I thought Simon was a bloody legend. He\u2019s the nicest bloke ever \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising he went above and beyond to get it back to me.\u2019\n\nSoftware engineer Simon said the wallet had already been run over a few times before he managed to pick it up.\n\nHe cycled to Simon\u2019s and got the wallet in the same night he lost it (Picture: Kennedy News and Media) He tried to contact Tim on Facebook, but could not find his account due to the common nature of his name.\n\nAfter considering the \u2018puzzle\u2019 of finding the wallet\u2019s owner, he considered the bank transfers a \u2018long shot\u2019 and was shocked when he got a phone call just an hour later.\n\nSimon said: \u2018When he got in touch I just felt surprise and delight. I was expecting him to eventually but it all happened quite quickly.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018If I lost my wallet in the road I would want someone to do the same. It was also just a bit of a puzzle \u2013 like how do I contact this dude who I have such little information about?\n\n\u2018It was an interesting thing to ponder.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon Byford received a bottle of wine for his trouble (Picture: Kennedy News and Media) Tim shared a picture of the messages sent to his bank account on Twitter, and has since racked up more than 23,000 retweets and 133,000 likes.\n\nHe confirmed to his followers that he had not yet paid Simon back the 4p.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
