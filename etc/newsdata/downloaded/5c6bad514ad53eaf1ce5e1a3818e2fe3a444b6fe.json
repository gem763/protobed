It is untenable that a country can have large numbers of undocumented immigrants and nothing is done about it,\" Bongo said.\n\nThere will be a three-pronged approach.\n\nFirstly, the committee believes that completing the legislative-making process of the Border Management Authority is necessary to safeguard South Africa's borders. A seamless process in and out of the country is but one pillar in curbing illegal immigration.\n\nSecondly, ensuring staff capacity at the Immigration Services Inspectorate should be a priority, as it is currently understaffed.\n\n\"But enforcement must be preceded by properly working application systems that are not prone to inordinate delays,\" Bongo emphasised.\n\nThirdly, the fight against forgery and corruption must be strengthened, by weeding out corrupt elements within Home Affairs. Accepting bribes to circumvent the system will not be tolerated.\n\nIn the last week of August, the committee will have an oversight visit to Gauteng, where it will engage with the Department of Home Affairs and other stakeholders in an attempt to resolve some of the challenges around documenting foreigners.\n\n\"The committee condemns in the strongest terms the attack on law enforcement officials in the City of Johannesburg. Police have an important role to play in securing the safety of all and must not be subjected to such attacks,\" the statement reads.\n\nBongo said the committee also plans to engage with the Portfolio Committee of Small Business Development to ensure that regulations around small business trading are strengthened.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
