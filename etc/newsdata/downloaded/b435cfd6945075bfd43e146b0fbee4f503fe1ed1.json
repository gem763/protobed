The Trump administration in July announced $16 billion to compensate farmers for lost sales due to China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, on top of $12 billion pledged in last year's aid package. The aid program got off to a rocky start with farmers complaining of difficulty signing up and confusion over payment rates. USDA has received 302,397 applications for the program since enrollment opened, Rich said.\n\nU.S. farmers receive $4.07 billion of latest government trade aid", "description": "U.S. farmers receive $4.07 billion of latest government trade aid", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
