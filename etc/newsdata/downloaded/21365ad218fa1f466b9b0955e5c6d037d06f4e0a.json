A miracle of focused observation and precise draughtsmanship, the famous watercolour, which faithfully transcribes the ever-soft filament of the mammal\u2019s fur, was created by pioneering German Renaissance painter, printmaker, and theorist Albrecht D\u00fcrer in 1502. It is now among the highlights of a new exhibition at the Albertina Museum in Vienna devoted to D\u00fcrer\u2019s genius \u2013 an event that marks only the ninth time that the painting has ever been displayed in public.\n\nThe reverberating gleam in the hare\u2019s right eye, according to Christof Metzger, who curated the exhibition of more than 200 paintings, drawings and prints, is actually a reflection from inside D\u00fcrer\u2019s studio, where the work was made \u2013 a magical touch that collapses the distance between observers of the masterpiece today and the bygone world that the artist inhabited half a millennium ago. \u201cIt\u2019s really fascinating,\u201d Metzger explained to BBC Culture about the most popular work in the Albertina Museum\u2019s collection. \u201cThis animal materialises on paper in his workshop, and in the eye of the painted hare you can see his workshop\u2019s window.\u201d\n\nMore like this:\n\n- F\u00e9lix Vallotton: A painter of disquiet and menace\n\n- Picasso: The ultimate painter of war?\n\n- Victor Vasarely: The art that tricks the eyes\n\nHere the hare is free to fidget in the minds of those who encounter it\n\nIs it indeed \u2018the glazing bars from the window in the painter\u2019s studio\u2019, as the accompanying catalogue describes it? That seems to be the scholarly consensus, though the stretched shape of the beguiling glisten is ambiguous, and conjures something more sacred: the tall parallel panes of painted glass that one finds in the high windows of a cathedral\u2019s nave. D\u00fcrer\u2019s decision to erase from the surface of his work any suggestion of the animal\u2019s physical environment keeps its situation (and meaning) remarkably elastic. The shroud-like emptiness that surrounds the portrait transforms the marvel into something as mystical as it is material \u2013 a fiery figment of the imagination; a vision; a prayer.\n\nIn the only other works by D\u00fcrer where hares figure \u2013 a woodcut from six years earlier, entitled The Holy Family with Three Hares (c1497), and an engraving created two years later, Adam and Eve (1504) \u2013 the animal finds itself entangled in overt religious symbolism. But here, the hare is free to fidget in the minds of those who encounter it \u2013 as teasingly evasive in spirit as it is fixed physically in pigment and paper.\n\nMany of his works are really timeless \u2013 Christof Metzger\n\nHow, exactly, D\u00fcrer managed to capture the skittish creature with such painstaking rigour \u2013 without the aid of taxidermy to hold the jittery jumper \u2013 still has bedevilled admirers of the work for centuries. A photographic memory? A steady, stewy diet of jugged hare? \u201cI think with detail studies,\u201d Metzger posits, when asked how he believes D\u00fcrer pulled it off: \u201cstudies of the hare in different positions: sitting, springing, from the side, from the front. Drawings like this are often the basis for his watercolours. He observed the living animal and then maybe when he makes the watercolour, the poor little hare is already in D\u00fcrer\u2019s kitchen. We do not know.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, what we can feel, is the indispensable power of the sublime glimmers that bedew the hare\u2019s eye. Remove those subtle sparkles and the soul of the work would be snuffed out, its magic extinguished. Glimpsed through the gleam of the hare\u2019s intense, almost otherworldly eye, and D\u00fcrer\u2019s other masterworks bristle too with such invigorating details \u2013 seemingly slight chroniclings that are so astute, so meticulous, their truth transports us and makes us feel as if we are seeing the Earth we inhabit for the very first time. \u201cMany of his works, and you can see this in the exhibition, are really timeless \u2013 \u201chis landscapes, his studies of animals, of plants, of persons,\u201d Metzger says. He\u2019s such a brilliant observer of his world, of his context, on the one hand, and on the other hand such a brilliant artist in his ability to fix on paper what he has observed in nature, which is really fascinating and fantastic.\u201d\n\nA master of the natural world\n\nFrequently mentioned in the same breath as Young Hare is D\u00fcrer\u2019s hypnotic study of a dishevelled scrap of seemingly random sward known simply as the Great Piece of Turf, a watercolour accented by pen-and-ink that the artist created the following year. His realistic articulation of every feathery fibre of cocks-foot, every soft serration of germander speedwell leaves, and the weightless sway of a sprawling tuft of Agrostis, or creeping bent, is truly breathtaking. Symphonic in its disorder, the study conjures from chaos a sense of organic rhythm undergirding all of life. What elevates the scene into the strangeness of a great work of art is its surreal suspension of plants to reveal below the soil-line the downward reach of their straggling roots, as if the patch of earth were levitating before us, ascending to heaven.\n\nThe Great Piece of Turf and the Young Hare both belong to the Albertina\u2019s permanent collection, which forms the basis of the exhibition. \u201cWe have a very large and important collection,\u201d Metzger tells BBC Culture, \u201cand for works on paper, maybe the most important collection in the world.\u201d Why now? \u201cWe thought it is time to show D\u00fcrer again after the last exhibition which took place in 2003. It\u2019s always the right moment for an Albrecht D\u00fcrer show.\u201d\n\nTaking flight\n\nThe soaring majesty of uplifting colours is held in cruel check by the spectre of violence that ripped the wing from the bird\u2019s torso\n\nThere is indeed something imperishably poignant and up-to-date about D\u00fcrer\u2019s meticulous scrutiny of the natural world, which is now, in the light of anxieties surrounding climate change, as much a source of unease as wonder. The brutal beauty of his assiduous study Wing of a Blue Roller, a watercolour on vellum probably created a year or two before the Young Hare, is indicative of the artist\u2019s unflinching eye. \u201cThe outspread wing takes up almost the entire surface of a nearly square sheet of parchment,\u201d Metzger writes in the show\u2019s catalogue, \u201cand depicts every detail of its morphology with the highest degree of zoological accuracy: the reddish, cinnamon-coloured back plumage remaining near the tear, the secondary feathers in ultramarine, turquoise, pale green and off-white, as well as the primary feathers ranging in colour from white and azurite to bluish black.\n\n\u201cHe even applied the finest of gold lines to his depiction of the dead animal\u2019s breast plumage in order to imitate its iridescent lustre.\u201d\n\nIn art history, we\u2019re rarely accustomed to seeing such resplendent plumage unless it is flapping spiritually from the shoulders of the Archangel Gabriel in depictions of the moment he informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ, such as Fra Angelico\u2019s celebrated fresco The Annunciation. But in D\u00fcrer\u2019s work, the soaring majesty of uplifting colours is held in cruel check by the spectre of violence that ripped the wing from the bird\u2019s torso, displacing the specimen to a decidedly secular context. Seen in the light of present-day unease about the damage humans are inflicting on the natural world, D\u00fcrer\u2019s watercolour ruffles with prescient profundity.\n\nBorn in Nuremberg in 1471, D\u00fcrer rose to prominence in his 20s as a master of woodcut prints. Following stints studying in Colmar, Strasburg, Frankfurt and Venice (where he honed printmaking techniques), he returned to Nuremberg in 1495 and established his own workshop, where he quickly began to build a formidable reputation. The Albertina exhibition displays many of the finest works that D\u00fcrer created in the ensuing years, from collections around the world, including such masterworks as the Adoration of the Magi (on loan from the Uffizi), Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (from Vienna\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum), and Christ among the Doctors (from the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid).\n\nAre there any surprises? \u201cWe have a very interesting example in the exhibition,\u201d Metzger says, \u201cof a self-portrait as a nude.\u201d He\u2019s referring to a rather unsettling ink-and-whitelead drawing on green paper that shows the naked artist wearing only a hairnet, framed by an abstract field of self-abnegating black. \u201cYou see him from his legs up completely naked. We do not know how D\u00fcrer made this. With only a small mirror he constructed his naked body. His body is absolutely detailed in the way it\u2019s observed and drawn, but it\u2019s fragmented. The arms are missing. The legs are missing. It\u2019s only the torso of his body.\u201d\n\nYet it is the work\u2019s very disjointedness that paradoxically pulls it together into something pulsing and intense. D\u00fcrer\u2019s ability to spin into existence from an almost miserly economy of strokes \u201ca person filled with life whom you can meet on the street 10 minutes later\u201d, as Metzger puts it, is exhilarating. \u201cIn my opinion, the exhibition is really a once-in-a-lifetime possibility. We are really trying to give an impression of his whole cosmos.\u201d Through D\u00fcrer\u2019s fastidious eye we find ourselves transported to another reality \u2013 a world we never knew we knew.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer is at Vienna\u2019s Albertina Museum until 6 January 2020.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
