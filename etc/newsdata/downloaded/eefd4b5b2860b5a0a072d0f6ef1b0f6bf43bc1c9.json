That\u2019s a game changing moment.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOf course, Dwayne \u2013 who returns on tonight\u2019s launch of Friday Night SmackDown in Los Angeles \u2013 wasn\u2019t an instant hit, with his initial debut as Rocky Maivia not quite catching on with fans in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, the rise of his career defining rival \u2018Stone Cold\u2019 Steve Austin \u2013 and Triple H himself \u2013 took time to really take off.\n\n\u2018The funny thing is for a lot of people \u2013 when Rocky Maivia walked through the door, nobody went \u201cOh this guy\u2019s gonna change\u201d \u2013 I mean, maybe some people saw it but a lot of people didn\u2019t go \u201coh this guys gonna change the world and be the biggest movie star ever!\u201d Stone Cold when he walked into the WWE as The Ringmaster, Hunter Hearst Helmsley,\u2019 Levesque pointed out.\n\n\u2018Do you know who it\u2019s going to be? No you don\u2019t, but you do your best to try and figure it out.\n\nHollywood Hulk Hogan and The Rock at Wrestlemania X8 (Picture: George Pimentel/WireImage)\n\n\u2018You didn\u2019t know Rocky Maivia was the guy day one, but a year later you were like, this guy\u2019s got something, right? So, it\u2019s a process but that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u2019\n\nLevesque also took his time to become the legendary and hugely influential star fans know and love today.\n\nHowever, injuries and a focus on his office role shaping the present and future of the industry means The Game has no plans \u2013 or even desire \u2013 to make an in-ring return.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how I would fit it in, and I don\u2019t have the desire right now to fit it in,\u2019 he admitted just months after facing Dave Bautista at WrestleMania 35 in April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But you never know. If the right thing comes along and the company needs it or whatever, then I would entertain the idea.\u2019\n\nInstead, Levesque\u2019s priority is shaping WWE\u2019s future through NXT and PC, and with his work for both Raw and SmackDown.\n\n\u2018People talk about the Attitude Era, they talk about the Ruthless Aggression Era. That new Era is coming. It\u2019s here, it just hasn\u2019t hit yet,\u2019 he promised.\n\n\u2018The landscape of WWE in this week has changed, totally \u2013 and I think that will continue over time. The best refresh and they reimagine themselves and that\u2019s what this company has done year after year after year after year.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mother finds photos of son, 9, in his wrestling singlet on creep\u2019s Instagram page\n\nMORE: WWE star Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson officially announces his retirement from wrestling", "description": "We speak to Triple H about the rise of The Rock and who could be the next wrestling champion.", "authors": ["Alistair Mcgeorge"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88381151_1570205410.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
