We know that we will make some mistakes, so for the next month, if you have time sensitive events, please order a few days earlier than you normally would. \"\n\nRent the Runway didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nPlenty of Rent the Runway consumers have sounded the alarm on Twitter over the last week.\n\nHyman herself has taken up the task of responding to some of the frustrated shoppers.\n\nThe Twitter account of Rent the Runway's support desk has also been inundated.\n\n\"We know that we will make some mistakes, so for the next month, if you have time sensitive events, please order a few days earlier than you normally would,\" Hyman wrote in the email to customers. \"We are sorry, and we own this.\"\n\nRead the full email Hyman sent out to customers here:\n\nWe are committed to always being transparent and giving you the real play-by-play as we grow our business together. Over the last week and into the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our operation.\n\nThese changes will greatly improve your experience by increasing the selection you will have from our Unlimited closet. However, in the short-term as we implement these changes, we know some of you are experiencing delays in shipments and therefore longer response times from our customer service team. Please know that the changes we are making will very quickly lead to more availability of the items you want and the consistent quality of customer experience you deserve.\n\nWe are working around the clock (myself included!) to implement these operational transformations as quickly as possible. Upgrading systems while still running the business at full speed is complex. We know that we will make some mistakes, so for the next month, if you have time sensitive events, please order a few days earlier than you normally would. We are sorry, and we own this. Everything we are doing today is to improve your Rent the Runway membership for the long-term and you should feel this improvement within the next three weeks.\n\nWe are beyond grateful for your commitment to Rent the Runway.", "description": "Rent the Runaway customers are taking to social media to blast the company for delays  CEO Jennifer Hyman", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a63352e22af0ec5211c4c-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
