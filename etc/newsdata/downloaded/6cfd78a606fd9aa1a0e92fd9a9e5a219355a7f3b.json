All at interesting velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\u201d\n\nMr. Dorsey said the decision \u201cisn\u2019t about free expression\u201d and that the company would aim to finalize the policy by Nov. 15. He said the policy will begin to be enforced the next week, on Nov. 22.\n\nBrad Parscale, campaign manager for President Trump\u2019s reelection bid, said in a statement that \u201cTwitter just walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars of potential revenue, a very dumb decision for their stockholders.\n\n\u201cWill Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans? This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known,\u201d he said.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to drop political advertising comes as rival social media company Facebook has faced pressure from critics for taking the opposite approach, keeping political ads and rebuffing demands that they be censored if judged false or hateful.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg discussed his decision in an address on free expression at Georgetown University earlier this month and said he did not believe political ads should be fact-checked.\n\n\u201cI think it would be hard to be biased against both sides, but look, right now we\u2019re doing a very good job of making everyone angry at us,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said at Georgetown earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s because my values on this and our beliefs don\u2019t generally, they don\u2019t hue to what either wing thinks we should be doing.\u201d\n\nHis decision-making relating to political advertising later came under scrutiny from the House Financial Services Committee, during testimony over Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency venture, Libra.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat and committee member, grilled Mr. Zuckerberg over Facebook\u2019s policy on political advertising, which she described as \u201callow[ing] politicians to pay to spread disinformation in 2020 elections and in the future.\u201d\n\nLast week, Facebook also announced new steps it would take to thwart its platform from being used as a weapon to interfere with electoral politics. Among the changes Facebook said it would make was the release of a new security tool to allow monitoring of elected officials and candidates for hacking attempts, labeling state-controlled media as such, more clearly identifying its fact checks, and investing $2 million in media literacy projects.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
