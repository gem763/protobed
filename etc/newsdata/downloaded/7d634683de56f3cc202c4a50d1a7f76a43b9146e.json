The plane was above the Atlantic Ocean at the time.\n\n\u201cFlight DE2116 from Frankfurt to Canc\u00fan on 6 February 2019 diverted to Shannon airport as a precautionary measure due to a minor amount of smoke in the cockpit after a liquid spillage,\u201d a Condor spokesperson released in a statement to CNN.\n\n\u201cAfter the aircraft was fully inspected and repaired by our team of engineers, the flight continued via Manchester due to the legal operating hours of the crew. We have comprehensively investigated this incident and reviewed the procedures of liquids in the cockpit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur crews were reminded of careful handling as well as to use appropriate containers for their water or coffee. We apologise for any inconveniences the diversion might have caused to our guests.\u201d\n\nThe plane was landed safely. None of the 326 passengers and 11 crew members onboard were injured.\n\nSource: CNN", "description": "Condor flight travelling Frankfurt to Canc\u00fan makes e an emergency landing in Ireland after the pilot accidentally spills his coffee.", "authors": ["Louis Hanson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pilot-spills-coffee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
