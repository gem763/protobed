The company will test the gas flow from its second well, with results expected early in the new year.\n\n\"We completed very similar tests on the Preston New Road 1 well a number of months back with excellent results, high-quality natural gas flowing to surface, and we're hoping for a similar if not better result from this current well,\" Cuadrilla CEO Francis Egan said earlier this month.\n\n\"After that we'll decide how we can move forward in bringing this exciting natural gas opportunity in shale forward. The UK will require natural gas for many decades to come ... we're confident Lancashire and Cuadrilla will play, and can play, a part in that.\"\n\nFracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping sand, water and chemicals into wells at high pressure and high volume, creating cracks and releasing gas.\n\nThe process can cause earth tremors, which in Cuadrilla's case triggered a public outcry in 2011 followed by a seven-year legal battle. This resulted in the current system of tight regulatory thresholds.\n\nWith Extinction Rebellion protests entrenched in central London and climate change rapidly climbing up the public's list of concerns, the political backdrop may turn against shale-gas exploration.\n\nThat said, a statement from the British government's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Department in August was relatively positive.\n\n\"Shale gas could be an important new domestic energy source reducing the level of gas imports while delivering broad economic benefits, including through the creation of well-paid, quality jobs. It could also support our transition to net zero emissions by 2050,\" the statement said.\n\nCuadrilla has the right to remain on the site until April 2023, and any bid to resume fracking would require only a request to Lancashire County Council to extend its planning consent, rather than a new application process.", "description": "Campaigners say fracking suspension is the end of the road, but the company is testing gas flow and prodding the regulator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6622%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/34397d990db13ca9e52eb196a6db8b4ad7277874", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
