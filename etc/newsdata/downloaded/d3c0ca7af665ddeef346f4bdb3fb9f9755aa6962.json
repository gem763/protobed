It had jumped 1.3 per cent on Friday as investors grasped at a headline, later denied, that Mr Johnson's Northern Ireland allies may soften their Brexit stance.\n\nBut the currency is also being buffeted by the volatile dollar, which rose late on Monday as oil prices eased and trade tensions with Japan appeared to cool. The greenback inched to a five-day high against a basket of currencies ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week.\n\nAgainst the euro, sterling fell 0.3 per cent to 88.8 pence having firmed on Monday to a three-month high.\n\nCommerzbank advised watching the options markets. Insuring against a steep pound fall still carries a sizeable premium, showing that \"options traders do not exclude a major sterling bang\" they added.\n\nTwo month implied sterling volatility, the contract encompassing the Brexit deadline and a possible general election, ticked up to a one-week high.\n\nIt had risen to over 15 vols in early September before tumbling last week to a 9.3 vols low, and stands now around 10.3 vols. Three-month vols with Dec 17 expiry also remain elevated due to election risk.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [LONDON] Sterling retreated from six-week highs against the dollar on Tuesday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson stuck to his pledge to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct 31, vowing not to seek an extension to the deadline. .
