That was a drop of a little over 1%. Lending had risen $644 million in the second quarter.\n\nJPMorgan was the only big bank that registered a drop in lending. But all four of the nation's biggest lenders, which also included Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, saw loan growth slow. All told, lending at the four banks rose less than one half of one percent in the third quarter. That was down from a 1% increase in the second quarter.\n\nThe loan numbers were reported by the big banks as part of their quarterly earnings announcements to investors. Those announcements were generally better than investors had expected them to be.\n\nEarnings at JPMorgan, for instance, rose 8% from the year-ago period, to just over $9 billion. Bank of America's net income was up 4%, excluding an impairment charge. Those earnings jumps suggest the economy is still plugging along.\n\nYet the lending dip suggests growth is losing speed. Companies tend to increase borrowing when they are looking to expand or are optimistic that they will have more business in the future. Shortly after President Donald Trump was elected, Wall Street analysts predicted that a pickup in lending would lift economic growth. Lending growth did jump initially, but now it is slowing.\n\nCBS News poll: Americans split on the future of the economy\n\nThe slowdown in lending also suggests that the Federal Reserve's recent moves to lower interest rates \u2014which should make lending cheaper and encourage businesses and individuals to borrow and spend more\u2014 might not be providing much of an economic boost.\n\n\"We are seeing a slowing in bank lending, but that's not all that surprising since we already [see] economic growth is slowing,\" Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note this week. \"It's not a positive sign, but not something we didn't know already.\"\n\nMany economists have been waiting for U.S. consumers to up their spending and rescue the economy, since the job market remains strong with unemployment at 50-year lows. But that spending surge doesn't appear to be happening.\n\nInstead, Ashworth noted, retail sales were the weakest they had been in more than six months. Based in part on that trend, he estimates that GDP growth could drop to 1% in the fourth quarter, down from 3% in the first three months of the year.\n\nMany businesses are downgrading their expectations for the economy for the next 12 months, Ashworth said. That was consistent with the slowing loan numbers being reported by the big banks this week.", "description": "Big banks reporting weaker lending even as the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates to stoke economic growth", "authors": ["Stephen Gandel"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/7af54b30-cff0-4115-a9e2-31098028f2ae/thumbnail/1200x630/3d28519195a561e384c30fabfe48926e/satmo1026jpmorgan640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
