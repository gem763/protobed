WSMV, an NBC affiliate, reported that he told his audience it was \u201ca heck of a day not to be in Washington\u201d.\n\nWSMV reporter Nancy Amons was determined not to give him a break.\n\nSaying she would \u201cstart right away with the tough stuff, as you know\u201d, Amons asked about a key issue in the Ukraine scandal: the removal of the US ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was testifying to House members on Friday, and the resignation of Michael McKinley, a close aide to Pompeo.\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, you have some of your facts wrong, so you should be careful about things you assert as facts before you state them,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cBut more importantly, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work that I\u2019ve done along with my team, other senior leaders at the state department, to make sure that this institution was functional, preserved and delivering on behalf of America.\u201d\n\nPressed, Pompeo repeated that he did not talk about personnel matters as \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be appropriate, ma\u2019am, to do that\u201d. He appreciated the question \u201ca great deal\u201d, he said, but would not answer it.\n\nWith Pompeo\u2019s irritation increasingly visible, Amons asked if he had met Rudy Giuliani on a visit to Warsaw this year.\n\nThe former New York mayor is commonly described as Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer although it is not clear what legal work he might do for the president.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry proceeds, Giuliani is under scrutiny regarding extra-governmental efforts to promote conspiracy theories about Ukraine and to persuade President Vlodimyr Zelinskiy to investigate unproven allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden, the son of former vice-president Joe Biden.\n\nTwo Soviet-born associates of Giuliani were arrested this week on campaign finance charges. Giuliani himself is reportedly under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nPompeo chose three times not to answer Amons\u2019 question, instead offering grim-faced variations on a theme: that he went to Warsaw to work on \u201can important mission \u2026 to take down the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d and it was the \u201conly thing I engaged in while I was there\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re not going to say,\u201d Amons said.\n\nShe then asked about text messages between US diplomats, obtained by House Democrats, which show concern that Trump was making the US-Ukraine relationship contingent on help with investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cWere you aware that this was happening?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your facts wrong,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee when you phrase the predicate of a question in that way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and it does a real disservice to the employees and the team at the United States Department of State. Our team was incredibly focused, we wanted a good relationship with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAmons also asked about the situation in Syria, where Trump\u2019s decision to pull US troops away from the border with Turkey has given a green light to an incursion by Turkish forces opposed to Kurdish groups long allied to the US.\n\nRelated: 'We knew this would happen': Kurds in Nashville say Trump betrayed them\n\nCivilian casualties and possible war crimes have been reported. The United Nations said on Sunday 130,000 people have been displaced. Nashville is home to a sizeable Kurdish American community, some of whom told the Guardian this week of their sense of betrayal by the US government. Amons asked the secretary of state what he would say to them.\n\n\u201cSo the United States under President Trump did enormous work to support the Kurds in taking down the [Islamic State] in predominantly Kurdish regions of Syria,\u201d Pompeo said.", "description": "Titans of American journalism Rather and Mitchell join praise of Nancy Amons after Nashville reporter stuns secretary of state  * Opinion: Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump\u2019s real secretary of stateSecretary of state Mike Pompeo.
