The answer continues to be a resounding \"no\" as she further solidifies herself as a multi-hyphenate star, returning to the stage Tuesday night to bring her inclusive lingerie brand Savage X Fenty back to New York Fashion Week with a fabulous show.\n\nRihanna transformed Brooklyn's Barclays Center into her own intimate world, complete with a Grecian-inspired set with white stairs and archways, and brought out some of the biggest stars to the audience and the stage for her second-ever Savage show.\n\nSome of the industry's top models \u2013 Gigi and Bella Hadid, Cara Delevingne, Joan Smalls and Slick Woods \u2013 joined forces with model-dancers of all shapes, ethnicities and sizes and top-notch entertainers \u2013 including Migos, DJ Khaled, Halsey and Normani \u2013 to showcase a colorful variety of bras, underwear, bodysuits and sexy undergarments in the most entertaining way.\n\nAnd the proof is in the performance: If there were any worries about how wearable the lingerie is, all the intense dance moves showed that everything stays right where it's supposed to be no matter how vigorous the movement.\n\nAs if the Victoria's Secret fashion show needed another kick while it's down, the Savage X Fenty show delivered a one-two punch of size inclusivity and diversity to the struggling lingerie brand as it continues to shutter stores and opts to \"rethink\" its own annual show.\n\nThe show, which fans can stream on Amazon Prime Video on Sept. 20, was equal parts runway event, concert and dance party.

(We promise we're grateful, and we're not rushing you on the new music!)\n\nRihanna performs at the Savage X Fenty Show on Tuesday in Brooklyn, N.Y. More\n\nShe didn't return until her final bow at the end of the show, giving the camera and the audience a joyful wave before exiting the stage.\n\nForbes' list: Rihanna tops list of wealthiest female musicians with eye-popping $600 million\n\nA-list celebrities from Diplo to Paris Hilton hit the red carpet\n\nRihanna called on all her famous friends to attend the show.\n\nHalsey, Diplo and Normani made early entrances on the carpet.
