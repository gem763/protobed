The announcement sparked denunciations from world leaders.\n\nFollowing the announcement, a United Nations spokesman said the organization maintains that any Israeli move to control the Palestinian territory \"would be devastating to the potential of reviving negotiations, regional peace and the very essence of a two-state solution.\"\n\nNETANYAHU WHISKED OFFSTAGE AT CAMPAIGN RALLY AFTER ROCKETS FIRED FROM GAZA STRIP\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s Tuesday announcement appeared to be aimed at shoring up the support of right-wing voters, many of whom live in settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nNetanyahu presented the move as a historic \u201cone-time opportunity\u201d to favorably redraw Israel\u2019s borders. The Jordan Valley makes up about a quarter of the West Bank, which is the centerpiece of any future Palestinian state.\n\nWhile the head of the Jordan Valley Regional Council reportedly praised Netanyahu for the campaign pledge, some critics asserted that Netanyahu could have annexed the territory immediately through the cabinet without waiting until after the election, according to The Times of Israel.\n\nOn Wednesday Netanyahu said he had tried to annex the territory last week, but was shot down by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cI want to act on it immediately,\u201d Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video posted to Facebook. \u201cTherefore I wanted to already bring it to the Knesset [The Israeli Parliament] last week, [but] the attorney general said to me, \u2018You can\u2019t because it is a transitional government.'\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said Tuesday if he was reelected he would also move toward annexing West Bank Israeli settlements, but added that he was waiting for the release of the Trump administration\u2019s Mideast peace plan.\n\nThe White House has said the plan is complete but will not be released until at least after the Israeli elections. The plan already is facing rejection by Palestinian officials, who oppose strengthening ties between the U.S. and Israel.\n\n\u201cThe plan to apply sovereignty is not something that we thought about just recently. It was planned for months,\u201d a senior Israeli government official reportedly told The Times of Israel. \u201cBut there were legal issues with doing anything before the elections. The attorney general said it cannot be done now due to legal constraints.\u201d\n\nThe official reportedly added that U.S. officials were \u201cfully informed.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s last-minute pledge to annex the Jordan Valley if reelected next week has sparked Arab condemnation and injected the Palestinians into a political campaign that had almost entirely ignored them.\n\nIn response to Netanyahu\u2019s declaration Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, wrote on Twitter, \u201cKilling all chances for peace for electoral purposes is irresponsible, dangerous.\u201d\n\nCOEXISTENCE IN A 'DANGER' ZONE: AN INSIDE LOOK AT ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS IN THE WEST BANK\n\nThe Jordan Valley makes up the eastern edge of the West Bank. Israel captured the area from Jordan, along with the rest of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 war. It has since established around 30 settlements in the Jordan Valley, which, according to the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem, is now home to some 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 settlers. Palestinians and the international community overwhelmingly consider all Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.\n\nThe Jordan Valley is considered a key security asset for Israel because it provides a buffer zone against potential attacks from the east and assures a defensive line along the country\u2019s long frontier with Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel 25 years ago.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu\u2019s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia also reportedly warned that the prime minister\u2019s promise to extend Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley could escalate tensions.\n\nAccording to The Times of Israel, the Russian foreign ministry said the implementation could lead to a \u201csharp escalation of tensions in the region [and] undermine hopes for the establishment of long-awaited peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to travel Thursday to Sochi to meet with Putin where the leaders will reportedly discuss regional issues. Netanyahu also met with Putin in Moscow days before the April 9 elections, reportedly as a way to garner votes from Israel\u2019s large community of Russian speakers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBefore the elections in April, Netanyahu made a similar promise that he would apply Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank if reelected. Netanyahu failed to form a government in the allotted time frame and instead of allowing another lawmaker to try to form a government, he pushed through a vote to dissolve the Israeli parliament and call for new elections.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bradford Betz, Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly said Wednesday he had planned to declare sovereignty over the Jordan Valley immediately but Israel's attorney general told him he did not have the authority to do so until after he was reelected and able to form a new government.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
