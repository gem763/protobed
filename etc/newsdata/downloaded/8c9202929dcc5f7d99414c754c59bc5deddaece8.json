He\u2019s played the youngsters and I\u2019m pleased to see them in there, with Saka,\u2019 the ex-Arsenal striker told Premier League Productions.\n\n\u2018But Saka, for an 18-year-old, if you\u2019re leaving Ozil totally out of the squad, then we have to see more from him [Saka], we have to see more from Joe.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, it was a game where it passed them both by and then it comes down to the manager and his choices.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s made the change at half-time, with Ceballos, so you\u2019re thinking to yourself: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you start him in the first place?\u201d\n\n\u2018Start him. He\u2019s someone that gets on the ball when they want to try and play out, Guendouzi\u2019s got a lot of energy and get the boys playing.\n\n\u2018[Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang didn\u2019t have anything to play off today because there wasn\u2019t any creativity.\u2019\n\nMousset scored the only goal of the game on Monday night (Picture: Getty)\n\nCeballos did have an impact after replacing Willock at half-time, but the Spaniard wasn\u2019t able to change the scoreline as Arsenal left Bramall Lane empty-handed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked whether Ceballos made a difference, Wright replied: \u2018Yeah, because he wants to try and get on the ball and he doesn\u2019t mind getting on the ball anywhere to try and do his stuff.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a disappointing one simply because Arsenal could have gone third.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the kind of game where they can lay down a marker and they don\u2019t and it\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019\n\nMORE: Unai Emery on why Freddie Ljungberg was shown yellow card during Arsenal defeat", "description": "Ian Wright has hit out at Unai Emery's decision to drop Dani Ceballos to the bench following Arsenal's 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sheffield United.
