It was made public knowledge, in the newspapers, who she was. Why this solicitor is coming to her as Lydia, makes no sense to me. Does he live under a rock?\"\n\n\"I am reliably informed that solicitors who are looking for people normally place an ad in the local paper asking for the whereabouts of someone. Considering Lydia Hart aka Jenny Finn was all over the papers recently because of the buried baby, the world knows her,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"We're supposed to believe that Lydia 'Jenny Finn' Hart... who had no family to speak of was gifted \u00a310K??? Really #Emmerdale?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEmmerdale viewers were disgusted by Mandy's sickening actions - and hope she doesn't get away with it.\n\nTaking to Twitter, one viewer said: \"Mandy makes me sick. the family will never forgive her if she manages to rip off Lydia.\"\n\n\"Mandy pulling a fast 1 with the lawyer in order to get Lydia's inheritance by saying she's Lydia, talk about sinking low, that lawyer looks shifty to me,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Feel for Lydia been undercut by Mandy\"\n\n*Emmerdale airs weekday on ITV at 7pm with an extra episode on Thursdays at 8pm", "description": "Emmerdale viewers were quick to point out a glaring issue when Mandy Dingle pretended to be Lydia Hart", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561794.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Emmerdale-blunder-as-Lydia-Hart-is-left-money-in-a-will-despite-the-REAL-Lydia-dying-and-getting-r.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
