This circus is going to last\u2026seven whole hours. The 2020 Democratic field is going to have their day talking about one of the Left\u2019s favorite subjects. Julian Castro got the ball rolling talking about \u201cenvironmental racism.\u201d He was later asked whether it was \u201cfair\u201d for younger generations to procreate. Yeah, this clown show is going to last seven hours, did I already mention that? The noted anti-Trump network has its rating buoyed by the fact that airports only show CNN, though I think even folks waiting to board their flights will find this to be nauseating. No one cares. It\u2019s another theatrical production from people of the elite class, from urban America, trying to tell the rest of us how to live our lives. It\u2019s one massive ad buy for the Green New Scam, which, like most far-left environmental action items paves way for backdoor socialism under the guise of trying to save Mother Earth.\n\nA retired teacher asked @JulianCastro whether it was \"fair\" to ask future generations to procreate \u2013 he called it the \"cycle of family\" \u2013 due to the current climate situation.\n\n\n\nWe're only in hour one of this *7-HOUR LONG* climate town hall. pic.twitter.com/3EAn37gWSf \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 4, 2019\n\nWell, President Trump wasn\u2019t going to keep quiet for several hours. He took to Twitter to note eight things CNN will bury during tonight\u2019s climate change event, which will surely drive liberals insane. Why? Well, that\u2019s their default reaction to anything Trump says or does. The president merely stated that the U.S. was the nation that saw the largest drop in carbon emissions, China is the largest carbon contributor, and we lead the world in energy production. The Left is staunchly anti-fracking when it comes to natural gas. What better gift to the Russians than to stop our natural gas production\u2026and Trump is the one who is a Russian puppet? But hey, these are their rules.\n\n1. Which country has the largest carbon emission reduction?\n\n\n\nAMERICA!\n\n\n\n2. Who has dumped the most carbon into the air?\n\n\n\nCHINA!\n\n\n\n3. 91% of the world\u2019s population are exposed to air pollution above the World Health Organization\u2019s suggested level.\n\n\n\nNONE ARE IN THE U.S.A.! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\n4. The U.S. now leads the world in energy production...\n\n\n\nBUT...\n\n\n\n5. Who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water?\n\n\n\nAMERICA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\n6. The Democrats\u2019 destructive \u201cenvironmental\u201d proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump.\n\n\n\nDon't the Democrats care about fighting American poverty? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\n7. The badly flawed Paris Climate Agreement protects the polluters, hurts Americans, and cost a fortune. NOT ON MY WATCH!\n\n\n\n8. I want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet \u2013 we\u2019ve now got that! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\nOh, and CNN is projected to emit 57 tons of carbon by just hosting this event.
