Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate election rival Joe Biden for personal gain, the whistleblower alleged, and White House officials tried to cover up the phone call.\n\nNoah said on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d that the complaint is \u201creally bad\u201d for Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s even worse, is that this entire complaint is only nine pages long, which means people might actually read it,\u201d the host said. \u201cHell, if it had a few pictures, Trump himself might even read it.\u201d\n\nNoah contrasted the whistleblower\u2019s brevity with the length of Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to read 500 pages,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could give me the secret to eternal life, but if it\u2019s 500 pages I\u2019ll be like, \u2019I\u2019ll just die, it\u2019s fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatch the full takedown above.", "description": "And it's not what you think, as \"The Daily Show\" comedian pointed out why the Ukraine scandal threatens the president.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8dfc621e0000a203747008.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
