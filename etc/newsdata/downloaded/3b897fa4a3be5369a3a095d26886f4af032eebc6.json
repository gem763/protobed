Sam\u2019s Club, owned by Walmart, introduced free same-day pickup nationwide on orders of 15 items or less. Etsy ETSY, +1.40% has said it would help sellers offer free shipping on orders of $35 or more, in addition to boosting free-shipping items in search results.\n\nBut consumer psychologists say you should think twice before clicking buy, as the \u201cfree shipping\u201d option and instant gratification will make you even more likely to spend.\n\n\u201cNext-day delivery causes shoppers to buy more items, and to buy items more often from the retailers,\u201d said consumer psychologist Bruce Sanders, author of the book \u201cRetailer\u2019s Edge.\u201d\n\nWalmart debuted free two-day shipping on $35-and-up orders in 2017. Competitor Target TGT, -0.77% also offers free two-day shipping at the $35 minimum and announced it would debut $9.99-per-order same-day delivery of 65,000 items. Meanwhile, non-Prime Amazon customers get free regular shipping on eligible items totaling a $25 minimum. (Amazon introduced Prime two-day shipping in 2005.)\n\nWalmart customers must hit a $35 minimum on eligible items in order to receive the free next-day shipping. What if your bill only comes to $30? Sanders said it will encourage you to reach the free-shipping minimum. It may sound counter-intuitive, but spending that extra $5 can make you feel like you\u2019re getting a discount. Shoppers, consumer psychologists say, love anything with the word \u201cfree.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople always like to get things faster,\u201d Peggy Sue Loroz, a consumer psychologist and professor of marketing at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., told MarketWatch. \u201cThey start thinking, \u2018What else can I throw into this basket? Oh, we\u2019re kind of getting low on shampoo. The kids are going to need new socks.\u2019\u201d That list could go on and on.\n\nFree shipping is a big incentive for click-happy consumers. Nearly eight in 10 people cite free shipping as a factor that would make them more likely to shop online, according to the latest Walker Sands Future of Retail Report. And 54% of people under 25 ranked same-day shipping as their top purchase driver.\n\nAnother study by the marketing company Retention Science concluded that people actually choose free shipping over a dollar discount. They may see it as a more lucrative perk, and it makes their online shopping experience more seamless, just like \u201cone-click\u201d shopping.\n\nFree shipping makes online shopping more seamless. And if you change your mind after buying something, that\u2019s no problem, Loroz said. \u201cI can return this to a Walmart store and I don\u2019t have to go through the hassle of trying to return an item by mail. That makes me more likely to do that kind of impulse buying.\u201d\n\nThere may be a downside to buying something that lands on your doorstep the next day, or later the same day. Research suggests that looking forward to the arrival of a purchase can increase enjoyment of that experience. The binge viewing experience has now come to shopping. \u201cIf you do wait a bit for it, you treasure it more \u2014 as long as it\u2019s something distinctive,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nOf course, shoppers are likely to be buying more everyday items like toilet paper or printer cartridges from Walmart \u2014 not exactly luxury or \u201cdistinctive\u201d goods for which they might savor the wait, Sanders says. But believe it or not, impulse or \u201cemotional\u201d shoppers also like to buy essentials as well as luxury goods, according to a study in the Journal of Consumer Research. That includes everything from toilet and bleach to garbage bags and Clorox.\n\nShares of Walmart and Amazon have been up 28% and 17% year-to-date, respectively. That\u2019s compared to a 15% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.65% and 20% increase for the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.40% .\n\n(Quentin Fottrell contributed to this story.)\n\n(This story was originally published May 15, 2019 and updated on Oct. 25, 2019.)", "description": "Amazon says the cost of one-day shipping ate into its third-quarter profits \u2014 it can affect consumers\u2019 finances, too.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan", "Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ622_shippi_ZG_20190515095045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-15"}
