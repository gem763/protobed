Which? found it difficult to use and unhygienic to empty, and it scored just one star for cleaning on carpets, floorboards and laminate flooring.\n\nNext up was a set of headphones made by little-known brand Yineme. Which? said it had an unusually high number of positive reviews and the Amazon\u2019s Choice badge.\n\nBut tests revealed the headphones\u2019 sound to be \u201cexceptionally poor\u201d, making its noise cancellation feature \u201cworthless\u201d.\n\nNatalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, said: \u201cCustomer reviews should be a helpful resource for shoppers choosing what to buy and billions of pounds are spent every year based on this feedback, so it\u2019s vital that Amazon takes stronger action to ensure people can trust the information they see online and aren't duped into buying poor-quality products.\u201d\n\nThe consumer group shared its findings with Amazon, which has since removed the vacuum cleaner and the headphones from sale.\n\nThe company said: \u201cAmazon is relentless in our efforts to protect the integrity of reviews. Any attempt to manipulate customer reviews is strictly prohibited and in the last year alone, we\u2019ve spent over $400m (\u00a3310m) to protect customers from reviews abuse, fraud and other forms of misconduct.\u201d\n\nWhich? had three recommendations for spotting fake reviews: it advised consumers to watch out for large numbers of reviews, especially when many were posted around the same time; to be wary of brands they haven't heard of and to check that the brand has a reputable-looking website; and to check negative reviews, including on a number of sites.", "description": "Amazon is failing to stop a flood of fake glowing reviews for \u201cshoddy\u201d products that risk misleading millions of customers, Which? has found.
