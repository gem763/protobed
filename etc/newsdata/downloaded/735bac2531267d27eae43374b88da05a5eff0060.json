Defense reporters baffled by bizarre glitch on TV screens showing CNN", "language": "en", "text": "Reporters are scratching their heads following an odd tech glitch at the Pentagon, in which the name of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah flashed across TV screens tuned to CNN in the building\u2019s press pen. Nobody\u2019s sure why.\n\nA number of journalists in the Defense Department press corps took to Twitter with alarm on Monday afternoon to share pictures and videos of the mysterious malfunction, some wondering aloud whether the militant group had successfully infiltrated the Pentagon. During the glitch, an image with the word \u201cHezbollah\u201d in all-caps at the top and bottom of the screen, with indecipherable text and graphics in the background.\n\nSo this just popped up on my TV screen as I was watching \u2066@CNN\u2069 ...happened on at least two other screens at the Pentagon. \u2066@ChiefPentSpox\u2069 \u2014is this a Pentagon issue or CNN issue? Did Hezbollah just successfully hack into something? #breakingnewspic.twitter.com/TlUv6I6xug \u2014 Carla Babb (@CarlaBabbVOA) October 7, 2019\n\nLiterally not now, Hezbollah.\n\n\n\n(from the TV in the Pentagon bullpen \ud83d\udc40) pic.twitter.com/1CJ2YUZ6n8 \u2014 Haley Britzky (@halbritz) October 7, 2019\n\nThe glitch appears to have affected more than one TV screen in the building and lasted a few minutes.\n\nSleuths on social media may have already got to the bottom of the mystery, however, with some suggesting the TVs had merely frozen on a promo for the third season of CNN\u2019s \u201cDeclassified,\u201d a docu-drama series about the US intelligence community.\n\nLooks like it was the promo for the next episode of @RepMikeRogers' @CNNOriginals series #DECLASSIFIED got stuck... You should tune in, it's on this Sunday at 9 p.m. on @CNN. Not that I'm biased or anything... \u2014 \ud83d\udc7b Joshua Huminski \ud83d\udc7b (@joshuachuminski) October 7, 2019\n\nNevertheless, the short-lived oddity did not prevent many from declaring the DoD was the victim of a hack.\n\nLike this story?
