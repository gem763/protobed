We welcome the opportunity to engage with the RBA as part of its broad-based, periodic review of the payments industry next year,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAppen slid 4.3 per cent to see shares valued at $22, Altium retreated 1.7 per cent to $33.16, and Xero slipped 1.7 per cent to $68.70.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther technology stocks to take a hit included REA Group \u2013 declining 3.2 per cent to $108.25 \u2013 and Bravura Solutions, which was down 3 per cent to $3.91.\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Wine Estates fell 10.8 per cent on the news that its chief executive Michael Clarke would retire in the 2021 financial year to finish the session at $16.59.\n\nBut it was not all doom and gloom for Australian shares as crucial companies performed well during the trading session.\n\nQantas Airways was one such stock as it defied the slide despite Credit Suisse analysts downgraded to \"neutral\" due to limited evidence for capacity cuts at rivals like Virgin Australia.\n\n\"We think the market is expecting large capacity cuts from Virgin that will be a significant benefit for Qantas. While we believe this is possible: (1) there is limited evidence of this, yet; (2) cuts may be smaller and take longer to materialise than expected,\" they said.\n\nThe analysts did not change their target price for the stock and, nevertheless, Qantas shares rose 0.2 of a percentage point to $6.54.\n\nResource explorer Lynas Corporation was up 2.8 per cent to $2.60 due to a good production update for the September quarter.\n\nProperty developer Stockland, which held its annual shareholder meeting in Sydney on Monday, also rose 6.5 per cent to $4.92 per share as chief executive Mark Steinert lauded a \"solid start to the year\".\n\n\"Our residential communities business recorded its strongest quarterly result this calendar year, finishing moderately above expectations,\" he said.", "description": "The S&P/ASX 200 Index added 2.8 points, or 0.04 of a percentage point, to end Monday's trading session at 6652.2 points.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3367%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1134%2C$y_685/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8584ae83d39ed06c3a6eda6f8cdf5ada1223418e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
