Six other people were wounded in the aftermath, as the attackers fired on an ambulance that arrived at the scene.\n\nAn initial investigation suggested that the massacre came in response to the capture of three Farc dissidents by local indigenous guardsmen.\n\n\u201cClearly, here we have a longstanding threat of drug trafficking groups, and of dissidents, who want to intimidate the population,\u201d Duque told reporters from the nearby town Santander de Quilichao. \u201cI hope to make some important announcements about operational capacity in the region and the capacity we will have to face these threats.\u201d\n\nColombian activists face 'extermination' by criminal gangs Read more\n\nBut his words rang hollow with indigenous leaders across the country who say he has done little to combat threats and attacks that have persisted since the Farc demobilised following a peace accord signed in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe government says the right things, but doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Eduin Marcelo Capaz, the human rights coordinator of a local indigenous council. \u201cDuque will say whatever he has to to cover up his government\u2019s ineffectiveness and disinterest in protecting us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen will the massacre end?\u201d tweeted the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (or Onic), going on to report that 121 indigenous people have been murdered since Duque took office in August last year.\n\nOpposition politicians also lambasted the government\u2019s inaction. \u201cWhat is under way in Colombia is an indigenous genocide, and it will not stop if international justice does not appear,\u201d Senator Gustavo Petro tweeted on Tuesday night, as news of the massacre began to spread.\n\nViolence is a daily reality in the Cauca province, where last month mayoral candidate Karina Garc\u00eda was murdered with three others on the campaign trail ahead of elections that took place last Sunday.\n\nThe violence that marred the election campaign \u2013 six other candidates were murdered nationwide \u2013 reminded Colombians of the political violence of the 1990s and 2000s, when the Farc were at their most powerful.\n\nThe 2016 peace deal was supposed to usher in a new chapter of tranquility, formally ending half a century of civil war that killed 260,000 and forced over 7 million from their homes.\n\nBut while the Farc demobilization removed one faction from Colombia\u2019s war, peace never truly arrived: local conflicts over the drug trade, land rights and mineral resources continue to fuel violence, and social and indigenous leaders are often targets.\n\nAccording to Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman, 486 activists and human rights defenders have been murdered since January 2016, alarming watchdogs.\n\n\u201cThe region where this massacre took place is a first-tier zone for violence, and the defence sector surely knows this but the response to repeated calls for help from indigenous communities has been far from adequate,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank.\n\n\u201cPeople are being left unprotected by their government in an area that is being disputed among several armed and criminal groups,\u201d Isacson added. \u201cColombia must prioritise protecting these communities, working with their leaderships, to prevent another horrible tragedy.\u201d", "description": "Operation aims to route out armed groups in conflict-ridden Cauca province and hunt down gunmen responsible for massacre", "authors": ["Joe Parkin Daniels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7b4e88f48e43e0d68f05db50983110423ef9709/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e0d4a2b86cd655a2ec2d120d1c346ea", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
