But others are moving away from the festivities in order to promote inclusivity.\n\nThe Evanston/Skokie School District 65 in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Ill. is one such example. On Sept. 27, interim superintendents Heidi Wennstrom and Phil Eckhart issued a statement announcing that the district would be \u201cmoving away\u201d from Halloween celebrations.\n\nThe reasons are two-fold. As the statement below, which was provided to Yahoo Lifestyle, explained, Halloween festivities may alienate and exclude students and staffers who may not celebrate for various personal or religious reasons (as the holiday, with both its pagan roots and connection to All Saints\u2019 Day, is seen as too Satanic for some Christians and too Christian for some Muslims and Orthodox Jews). What\u2019s more, District 65 officials claimed, they can have an \u201cunintended negative impact\u201d on those who may not be able to afford costumes.\n\n\u201cAs part of our school and district-wide commitment to equity, we are focused on building community and creating inclusive, welcoming environments for all,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWhile we recognize that Halloween is a fun tradition for many, it is not a holiday that is celebrated by everyone for various reasons and we want to honor that.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware of the range of inequities that are embedded in Halloween celebrations that take place as part of the school day and the unintended negative impact that it can have on some students, families, and staff. As a result, we are moving away from Halloween celebrations that include costumes and similar traditions during the school day. We are confident our school communities will find new and engaging ways to build community within their schools.\n\n\u201cIn District 65, we remain committed to equity and discontinuing current and past practices that are not in alignment with our goals. Our schools are special because of the people who are a part of them and our commitment to serving the educational needs of our students. Many of our schools have already moved away from the traditional Halloween activities during the school day and have scheduled Halloween or other seasonal activities outside of the school day.\u201d\n\nView photos Halloween has become a thorny topic for some schools.

(The school is avoiding the issue this year by closing for a staff development day, according to its calendar.)\n\nMeanwhile, officials at North Country Elementary in Antelope, Calif., told CBS Sacramento that low attendance was to blame for their decision to cancel Halloween events this year in favor of a \u201charvest festival.\u201d In a statement, administrators cited a trend of parents keeping their children home because they don\u2019t celebrate the holiday.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently respected the right of families to choose to have their children participate, or not, in such celebrations,\u201d it read. \u201cHowever, when the number of students choosing to not participate becomes significant, it is incumbent on the school leadership to re-evaluate and determine if the event is truly meeting the social and academic needs of its student population.\u201d\n\nAnd Vermont\u2019s Burlington School District raised concerns about costumes being culturally insensitive, with English Learning director of programs Miriam Ehtesham-Cating telling local news outlet WCAX that \u201cmany people are made uncomfortable by the notion that you change your identity, you turn into someone else and those somebody else' could represent cultural appropriations.\u201d Other schools have pointed to safety issues and a focus on \u201ceducational time,\u201d prompting many parents to express frustration with the lack of Halloween spirit. Online, critics have bashed it as a symptom of \u201cPC\u201d culture.", "description": "A parent opens up about why she's keeping her kid home on Halloween \u2014 while others are hitting out at claims that Halloween events aren't inclusive.", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L8wLdksHd18z._4qmcSaCQ--~B/aD0yNDYwO3c9MzQwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9cffcdc0-f5d5-11e9-bcbf-22dc1b7e73a9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
