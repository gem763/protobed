He pointed to the LSE's share price after the announcement - just more than \u00a371 and well below the \u00a383.61 offer price - a sign that investors don't expect the deal to get over the line.\n\nHe said political considerations would be \"front and centre\".\n\n\"The UK government may not wish to see such a vital symbol of UK financial services strength, and indeed a strategic asset, to be owned by foreigners,\" he said. \"Effectively it would hand it over to the Chinese through the Hong Kong back door.\"\n\nOne of the conditions of the offer from Hong Kong is that the LSE scraps its proposed \u00a322bn deal to buy data firm Refinitiv from its current owners, which include Thomson Reuters and private equity house Blackstone.\n\nBut in its statement, the LSE said it \"remains committed to and continues to make good progress\" with the deal.\n\nIn 2017, EU regulators blocked a proposed \u00a321bn merger between the LSE and Germany's Deutsche Boerse.\n\nThe European Commission said the deal would have created a \"de facto monopoly\" for certain financial services.", "description": "The surprise move from the owner of Hong Kong's main share market threatens the LSE's own bid plans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10D21/production/_98979886_lsereuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
