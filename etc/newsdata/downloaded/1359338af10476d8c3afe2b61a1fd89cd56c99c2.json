That really was Serge Gnabry, the former Arsenal man who could not get a game on loan at West Bromwich Albion four years ago, and he really did score four second half goals against last season\u2019s Champions League finalists.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere was a time when Spurs took the lead, although by the end that part of the evening felt like it belonged to a different team in a different era as the game wound down and Bayern seemed to score with every attack. The collapse was shocking at first and then as the scoreline slipped into the absurd this ceased to be a serious performance from the home team \u2013 rather it was a collapse, a bad joke repeating itself in on Pochettino in a nightmarish loop.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t fix anything by shouting,\u201d he said later, \u201cnot when the emotion is here, on the skin\u201d. The first 30 minutes he said had been the best of the season, and there was much in it that was promising but also a wild element that, looking back, hinted at what was to come. Spurs had first half chances, two for Heung-Min Son who then scored with his third, and another for Tanguy Ndombele, and then when the collapse came it did so in a wave cutting through Spurs\u2019 midfield and defence until it seemed they had stopped functioning altogether.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Spurs manager takes his team to Brighton on Saturday unsure what they will deliver, although this was an evening when you could choose to read much into the list of unresolved problems that they face. The contract impasse that hangs over Jan Vertonghen, very much not the equal of Robert Lewandowski who scored two. The same might be said of Toby Alderweireld, flat-footed against the pace of Gnabry, and another part of this team that looked past his best.\n\nMan-of-the-match Gnabry slots home his third in a demolition job at Tottenham Credit: Action Images\n\nGnabry is a very different player to the young man whose potential was never fully realised under Arsene Wenger, although as the humiliation heaped up for Spurs this felt like some vengeance on timer-delay from the old Frenchman. This quality of Gnabry\u2019s pace and finishing were not in doubt on this golden evening for him, but it did not take much cutting in from the left on his right foot to make the Spurs defence look distinctly mediocre.\n\nChristian Eriksen, so crucial last season, was a second half substitute in this game, on the pitch in time to see Bayern strike three times in the final ten minutes of the match and unable to change the outcome. This Spurs team built by Pochettino has reacted to adversity in the past and in doing so conjured implausible victories, but those were different times when the competing agendas of certain individuals, as their manager might say, did not feel quite so fundamental.\n\nLast season\u2019s run to the final started without a single point from their opening two group games and two wins over Red Star Belgrade in their next two matches could change their fortunes again. How many times can they continue to walk this fine line between success and catastrophe is very much open to question. They are capable of scoring important goals, and even when Harry Kane\u2019s penalty brought this game back to 4-2, there seemed a degree of hope for them. It is just that in their current guise, Spurs are so unpredictable.\n\nNorth London is RED!!! pic.twitter.com/1Te5YjqpWo \u2014 Serge Gnabry (@SergeGnabry) October 1, 2019\n\nAs with last Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup third round elimination on penalties to Colchester United, the other theme of the night was that when Pochettino\u2019s side fail, they do so spectacularly. They went in at half-time behind to two brilliant goals from Bayern, two finishes that turned half chances into goals of the kind that an opposition struggle to get out their heads for the rest of the game. Even so, it felt like Spurs had generally had the best of the first half.\n\nNdombele had some of his best moments in a Spurs shirt with two fine passes to Son and then there were other moments of his that made you wince: a careless booking, a misplaced cross, a goalscoring chance that went begging. The same might be said of Serge Aurier, a great attacking option for Spurs on the right wing and then fortunate to avoid a red card when he tried to leap David Alaba and ended up studding him with both boots.\n\nSon scored the first on 12 minutes, connecting with Moussa Sissoko\u2019s pass. Joshua Kimmich\u2019s equaliser was magnificent: one touch with his right to control the ball, another to send Sissoko in the wrong direction and a third to sweep it past Hugo Lloris. Just before half-time, Lewandowski doubled back on his right foot and struck a shot out of Lloris\u2019 reach.\n\nPochettino, for once, looked at a loss as to what to do tactically to change things around Credit: Action Images\n\nThe pair of Gnary goals in the first ten minutes of the second half exposed the lack of pace in the Spurs\u2019 defence. For the first Aurier gave up his pursuit and then Gnabry cut in and struck with his stronger right foot with Alderweireld unable to get close. Gnabry rolled his second in off the post with his weaker left foot after Sissoko had sold Harry Winks a questionable pass, and Thiago Alcantara, on for Alaba at half-time, pinched the ball away.\n\nKane scored a penalty given for Kingsley Coman\u2019s foul on Danny Rose that Bayern\u2019s players keenly contested with referee Clement Turpin. An hour played and at 4-2 Spurs were still in the game. But in those last ten minutes they looked extremely tired. Thiago spotted the potential for a ball over the high line and suddenly it seemed as if Bayern could not miss.\n\nGnabry was given space to complete his hat-trick and then claim a fourth, while between those two goals, Lewandowski finished first time from a Philippe Coutinho pass. This was chaos, and Pochettino\u2019s explanation of frustration among his players affecting the last few minutes rang hollow. It was bigger than that. At the final whistle Bayern were still hunting for more.\n\n10:24PM\n\nPochettino speaks\n\n\"It's hard to accept this kind of result. Every touch they had went in, we are upset and disappointed, we need to stay tough and stay strong. Bayern were very clinical and we need to move on. \"We need to believe in ourselves, that is the only way we can move on.\"\n\n9:55PM\n\nConfirmation of that sorry stat\n\n7 - Tottenham Hotspur have conceded seven goals in a home match for the very first time in any major competition.

As the half went on they looked the more composed and with his first real chance of the half Lewandowski gave the Germans the lead.\n\n8:47PM\n\nGOAL! Tottenham 1-2 Bayern Munich\n\nCoutinho is fouled by Ndombele and the Tottenham man sees a yellow card thrust in his face.\n\nFrom the resulting free-kick - on the edge of the area - Lewandowski fires at the wall and wins a corner.\n\nFrom that set-piece Bayern win a throw-in.\n\nAND the sustained pressure ends up with a late first-half goal. There's a bit of pinball in the area - and the Pole shows all his predatory instincts and fires right into the corner leaving Loris no chance.\n\n8:41PM\n\n39 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nBit more control about Bayern at the moment - although they look vulnerable to Tottenham counter attacks - they are getting to omuch time and space on the ball and the hosts cannot let this continue.\n\nAs I typed that Bayern once again get into a good position wide on the left and Gnabry forces Loris into another save.\n\n8:39PM\n\n36 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nDele finally gets in behind the Bayern backline and he tries to play in Kane, but Sule intervenes. Will not be shocked if another goal comes before the break.\n\n8:36PM\n\n33 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nAfter half an hour the one thing that is clear is that both sides are finding a lot of time and space out wide and getting in behind their opponents. Tottenham's diamond in midfield is inviting Bayern to switch play, which they are doing time and again.\n\n8:34PM\n\n30 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nBayern had a five vs four in the final third but they cannot make it count - Sissoko doing his defensive job well - as they pondered a bit too much on the ball.\n\n8:31PM\n\nNot a long-lasting lead\n\n194 - There were just 194 seconds between Son Heung-Min's opener for Tottenham Hotspur and Joshua Kimmich equalising for Bayern Munich.

Kane is dropping in and there is room for Dele to get in behind.\n\n8:28PM\n\n25 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nGood football from Tottenham. Kane in the middle plays in Sissoko wide on the right. He gets his head up, spots Ndombele's run into the area and the midfielder should have scored. He fires at Neuer who makes the save. Great signs for the hosts in the final third - but that should have been two for Tottenham.\n\n8:26PM\n\nSon's strike\n\nWe've shown you Kimmich's goal so here's a pic of Son's opener to even things out...\n\nSon scores the opener against Bayern Credit: Getty Images\n\n8:23PM\n\n19 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nThis match is raining shots - great for us watching but you suspect the two coaches will be feeling a bit agitated.\n\nLoris is the keeper made to work this time, as a corner finds its way to Coutinho who, with acres of space, fires in a strike from 25 yards.\n\n8:21PM\n\nWhat a strike\n\nJoshua Kimmich \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nWhat a finish! pic.twitter.com/RfdkDhsAeD\n\n\n\n\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 1, 2019\n\n8:20PM\n\n15 mins: Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nNearly anther goal.\n\nBayern play a very (as in very, very) high line, Dele finds Kane who then finds Neuer in no-man's land. The Tottenham striker rounds the keeper before his shot is cleared while goal bound.\n\nFair to say this is an open game...\n\n8:18PM\n\nGOAL! Tottenham 1-1 Bayern Munich\n\nBrilliant goal!\n\nTottenham's lead lasts all of two minutes. After a Bayern attack the ball comes back to Kimmich 25 yards out, he has lots of time and space to come back onto his right foot and fires past Loris into the corner.\n\nGreat strike but Spurs didn't go with the Bayern runners and Kimmich had way too much time on the ball.\n\n8:15PM\n\nGOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Bayern Munich\n\nThird time lucky for Son!\n\nTottenham press Bayern high up the pitch and they give the ball to Sissoko who plays in Son on the righthand side of the box and he makes no mistake hitting the ball into the far corner.\n\nThe Korean has got in behind the Bayern backline three times now and the visitors need to keep track of his movement.\n\n8:12PM\n\n9 mins: Tottenham 0-0 Bayern Munich\n\nThat combination again - Ndombele plays in Son and the Korean tries to pass the ball into the back of the net from the lefthand side of the area.

The big news is that Hernandez, the club's most expensive signing, misses out with a knee injury.\n\n7:07PM\n\nTottenham team announced\n\nStill no place in the starting XI for Christian Eriksen...and Lucas Moura, who some had tipped to start, is also on the bench. Spurs begin with a front three of Kane, Son and Dele who is without a goal since the spring, how Pochettino would love to see him find those scoring boots again tonight.\n\n6:56PM\n\nA Champions League rarity - a rare match-up\n\nSince the birth and subsequent expansion of the Champions League classic match-ups between big European clubs can be as regular as some domestic rivalries. Remember the late 1990s when Manchester United seemed to play Juventus and Bayern all the time? And Bayern v Real Madrid is another match that seems to have been played more times than I care to remember over the years.\n\nThis clash is, however, (and thankfully) different. HURRAH!\n\nTottenham haven't played Bayern since 1983, and have only faced each other four times in total - Bayern winning twice, Spurs once, with one draw.\n\nThat 1983 two-legged Uefa Cup tie ended with the north Londoners going though 2-1 on aggregate.\n\n6:53PM\n\nGood evening football fans\n\nIf you, like me, can sometimes find the Champions League group stages somewhat predictable, dull and on the verge of soporific (exhibit A - see Group C, Manchester City's pool) this is a match that should beat any ambivalence about pre-Christmas European matches out of you.\n\nContinental aristocrats, Bayern Munich, away at last season's beaten finalists, Tottenham Hotspur, at Europe's finest new arena in a match that should conjure up goals and one that both will be keen to win (for different reasons, more of that later...) - if that doesn't tickle your footballing fancy well, I guess, there is just no pleasing some.\n\nTottenham's mini crisis - the type of crisis (sixth in the Premier League with two defeats this term) lots of clubs would be only too happy to endure - is still, on the balance of things, ongoing. There have been signs on the pitch of strife off it, but a 2-1 win against Southampton at the weekend, having played most of the match with 10 men, was just what Mauricio Pochettino's side needed. If that victory is a signal of changing fortunes, then three points against Bayern tonight would be a statement that Tottenham are over the worst of their early-season troubles.\n\nTottenham got back to winning ways with a 2-1 victory at home to Southampton on Saturday Credit: Getty Images\n\nAside from their less-than-glittering start to the domestic season, the north London side also have their mini-Greek tragedy (apologies for probably going OTT with that description) to get over. Having been 2-0 up and coasting at Olympiakos two weeks ago they ended up drawing 2-2. Last season Tottenham started sluggishly in Europe and they will be only too keen to avoid yet another poor opening to their Champions League campaign this time around.\n\nTheir German opponents start every season as one of the favourites for this competition. Which, when you consider they haven't won it since 2011, means every year for the past five or so they have another season of disappointment to try reverse.
