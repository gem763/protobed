The guy hates losing and will try to buy them all.\u201d\n\nOh, boy! Better buy up all the bitcoin before Xi snaps it all up!\n\nChina's crypto conundrum\n\nThe notion that China is buying up all the Bitcoin is fairly ludicrous. Yes, much of the world's bitcoin mining is done in the country, so there is and has always been a local, vested interest. And yes, a Chinese court recently ruled that Bitcoin is private property and enjoys the same legal protection as any other asset.\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, the regime has sought to crack down on those mining farms, and last year summarily banned Bitcoin trading altogether. Simultaneously it has been developing its own cryptocurrency, a stablecoin tied to the renminbi, for the better part of two years.\n\nBitcoin is a competitor. China will do what it has always done since the mid 20th Century: It will build its own crypto currency. Indeed it has said as much. Wake up, sheeple!\n\n\u201cChina isn\u2019t going to suddenly become friendly to bitcoin,\u201d Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, told Decrypt. \u201cThey\u2019ve been getting more hostile lately.\u201d\n\nTrading places\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that Bitcoin traders might have become excited by Xi\u2019s announcement. The pump took place around 1pm UTC, just as traders in Asia began to awaken. And Chinese investor Dovey Wan pointed out on Twitter that searches for \u201cblockchain\u201d on WeChat, the immensely popular Chinese messaging app, spiked by several orders of magnitude prior to the rally. Could Xi\u2019s sort-of vote of confidence for blockchain technology sent traders into a bullish frenzy?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably traders reacting to it to some degree,\u201d speculated Carter. \u201cBut the size of the move was shocking. We\u2019d need something cataclysmic to explain a move that significant.\u201d\n\nRemember that Xi never explicitly mentioned Bitcoin\u2014he mentioned only \u201cblockchain.\u201d His regime has long been exploring the technology as a better way to surveil its citizens, not as a way for the masses to buy Oxy, or offshore their money.\n\nCarter reckons the pump was due to a minor fund liquidating\u2014or newly joining the thinly traded bitcoin market\u2014causing a brief influx of money that would have triggered the wider rally. And over on derivatives exchange BitMEX, scores of short-sellers\u2014traders betting against bitcoin \u2014did indeed have their positions liquidated. That means they had to scramble to cover their bets, which drove up the price of BTC.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is China actually planning to \u201cbuy all the Bitcoin?\u201d Let\u2019s not keep falling for the same malarkey.", "authors": ["Ben Munster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NgDPT889R8bkWDeOOVDOgA--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/dd09981da4b43405c37d3ea8ecfb49b5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
