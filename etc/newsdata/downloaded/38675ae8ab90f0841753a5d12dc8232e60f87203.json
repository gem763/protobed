According to Mobile Police, the victims ranged in age from 15 to 18-years-old. Five of the victims were in critical condition when taken to the hospital, but none of them had life-threatening injuries, WKRG-TV reported.\n\nA person at the LeFlore High School vs. Williamson High School football game recorded the moment the gunman fired rounds.\n\nThis is just horrific to watch from Ladd-Peebles Stadium.

The children\u2019s reactions are heartbreaking to watch. \u2014 Simone Eli (@SimoneEli_TV) August 31, 2019\n\nMobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste and the Mobile Police Department have long advocated for teen violence prevention in the city.\n\n\u201cWhy are the young people bringing this type of violence to public events. They\u2019re bringing their beefs that they have with each other in their neighborhoods and they\u2019re putting other people in harm\u2019s way,\" Battiste said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be more aggressive on our end, the city, as to how we hold the individual accountable when they go before the courts. We have got to make sure they understand that we will not tolerate juvenile violence in our community.\"\n\nMobile County Public School System Director of Communication Rena Philips released the following statement:\n\nIt is sad that something like this happened at a high school football game, where our athletes were having a good game on the field. We do not know all of the details as this is a Mobile Police investigation, so we will have to refer all further questions to the MPD.\n\nPolice arrested 17-year-old Deangelo Parnell in connection with the shooting. He is being charged with nine counts of attempted murder, WKRG-TV reported.", "description": "So sad..09/02/2019 3:06:45AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/243/80d8da02-a8e5-4796-a858-a8047a99e806.jpg"}
