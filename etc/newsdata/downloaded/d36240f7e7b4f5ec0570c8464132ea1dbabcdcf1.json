On Wednesday, Obama \u2014 a frequent visitor to the valley \u2014 will sit down with Splunk Inc. SPLK, +1.03% Chief Executive Doug Merritt to discuss responsible practices around data use as part of a day-long conference held at the software company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll ask Mr. Obama about the Importance of data management and decision making,\u201d Merritt told MarketWatch in a phone interview Monday. \u201cHe was the first federal official to go hard on open data and apply CIO [chief information officer] functions across government to make informed decisions.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who has submitted 20 questions to the former president\u2019s handlers for review, did not include any about the federal government\u2019s ongoing investigation of four of tech\u2019s biggest players: Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -0.68% GOOG, -0.67% Google, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.71%, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.53%, and Facebook Inc. FB, -0.52%. Merritt said he made the decision because Obama has shown restraint in commenting on the current administration.\n\nInvestigations by the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission into the information-gathering habits and business practices of Big Tech are a central theme of Splunk\u2019s data-management event, the first of its kind for the company. Splunk is holding its event to highlight the topic in general and give the public a better understanding of what it does. The San Francisco-based company, on pace to ring up $2.3 billion in revenue this year, has a separate developers conference in Las Vegas in October.\n\nThe antitrust suspects: Facebook and Apple appear to be most at risk\n\nLast week, members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the behavior and market power of the companies, publicly demanded documents including personal emails from CEOs Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Larry Page of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Tech companies have also been an issue in the president campaign, with candidates including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., actively campaigning against those same companies.\n\nMerritt declined to disclose how much his company is paying Obama to appear, but joked, \u201cShockingly, he was not the most expensive option.\u201d\n\nThe coincidental appearances of Trump and Obama, the result of a quirk in schedules, underscores the importance of the region to the national economy and culture. Michelle Obama is scheduled to talk at Dropbox Inc. DBX, +1.69% next week. The former first lady is scheduled to discuss work-life balance at the company\u2019s \u201cWork In Progress\u201d event.\n\nThe political star power descending on Silicon Valley highlights a slew of software conferences coming to San Francisco, and Splunk\u2019s bid to create some buzz of its own. Oracle Corp.\u2019s ORCL, -1.13% OpenWorld is this week, ahead of Dropbox\u2019s event next week, and Salesforce.com Inc.\u2019s CRM, +0.02% annual Dreamforce event is scheduled for November.", "description": "Former President Barack Obama and President Donald J.
