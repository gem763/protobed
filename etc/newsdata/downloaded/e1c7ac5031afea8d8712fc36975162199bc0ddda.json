Some districts, such as Xicheng, have developed apps to to help residents find parking spaces.\n\nThe local transport authority also said by the end of this year, the electronic toll on both sides of the capital's roadway will be fully covered, including suburbs and the Yizhuang Economic-Technological Development Area.", "description": "Beijing will unveil detailed guidance on shared parking to make it more convenient for residents to locate parking spots as the supply of parking spots decreases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9f17b8a310cf3e97a08044.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
