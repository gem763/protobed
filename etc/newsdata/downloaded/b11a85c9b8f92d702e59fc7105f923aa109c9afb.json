It's not good,\" customer Juan Hernandez told local TV station KOAT. \"We need to have respect for others and have limits.\"\n\nGARDEN DENIES IT'S FUNDING TRUMP'S 2020 REELECTION AFTER BOYCOTT TWEET GOES VIRAL\n\nUniversity of New Mexico professor Patricia Perea said \u201cnormalizing\u201d the terms, which also include phrases like \u201cFake News,\u201d is dangerous.\n\n\"It seems fun, it seems like you can make fun of this and maybe make it lighthearted, but you really can't, you're offending a whole community,\" Perea said. \"It's normalizing the terms and potentially turning them into funny or humorous terms, and the more that you do that, the more likely people are to repeat them and perhaps forget the contexts in which they were said.\"\n\nNEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT OWNER OFFERS FREE MEAL TO PEOPLE EVACUATING HURRICANE DORIAN\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s owner Hanif Mohamed, who is an immigrant, said the terms on the menu are all in fun. If anything, he said, he hopes it sparks conversation.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the people who walk in, more than 99 percent, don't seem to have an issue with it,\" Mohamed told the station. \"The menu's not designed to insult people or hurt people, but it's just meant to keep the conversation going as to what's happening around us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNot everyone, however, thinks the restaurant\u2019s name choices for menu items are offensive.\n\n\"To me it's not offensive,\" said Christy Garcia. \"I just think it's interesting that they decided to be so bold with the names.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
