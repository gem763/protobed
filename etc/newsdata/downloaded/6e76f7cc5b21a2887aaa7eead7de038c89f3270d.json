What we\u2019ve done is dishonorable and weak, letting Turkey essentially dictate U.S. policy in Syria towards an American ally. It\u2019s also difficult for him to understand why Pence and Pompeo weren\u2019t sent to Turkey after Erdogan first told Trump on the phone that he was prepared to invade. They might have prevented an incursion altogether instead of negotiating a ceasefire after the fact. I think that one\u2019s actually easy to answer: Trump called Erdogan\u2019s bluff. He\u2019s threatened before to push the Kurds off the Syrian border and Trump didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d follow through. It turned out he wasn\u2019t bluffing this time.\n\nThe most noteworthy bit comes at the end, when Romney calls on the Senate to hold public hearings about how the administration behaved here. I think there might have been a chance of that if no deal had been reached today in Ankara between Erdogan and Pence. As it is, Senate Republicans are going to hold their breaths, hope that the ceasefire sticks, and try to put all of this behind them.\n\nWATCH: Full speech: Sen. Romney condemns President Trump\u2019s handling of the Turkish invasion of Syria: \u201cAre we so weak and so inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America?

He referred at one point to Turkey \u201ccleaning out\u201d the border area of terrorists, an unfortunate choice of words when critics are accusing the U.S. of complicity in the de facto ethnic cleansing of Kurds under Pence\u2019s deal:\n\nReferring to Kurds living along Turkish border in Syria, Trump says of Turkey, \"they had to have it cleaned out.\" pic.twitter.com/W8J7IFctO3 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cWe got exactly what we wanted out of the meeting,\u201d said one Turkish official of the negotiations with Pence and Pompeo. The leader of Kurdish forces in Syria says he\u2019s willing to give the deal a try, though:\n\nMazloum Abdi tells Ronahi TV that the extent of the cease-fire stretches 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the town of Tal Abyad to Ras al-Ayn. That appeared to conflict with Turkey\u2019s insistence that its \u201csafe zone\u201d from which Kurdish forces must be removed should stretch the entire length of the border from the Euphrates River to Iraq. \u201cWe will do whatever we can for the success of the ceasefire agreement,\u201d Mazloum said Thursday, describing it as a \u201ctentative agreement.\u201d\n\nWhy are the Kurds suddenly willing to \u201cclean\u201d themselves out of the territory Turkey wants? It\u2019s not that they fear the Turkish military; if that were the case they would have withdrawn years ago rather than risk an offensive from Erdogan. Some experts think the Kurds have calculated that there won\u2019t be a real solution to this crisis until Erdogan consults with the true superpower in the region in the Trump era \u2014 Russia. Putin is set to meet Erdogan five days from now in Sochi to discuss the fate of northern Syria. A five-day ceasefire negotiated by the U.S. is useful to the Kurds in pausing Turkish operations until then. Hopefully Putin can cajole/threaten the Sultan into leaving the area with assurances that Russia will fill the void left by the Americans. If he can\u2019t or won\u2019t, the ceasefire will end and the Turks and Kurds can get back at it. There may be a limit to how far Turkey can advance anyway: With Russian and Syrian troops now in the area, a renewed offensive might turn into a multinational free-for-all, which would be messy for Turkey.\n\nThat is, maybe Erdogan banked today\u2019s ceasefire in the expectation that he\u2019d have to cease fire soon regardless, if only at Russia\u2019s behest. Might as well sign a deal with Pence and get the United States to commit to Turkey\u2019s position that the Kurds don\u2019t belong in the parts of Syria that Erdogan wants under Turkish rule.\n\nYour exit quotation:", "description": "\"We once abandoned a red line.
