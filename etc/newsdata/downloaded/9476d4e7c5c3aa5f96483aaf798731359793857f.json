Some of them said they were sodomised by their teachers,\u201d Sabo stated.\n\nPolice had been tipped off by complaints from local residents who became suspicious of what was happening inside the school.\n\nDuring the raid on the school, police said they found a \u201ctorture chamber\u201d where students were chained, hung and beaten.\n\n\u2018Severe punishment\u2019\n\nOne inmate quoted by Nigerian media described horrific conditions and treatment at the facility.\n\n\u201cI have spent three months here with chains on my legs,\u201d Bello Hamza said, adding that he was meant to be in South Africa studying for his Master\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cThis is supposed to be an Islamic centre, but trying to run away from here attracts severe punishment; they tie people and hang them to the ceiling for that.\u201d\n\nPictures published in several newspapers showed an alleged victim with scars on his back and another chained up by his foot to a metal railing.\n\nSabo said the victims were of different nationalities and that \u201ctwo of them said during interrogation they were brought by their parents from Burkina Faso\u201d.\n\nThe identities of the rescued victims were being documented to determine where they came from and to contact their families.\n\nParents of some of the victims from within the city, contacted by police were \u201cshocked and horrified\u201d when they saw the condition of their children, as they had no idea what was happening inside the school.\n\nParents were allowed to visit their children every three months, but only in select areas of the premises.\n\n\u201cThey were not allowed into the house to see what was happening\u2026 the children are only brought to them outside to meet them,\u201d Sabo said.\n\n\u201cAll they thought was their children are being taught the Koran and good manners as they looked subdued,\u201d he added.\n\nPrivate Islamic schools are common in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria, where government services are often lacking.", "description": "(AFP) -- Police in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna have rescued more than 300 male students from an Islamic school where many had been tortured and sexually abused, a police spokesman said Friday.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/koran-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
