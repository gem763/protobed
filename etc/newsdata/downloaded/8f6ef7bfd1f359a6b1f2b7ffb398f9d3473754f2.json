But it\u2019s not new. Apartment doors, shop fronts, flower boxes, benches and lamp-posts have been covered in tags for weeks. Months even.\n\nAlong the boulevard to the landmark Place de la R\u00e9publique \u2013 looking shabby despite a \u00a320m facelift six years ago \u2013 the homeless dozed in doorways or on benches, sleeping bags pulled over their heads. The pavements were littered with abandoned electric scooters and bicycles, and punctuated by dog mess and cigarette ends. A man walking west opened a new packet of cigarettes and threw the cellophane and silver paper on the ground.\n\nThe city of light and of romance has become a dirty old town, or as locals have nicknamed it, Paris poubelle (dustbin Paris).\n\nOn Saturday, World Cleanup Day, Parisians were urged to pick up the mess they and visitors have made. \u201cParis is definitely getting dirtier. It\u2019s filthy everywhere. The city needs an aggressive policy to make the streets cleaner and safer,\u201d said Matthew Fraser, professor of communications at the American University of Paris, who has lived in the city for the best part of 30 years.\n\n\u201cParis thrives on its own moral chaos. Nothing is organised, everything is urban anarchy. I don\u2019t think Parisians notice it, because it\u2019s their chaotic energy. But if you\u2019re from the outside, or from another culture, the city is a mess.\u201d\n\nParisians like nothing better than to grumble and today, the state of the city is the No 1 complaint. Next March, they will vote for a new mayor and propret\u00e9 (cleanliness) will be high on their agenda as the city gears up for the 2024 summer Olympics.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, centre, has made efforts to clean up the city\u2019s image, but still faces criticism.

Her rivals are Benjamin Griveaux, the former spokesman for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist LREM party and the prize-winning mathematician C\u00e9dric Villani, also a member of the current government, who launched his campaign last Thursday.\n\nHidalgo, also president of the C40 Cities climate group, is popular with many Parisians \u2013 especially those that do not have a car \u2013 for her grand schemes to discourage vehicle use and tackle pollution by pedestrianising large swaths of Paris and digging up streets to create cycle lanes. But even her fans admit that rubbish is a growing problem.\n\nCity Hall spends \u20ac550m a year to get rid of the estimated 16 tonnes of dog dirt produced each day by the city\u2019s 200,000 pets, 350 tonnes of cigarette ends, and empty 30,000 bins. And still the Paris poubelle nickname sticks. In 2016, Japanese tour operators and Japan Airlines became so worried about their compatriots being put off that they began spending weekends clearing the famous Trocad\u00e9ro gardens of cigarette ends, beer cans and other detritus.\n\nRuth Grosrichard, a professor of Arab languages and civilisation, lives just north of Boulevard Saint-Martin, in the 10th arrondissement near the run-down Gare du Nord, one of the city\u2019s busiest stations and home of the Eurostar terminus.\n\nIt is one of the most densely populated areas of an already crowded city; with almost 54,400 people per square mile, Paris is the most densely populated city in Europe. Manchester, which is a comparable size, has an average of 12,200 per sq mile. The northern district\u2019s problems are compounded by a steady influx of migrants who, for want of homes, have set up encampments in the area.\n\nGrosrichard, a campaigner with two community action groups, says for years the authorities have pushed the city\u2019s problems \u2013 drugs, migrant camps, homelessness \u2013 away from the chic arrondissements to poorer districts in the north-east, creating a clear divide either side of the Seine.\n\nThe French are used to the state taking care of all their needs. They feel little obligation to take responsibility for their own actions Matthew Fraser\n\n\u201cI take a metro from the northern district where I live to the southern district where I work and it\u2019s like two different countries,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of indiscipline and incivility and the trouble is degradation attracts more degradation, dirt more dirt. We need proposals to break the vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nThe city has introduced \u201cincivility brigades\u201d, uniformed personnel with the power to fine people for leaving electric scooters or bikes on pavements (or for riding pavements on them), for dropping litter and for failing to clear up dog mess. But a poll of people on Boulevard Saint-Martin reported no sightings of them.\n\nGosrichard said: \u201cI have never seen a single incivility brigade in our area. Not one. We keep asking city hall where they are, but we\u2019ve never seen any. They spend millions on cleaning the city and it\u2019s dirtier than ever before. We can\u2019t let things go on as they are, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019ve travelled to many other cities in Europe and elsewhere and Paris is definitely the dirtiest.\u201d\n\nFraser believes the problems stem more from culture than cleanliness, accusing Parisians of lacking \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d. \u201cThe French are used to the state taking care of all their needs, they feel little obligation to take responsibility for their own actions and their consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cTry not picking up after your pet dog in a park in London or New York, you will get scolded by someone. In Paris, people don\u2019t even flinch.\u201d", "description": "The French capital, despite efforts to deal with litter, graffiti and dog mess, is grubbier than ever", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a13af09987016659f77421643f5305fdcf164382/0_164_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c9310d98441df12796c15924ed45c2f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
