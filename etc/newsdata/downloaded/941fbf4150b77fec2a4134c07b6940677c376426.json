It is being led by Elsheikh\u2019s mother who went to court in London to stop his extradition to the US, and to prevent the British government sharing evidence with the US, if the death penalty is not ruled out.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Wednesday evening that the two men had been transferred to US custody because the Turkish invasion into northeastern Syria threatened their continued detention by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nTurkish troops advance into Syria as Trump washes his hands of the Kurds Read more\n\nUK and US officials refused to comment on the report but in remarks earlier on Wednesday, Donald Trump said: \u201cWe have taken a certain number of Isis fighters that are particularly bad, and we\u2019ve wanted to make sure that nothing happened with them with respect to getting out.\u201d\n\nTrump said he had talked to Boris Johnson on the subject of Isis prisoners, but did not say whether he was referring to Kotey and Elsheikh.\n\nEarlier this month, a cross-party group of MPs and peers who visited the region last month warned that Trump\u2019s green light to a Turkish invasion \u201crisks global security\u201d because it could allow Isis members to escape and regroup.\n\nMeanwhile, women and children in the largest Islamic State detention centre in Kurdish-controlled Syria are expecting to be freed in the wake of a Turkish assault on the area, according to people inside the camp.\n\nAl-Hawl, home to about 60,000 women and children with links to Isis and 10,000 displaced civilians, has been tense since Donald Trump announced US troops would leave the area at the weekend, paving the way for the Turkish attack on Wednesday.\n\nRadicalised women, including some who have been accused of killing other prisoners they say are not adhering to Isis\u2019s strict ideology, believe Isis sleeper cells in the area will attack the Kurdish guards and free those inside in the next two days, a woman who has been held alongside them said via WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cThey know the Turkish campaign has begun,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAfter living in this horrible place for months they are ready to take this opportunity to break out.\u201d\n\nAbout 90,000 men, women and children from Isis\u2019 former \u201ccaliphate\u201d are currently in the custody of the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Their fate was thrown into question by Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw the 1,000 US special forces in the area, effectively removing the buffer that has stopped Turkey attacking the SDF.\n\nInside al-Hawl camp, the incubator for Islamic State's resurgence Read more\n\nIn rambling remarks on Isis detainees, the US president railed against European countries for not taking custody of their own nationals who had been caught in Isis ranks.\n\n\u201cI gave them one chance, I gave them another chance, I gave them a third chance and even gave them a fourth chance. They didn\u2019t want to take them back,\u201d Trump complained. He argued that if European governments had complied with his request they would not be facing the risk of escaped Isis fighters returning to their homelands.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go. They want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn\u2019t want them from us,\u201d the president said.\n\nEuropean officials insist that Trump\u2019s response to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s request for acquiescence in his planned offensive might have been based, at least in part, on a misunderstanding of the status of the Isis prisoner issue.\n\nAt the time the Turkish offensive began, the US, France, Germany and other European countries whose nationals had joined Isis had been exploring ways of prosecuting Isis fighters in the region, most likely in Iraq. It was officially called the \u201cregional prosecution pathway\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe never expected the US to take them back on to US soil, and we definitely did not want them taken to Guantanamo,\u201d a European official said, expressing surprise at the president\u2019s remarks, as the Europeans and the US had been in constant and continuing discussions about the fate of the Isis captives.\n\nThe official said the reason European fighters were not being taken back by their own countries was not about cost, but about the difficulties of prosecuting them.\n\n\u201cIt is a question of due process,\u201d the official said. \u201cCourts at home would throw out cases of detainees captured on the battlefield.\u201d", "description": "Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh are accused of involvement in beheadings", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan", "Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b844165fdf509c07276c2b733d8b63f4e15919ff/0_5_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39ab0f621b4e15b53c39ef46c49dc7da", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
