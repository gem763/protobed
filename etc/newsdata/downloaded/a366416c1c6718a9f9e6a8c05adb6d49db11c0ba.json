It is served here with lingonberry preserves cut with vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, and made velvet with butter. The dish goes beautifully with boiled potatoes. In Sweden, you\u2019d use golden syrup to caramelize the cabbage, but molasses works just as well. The Swedish chef Magnus Nilsson told me the result is no less Nordic for the substitution. \u201cCabbage smells in a very special way when it almost burns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets savory, almost like a beef stock. It tastes almost brown and umami yummy.\u201d You\u2019ll want to eat it right away, but the leftovers make for a fine sandwich in coming days.\n\nFeatured in: A Caramelized Cabbage Casserole To Get You To Spring.", "description": "This is a Swedish version of a dish with roots in the Ottoman Empire, an infidel\u2019s version of Turkish dolmas, made not with lamb and grape leaves but with ground pork and beef cloaked with deeply caramelized cabbage It is served here with lingonberry preserves cut with vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, and made velvet with butter The dish goes beautifully with boiled potatoes", "authors": ["Sam Sifton", "Eric N.
