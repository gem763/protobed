It continued to stymie opponents in the second half, even if it finally gave up some points.\n\n\u201cThe second half we just went out there and tried to put the game away,\u201d Mahone said. \u201cIt was a close game, but the second half we knew we had to finish and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nBachmeier threw for 263 yards and two touchdowns, Mahone rushed for a pair of scores in the fourth quarter, and Boise State pulled away in the second half for a 30-19 win over Air Force on Friday night.\n\nBachmeier\u2019s arm made up for a Broncos\u2019 running game that was ineffective until the fourth quarter. He hit CT Thomas on a 36-yard touchdown pass in the first half while getting crunched by a defender, and added a 28-yard TD toss to tight end John Bates late in the third quarter to give the Broncos a 17-13 lead.\n\nMahone added a pair of 10-yard TD runs in the fourth as the Broncos (4-0, 1-0 Mountain West) won their 20th straight conference opener.\n\nBachmeier was 19 of 26 passing in another impressive performance by the freshman in just his fourth start.\n\n\u201cHe came back in the second half even better. He\u2019s a strong kid back there in the pocket. He took a couple of licks, but he gets right back up,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nAir Force quarterback Donald Hammond III had an 8-yard touchdown run in the first half and threw a 31-yard TD to Geraud Sanders late in the fourth quarter. Taven Birdow led Air Force (2-1, 0-1) with 67 yards rushing, but the second-best rushing attack in the country was held to 242 yards, more than 100 yards under its season average.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a really, really good team,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said.\n\nBachmeier also got help from his receivers, who made terrific catches. Thomas, who had a career-high 119 yards receiving, made a diving 29-yard catch to set up Eric Sachse\u2019s 40-yard field goal in the first half. John Hightower made a juggling reception surrounded by two defenders on a key third-down in the fourth quarter, and Mahone scored on a 10-yard TD run on the next play to give the Broncos a 23-13 lead.\n\n\u201cWe knew coming into the game Air Force does a great job being physical,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cOur mindset was we had to compete for the ball, every ball that comes our way.\u201d\n\nTied 10-10 at halftime, Hammond spent the start of the second half in the injury tent while Isaiah Sanders took over at quarterback. Sanders led the Falcons to a 32-yard field goal by Jake Koehnke midway through the third. It was the first second-half points allowed this season by the Broncos.\n\nBachmeier responded with his best drive of the night, taking the Broncos 77 yards in 11 plays, capped with the TD pass to Bates. The biggest play of the drive was Bachmeier\u2019s 13-yard strike to Akilian Bulter on fourth-and-10 at the Air Force 38. Two plays later, Bates was in the end zone and Boise State was ahead for good.\n\nAir Force was stopped on fourth-and-1 at the Boise State 48 on the next possession and the Broncos answered with the first of Mahone\u2019s TD runs.\n\nPROTECTING THE FRESHMAN\n\nBachmeier had been hit a lot through the first three games, and continued to get battered in the first half. He was sacked only once in the first half, but took a handful of big hits as protection broke down. His willingness to take a hit, though, can lead to big plays, like the Broncos\u2019 first touchdown. Bachmeier allowed Thomas to develop his route and hit the speedy receiver on a 36-yard touchdown to give the Broncos a 10-7 lead.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sign of a good quarterback. \u2026 When you play that position you\u2019re going to get hit differently, but you\u2019re going to get hit if you\u2019re going to stand and deliver it sometimes and those guys have to be able to do that and not flinch and he seems to be able to do that,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.\n\nFINALLY\n\nKoehnke\u2019s field goal with 6:29 left in the third quarter was the first points scored against Boise State\u2019s defense in the second half this season. The Broncos held Florida State, Marshall and Portland State scoreless in the final 30 minutes of the first three games. Boise State went 98 minutes, 31 seconds of combined second-half action before allowing points.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAir Force: The Falcons were unable to keep the momentum from last week\u2019s upset win at Colorado and still have not beaten a ranked team on the road since winning at California in 2002.\n\nBoise State: It\u2019s a result of facing a run-first team, but Boise State nose tackle Sonatane Lui set a career-high with 16 tackles. Lui had eight combined tackles through the first three games. \u2026 Pass rusher Curtis Weaver didn\u2019t have a sack after having four last week against Portland State.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAir Force: The Falcons return home to host San Jose State next Friday.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos have an open weekend and next play at UNLV on Oct. 5.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hank Bachmeier's arm and poise carried No. 20 Boise State until Robert Mahone took over in the fourth quarter.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/air_force_boise_st_football_67864_c0-137-3277-2047_s1770x1032.jpg?b9e5f66eecc0bb9133ee649cf57fcef2f5fbd2a2", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
