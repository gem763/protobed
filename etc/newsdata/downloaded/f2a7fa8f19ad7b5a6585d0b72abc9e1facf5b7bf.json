Grow Old With Me was one of the last songs written by John Lennon, with the original only emerging four years after his death.\n\nStarr covers it with help from McCartney, who plays bass, and Jack Douglas, whose string arrangement contains a line from George Harrison\u2019s Here Comes The Sun.\n\nYou do, admittedly, have to listen hard to hear Harrison\u2019s familiar melodic refrain, but it is in there, giving the album its nostalgic centrepiece.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a publicity stunt,\u2019 Ringo insists. \u2018It\u2019s what I wanted. So, in a way, it\u2019s the four of us on there.\u2019 His vocal range is limited, but the song is a tenderly sung highlight.\n\nIt\u2019s his 20th solo effort \u2014 eight more than he recorded with The Beatles \u2014 and has the contented air of a drummer who has settled into an easy late-life groove. The Beatles are pictured above in the summer of 1966\n\nThere\u2019s another nod to The Beatles too, although a fresh take on Barrett Strong\u2019s Money (That\u2019s What I Want) is less auspicious.\n\nThe song was covered on With The Beatles in 1963, with John supplying a rasping lead vocal. This version is smothered in auto-tune in a bid to sound modern, and the result is hideous.\n\nMostly, though, Ringo carries on in the good-hearted spirit that powered him through 2015\u2019s Postcards From Paradise and 2017\u2019s Give More Love.\n\nAs well as Macca, Walsh and Lukather, he\u2019s joined by Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart, Texan rocker Edgar Winter and keyboardist Benmont Tench. It\u2019s an A-List session team \u2014 and it shows.\n\nThe songs \u2014 funky rockers and freewheeling West Coast pop \u2014 have the feel of superior bar-room jams, with the awkward reggae excursions of Starr\u2019s two previous albums consigned to history.\n\nThe drums are laid-back, even jazzy, underpinning the songs without being flashy.\n\nBack in the days of Beatlemania, the drummer was well known for his quirky turn of phrase.\n\nHe came up with the expression A Hard Day\u2019s Night and there are more classic Ringo-isms here: Send Love Spread Peace is one; Gotta Get Up To Get Down is another, though the latter certainly owes a little to James Brown.\n\nRingo\u2019s lightweight rock \u2019n\u2019 roll can be predictable.\n\nThank God For Music is throwaway and Send Love Spread Peace mawkish. But the sense that the drummer and his famous friends are genuinely having fun is infectious.\n\n\u2018Recording at home has been good for me,\u2019 he says. It\u2019s hard to argue.\n\nJames Blunt flirted with arena rock on 2010\u2019s Some Kind Of Trouble and dabbled in electronica two years ago on The Afterlove.\n\nThe former army officer\u2019s sixth album sees him return to the confessional acoustic fare of Back To Bedlam, his all-conquering debut.\n\nThat was the record that made him a star and gave us You\u2019re Beautiful, a single that topped charts on both sides of the Atlantic before sparking a backlash that led to it beating Mr. Blobby and The Birdie Song to be voted the most irritating song of all time.\n\nBut there was always more to Blunt, 45, than first met the eye. Beneath its sentimentality, You\u2019re Beautiful was a dark ballad about obsessive unrequited love for a stranger.\n\nThe former army officer\u2019s sixth album sees him return to the confessional acoustic fare of Back To Bedlam, his all-conquering debut\n\nAnd any critical barbs were certainly put into perspective by the singer\u2019s experiences with the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo.\n\nThe back-to-basics approach he takes on Once Upon A Mind has its formulaic moments.\n\nHalfway is a stock, mid-tempo strum-along and The Truth a euphoric, Balearic-style dance track. 5 Miles offers proof of his place as a skilful craftsman rather than a deeply emotive songwriter.\n\nBut life\u2019s slings and arrows, alongside the joys of new parenthood, have had a profound impact, resulting in some of his most revealing songs since Back To Bedlam.\n\nThe best is the poignant Monsters, a plangent piano piece about his seriously ill father that deploys his fragile falsetto voice to superb effect.\n\nHe examines his own mortality on Stop The Clock and advises his two young sons to live life to the full \u2014 with the obligatory touch of melancholy \u2014 on I Told You.\n\nAmid the introspection, he also delivers some inescapable ear-worms and, on How It Feels To Be Alive, an epic that sounds like his audition for a Bond Theme.\n\nBoth albums are out today. James Blunt starts a tour on February 14 at Arena Birmingham (ticketmaster.co.uk).", "description": "ADRIAN THRILLS: Made in the Californian home studio he affectionately calls 'the smallest club in town', Ringo's latest album reinforces his status as an affable elder statesman.", "authors": ["Adrian Thrills For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20150490-0-image-a-19_1571946920200.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
