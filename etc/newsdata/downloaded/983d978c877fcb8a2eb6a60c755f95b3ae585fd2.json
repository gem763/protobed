In the end, the people we bought (the home) off were very open, they even left us a nice present.\u201d\n\nThe couple were helped by keeping a strict saving plan. \u201cI lived with my parents to save on rent until I was 29, so that gave me a good deposit to start with.\u201d\n\nInfinity Group money mentor Graeme Holm said Millennials were often discovering simple lifestyle changes could rapidly improve their ownership prospects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that young buyers are (locked) out the market, but once you get a budget and stick to it\u2019s a lot easier,\u201d Mr Holm said. \u201cWe live in a society of instant gratification and even simple lifestyle changes make a difference.\u201d\n\nING head of retail banking Melanie Evans said the main challenge for home buyers was coming up with a 20 per cent deposit, but those who took a flexible approach would get ahead.\n\n\u201cWhile many millennial Aussies believe home ownership is a far off dream, our research found the reality of owning a home is far closer than they think,\u201d Ms Evans said.\n\n\u201cYou just need to be willing to make small sacrifices in the first instance to save for that deposit, and compromise on the type of home you\u2019re willing to take on to kick off your home ownership journey.\u201d", "description": "Three years after Millennials were hammered in smashed avo-gate, Gen Y has proved what many thought was impossible and revealed their views of the housing market don\u2019t match reality.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12000028/capi_e0b19b59ead0efbac996e28e6d934549_00e32c68c9c16c7cb551637f5cb467f1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
