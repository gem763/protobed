When he was in the cage, MacDonald thought he was ahead on the scorecards. If he had done a few things differently, MacDonald indicated things would have ended more favorably.\n\n\u201cWell, I felt I had good moments,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cIt was close every single round. What I feel I should have done is put the gas on a little more. I felt like when I had good moments, I backed off, let him recover and I just gave too much leeway. Instead of having that foot on the gas pedal a little earlier.\n\n\u201cI felt comfortable with where I was in the fight. I felt confident \u2013 maybe more confident than I should have been in the scoring. The rounds just got away from me. Every round was tight though. I\u2019m not too down about it, just obviously wish I could have done a little more during the fight.\u201d\n\nDespite online jeers from some fans about newly enthused religious beliefs, MacDonald said he\u2019ll continue to put his faith in God going forward. If it wasn\u2019t for finding Christianity, MacDonald said trying times like his Bellator 232 loss would be much harder.\n\n\u201cI think they have a bad perspective on it,\u201d MacDonald said of the criticism. \u201cI feel like Jesus has made my life rich and changed my life around completely from a dark place to a place of joy (and) peace. Now I have purpose and fulfillment in my heart. So I just don\u2019t think they are looking at the right perspective.\n\n\u201cMost times after a loss, I probably wouldn\u2019t be talking with you. But, I\u2019m blessed and I know God has good things in store for me. Losing one fight doesn\u2019t change my faith or perspective on God. I know he has good plans for me and like my song says, I\u2019m going to see a victory no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe Bellator 232 headliner was the second meeting between Lima and MacDonald. The two squared off at Bellator 192 in January 2018. After five rounds, MacDonald was declared the winner by unanimous decision.\n\nWith the lifetime series tied one to one, MacDonald believes it\u2019s inevitable the two welterweights will meet again in the near future. But first, MacDonald needs to re-up with Bellator, as he revealed his contract with the promotion has expired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely (we rematch),\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cWe had to close fights. He won one, I won one. It\u2019s kind of inevitable that we\u2019ll probably fight again\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say no. If they want to do it, they can do it. First I\u2019ve got to re-sign. My contract expired. We\u2019ve got to deal with that situation. Obviously if they want to give a title shot, sure.\u201d\n\nBellator 232 took place Saturday at the Mohegan Sun Arena.
