Colas calls this the \u201cbirth of the Fed put.\u201d\n\nLost decade of 2000-2010: Stocks barely moved after big gains in the prior decade.\n\nThe fifth addition to this list, according to Colas, is the negative or ultra-low interest rate landscape.\n\nYahoo Finance More\n\nThere is roughly $17 trillion worth of negative yielding sovereign bonds across the globe. That means investors pay money to own the bond vs. the other way around. Falling bond yields mean bond prices are rising, a signal of increased demand for bonds. Bonds generally are in higher demand during uncertain economic times, since they are perceived as less risky than stocks. Lately, investors have been worried about slowing global economic growth, partly driven by trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nYields on the 10-year German bund stand at -0.66%, while the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) stands at 1.483%, slightly above its record low in July 2016 of roughly 1.37%.\n\nLike the aforementioned historical examples, Colas is trying to figure out what negative/low rates means for the markets over the next several years.\n\n\u201c[This] could be as large a mispricing as the dot com/housing bubble,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s assume for a moment that the U.S. and China do come to a trade agreement in the next 6-12 months and the global economy does not fall into recession. Will German 10-years still sport a negative yield? Doubtful. Back in October 2018 they paid 0.50%, for example.\u201d\n\nColas is confident the U.S. 10-year yield will not be trading at its current level in 12 months from now.\n\n\u201cA year from now we\u2019ll look back on September 2019 and wonder how markets could have either been so fretful or so complacent about 2020\u2019s economic conditions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur optimistic nature means we believe the former sentiment will prevail, but we understand the bearish argument as well.\u201d\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
