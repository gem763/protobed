On Sunday, demonstrators shouted at police who had cordoned off city streets, and authorities closed down a main subway station near the U.S. consulate as protesters swelled in number.\n\nEarly in the evening, cardboard boxes and displaced road fencing were set on fire in front of an entrance to the station. At other entrances, windows were smashed and protesters threw rocks.\n\nThe weekend of demonstrations signals that recent moves by the government\u2014including withdrawing a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China for trial\u2014have failed to pacify the city\u2019s protest movement. That bill sparked the unrest, now in its 14th weekend.\n\nSunday\u2019s demonstration was intended to call on the U.S. to act to protect Hong Kong and support the protest movement. The day\u2019s march began with organizers playing the U.S. national anthem as many waved large American and British-colonial flags. Later in the afternoon, chants of \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d could be heard.\n\nOrganizers and marchers specifically urged Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would impose penalties on Hong Kong or Chinese officials who suppress basic freedoms in the city.\n\nJoe Lau, 36, was at the rally with his wife and wore a Trump 2020 hat while holding an American flag. He said Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, needed to do more to protect the territory\u2019s autonomy and said he wanted to see universal suffrage in the city.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she is willing to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think the U.S. government has the ability to force the Hong Kong government to do that.\u201d\n\nMany protesters have carried American or British flags during recent marches in a bid to draw international support for their cause, and many have been bolstered by lawmakers and others in Washington who have voiced support for the pro-democracy movement.\n\nA a fire at an entrance to the Central subway station.

President Trump initially described Hong Kong as an internal matter for China, though he later warned Chinese President Xi Jinping that a violent reaction to the protests could threaten a trade deal.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly said that Hong Kong is an internal affair and has demanded that U.S. lawmakers \u201cmind your own business\u201d when it comes to matters concerning the semiautonomous city.\n\nChinese officials have also accused the U.S. of involvement in the protest movement. In one photo widely circulated by Chinese state media outlets, a U.S. consular official in Hong Kong was seen meeting in a hotel lobby with prominent pro-democracy figures. China Daily and other mainland outlets pointed to the image as evidence of a U.S. \u201cblack hand\u201d behind the protests.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Beijing has denied that Washington was behind the protests. The U.S. consulate in Hong Kong had no immediate comment on Sunday.\n\nSunday\u2019s march followed two smaller demonstrations on Friday night and Saturday that descended into street skirmishes with police into the late hours. On Friday, police fired tear gas into a crowd and closed a subway station in the city\u2019s Kowloon district that had been the site of numerous arrests during a previous protest.\n\nSaturday saw similar battles after an attempt to once again rally at the city\u2019s airport failed to gather steam.\n\nOn Saturday, police said there had been no deaths resulting from the recent clashes in the city\u2019s subway and dismissed online rumors of such deaths as \u201cnot only false, but also malicious.\u201d\n\nSunday afternoon\u2019s demonstration appeared to gather additional numbers as the demonstrators wound their way through the city. Authorities closed the Central Station subway interchange, in the heart of the city\u2019s financial district, following what they described as \u201can escalation of the situation in the station.\u201d\n\nOther demonstrators could be seen hauling traffic cones and street railings into a barricade on the one of the neighborhood\u2019s main thoroughfares.\n\nOne masked 23-year-old protester who gave a speech at the rally\u2019s starting point said that the demonstrators hoped to win over the U.S. because previous rallies haven\u2019t worked to achieve all of their aims.\n\n\u201cHong Kongers ourselves do not have enough power to fight for this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are now hoping to ask for the international community to help us with fighting for democracy.\u201d\n\nWrite to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com and Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "description": "Tens of thousands of demonstrators called on the U.S. to protect human rights in Hong Kong, capping a weekend of smaller, heated protests that continued even after the government\u2019s recent attempt at conciliation.", "authors": ["Dan Strumpf", "Mike Cherney", "Dan.Strumpf Wsj.Com", "Mike.Cherney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105069/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
