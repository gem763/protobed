An environmental group said the spill has affected at least 13 villages, threatening the livelihoods and health of thousands of people.\n\nOn Monday, Dharmawan Samsu, Pertamina\u2019s upstream director, told reporters that Pertamina had connected a relief well, which should contain the leak, and aimed to permanently plug the leaking well by Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cWith this completion, we can soon focus on recovery efforts for the affected area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will renovate public infrastructure and clean the environment to restore the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nMore than 42,000 barrels of oil have been recovered offshore since the spill, Taufik Adityawarman, a Pertamina official said, as well as 5.7 million bags of mixed sand and oil from beaches.\n\nPertamina has promised to compensate residents affected by the spill, mostly fishermen from villages near the well. Adityawarman said so far only 30% of the compensation money has been distributed.\n\nThe company has estimated output from the ONWJ block this year of 29,000-30,000 barrels of oil per day and 110 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.", "description": "Indonesia's state oil and gas company PT Pertamina [PERTM.UL] said on Monday it had stopped an underwater leak from an oil well off West Java over the weekend after more than two months of spillages.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
