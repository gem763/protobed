The law was to come into effect on January 1 of next year.\n\nJudge Steve Jones of the Northern District of Georgia federal court stayed the law's implementation, saying it contradicts standing US Supreme Court's precedent allowing women the right to abort a fetus before it becomes viable, around the 24th week of pregnancy.\n\nAfter the Georgia law's passage, several entertainment giants including Disney, Netflix and Warner Studios threatened to cut ties with the state if the measure came into effect.\n\nActress Alyssa Milano even called for women to boycott sex until the law was repealed.\n\nAbortion opponents are stepping up their efforts to get a case on the procedure before the Supreme Court, in hopes that new conservative justices appointed by President Donald Trump will hand down a ruling tightening the procedure's availability.\n\nGeorgia's restrictive law was similar to others adopted by conservative states in the southern and Midwestern US in an attempt to curtail access to the procedure.\n\nCourts have already struck down several, including those passed by Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi.\n\n\"We won't stop fighting until we defeat all efforts to block access,\" said Talcott Camp of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several groups that sued over the law.", "description": "A US federal court on Tuesday blocked the state of Georgia from implementing a restrictive abortion law whose passage earlier this year sparked an outcry, particularly from Hollywood.
