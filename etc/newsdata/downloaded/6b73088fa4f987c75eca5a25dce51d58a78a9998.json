Feeling under the weather today as a result of a tough week.\n\n\"Hopefully we'll be right as rain for Saturday,\" she posted.\n\nIt comes after Shirley was sent death threats over the early elimination of contestants Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell.\n\nThe judge appeared to avoid talking about the recent death threats on the show, while Rylan and Zoe also chose not to address the trolling.\n\nEarlier in the week, pro dancer Dianne Buswell begged fans to stop sending Shirley death threats, following her and radio DJ Dev Griffin's controversial exit.\n\nThe 59-year-old head judge was targeted by furious viewers after the DJ was booted off the competition.\n\nDianne was forced to take to Twitter and pleaded with trolls to stop sending Shirley death threats.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nDianne tweeted: \"Guys this is terrible you can not be bullying like this. It\u2019s awful and really upsets me to hear this. It's simply not ok and should never happen!\"\n\nEarlier in the week, Shirley appeared on Loose Women where she claimed Strictly viewers were to blame for not saving Dev and Dianne.\n\nShirley said: \"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"\n\nStrictly Come Dancing 2019 continues Saturday with the results show on Sunday on BBC One.", "description": "Strictly Come Dancing's head judge Shirley Ballas appeared healthy on It Takes Two as she avoided talking about recent death threats", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Bbc", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650989.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_181019SCD_6586JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
