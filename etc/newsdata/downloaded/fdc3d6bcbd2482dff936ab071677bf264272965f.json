This is due to the traditional banking system catching up with its confirmation processes, which it is actually doing as we speak.\n\nThis nightmarish prospect of hacking, theft, delays in transactions and worst, monetary losses will soon be eradicated if we consider the best technology for all cryptocurrencies \u2013 not just an alternative system.\n\nThe Bitcoin scalability problem concerns the limits on the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can process. It is related to the fact that records (known as blocks) in the Bitcoin blockchain are limited in size and frequency.\n\nBitcoin transactions can only be accommodated at the current block size of 1MB. ILCoin\u2019s Miniblock\u2019s size is 25MB as opposed to Bitcoin\u2019s 1 MB current block size. These two data do not give the total implications of what Bitcoin needs to adopt.\n\nRIFT Protocol: game-changer?\n\nBigger block size is a simplified picture of what\u2019s on offer by the ILCoin Development Team. With RIFT Protocol implementation, the block size could be expanded to over 1.5GB. So, what\u2019s on offer?\n\nTransaction speed is not an ideal measure of how great a system is but rather, it\u2019s the efficiency or the measure by how much a system gets done with what resources. Ideally, what the world system needs is something that can really replace traditional systems built around the whim of current world market holders \u2013 the status quo.\n\nRIFT-Protocol is the basis for DCB (Decentralized Cloud Blockchain). This means that RIFT-Protocol and C2P (Command Chain Protocol) are requirements for DCB. The on-chain based data storage system like DCB is made possible with RIFT-Protocol. RIFT architecture can be thought of like a double layer of blocks, with the mini-blocks able to replicate itself without the need for mining.\n\nDecentralized Cloud Blockchain is the world\u2019s first data storage platform based on a decentralized blockchain system that can provide storage on-chain. DCB depends on data storage with a system that is built upon the SHA-256 ILCoin Decentralized Hybrid Blockchain system.\n\nRevolutionizing concepts of cryptocurrencies\n\nThe project includes a wider range of data storage possibilities including but not limited to videos, pictures, and files. An exclusive offer by ILCoin Development Team to partners is their own platform in addition to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis third type of ILCoin-exclusive feature \u2013 which is closest to true blockchain utilization \u2013 will revolutionize the current concepts of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf Bitcoin enthusiasts who make the comparison to the existing system in the first place don\u2019t suggest a better measure of efficiency, one could say it\u2019s a lot of BS. If the claim is NOT predicated on Bitcoin possibly being able to replace the existing financial system at all, there\u2019s no reason to think this is even possible.\n\nCrypto has so far been weirdly detached from the real-world economy. For all the activity within the crypto economy \u2013 and headlines about number going up or down \u2013 it doesn\u2019t much affect the real-world economy.\n\nIf one believes Bitcoin is a legitimate alternative to the current monetary system \u2013 set out how that would happen. Make a plan that doesn\u2019t have really obvious huge glaring holes in it \u2013 and that shows comprehension of how the existing system works and the stuff it does.\n\nILCoin\u2019s process will be fulfilled as part of the long-term goal whose steps include the \u201cdefensive approach, the decentralized partner node system, and the smart contract-based platform; all of which are part of DCB\u2019s creation\u201d.\n\nThe ILCoin platform is designed to achieve a supreme level of security, and yet, have easy-to-use features. The team\u2019s aim is to bring blockchain technology closer to the currently known data storage framework and as such, create a \u201cmore transparent and fair value approach to economic, legal, and financial processes\u201d, as they have vowed to do.\n\nJust criticizing the present system as bad doesn\u2019t mean your system is better. You need to show that. Let\u2019s see what happens as the ILCoin Development Team goes about putting their technology to work.\n\nFor more information, visit: https://ilcoincrypto.com/ or connect with the ILCoin community at: t.me/ILCoinDevelopmentTeam.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Markham"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2019/09/rift-v6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
