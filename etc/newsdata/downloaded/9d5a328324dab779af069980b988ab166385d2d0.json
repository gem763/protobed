They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nThe U.S. president later cast his decision to abandon the Kurdish fighters in Syria as fulfilling a campaign promise to withdraw from \u201cendless war\u201d in the Middle East, even as Republican critics and others said he was sacrificing a U.S. ally and undermining American credibility.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements have reverberated on all sides of the divide in Syria and the Mideast.\n\nIn Ankara, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Turkey was intent on combatting Syrian Kurdish fighters across its border in Syria and on creating a zone that would allow Turkey to resettle Syrian refugees there.\n\n\u201cWhere Turkey\u2019s security is concerned, we determine our own path but we set our own limits,\u201d Oktay said.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Syrian capital of Damascus, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad called on the country\u2019s Kurds to rejoin the government side after apparently being abandoned by their U.S. allies.\n\nMekdad\u2019s comments were the first Syrian reaction since Trump\u2019s announcement on Sunday and as northeastern Syria braces for an imminent Turkish attack on Syrian Kurdish militias. Trump\u2019s statement has infuriated the Kurds, who stand to lose the autonomy they gained from Damascus during Syria\u2019s civil war, now in its ninth year.\n\n\u201cThe homeland welcomes all its sons and Damascus will solve all Syrian problems in a positive way, away from violence,\u201d Mekdad claimed in an interview with the pro-government daily Al-Watan.\n\nPresident Bashar Assad\u2019s government abandoned the predominantly Kurdish area in northern Syria at the height of Syria\u2019s civil war to focus on more key areas where the military was being challenged by the rebels. The U.S. began working with the Syrian Kurdish fighters after the emergence of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe Syrian government \u201cwill defend all Syrian territory and will not accept any occupation of any land or iota of the Syrian soil,\u201d Mekdad said about the expected Turkish incursion.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish force has pledged to fight back, raising the potential for an eruption of new warfare in Syria.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate for a moment in defending our people\u201d against Turkish troops, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement, adding that it has lost 11,000 fighters in the war against the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish force that fought IS invited Trump to come see the progress the force and the U.S. made in northeastern Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have more work to do to keep ISIS from coming back & make our accomplishments permanent. If America leaves, all will be erased,\u201d he tweeted, referring to the Islamic State group by an alternative acronym.\n\nTurkey, which considers Kurdish fighters in Syria terrorists and links them to a decades-old insurgency in Turkey, has already launched two major incursions into northern Syria over the past years. The first was in 2016, when Turkey and Syrian opposition fighters it backs attacked areas held by the Islamic State group west of the Euphrates River. Last year Turkey launched an attack on the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin, leading to the displacement of some 300,000 people.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Iran urged Turkey not to go ahead with its planned an attack on Syrian Kurds, the Iranian state TV reported. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to express Tehran\u2019s opposition to the anticipated Turkish operation.\n\nZarif urged Turkey to respect Syria\u2019s integrity and sovereignty, the report said.\n\nIran, Turkey and Russia have been working together as part of the so-called Astana group on the Syrian civil war, talks that have run parallel to U.N. efforts to find a solution to the conflict.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement threw the military situation in Syria into fresh chaos and injected deeper uncertainty into the region.\n\nU.S. involvement in Syria has been fraught with peril since it started in 2014 with the insertion of small numbers of special operations forces to recruit, train, arm and advise local fighters to combat the Islamic State. Trump entered the White House in 2017 intent on getting out of Syria, and even before the counter-IS military campaign reclaimed the last militant strongholds early this year, he declared victory and said troops would leave.\n\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. and Turkey had reached an apparent accommodation of Turkish concerns about the presence of Kurdish fighters, seen in Turkey as a threat. American and Turkish soldiers had been conducting joint patrols in a zone along the border. As part of that work, barriers designed to protect the Syrian Kurds were dismantled amid assurances that Turkey would not invade.\n\n____\n\nFraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.
