Justified? Unjustified?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nSurveillance video released Tuesday shows a California police officer fatally shooting a 16-year-old boy from behind.\n\nIsiah Murrietta-Golding was running from Fresno Police officers, the footage from 2017 shows, and did not get up after an officer fired his gun.\n\nAttorney Stuart Chandler, who represents Murrietta-Golding's father, released the video and body camera footage ahead of an upcoming trial. The father sued the Fresno Police Department for excessive force and wrongful death, according to court documents.\n\nThree reviews determined the use of force was justified during a homicide investigation at the time, Fresno Police Department Chief Andrew Hall said in a statement. The department's Internal Affairs Bureau, the Fresno County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the City of Fresno\u2019s Office of Independent Review all determined officers acted within policy after seeing Murrietta-Golding reach for his waistband several times during a pursuit.\n\nInvestigators later determined he was unarmed.\n\nThis frame grab from surveillance camera footage released by attorney Stuart Chandler on October 22, 2019 shows Isiah Murrietta-Golding fleeing from a Fresno Police officer on April 14, 2017 in Fresno, Calif. Murrietta-Golding was shot and killed. (Photo: Stuart Chandler)\n\n\u201cThere absolutely is no way the officer\u2019s life was in danger,\u201d Chandler told The Fresno Bee. \u201cHe was running away and he was trying to hold up his pants.\"\n\nPolice came into contact with Murrietta-Golding on April 15, 2017, because he was a suspect in a homicide on the previous day, according to the independent review. Officers were about to take Murrietta-Golding into custody during a traffic stop when he ran away, body camera footage shows.\n\nOfficers chased after the teen, footage shows, telling him to stop. After he jumped over a fence, the review says an officer saw Murrietta-Golding reach for his waistband while looking at police from over his shoulder.\n\nBelieving he was reaching for a weapon, an officer fired one fatal shot, according to the review. Body camera footage shows an officer, who the lawsuit identified as Ray Villalvazo, firing his gun through the fence. The bullet struck the back of Murrietta-Golding's head, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOfficer misconduct: Hundreds of police officers have been labeled liars. Some still help send people to prison.\n\nA trial on the shooting is scheduled for October 2020, the Bee reported. Hall said ongoing litigation will consider all factors of the incident.\n\n\"The 16-year-old in this case was involved in the homicide with his brother and the brother was later arrested and pled guilty,\" Hall said in a statement. \"The video represents a different vantage point and was not what the pursuing officers could see. The 16-year-old was also known to carry firearms and had jumped a fence into a child daycare center.\"\n\nThe preschool was closed on that Saturday, the lawsuit said, and no one was on the campus. Police also did not have an arrest warrant when they attempted to take Murrietta-Golding into custody, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"This young man was trying to run away, and you can be as critical as you want about how you shouldn't do that, but it doesn't give police the right to use lethal force,\" Chandler told KFSN-TV.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/23/isiah-murrietta-golding-california-police-shooting-debate-2017-video/2452447001/", "description": "Surveillance video released Tuesday shows a California police officer fatally shooting Isiah Murrietta-Golding, 16, from behind.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Published A.M.
