They would pay a lot more in taxes, but they would get a lot of quality benefits \u2014 stuff like childcare and college is a huge cost burden for this group. It is the top 1 percent, and especially the top 0.1 percent and up, who would really get taken to the cleaners.\n\nSimilarly, scooping up, say, half the wealth in the country into a social wealth fund, which would distribute its return on a per-capita basis, would leave most of the upper-middle class in fine shape. The top 1 percent owns about 40 percent of America\u2019s wealth, and the next 4 percent (that is, those in the 95th to 99th percentile) another quarter. The bottom half of the upper-middle class, meanwhile, only owns about a tenth. Once more, the tippy-top would be the ones who would really pay.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ryan Cooper", "Theweek.Com Articles Why-Uppermiddle-Class-Benefit-From-Socialism"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
