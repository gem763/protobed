In Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, 100 centimeters (39 inches) of rain was recorded over 48 hours.\n\nSome of the muddy waters in streets, fields and residential areas have subsided. But many places remained flooded Monday, with homes and surrounding roads covered in mud and littered with broken wooden pieces and debris. Some places normally dry still looked like giant rivers.\n\nSome who lined up for morning soup at evacuation shelters, which are housing 30,000 people, expressed concern about the homes they left behind. Survivors and rescuers will also face colder weather, with northern Japan turning chilly this week.\n\nSoldiers and firefighters from throughout Japan were deployed to assist with rescue efforts. Helicopters could be seen plucking some of the stranded from higher floors and rooftops of submerged homes.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would set up a special disaster team, including officials from various ministries, to deal with the fallout from the typhoon, including helping those in evacuation centers and boosting efforts to restore water and electricity to homes.\n\n\u201cOur response must be rapid and appropriate,\u201d Abe said, stressing that many people remained missing and damage was extensive.\n\nDamage was especially serious in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke.\n\nIn one area, a few vehicles in used car lots were flipped over by the waters that had gushed in, covering everything with mud. Apples swept from the flooded orchards lay scattered in the mud.\n\nAreas in Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures in northern Japan were also badly flooded.\n\nIn such places, rescue crew paddled in boats to reach half-submerged homes, calling out to anyone left stranded.\n\nTokyo Electric Power Co. said 35,100 homes were still without electricity early Monday evening in Tokyo and nearby prefectures that the utility serves. That was down from nearly 57,000 earlier in the day.\n\nEast Japan Railway Co. said Hokuriku bullet trains were running Monday but were reduced in frequency and limited to the Nagano city and Tokyo routes.\n\nMimori Domoto, who works at Nagano craft beer-maker Yoho Brewing Co., said all 40 employees at her company were confirmed safe, though deliveries were halted.\n\n\u201cMy heart aches when I think of the damage that happened in Nagano. Who would have thought it would get this bad?\u201d she said.\n\nTama River in Tokyo overflowed, but the damage was not as great in the capital as in other areas. Areas surrounding Tokyo, such as Tochigi, also suffered damage.\n\nMuch of life in Tokyo returned to normal on Monday. People were out and about in the city, trains were running, and store shelves left bare when people were stockpiling were replenished.\n\n___\n\nKageyama reported from Tokyo.\n\nFollow Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "description": "NAGANO, Japan (AP) \u2014 Rescue crews dug through mudslides and searched near swollen rivers Monday as they looked for those missing from a typhoon that left", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/106ad6_asia-typhoon-27543-two-vehicles-are-submerged-in-floodwaters-monday-oct-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
