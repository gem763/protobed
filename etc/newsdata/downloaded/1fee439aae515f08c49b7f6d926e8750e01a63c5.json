Maxine Waters announced Wednesday. Waters, the California Democrat who chairs the committee, said that Zuckerberg will testify as the sole witness at a hearing entitled \"An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.\"\n\nZuckerberg will likely face tough questions from lawmakers about Libra, Facebook's cryptocurrency venture that is set to roll out in June 2020.\n\nLibra has already garnered scrutiny from lawmakers. Waters and other top Democrats sent a letter to Facebook in July calling on the company to halt its implementation of the cryptocurrency, and Waters has voiced \"serious concerns\" with Libra.\n\nWaters is the author of a draft bill that would block Facebook and other tech giants from being licensed or registered as US financial institutions. If passed, the bill would all but outlaw Libra and other such cryptocurrencies established by social media platforms.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider that Zuckerberg \"looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions.\"\n\nIt's relatively rare for Zuckerberg to agree to testify in public hearings. His last such appearance in Washington was in April 2018, when he faced five hours of relentless questioning from lawmakers over Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.\n\nSheryl Sandberg was reportedly slated to testify on Libra instead of Zuckerberg, but committee members waved off her appearance earlier in October and pursued testimony from Zuckerberg himself, Forbes reported.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg is going to Washington this month, where he'll face lawmakers who are skeptical of Facebook's cryptocurrency venture.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e068d3b33a7422c2c17a2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
