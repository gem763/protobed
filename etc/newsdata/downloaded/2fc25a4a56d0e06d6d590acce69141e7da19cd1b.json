Andrew Brunson says he has watched as the Turkish government has striven to purge sects of Christians and Muslims after the failed 2016 coup attempt against Mr. Edrogan.\n\n\u201cWell, we cannot go back to Turkey, at this point, for obvious reasons,\u201d Mr. Brunson, 51, told The Washington Times. \u201cThe Turkish government probably would not allow me back in the country, plus they\u2019ve made me a target [for Islamists], so I wouldn\u2019t last a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Brunson was imprisoned for two years in a Turkish prison on espionage charges, which he says are false. As a missionary, he had started churches and tended to refugees in Turkey for more than 20 years when Turkish authorities took him into custody while he applied for permanent residency in October 2016.\n\nHe was released last October after the U.S. Treasury Department imposed economic sanctions on two Turkish authorities and following public pressure from President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIn his new memoir, \u201cGod\u2019s Hostage,\u201d Mr. Brunson recounts the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to pry the release of an unknown Christian pastor.\n\n\u201cIt may be a miracle that I was released, but I think it was an even greater miracle that so much was done to release me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI am still amazed at the unprecedented steps that my government took.\u201d\n\nMr. Brunson says he has watched the escalation of violence in Turkey and northern Syria against religious minorities and notes that Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 is abandoning its Western friendships.\n\n\u201cThe population of Turkey is highly anti-American at this point,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cThat has been stoked by political leaders for domestic reasons and because their world view is really moving away from the West.\u201d\n\nMr. Brunson expends no words of friendship in \u201cGod\u2019s Hostage\u201d toward Mr. Edrogan, who has had thousands of citizens arrested after the coup attempt. But the pastor shies from critiquing Mr. Trump for displaying any warmth toward Mr. Erdgoan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stay away from that subject,\u201d he told The Times.\n\nReached for comment in the wake of the Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, Mr. Brunson declined to offer opinions on the quickly developing events. But he pointed to a passage in his book detailing a dream he had in prison.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Iran, and Russia were coming together to form an alliance so dark that I woke up swearing and gasping for breath,\u201d Mr. Brunson writes.\n\nThree days after his dream, he says, an off-duty Turkish police officer assassinated the Russian ambassador. Rather than driving Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr. Edrogan apart, the news brought them \u201ccloser together,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he acknowledges the hazards, Mr. Brunson said he plans to return oversees someday to continue his mission abroad and follow his unique calling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that being overseas is more important,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cThat\u2019s just what God has called us to do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
