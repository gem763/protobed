Triple Flag will pay more than R2bn ($145m) in cash upfront for the future delivery of gold from RBPlat mining operations\n\nRBPlat will deliver 70% of its gold output to Triple Flag until 261,000 ounces are delivered, and then 42% of output thereafter. For every ounce, Triple Flag will pay 5% of the spot gold price to RBPlat.\n\nGold output represents only 3% of RBPlat\u2019s revenue and the deal will allow it to monetise a portion of this gold production at a time when the rand gold price is at a high, compared to prices over the past decade, the company said.\n\nThe money will be used to help settle a part of the R1.86bn deal it struck with Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) to buy its 33% stake in the Bafokeng Rasimone joint venture near Rustenburg.\n\nIn essence, the deal means that for the next three decades, RBP will have to deliver gold \u2013 which is currently trading above $1,400 an ounce - to Triple flag at an estimated $555 an ounce, says Gryphon Asset Management portfolio manager Casparus Treurnicht.\n\n\u201cThat may sound low, but RBPlat clearly doesn\u2019t want to let the opportunity slip of capitalising on high gold prices. They are also keen to get the cash now to settle the deal with Amplats.\u201d\n\nTreurnicht says the deal has had a painful impact on RBPlat\u2019s finances: its total finance costs in the six months to end-June rocketed to R263m from R7.2m a year before. The Triple Flag deal will help settle its debts.", "description": "The money will be used to help settle its debts after buying Amplats' stake in a Rustenburg joint venture.", "authors": ["Helena Wasserman"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9483/223fb9f4f85344fd8b98996753d9e94e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
