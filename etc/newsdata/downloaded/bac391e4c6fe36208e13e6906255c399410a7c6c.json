Yep, that\u2019s right, more than a century. The Utes\u2019 last win came in 1916. But No. 10 Utah (3-0) has a chance in its Pac-12 opener to not only break the Coliseum Curse but also establish itself as the team to beat in the Pac-12 South and perhaps even forge a path toward a bid in the College Football Playoff. The Trojans (2-1), with freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, have already toppled Stanford at home, but they lost last weekend at BYU.\n\n\u201cI guess everyone is entitled to a bad century,\u201d Utah coach Kyle Whittingham joked. \u201cThis game fortunately, in our opinion, doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the last 100-plus years. It is its own entity, new challenge. History hasn\u2019t been good to us in that place, but we feel it has no bearing on this year.\u201d\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Colorado (2-1) made a splash under new coach Mel Tucker with an early victory at home over Nebraska. Now the Buffs are looking for that statement win on the road, and ASU (3-0) presents an opportunity for quarterback Steven Montez, who is averaging just over 275 yards passing per game, third-most in the league. He\u2019s got a good target in Laviska Shenault, who last week caught eight passes for 124 yards and a touchdown and also ran for another score in a loss to Air Force. But the duo will face a stout challenge Saturday in the Sun Devils, who have held their first three opponents to a combined 21 points - the fewest they\u2019ve allowed over a three-game stretch since 1993.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS: Utah running back Zack Moss needs 196 yards rushing to pass Eddie Johnson (3,219) and become the school\u2019s leader. His next game with 100 yards rushing will be the 14th of his career, tying him with John White and Devontae Booker for most in school history. \u2026 Cal has held its last 10 opponents below 24 points, a stretch that began last season. \u2026 Arizona State has scored at least 10 points in 122 straight games, four shy of the FBS modern-era record. \u2026 Washington State is off to a 3-0 start for the third straight year, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 1907-09. The Cougars are also 15-1 at home over the past three seasons. \u2026 Stanford (1-2) hosts Oregon this weekend hoping to avoid its first three-game losing streak since 2008. \u2026 The Ducks haven\u2019t won a conference opener since 2014. \u2026 Washington has allowed an average of just 18 points and 324 yards per game heading into its final nonconference game against BYU.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Washington State running back Max Borghi. The sophomore is only averaging 67.3 yards rushing a game, ranking him 11th in the Pac-12, but he\u2019s making his carries count with four touchdowns, tying him for the lead among conference running backs. He\u2019s also caught six passes for 61 yards. He\u2019s got five total touchdowns this season and is averaging 10 points a game. That could give UCLA headaches this weekend. The Bruins are allowing an average of 188 yards rushing, 10th in the league. They\u2019re allowing 279 passing yards a game, also 10th in the conference.\n\nUPSET WATCH Cal (3-0) could turn out to be the Pac-12\u2019s surprise of the season and the Bears are starting to get some attention after that upset victory over Washington. The Golden Bears face Mississippi this weekend. They haven\u2019t started 4-0 since 2015, while Mississippi (2-1) is seeking its first win over a Top 25 team since beating No. 16 Mississippi State 31-28 in 2017. This totally has the makings of an upset - although Mississippi is just a 2\u00bd-point favorite. Cal and Mississippi last faced each other in 2017, when Cal beat the visiting Rebels 27-16.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here are some things to watch this week in the Pac-12 Conference:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
