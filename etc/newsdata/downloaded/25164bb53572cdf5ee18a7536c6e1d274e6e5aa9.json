Democrats believe Trump was withholding the military aid to use as leverage to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden.\n\nBut Zelenskiy on Thursday said the call \u201cwasn\u2019t linked to weapons or the story with [Ukrainian gas company] Burisma,\u201d where Hunter Biden served on the board.\n\nAsked what Ukraine did to persuade the U.S. to release the aid, Zelenskiy said: \u201cWe have many diplomatic contacts. And in case we need to find a solution to questions of this level, questions about our country\u2019s security, we use all our powerful possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to interfere in any way in the elections\u201d in the U.S., the Ukrainian leader said.\n\n\u201cWe are an independent country, we have relations with many countries,\u201d not just the U.S., he said.", "description": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he doesn\u2019t \u2018want to interfere in any way in the elections\u2019 in the US.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177516251-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
