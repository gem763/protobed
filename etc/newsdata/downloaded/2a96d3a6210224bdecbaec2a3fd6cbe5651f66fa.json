He was due back at Camp Pendleton after a three-day leave that took him home to the suburbs west of Phoenix and a camping trip.\n\nU.S. Marine Lance Corporal Job Wallace in undated photo KPHO-TV\n\nAbout an hour south of Dallas, Navarro County is more than 1,100 miles east of Surprise and in the opposite direction from Camp Pendleton in Southern California.\n\nThe statement from Kurt Thomas, the special agent in charge of the NCIS Marine Corps West field office, did not include details about how Wallace was found or what he was doing.\n\nStacy Wallace had said her son loved the Marines and was excited to get back to Camp Pendleton, having been recently promoted.\n\n\"He got into several colleges and missed scholarship opportunities just so that he could be a Marine, because he felt it was his duty to serve his country,\" Wallace said.\n\nWallace's mother had said law enforcement officials told her that her son's phone was last pinged Monday night in Arizona. But a Border Patrol camera spotted his truck the next morning traveling eastbound on Interstate 10 near Fort Hancock, Texas, southeast of El Paso.\n\nA Surprise police spokesman had said officers took a report and turned the matter over to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Thomas' Saturday night statement thanked law enforcement partners in Texas, Arizona and on the federal level \"for their aid in bringing this to a safe resolution.\"\n\nStacy Wallace told CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV the waiting was \"the worst experience of your life. There's too many emotions for me to get into what it's like.\"\n\nBut now, she told the station, \"There's lots of emotions but I'm overjoyed. I'm super happy to have my son \u2026 safe.\"\n\nThe family, she said, will wait for the right time to ask her son what happened. \"I haven't even gotten to the questioning phase,\" she remarked to KPHO. \"I'm still in the release of emotions (phase) and (am) overjoyed my son's home, and he's alive.\"", "description": "Lance Corporal Job Wallace was on what was supposed to be a three-day leave from Camp Pendleton and was seen in area of his family's suburban Phoenix home", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/23/41091dc8-4947-4b73-b15c-ef41d0749469/thumbnail/1200x630/3d92c1f81fe9172596c9297b9d825d85/job-wallace.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
