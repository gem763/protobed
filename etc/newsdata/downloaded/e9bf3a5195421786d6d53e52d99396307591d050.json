Analysts estimate that opioids have caused 400,000 deaths since 1999.\n\nJust when efforts to impose consequences on the Sackler family for their role in the opioid crisis were kicking off, universities were still accepting donations from Sackler foundations. In 2018, nine universities accepted donations from foundations ran by the Sackler family. Yale University was amongst the universities that accepted donations from Sackler foundations in 2018.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny of Brandeis University has become a leading critic of opioid manufacturers. He told the Associated Press that universities should return any donations that they received from the Sackler family. \u201cMoney from the Sacklers should be understood as blood money,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cUniversities shouldn\u2019t take it, and universities that have taken it should give it back.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives at Cornell, Yale and the California Institute of Technology, all of which received donations totaling more than one million from the Sackler family, told the Associated Press that they plan to reject any future donations from the family or their foundations.\n\nOf the 20 universities that received donations greater than one million, not one said that they would return money they received from Sackler foundations.\n\nBreitbart News reported in September that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology received large donations from Jeffrey Epstein.
