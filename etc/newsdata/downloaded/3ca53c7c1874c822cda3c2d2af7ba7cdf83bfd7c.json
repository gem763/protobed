(Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nJin, who is one of seven musicians in the K-pop supergroup, turns 27 in December.\n\nMany are wondering what will happen to the band as he and other members approach their deadline for serving.\n\nWhen asked about it earlier this year on CBS Sunday Morning, Jin was clear about the band\u2019s intentions to serve.\n\n\u201cAs a Korean, it\u2019s natural, and someday, when duty calls, we\u2019ll be ready to respond and do our best.\u201d\n\nDespite BTS\u2019s massive success and worldwide impact, they still won\u2019t be exempt.\n\nIf not BTS, who gets a pass?\n\nTurns out, certain people in Korea can be excused from military service.\n\nSouth Korean Olympic swimmer Park Tae-hwan is just one of many athletes to be exempt from mandatory military service. (Adam Pretty/Getty Images)\n\nPublic figures like Olympic athletes and even artists, including classical musicians, have been permitted to skip their service in the past.\n\nBut K-pop bands are not yet eligible to be given a pass, based on current conscription rules.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Ministry of Defence has started conversations about changing the rules, but until then, the meteoric rise of BTS may come to a standstill.\n\nAre South Koreans alone?\n\nMandatory military service exists in 26 different countries, including Norway and Brazil.\n\nIn South Korea, women aren\u2019t required to serve but may volunteer if they wish.\n\nIn countries like Israel, both men and women are required to serve. (Amir Cohen/Reuters)\n\nIf not exempt, let the brotherhood stay together\n\nSince they are not exempt, many fans on Twitter are sharing a petition to allow BTS to complete their service together.\n\nThe thinking is to get it all done in two years, rather than continuing with members leaving at different times.\n\nThe petition already has more than 20,000 signatures, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see if the BTS ARMY can yet again pull through for their supergroup.\n\nCBC Kids News reached out to BTS for comment, but has not heard back.", "description": "K-pop superband BTS will not be exempt from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/BTS_%281%29_resized.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
