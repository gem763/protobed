The knife was either hidden there or in his shorts pocket\n\nProsecutor James Mactaggart dismissed Turner's claim as 'nonsense' and told the court he planned to kill Ms Thomas in an 'outrageous act of evil'.\n\n'This was someone perfectly normal contemplating the evil deed he was going to commit, planning and plotting in his mind. He knew what he was doing. He was functioning quite well,' he said.\n\n'He turned up with a knife. He had, in the state's case, formed an intent to take her life.'\n\nJustice McGrath labelled Turner's claims 'a concoction' but accepted he had in the past suffered from 'some form of dissociative seizures'.\n\nTurner was captured on CCTV footage sitting in the waiting room outside the meeting before the attack, peering into a lever arch folder.\n\nMr Mactaggart said he either hid the knife in there or in his pocket.\n\nThe pair were meeting to discuss Turner's claim that she owed him $2,000, and she was killed just after refusing to pay him.\n\nAdministration worker Crystal Sudholz testified that she heard muffled yelling then a 'horror movie scream' about four minutes into the meeting.\n\nThe registrar then ran out of the room before Turner emerged and slid against a wall to the floor, where he sat until detectives and security guards rushed over to arrest him.\n\nOne of the stabs cut Ms Thomas's (pictured) carotid artery, which killed her within seconds\n\nAt his Supreme Court of Western Australia trial, he wept as he claimed the last thing he recalled on the morning of the killing was speaking with their children.\n\nTurner said his next memory was being in a police station with blood on his hands.\n\nHe insisted that after he had an accident while working as a truck driver in 2015, he suffered symptoms including seizures that caused blackouts, sometimes lasting more than 45 minutes.\n\nThe pair were embroiled in a custody dispute in the days leading up to the attack and were meeting with a registrar at the Joondalup complex over Turner's separate claim Ms Thomas (pictured) owed him money\n\nTurner said he had no recall, but after he was played CCTV footage of the waiting room outside the meeting - which showed him slide to the floor after the registrar ran out - he admitted he killed her.\n\n'It appears that way,' he said. 'I didn't intentionally kill her.'\n\nMr Mactaggart dismissed Turner's claims as 'a pack of absolute lies', saying he was fully aware of what he was doing, and had spent more than 100 hours getting neurological tests but his results kept coming back normal.\n\nHe was humiliated Ms Thomas had got the better of him in a bitter custody dispute, obtaining a court order to recover the children days earlier, and she refused to settle with him at the meeting over his claim she owed him money, the prosecutor said.\n\nDefence counsel Lisa Boston argued her client had experienced insane automatism, telling the jury in her closing address that it would have been 'bonkers' for a man trained in commando knife techniques to knowingly kill someone in a complex packed with security guards and police.\n\nTurner trained in lethal artery-slashing and knife concealment when he was aged in his late 20s, and continued to practice during his eight-year relationship with Ms Thomas.\n\nAsked about this interest, Turner replied it was 'for the historic aspect' as he studied the Fairbairn system used in WWII.", "description": "Paul Gary Turner, 43,\u00a0smuggled a knife into a meeting with Sarah Marie Thomas, 33, at Joondalup courthouse in Perth in December 2016 and stabbed her six times, killing her in seconds.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19719298-0-image-a-21_1571103235795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
