He won an NBA title in 1972 and coached the Lakers in the late 1970s.\n\nLater, as general manager, he guided the Lakers to several titles through the 1980s and paved the way for a three-peat in the early 2000s.\n\nThe iconic NBA logo is based on his silhouette.\n\nMr. West was born in West Virginia and played for the West Virginia University Mountaineers.
