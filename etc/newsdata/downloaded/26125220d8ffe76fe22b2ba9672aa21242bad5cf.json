(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nJust how much can a story targeting Donald Trump implode? Apparently, this much.\n\nIf you are short on background, on Wednesday of last week, a story broke that a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d had filed a complaint against President Trump. The assertion was that Trump had threatened Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president on a phone call over investigating Joe Biden. The threat supposedly involved $250 million in military aid. After a day of full blown meltdowns on the left and in the media, the impeachment train was stopped in its tracks when it was revealed Trump had in fact not threatened Ukraine, nor offered any kind of quid pro quo.\n\nIn the end, we are left with Biden admitting to extorting Ukraine on tape and Trump simply asking if it could be looked into. Worst scandal ever.\n\nNow, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, who has read the read out of the call, just dumped even more cold water on this story.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Defends Trump Talk: \u2018No Pressure.\u2019 https://t.co/0mfHxzYqxQ \u2014 Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cI know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\u201d Prystaiko told Hromadske. \u201cThere was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\u201d\n\nThis is correct. Whether Democrats and the media want to admit it or not, presidents talk to foreign leaders. They inquire on many different things and it would certainly be in bounds to ask why a former VP is on tape admitting he extorted Ukraine\u2019s former administration. There was no promise made or pressure applied here. How do I know? Because no investigation happened and the money ended up being released anyway. We are once again left arguing hypothetical nonsense, much like during the Mueller probe.\n\nThe real story here continues to be Biden bragging on camera that he extorted Ukraine\u2019s former administration. There was no reason for Biden do what he did from a foreign policy standpoint and even if there were, the former VP knew about the grave conflicts of interests. We already know he lied about having discussed his son\u2019s employment in Ukraine. We know the Obama administration warned him. Yet, he threatened Ukraine anyway until they fired a prosecutor who was targeting his son. That stinks to high heaven and deserves a real investigation.\n\nWe were told for years after Trump was elected that investigations are good. That the subjects of them should be thankful for their coming exoneration. Why is this any different? Why isn\u2019t Mitt Romney demanding a probe into Biden\u2019s actions? Why is it that investigations are only good and proper when they target Trump? Why is Biden allowed to obfuscate and dictate to the press on this matter?\n\nNone of this lost on Republican voters and they see the game is rigged.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
