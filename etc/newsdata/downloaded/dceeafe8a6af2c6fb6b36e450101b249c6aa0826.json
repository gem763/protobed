With the headphones on, the audio seems to swirl around your head in a full 360-degree motion. The effect is much like produced by Tibetan singing bowls, though you can choose from all sorts of relaxing musical tracks. \u2018It promotes the regulation of the nervous system by activating the body's natural resources to fight against stress,\u2019 Neural Up says. \u2018Our technology blocks the negative effects of stress on the body through a sensorineural stimulation that induces a feeling of intense relaxation that improves the state of well-being. \u2018\n\nNeural Up had one of its Bubble-Zen pods on display at CES, where attendees and members of the media were able to hop in and tune out for a few minutes in the middle of the hectic convention.\n\nOut in the real world, the firm says Bubble-Zen could find its place in large offices or even airports.\n\nThe Bubble-Zen team didn't disclose any specifics on the price, but said it could cost upwards of $15,000, depending on how many are needed for a given space.\n\nThe system relies on technology developed with neuroscience research in mind, co-founder Gil Borelli told Dailymail.com at CES.\n\nIt combines sound and visual isolation to put you into a state of deep relaxation, Borelli explained.\n\nAccording to Neural Up, the technology can help to dramatically reduce feelings of anger, fatigue, depression, confusion, and anxiety.\n\nThe effects, of course, are temporary \u2013 but, it\u2019s easy to see how regular use could help to cut down overall stress over time.\n\nDailymail.com tested out the immersive relaxation pod at CES and was impressed by how quickly the relaxation sets in \u2013 even in such a busy setting.\n\nDailymail.com tested out the immersive relaxation pod at CES\n\nWith the headphones on, the audio seems to swirl around your head in a full 360-degree motion.\n\nThe effect is much like that produced by Tibetan singing bowls, though you can choose from all sorts of relaxing musical tracks, including jazz and classical music.\n\nInside the pod, there\u2019s also an HD touch screen, a microphone and webcam, and LED lights.\n\nAccording to Neural Up, the system simply works by boosting processes already happening in your own brain.\n\nFrench startup Neural Up demonstrated its incredible relaxation technology in Las Vegas this week at CES.
