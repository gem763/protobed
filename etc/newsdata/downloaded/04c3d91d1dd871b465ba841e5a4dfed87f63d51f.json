Boeing said it is carrying out the culture review under its current contract.\n\nNASA said it is \u201cstandard practice\u201d for a company to receive additional money for work not included in the original contract , but did not directly respond to questions about why it didn\u2019t offer the additional payment to Boeing.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell if both paying a contractor extra to do a culture review and only offering the additional money to one of the companies is unusual because there isn\u2019t any public precedent. NASA ordered the review of the safety measures at SpaceX and Boeing in November after Musk smoked marijuana and sipped whiskey on Joe Rogan Experience podcast, but has not ordered such a preview of any past contractor. In fact, when the review was ordered, companies were not sure what exactly it entailed because it had not been done before at NASA, according to one person in the space industry.\n\n\u201cIt would be odd for NASA to pay a contractor millions to tell its employees not to do drugs,\u201d the industry official said, pointing out that other companies did not receive any extra money for \u201cmeeting basic contractual requirements.\u201d The person spoke on condition of anonymity to criticize a competitor.\n\nBoeing confirmed that it did not receive any extra money for its safety review, which will include reviewing documents and interviewing employees to ensure it is maintaining a drug-free workplace under its Starliner contract. It\u2019s not clear how much the review will cost Boeing.\n\n\u201cNASA is moving forward with fulfilling the objectives of their safety assessment under our current contract, and we are prepared to help our customer meet those goals,\u201d a Boeing spokesperson said.\n\nBut asked why Boeing didn\u2019t receive a similar deal as SpaceX to cover its safety\n\nassessment, NASA spokesman Joshua Finch declined to give a reason, telling POLITICO in a statement only that \u201cafter discussions with Boeing\u2026we decided we wouldn\u2019t pursue a contract modification to carry out the assessment that\u2019s underway.\u201d\n\nYet the implication that SpaceX is getting special treatment struck some as richly ironic given that Boeing has been paid nearly $1.7 billion more on NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program than SpaceX -- $4.82 billion compared with $3.14 billion.\n\nThe cost disparity makes some analysts think that the extra $5 million SpaceX received is not a big deal and does not constitute special treatment, since Boeing is receiving more overall.\n\n\u201cThe idea of NASA ever giving SpaceX preferential treatment over Boeing is simply giggle-inducing to industry insiders,\u201d said Greg Autry, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California who served on the Trump administration's NASA transition team. \u201cAt every step of the way Boeing got more [money] in the [Commercial Crew development] program. Far, far more than $5 million. Even discussing $5 million in this context is silly.\u201d\n\nSpaceX is building the Crew Dragon capsule and Boeing is manufacturing the Starliner as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Both programs are behind schedule.\n\nThe dust-up over how to handle Musk's marijuana violation also highlights the clash of cultures between longtime contractors and their new \u2013 and often more innovative \u2013 competitors, said Garrettson.\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is an important cultural divide between what is considered appropriate behavior in the old guard in the space community and what is considered OK among Silicon Valley tech people and a growing sector of Americans,\u201d Garrettson said.\n\nWhile marijuana is legal in multiple states \u2013 including California, where Musk\u2019s stunt took place \u2013 it remains illegal under federal law. Drug use is also not allowed for those who have a security clearance, which Musk does.\n\nAerospace contractors were \u201cabsolutely in horror\u201d that Musk, whose company also launches sensitive national security satellites for the Air Force and spy agencies, would violate a federal law, recalled Garrettson.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine explained at the time that \"if I see something that\u2019s inappropriate, the key concern to me is what is the culture that led to that inappropriateness and is NASA involved in that.\n\n\"As an agency we\u2019re not just leading ourselves but our contractors, as well. We need to show the American public that when we put an astronaut on a rocket, they\u2019ll be safe,\" Bridenstine added.\n\nThe safety reviews, which are still underway, are designed to \u201censure the companies are meeting NASA\u2019s requirements for workplace safety, including the adherence to a drug-free environment,\u201d NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said at the time.\n\nSpaceX says the extra $5 million it has been granted by NASA will cover the additional costs of conducting the review -- including interviews with employees ranging from senior managers to engineers \u2013 costs that were not accounted for in its original contract for the Crew Dragon capsule back in 2014. No one knew NASA would order the review when contracts were awarded, so the cost of one was also not included in Boeing\u2019s contract.\n\n\u201cSpaceX worked closely with NASA to account for additional work beyond the scope of the contract,\u201d said James Gleeson, a SpaceX spokesman.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e5/f6/8c5099174e45a51abbebe840ff39/191016-musk-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
