Turning to contract workers helps keep costs lower, particularly for white-collar jobs like content moderation \u2014 the job of deciding whether content should be allowed online.\n\nFacebook raising pay and support services for thousands of contractors and content moderators\n\nHCL \u201cemployees work side-by-side with those of the giant corporation for far less compensation and few, if any, of the perks,\u201d according to a statement about the union action. The group is identifying itself as the Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals.\n\nUnions have made inroads, largely for nontechnical roles. Bus drivers and security guards that service Google, Facebook and other companies have won the right to collectively bargain in recent years. About 150 workers making deliveries and working in warehouses for Google in 2015 attempted to unionize before the company rejiggered the unit, effectively quashing the effort.\n\nGoogle employees walk out over allegations of sexual harassment, inequality within company\n\nThe treatment of contract workers has been a hot-button issue at Google, where full-time employees have demanded the laborers receive pay and benefits to more closely match theirs. Some workers signed a petition in protest of Google\u2019s firing of some contract workers working on artificial intelligence for the search giant.\n\nUber, Lyft and food-delivery firm DoorDash have pledged $90 million to battle a California bill that would extend further benefits and pay to contract drivers. Classifying them as employees would upend their business models, which rely on drivers assuming costs such as fuel and vehicle insurance to keep fares lower.\n\nIn April, Google said it would require its contractor firms to offer paid sick and parental leave, as well as improved health care and minimum pay of $15 per hour. Google could end a contract with the outside firms if it fails to comply.\n\nContent moderators at YouTube, Facebook and Twitter see the worst of the web \u2014 and suffer silently\n\nGoogle and HCL didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Friday. NLRB spokesman Nelson Carrasco declined to comment.\n\nUnited Steelworkers spokesman Tony Montana said the union is \u201canxious to win the representation election so that we can go about the business of negotiating a fair contract that makes HCL employees across the country take notice.\u201d HCL employs additional Google workers around the country.\n\nThe NLRB will have to certify the union cards before a formal vote to form a union can proceed, for which a simple majority vote is required for passage.", "description": "The workers, about 90 in all, analyze data and perform other technical roles for Google at its office in Pittsburgh.", "authors": ["Greg Bensinger", "Reporter Covering Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FFXT2OWHJQI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
