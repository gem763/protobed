The debt relates to a deal in the 1980s over the UK\u2019s non-delivery of Chieftain tanks for which a previous Iranian regime had paid.\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was chained to bed in hospital, says husband Read more\n\nSuccessive courts have found the UK is liable to pay the debt, but Hunt told BBC Radio 4 there was an outstanding legal dispute over the precise sum. There has also been a hidden political dispute within the UK government over whether the money should be paid.\n\nZarif on Sunday claimed an agreement had been reached with some cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond for the release of the money, but Hunt as foreign secretary had scuppered the deal.\n\nHunt hit back by saying it was extraordinary that Zarif was admitting \u201cvery openly they are holding an innocent woman with a five-year-old daughter as a tool of diplomatic leverage to try to settle a financial dispute with the UK\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur policy as the British government had always been absolutely clear. We are a law-abiding government, so if there is a court order that says that this money has to be paid ... then we obey the law\u201d. He said \u201cthe court process is still continuing, it is still deciding the exact amount that has to be paid.\n\n\u201cWe obey court rulings, but what we will not do is link it to the release of a hostage because if you do that you then you encourage countries like Iran to take hostages in the future when they have another dispute.\u201d\n\nHe denied he had taken a different view to previous foreign secretaries. Ministerial sources say the biggest blockage came from Gavin Williamson during his time as defence secretary, and that the issue is politically off the table due to the UK declaring, along with France and Germany this week, that Iran was responsible for the attack on the Saudi Aramco oil installations on 14 September.\n\nTimeline Imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran Show Hide Arrest in Tehran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella. Release campaign begins Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, demanding the government do more for her release. Sentenced She is sentenced to five years in jail. Her husband says the exact charges are still being kept a secret. Hunger strike Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health deteriorates after she spends several days on hunger strike in protest at her imprisonment. Appeal fails Iran\u2019s supreme court upholds her conviction. Boris Johnson intervenes Boris Johnson, then Foreign Secretary, tells a parliamentary select committee \"When we look at what [she] was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism\". Four days after his comments, Zaghari-Ratcliffe is returned to court, where his statement is cited in evidence against her. Her employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, deny that she has ever trained journalists, and her family maintain she was in Iran on holiday. Johnson is eventually forced to apologise for the \"distress and anguish\" his comments cause the family. Health concerns Her husband reveals that Zaghari-Ratcliffe has fears for her health after lumps had been found in her breasts that required an ultrasound scan, and that she was now \u201con the verge of a nervous breakdown\u201d. Hunt meets husband New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with Richard Ratcliffe, and pledges \"We will do everything we can to bring her home.\" Temporary release She is granted a temporary three-day release from prison. Hunger strike Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on hunger strike again, in protest at the withdrawal of her medical care. Diplomatic protection The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, takes the unusual step of granting her diplomatic protection \u2013 a move that raises her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states. Travel warning The UK upgrades its travel advice to British-Iranian dual nationals, for the first time advising against all travel to Iran. The advice also urges Iranian nationals living in the UK to exercise caution if they decide to travel to Iran. Hunger strike in London Richard Ratcliffe joins his wife in a new hunger strike campaign. He fasts outside the Iranian embassy in London as she begins a third hunger strike protest in prison. Hunger strike ends Zaghari-Ratcliffe ends her hunger strike by eating some breakfast. Her husband also ends his strike outside the embassy.\n\nMoved to mental health ward According to her husband, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from Evin prison to the mental ward of Imam Khomeini hospital, where Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards have prevented relatives from contacting her.\n\n\n\nHunt called on Europe and the US to unify their policies on Iran, saying a strategy that left the two allies divided would not work.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe starting point has to be that western policy towards Iran is failing and the policy of maximum economic pressure designed to deter malign Iranian activity is clearly not working if you look at the Iranian attack on the Saudi oil facility on 14 September. You cannot underestimate the significance of that.\n\n\u201cBy the same merit, the European policy of trying to keep the nuclear deal going is also failing because Iran is in the process of breaching its uranium limits, so we need to rethink. The lesson I think is that when the US and Europe go their separate ways on Iran policy, in the end it does not work and we need to come together.\u201d\n\nHe said the Iranians needed to clearly know the negative consequences if they behaved negatively, and \u201cat the same time there has to be a ladder for them to climb down so that if they start to behave positively, so they can see a more positive outcome in terms of sanctions relief or whatever it is\u201d.\n\nIn a joint statement issued on Monday evening, the UK, France and Germany defended the existing Iran deal but re-emphasised a position first adopted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in the months leading up to Donald Trump quitting the deal in 2018.\n\nMacron had proposed the agreement signed in 2015 could be expanded to include new proposals for how the nuclear deal would function after some of its terms expire in 2025. The expanded deal would also cover the future of the Iranian ballistic programme and Iran\u2019s regional behaviour, according to Macron\u2019s plan.", "description": "Debt would not form deal for release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, ex-foreign secretary adds", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f2e6a5101ba6cccb7825b7bea45f45cadd476e2/0_76_2454_1472/master/2454.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9c22c00a78698d2aef63df6c12adacd", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
