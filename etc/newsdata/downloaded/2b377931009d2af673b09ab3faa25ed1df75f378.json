REUTERS/Jim Gathany/CDC/Handout via Reuters/Files\n\nIn a major report that contradicted the conclusions of a WHO-led malaria review last month, 41 specialists said a future free of malaria \u2014 one of the world\u2019s oldest and deadliest diseases \u2014 can be achieved as early as 2050.\n\nTo meet that target, however, governments, scientists and public health leaders need to inject more money and innovation into fighting the disease and the mosquitoes that carry it, the report said \u2014 something that will require \u201cambition, commitment and partnership like never before\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor too long, malaria eradication has been a distant dream, but now we have evidence that malaria can and should be eradicated by 2050,\u201d said Richard Feachem, director of the Global Health Group at the University of California, San Francisco, who co-chaired a review of malaria eradication commissioned by The Lancet journal.\n\n\u201cWe must ... challenge ourselves with ambitious targets and commit to the bold action needed to meet them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Lancet Commission\u2019s view comes a few weeks after the WHO published its own report on whether malaria can be wiped out, concluding that eradication cannot be achieved any time soon, and that setting unrealistic goals with unknown costs and endpoints could lead to \u201cfrustration and backlashes\u201d.\n\nIn contrast to the Lancet Commission, the WHO report said the priority now should be to lay the groundwork for future eradication \u201cwhile guarding against the risk of failure that would lead to the waste of huge sums of money (and) frustrate all those involved.\u201d\n\nThe Lancet report, however, said that rather than slogging on with steadily reducing malaria cases \u2014 all the time under the threat of resurgence \u2014 global health authorities could \u201cinstead choose to commit to a time-bound eradication goal that will bring purpose, urgency and dedication\u201d to the fight.\n\nMalaria infected about 219 million people in 2017 and killed around 435,000 of them \u2014 the vast majority babies and children in the poorest parts of Africa. These totals are little changed from 2016, but global case numbers had previously fallen steadily from 239 million in 2010 to 214 million in 2015, and deaths from 607,000 to around 500,000 from 2010 to 2013.\n\n\u201cMalaria continues to strip communities around the world of promise and economic potential,\u201d said Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho, a Tanzanian doctor who co-chaired The Lancet Commission. She said malaria eradication was \u201ca public health and equity imperative\u201d.\n\nTo stamp out the disease by 2050, the report\u2019s authors proposed three ways to speed up malaria\u2019s decline.\n\nExisting malaria-fighting tools such as bednets, medicines and insecticides should be used more smartly, it said, and new tools such as vaccines should be developed. Thirdly, governments in both malaria-affcted and malaria-free countries need to boost investment by about $2 billion a year to accelerate progress.", "description": "Malaria can be eradicated within a generation and the World Health Organization (WHO) should not shy away from this \"goal of epic proportions\", global health experts said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427796411&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88069", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
