Market pricing for a one- quarter of a percentage point rate cash rate reduction to 0.5 per cent in November stands at just 20 per cent.\n\nGreater conviction surrounds the Fed, with markets pricing in a 93 per cent chance of another 25 basis point cut to the Fed funds rate. That would reduce it to a range of between 1.50 and 1.75 per cent.\n\nJohn Woods, Credit Suisse's chief investment officer for the Asia-Pacific, agreed and said markets would focus on the tone of the Fed's statement.\n\n\"We don't believe there will be further cuts going forward this cycle but we don't think the Fed will switch to an immediately hawkish bias,\" he said.\n\nMatt Merritt, manager of multi-asset strategy at Insight Investment, said that \"while inflation is notable by its absence, policy keeps on getting skewed to try and keep this expansion phase chugging along\".\n\nThe Fed has hit its inflation target exactly twice in the last 10 years, he said, and only achieved that through a rare positive confluence of factors.\n\n\"The rest of the time they are way below it, so the active debate \u2013 certainly at the Federal Reserve \u2013 is what on earth do they have to do to avoid the threat of deflation coming back?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarkets were intensely focused on deflation just after the global financial crisis, when the world's central banks directed their policy tools on trying to avoid negative prices.\n\nBut despite the best efforts from central bankers who have \"thrown the kitchen sink at it\", inflation hasn't improved, Mr Merritt said. \"That's the challenge. Everyone is scratching their heads.\"\n\nCentral bankers may be fighting a battle that they just won't be able to win. Mr Merritt, who manages $US12 billion ($17.5 billion) at Insight, noted that, broadly, inflation has been steadily declining since the 1980s.\n\n\"Central bankers would like to say it's because they have done a really good job, but realistically there are a huge number of powerful forces such as technology and globalisation that seem to have anchored inflation at much lower levels,\" he said.\n\n\"Over recent decades, economic cycles have generally become longer. Part of the story is simply that inflation appears to have structurally declined.\"\n\nHowever, he said that due to a long but subdued global economic expansion, output gaps may have taken longer to close than previously. \"Maybe all the economic relationships still exist but the lags are longer.\"\n\nMark Burgess, the former head of the Future Fund and adviser to Jamieson Coote Bonds, said there was a now generation of people who think about inflation differently.\n\n\u201cThe 1970s were extremely difficult and I mention that just because our starting point in the last 35 years was from a very tough place,\" he said. \"And we\u2019ve really spent 35 years driving bond yields down as we\u2019ve changed our perception about the 1970s.\u201d\n\nEvery time the economy strengthened, people perceived inflation would come back, and that fed through to the performance of the bond market, Mr Burgess said. In fact, \u201cinflation doesn\u2019t come back that often\u201d, he said.", "description": "The RBA is set for another unwelcome reminder that it's losing the battle to restore price growth to the target band.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/77554aa90f329120298a34b3634f53bcb3203a6d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
