I\u2019ll look at the new games released that week, but honestly, I just want to see what\u2019s on sale. I especially want to see what\u2019s really on sale.\n\nOne of the few categories by which you can browse Switch games on the eShop is Great Deals. Leading that section may be a popular game that\u2019s now a few dollars cheaper, but occasionally, a ridiculous discount will catch my eye \u2014 such as a recent one that put the $45 rhythm game Superbeat: Xonic on sale for a staggering $1.30. My Switch is full of games that I hadn\u2019t heard of until I had the chance to pick them up for pocket change.\n\nIt makes me wonder: What\u2019s the rationale behind these massive discounts, and afterwards, do the game\u2019s developers feel that they benefited? Every developer I spoke with for this story said that deeply discounting their games for a short period has been a success.\n\nAs a marketplace, the Switch eShop is a bit of a black hole. Unlike leading storefronts such as Steam, the eShop offers just a few options to browse for games. Besides the aforementioned Great Deals section, there\u2019s Recent Releases, Featured, Best Sellers, and Coming Soon. You can search by name, genre, and price range, but only the most popular games lead those lists.\n\nOnce a game is off the Recent Releases section, or if it doesn\u2019t sell well enough to be featured in the 30 slots of the Best Sellers list, it may as well not exist. Putting a game on sale is \u201cway to game the system,\u201d said Matt Bitner, creator of the roguelite Metroid-style game A Robot Named Fight. \u201cFor developers that didn\u2019t have a breakout success, it\u2019s a nice way to get more eyes on your game,\u201d Bitner said \u2014 and the lower the price, the more pronounced the effect.\n\nBitner released A Robot Named Fight for Switch on April 25, 2018. Initially, sales were stronger than they had been on Steam, where he had released it earlier. But then they slowed to a trickle.\n\nHis Switch publisher Hitcents had a similar issue with another game, Draw a Stickman: EPIC 2, a few months after it was released in January 2018. It reduced the game\u2019s price of $10 by 30 per cent, and saw sales increase tenfold.\n\nIt was the first time the publisher ran a sale on any of its titles, said Jordan Taylor, the studio\u2019s head. Then at the end of August this year, Hitcents put Draw a Stickman: EPIC 2 on sale for around $1.45.\n\n\u201cThis one made me a bit nervous,\u201d Taylor said. His concerns were put to rest quickly. The sale massively paid off, with 1,000 times more copies sold per day. This earned it a spot on the Best Sellers list. \u201cWe definitely did not expect such a substantial increase,\u201d he said.\n\nHitcents suggested to Bitner that he do the same for A Robot Named Fight. \u201cI was vaguely worried that it may devalue the game, but it was already out on that shop for a year and a half, so I didn\u2019t have a lot of reservations,\u201d Bitner said. He put it on sale for $3, down from its typical price of around $19. \u201cIt was night and day,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that sale it performed better than launch.\u201d\n\nA Robot Named Fight did well enough to land on the Best Sellers page, but there were benefits outside of the eShop: Smaller gaming outlets published stories on the sale, players started streaming gameplay, and people tweeted about it.\n\nBitner wouldn\u2019t share earnings figures, but did say that unit sales of A Robot Named Fight increased 1,500 per cent when it went on sale compared to the previous month. \u201cIt\u2019s done well enough for me to continue making games,\u201d Bitner said.\n\nMembrane. (Screenshot: Perfect Hat)\n\nOne of Seth Scott\u2019s lifelong goals was to release a game on a Nintendo console. Through his development studio Perfect Hat Games, he accomplished that goal on February 22, 2018, when the psychedelic puzzle-platformer Membrane hit the eShop for $15.\n\nBut before Scott launched his game, he had studied how the eShop operated.\n\n\u201cWe got some visibility in the Coming Soon section,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we saw that once we were out of that page, our sales would drop to practically nothing. We had the idea to start experimenting with putting it on sale and hopefully get into the Great Deals section.\u201d\n\nMembrane has been placed on sale a few times now, with Perfect Hat experimenting with different price points \u2014 from 50 per cent off all the way down to 99 per cent \u2014 to see what works best. What worked best, he found, was the 9-cent price point.\n\n\u201cWe want to find the sweet spot where people buy it without thinking about it,\u201d said Scott, who added that most of the money brought in for the game has been during sales. \u201cWe just eclipsed 100,000 sales with our last discount of 99 per cent off,\u201d he said. Only 1 per cent of those sales were made when the game was at full price.\n\nMembrane Is A Trippy Physics Platformer Inside Someone's Body I can't explain precisely how a fly that didn't get into some bloke's eyeballs triggers a puzzle platformer, but hey, that's what you're dealing with in Membrane. Good, but very weird. Read more\n\nScott, too, found that doing a drastic sale helped Membrane\u2019s visibility in venues outside the Switch\u2019s eShop front door. \u201cUsually, when we put it on sale, random Reddit posts pop up and people post YouTube videos,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Scott and Bitner were willing to sell their games at steep discounts, Milan Babu\u0161kov of Bigosaur said he couldn\u2019t do the same for his game, Son of a Witch.\n\nHe\u2019d spent three years developing it, he said, so he didn\u2019t want to feel like he was devaluing his work or cheapening the purchase of customers who paid for the game at its full $22 price or at the modest 30 per cent discount he had once offered. Rather than putting an extreme discount on Son of a Witch, he changed the way he developed games going forward.\n\n\u201cI cannot compete with companies like Forever Entertainment or QubicGames, who develop small games and push new ones all the time,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cSo I decided to go into smaller games myself as well. I had been developing a lot of small games in the past, most of those open source or free to download. I started to port some of my old projects to Switch, with updated graphics and improved game mechanics. I sold those games for as low as 30 cents on eShop.\u201d\n\nThe strategy appears to be working for Babu\u0161kov. One of his games, Quest for the Golden Duck, made its way onto the digital-only Best Sellers list after being discounted from $15 to $0.57.\n\nQuest For The Golden Duck. (Screenshot: Bigosaur)\n\n\u201cThe price does not matter much and it might even be good to keep the price high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the rankings are done by number of copies sold, so the more units you sell the more visibility you get.\u201d\n\nTaylor did have a word of caution for developers looking to discount their own games. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run a severe discount on a product that I\u2019m not confident won\u2019t provide something of value to the player,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, I\u2019m not going to publish a lousy game and then spam sale after sale just to inflate numbers. Consumers face enough of a struggle buying games that are properly fun, so I\u2019d really hate to see a marketplace filled with countless half-baked titles all discounted to a dollar just to achieve similar results.\u201d\n\nWhile Bitner, Scott, and Babu\u0161kov all agreed that the Nintendo eShop could be vastly improved in terms of user controls and curation, discounting remains for now the best solution for developers hoping to get their games into players\u2019 hands, and perhaps create enough goodwill that players will buy their future projects.\n\n\u201cWhen people play Membrane and post about it and reach out, those are the ultimate moments that are satisfying as a game developer,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIf [sales] help that happen more often, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nStephen J.
