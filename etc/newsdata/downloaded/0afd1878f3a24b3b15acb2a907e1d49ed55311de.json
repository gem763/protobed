Supporters cheer \u201cfour more years\u201d as U.S. President Trump rallies in Dallas, Texas\n\nBy Steve Holland\n\nDALLAS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at a campaign rally at Democratic opponents like \"crazy Nancy\" Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, for pushing an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"The more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. They're crazy. They're crazy,\" Trump said at a packed American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) Center in downtown Dallas.\n\nPelosi accused Trump of having a \"meltdown\" after walking out of a White House meeting on Wednesday where she and other Democratic leaders complained about his decision to pull U.S. troops from northeastern Syria and allow Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies in the area.\n\n\"Crazy Nancy. That Crazy Nancy, she is crazy,\" Trump said of Pelosi.\n\nTrump has faced a backlash from his own Republican allies in Congress for the Syria pullout, but the president on Thursday said a ceasefire negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had helped ease the crisis.\n\nPelosi opened an impeachment inquiry in the House on revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a \"witch hunt\" and said Democrats are trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election that he won.\n\n\"At stake in this fight is the survival of American democracy itself,\" he said. \"That's what they want. But we will never let it happen.\"\n\nTrump's appearance in Dallas was aimed at rallying his core base of voter support in a state that he is favored to win in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nTexas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976 but an increase in Democratic voters in big cities like Austin and Houston could make it a closer race in 2020 than it has been in the past.\n\nTrump would not be expected to be re-elected should he lose the state's 38 electoral votes.\n\nTrump was concluding a long day in Texas in which he raised $5.5 million for his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee at two events.\n\nHe also cut the ribbon on a Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, Texas, where workers will produce the high-end fashion products made famous by the French company.\n\nThe company's billionaire controlling shareholder, Bernard Arnault, joined Trump for the event at the 100,000-square-foot (9,290-square-meter) plant.\n\n\"Louis Vuitton, a name I know well - cost me a lot of money over the years,\" said Trump.\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate from Texas who is lagging in the polls, staged a competing event in Grand Prairie, Texas, featuring performances by Lil' Keke, Cure for Paranoia and NuFolk Rebel Alliance.\n\n\"This president has trafficked in hate and racism. He has tried to make people afraid of our differences. But tonight, Texans are going to come together and we are going to stand up to all of that,\" O'Rourke said in a tweet.", "description": "Trump blasts 'crazy' Nancy Pelosi, Democrats at raucous Dallas rally", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H03V_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
