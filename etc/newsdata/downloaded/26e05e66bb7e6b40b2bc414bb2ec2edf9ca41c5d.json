It expects the moves to save it about $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) a year by the end of its 2022 fiscal year.\n\nHP announced the job cuts Thursday at a meeting with Wall Street analysts headlined by incoming CEO Enrique Lores. He had been overseeing the HP division that includes its profitable business of selling ink for the company's printers before being named to the top job last month.\n\nThe workforce reductions come as the Palo Alto, California, company wraps up a three-year restructuring plan that included the elimination of up to 5,000 jobs.\n\nHP was created in 2015 when Hewlett Packard split is PC and printer operations from its businesses specialising in data-centre hardware and business software. That part is now known as Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nHP's stock is down 10 per cent so far this year, while the benchmark Standard &Poor's 500 index is up 16 per cent.\n\nReuters", "description": "The personal computer maker said the revamp will generate about $1.5 billion a year in savings by the end of its fiscal 2022 year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.406%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_984%2C$y_1066/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2fced33ccd1165ac35f307b66f33b2eaa5f7e048", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
