Core operating earnings fell to $895 million or $1.45 per share, from $1.89 billion or $3.58 per share, a year earlier.\n\nThe profit slump and a trio of industrial setbacks capped a tumultuous week for the world's largest planemaker, which is already in the eighth month of a deepening crisis over the grounding of its best-selling single-aisle following deadly crashes.\n\nIt had already announced on Tuesday that it was replacing the head of its commercial-airplanes division.\n\nBoeing Co reported a 53 per cent drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the world's largest planemaker was hurt by the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX jets\n\nThe company ousted Kevin McAllister, in an unexpected management shakeup related to the MAX crisis that senior industry sources say puts Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg squarely in the firing line in the event of further revelations or if the company fails to recover from the MAX crisis.\n\nMuilenburg's title of board chairman was stripped earlier this month.\n\nMcAllister is being replaced Stanley Deal, who has been leading the company's services division.\n\nDeal's challenge to get the MAX back into service globally while simultaneously handling new aircraft deliveries and boosting 737 production is seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry's history.\n\nThe shake-up in Boeing's top ranks came just days after the release of internal communications that showed a senior test pilot experienced serious problems while testing flight-control software for the 737 Max on a simulator.\n\nThat software, called MCAS, is at the center of investigations into the two crashes that killed 346 people and led to grounding of the Max. Boeing is taking much longer than executives expected to change the software and get the plane flying again.\n\nThe 737 Max had been grounded worldwide since March, after the second of two fatal crashes in in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, which operates the largest domestic 737 Max fleet, recently extended their cancellation of flights on the plans through at least February.\n\nBoeing said it was sticking to its expectation that the MAX would return to service in the fourth quarter, though the timeline was at the mercy of regulators conducting certification reviews.\n\n'Our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, and we're making steady progress,' Muilenburg said in a statement accompanying the results. Boeing has begun taking steps to increase safety oversight in its industrial operations and at the board level, he added.\n\nBoeing said that Kevin McAllister is out as chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes\n\nRescuers at the scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash outside of Addis Ababa in March\n\nBoeing is under growing pressure to explain what it knew about 737 MAX problems before the aircraft entered service.\n\nThey already said it would redesign the MCAS anti-stall system to rely on more than a single sensor and to help reduce pilot workload.\n\nAnd it is delaying plans to step up production on its 737 line in the Seattle-area through 2019, and said it would not hit a record-level 57 aircraft monthly until late 2020, months later than previously planned.\n\nCiting global trade tensions, it was also reducing the 787 production rate to 12 airplanes per month for approximately two years beginning in late 2020.\n\nIts forthcoming 777X twin-aisle, facing engine issues at General Electric, was progressing through pre-flight testing and remains on track for first flight in early 2020, but the company was now targeting early 2021 for the first delivery of the 777X.", "description": "The company ousted Kevin McAllister, left, Tuesday.
