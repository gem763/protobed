They\u2019re not buying them back. This is gun confiscation. It\u2019s nothing but that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, this is \u2014 what you\u2019re calling for is civil war. What you\u2019re calling for is an incitement to violence. It\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t want to live here when that happened, would you?\u201d Mr. Carlson said later in the segment.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, a former Democratic congressman for Texas, recently spoke in support of banning certain guns following amid rash of deadly mass shootings, including a rampage last month inside a Walmart store in his hometown of El Paso.\n\nAsked over the weekend to address fears that the federal government would confiscate legally purchased assault rifles if elected president, Mr. O\u2019Rourke confirmed, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans who own AR-15s, AK-47s, will have to sell them to the government,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said Saturday.\n\nSpokespeople for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to confiscate firearms from tens of millions of law-abiding Americans whether it works or not, and he doesn\u2019t care what you think about it,\u201d Mr. Carlson said.\n\nVirtually all Democratic candidates seeking the party\u2019s nomination to compete next year against President Trump have endorsed various gun reform measures, ranging from banning semi-automatic rifles to enacting \u201cred flag\u201d laws that would block potentially dangerous people owning firearms.\n\nAround two-thirds of registered U.S. voters supporting banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons, according to the results of a Fox News poll conducted in the aftermath of last month\u2019s back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio. Conducted less than 24 hours apart, the rampages resulted in a combined 29 deaths and dozens of injuries.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
