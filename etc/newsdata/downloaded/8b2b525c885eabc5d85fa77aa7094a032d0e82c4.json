And all while in the background waved flags from communist countries.\n\nThat really says all that needs to be said and tells all that needs to be told about the left.\n\nElijah Schaffer, a journalist for The Blaze who covered the event \u2014 and who was maced by antifa-types as he was filming the antifa-types\u2019 violence \u2014 put it this way in a couple of tweets: \u201cTrump supporters are literally fleeing the event after it ended. \u2026 It is not safe in Minneapolis any longer for Trump supporters. Please stay away \u2026 do not come out with branded gear.\u201d\n\nAnother: \u201cThe situation outside the Trump rally in Minnesota is quickly deteriorating. Left-wing protesters are destroying barricades. A protester can be seen waving the Chinese flag in front of riot police. While people in Hong Kong wave American flags for freedom, we wave Chinese flags.\u201d\n\nYes. Chinese flags of communism.\n\nHow tragic.\n\nThis is the fault of our public school systems, filled with left-wing talking mouths spouting left-wing globalist crap, all at the command and demand of the teacher first, student second unions.\n\nThis is the fault of our Democratic Party leaders who went to great length at the outset of Trump\u2019s administration to call for summers of resistance, for open rebellion in the streets, for aggressive protests against all-things-Republican, even to the point of bringing the confrontations to GOPers as they ate in restaurants, shopped in stores, relaxed at home.\n\nThis is the fault of the previous administration\u2019s exalting of racial matters to the point of creationism \u2014 to the point of pretending for a gullible press that catchy phrases such as \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d were actually grounded in factual cases of white officers targeting black innocents for killing. And for what purpose? To advance a narrative that America is inherently racist and therefore, needs a complete revamp.\n\nThis is the fault of cowed Republicans, elected to office to fight such fake narratives, only to sit back, stay silent and even cut deals with the very ones they were elected to fight.\n\nThis is the fault of misguided physicians, over-prescribing behavioral controlling, mind-altering pills to little kids; this is the fault of parents who don\u2019t know how to parent \u2014 and in many cases, who don\u2019t want to parent; this is the fault of special interest groups and agenda-driven organizations that fashion realities out of thin air, and demand others recognize those fabrications as truths.\n\nBut most of all, this is the fault of a nation that\u2019s pulled all-things-God from the public, insisting that prayers from, say, football coaches have no place in American modern society, or that displays of, say, the Bible on military bases are counter to the Constitution. And the effect has rippled. Case after case, report after report, court battle after court battle \u2014 the message has been sent far and wide that this country has gone secular and those who don\u2019t agree should either shut up or prepare to be sued.\n\nThe secularization of our schools, our homes, our culture, our politics, even our churches, has brought about a society that cares little for common courtesies, displays zero tolerance for opposing views and places almost no regard on human life.\n\nAntifa types.\n\nDemocrats.\n\nThe intolerants of the left.\n\n\u201cProtesters light MAGA hats on fire outside of \u2018Keep America Great\u2019 rally in Minnesota,\u201d Fox News reported.\n\nAll the while waving communist flags.\n\nWelcome to America, Democrat style. Simply put: If the left gains control of the White House and Senate, and maintains leadership in the House, this is how America will look.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
