We take about 300 in each year. Some people finish it quickly, some take a bit longer.\u201d\n\nAGSM has also rolled out different formats for its executive MBA, which starts with a residential module before giving students the option to mix face-to-face and online learning.\n\nDespite the overall enrolment numbers, individual classes remain small. \u201cWhen we do online courses, we tend to have groups of 20 to 25 with an individual facilitator,\u201d Wailes says. \u201cIf there\u2019s additional demand \u2013 a lot of people want to do digital innovation, for example \u2013 we add more streams.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep it small because in an MBA you learn as much from the people you are studying with as from the facilitators of the program.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Queensland MBA director Dr Nicole Hartley says the demand for flexibility is fuelled by the changing nature of students\u2019 work.\n\nThe leaders of tomorrow ... need high-level skill sets around the ability to negotiate, communicate and have empathy. \u2014 Dr Nicole Hartley, University of Queensland MBA director\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people needing to be placed globally or shift and be more mobile in their jobs, and it is our remit to respond to that in different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are one of the most flexible face-to-face programs, and we offer all our courses not just as semester-long courses but as intensive offerings, weekend and night-time offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are mid-year offerings, over-Christmas offerings, the ability to take a semester off. We have a few MBAs coming in from Defence who are deployed overseas for a period of time and who can just take the time off and then build up the course with intensives.\u201d\n\nThe university is also working towards executive education micro-credentials \u2013 short skills-based intensive study opportunities that can either top up existing MBAs or be bundled together to lead to a full master's or MBA program. But rather than offering these solely online, as is the case with many micro-credential providers, UQ will probably offer them in a blended format combining online with face-to-face learning, Hartley says.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the leaders of tomorrow, they need high-level skill sets around the ability to negotiate, communicate and have empathy,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cTo us, the value in the MBA is being able to hone those skills while having access to the material when you need it, where you need it, and then you couple that with the powerful experience of coming together as a cohort.\u201d", "description": "The ability to fit study around busy schedules is the top consideration for MBA students when deciding on a business school.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2533%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_73/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b93faaa647563836a0776c88ba29ad7aa6ed68ab", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
