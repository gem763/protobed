We have to win this,\u201d California Air Resources Board chairwoman Mary Nichols said, adding that she\u2019s been paying her dues to the State Bar of California \u201cjust in readiness for this moment,\u201d so that she could be part of the litigation.\n\nShortly before she spoke, Trump tweeted out confirmation that he was revoking a waiver that\u2019s long allowed the state to establish its own tailpipe emissions policy, upending decades of bipartisan support for that exception.\n\nThe president argued that revoking the waiver would make cars cheaper and safer while making little difference in emissions and creating more jobs.\n\n\u201cThis is simply inaccurate,\u201d Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom retorted on Twitter, saying the looser standards Trump wants would cost consumers $400 billion and result in \u201c320 billion more gallons of oil burned and spewed into our air.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, accusing Trump of being in oil companies\u2019 pockets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the oil industry, period,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the car manufacturers, not about consumers. ... It\u2019s not about our economy. It\u2019s about oil companies.\u201d\n\nCar makers are also on board with California\u2019s standards, which landed four of the biggest brands in the industry in a public spat with Trump last month after they reached a voluntary agreement with California on fuel efficiency rules.\n\nTrump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge that human activities \u2014 like driving \u2014 are causing climate change remains at the center of this fight.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to backslide in our battle against climate change,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Wednesday. \u201cFor us, this is about survival. Our communities are screaming for help to address the climate crisis. Unlike the Trump administration, we don\u2019t run scared.\u201d", "description": "The president announced Wednesday that he's revoking the state's legal authority to set its own auto emissions standards.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82716e240000d3267db4db.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
