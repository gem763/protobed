And that\u2019s the one thing that Antonio Brown has shown me, that he\u2019s not willing to sacrifice anything for anybody else besides himself.\u201d\n\nDungy criticized Patriots owner Robert Kraft for rewarding a player\u2019s bad behavior.\n\n\u201cI really think this sent the wrong message,\u201d Dungy said. \u201cI know coaches want to win, but I\u2019m disappointed in Robert Kraft. I think at some point you say, just as an organization, \u2018We are not going to do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown couldn\u2019t sign until Monday, so he missed New England\u2019s 33-3 wipeout of the Steelers , a dismantling that suggests the Patriots don\u2019t need much help defending their latest title.\n\nWhile Belichick gives newcomers a clean slate, Brown has \u201calways been a \u2018me\u2019 guy,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI\u2019m not a big believer he\u2019s going to come in and fit in the \u2018Patriot Way.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther notable Week 1 decisions, when Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s Browns debut was most notable because he was wearing a $250,000 watch during the game:\n\nSEEING RED\n\nEvery year there\u2019s angst in the preseason over a new NFL rule, and come opening weekend the fuss seems rather frivolous. This time, it was the league\u2019s new pass interference policy allowing coaches to challenge both calls and non-calls.\n\nIn the preseason, there were 15 challenges to flags that were thrown for pass interference and zero were overturned. Of the 29 challenges for non-calls, seven resulted in a penalty upon review.\n\nThe rule stemmed from officials\u2019 failure to flag a blatant penalty in the NFC championship, and the lack of a flag for pass interference or roughness helped the Rams beat the Saints and advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile it\u2019s likely to come into play this season and have a major impact on a game\u2019s outcome, the new rule was largely inconsequential on opening weekend.\n\nCoaches went 1 for 4, with the Buccaneers\u2019 Bruce Arians lodging the only successful P.I. challenge.\n\nArians threw his flag after an incomplete deep pass from Jameis Winston to Mike Evans in the first quarter, saying 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman should have been flagged. Upon review, the officials agreed and penalized Sherman.\n\nThe Packers (for a non-call), the Vikings (for a call) and the Seahawks (just because) all lost P.I. challenges.\n\nSTILL KICKING\n\nIndy\u2019s loss to Kansas City in the playoffs on Jan. 12 turned out to be Andrew Luck\u2019s final game , but at the time, Colts fans feared it was Adam Vinatieri\u2019s farewell after he missed an extra point and a 23-yard field goal.\n\nVinatieri returned at age 46, but his 24th NFL season got off to a horrible start Sunday with the worst game of a storied career that features four Super Bowl rings.\n\nVinatieri missed an extra point and two field goals for the first time in his career, which spans 386 games, including playoffs. The misses came from 26 and 49 yards in regulation of the Colts\u2019 30-24 overtime loss to the Chargers.\n\n\u201cI feel lousy because the guys played their butts off against a really good Chargers team and they played well enough to win,\u201d Vinatieri said. \u201cI didn\u2019t help them out.\u201d\n\nIN STAFFORD WE TRUST\n\nTop overall pick Kyler Murray wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to rally Arizona from an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to tie Detroit 27-27 were it not for a blunder by the Lions coaching staff.\n\nA livid Matthew Stafford was caught by television cameras appearing to twice say, \u201cTrust me!\u201d after the sideline called a timeout as the play clock was winding down before a third-and-5 play in the fourth quarter.\n\nStafford found J.J McKissic on a screen pass that likely would have iced it were the play not blown dead.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell made the timeout signal, but head coach Matt Patricia said he calls the timeouts. Patricia insisted Monday there\u2019s no trust issue with the 11th-year quarterback.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As far as critics are concerned - along with fans of the Steelers, Raiders and even some Patriots backers - A.B. is TNT.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/steelers_patriots_football_90605_c0-101-2454-1531_s1770x1032.jpg?35427f2ca185e47ab58b88faf79318e85b3216e0", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
