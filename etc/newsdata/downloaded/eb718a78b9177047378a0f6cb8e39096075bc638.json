Or, worse, is it actually a detriment? This World Series has already broken ground as the first in which the visiting team won the first six games. That is especially remarkable considering that the Astros had the best home record in baseball this regular season (60-21). What, then, explains this anomaly? None of the players, coaches or managers (or reporters) have any clear reasons for it, other than pure fluke. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, really,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said after Game 6. \u201cI mean, we can\u2019t explain it. I know we were trying to win games at home and just couldn\u2019t do it. We came here today and, like I say, behind Stephen Strasburg we played really well.\u201d\n\nThe Game 7 matchup is just as intriguing as Game 6 was, between Strasburg and Justin Verlander. Tonight will feature Max Scherzer for the Nationals against Zack Greinke of the Astros. Greinke has been O.K. in the postseason, but Scherzer has been stellar. The only question is, will he be healthy? Scherzer was supposed to start Game 5 in Washington on Sunday, but was scratched because of spasms in his upper back and neck. He said it was so bad the morning of the game that he could not lift his arm, and his wife had to help him dress. He took a cortisone shot later that day, which takes about 48 hours to work. On Tuesday afternoon, Scherzer threw in the outfield before the game and proclaimed himself ready to go for Game 7. As it turned out, he was even ready to go by Game 6. He warmed up in the Nationals\u2019 bullpen during the gamem, and if Anthony Rendon had not hit a two-run homer in the seventh to extend Washington\u2019s lead to 5-2, Scherzer may have gone into the game for the bottom of that inning. \u201cThere were a lot of phone calls those last three innings,\u201d said Sean Doolittle, the Nationals relief pitcher. \u201cBut he was ready to go. He looked good. He looked clean and full on ready to go.\u201d\n\nGame 6 featured some entertaining histrionics between the cleanup hitters for both teams, but it is doubtful it will carry over to Game 7. Alex Bregman homered in the first inning and carried his bat all the way to first base, a serious no-no in baseball etiquette. Then four innings later, Juan Soto hit a titanic blast into the upper reaches of the second deck at Minute Maid Park, and he also carried his bat to first base. Soto said he thought what Bregman did \u201clooked really cool. I wanted to do it, too.\u201d", "description": "The 2019 M.L.B. season comes down to one game.
