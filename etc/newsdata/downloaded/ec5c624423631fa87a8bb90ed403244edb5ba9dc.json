It has stimulated them.\u201d\n\nJohnson was embroiled in heated exchanges in the Commons last week, when he dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d pleas from Labour MP Paula Sherriff to stop describing the Benn act as the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.\n\nSherriff had said that death threats to MPs often quoted Johnson\u2019s words, such as \u201c\u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019\u201d and she had called on him to \u201cmoderate his language\u201d.\n\nTimeline A history of recent attacks linked to white nationalism Show Hide In the past decade, across continents, white supremacists have repeatedly chosen the same targets for shootings, stabbings, bombings and car attacks. Ut\u00f8ya island and in Oslo, Norway 77 killed in a bomb attack, followed by a shooting targeting the island summer youth camp of Norway\u2019s Labor party. The shooter wanted to prevent an 'invasion of Muslims' and deliberately targeted politically active young people who he saw as 'cultural Marxists'. More than half of the dead were teenagers.\n\nSikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, US Six worshippers including the temple president are killed. The shooter, a ''frustrated neo-Nazi' who had played in white power bands, was a regular on racist websites. He had previously talked to one colleague in the US military about a 'racial holy war that was coming'. Piraeus, Greece Rapper and anti-fascist activist Pavlos Fyssas was stabbed to death. A senior member of Greece\u2019s neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was imprisoned after confessing to the killing. Overland Park, Kansas, US A former Ku Klux Klan leader shot and killed three people at a Jewish centre and retirement home, one of them just 14 years old. He said he believed Jews were destroying the white race, and that diversity was a kind of genocide. Charleston, South Carolina, US Nine people killed during Bible study at a historic black church. The victims included elderly longtime church members at the Mother Emanuel AME church, and Clementa Pinckney, a state senator. The shooter, a self-avowed white supremacist, said he wanted to start a race war.\n\nTrollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden An attacker stabbed students and teachers at a high school, targeting those with darker skin, police said. Three died, including 15-year-old Ahmed Hassan, who was born in Somalia and had recently moved to Sweden. Birstall, West Yorkshire, UK Labour MP Jo Cox shot and stabbed to death a week before the EU referendum vote in 2016. The man convicted of killing her, a white supremacist obsessed with the Nazis and apartheid-era South Africa, shouted: 'This is for Britain,' 'Keep Britain independent' and 'Britain first' as he killed her. Quebec City, Canada Six people killed and nineteen injured during evening prayers at a mosque in a shooting which the gunman said was prompted by Justin Trudeau\u2019s tweet that refugees were welcome in Canada, and that 'diversity is strength'. New York, US Timothy Caughman stalked and killed by a white supremacist with a sword. His killer, an American military veteran, said he targeted a random black man on the street in New York City as a 'practice run' for a bigger attack, and as part of a campaign to persuade white women not to enter into interracial relationships. Portland, Oregon Two men were killed and one injured after they tried to intervene to protect young women on a public train who were being targeted with an anti-Muslim tirade. Their alleged killer shouted 'Free speech or die' in the courtroom, and 'Death to Antifa!' Finsbury Park, London, UK One killed and 12 people injured after a van ploughed into worshippers outside a mosque.

Christchurch, New Zealand 51 people were killed and 49 injured in two consecutive attacks on mosques during Friday prayers. The gunman live-streamed the first attack on Facebook Live.

Walmart shooting, El Paso, Texas 21 people killed after a shooter opened fire at a busy Walmart store packed with families shopping. Two dozen more were injured. The 21-year-old white male suspect had driven nine hours to reach his target. and had posted a \"manifesto\" on 8chan. Lois Beckett and Martin Belam\n\nPro-remain MP Dominic Grieve said that he had received a death threat this weekend, after the Mail on Sunday quoted a government spokesman saying that he and the two other MPs who had drawn up the bill to prevent a no deal Brexit were under investigation over whether they had been \u201cengaged in collusion with foreign powers\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe direct consequence,\u201d Grieve said, \u201cwas a death threat as I came up on the train [to Conservative party conference]. There is a direct causal link between the two, indeed the death threat came accompanied by the Mail on Sunday article.\u201d\n\nJoe Mulhall, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, which monitors the far right, described the model as \u201cpost-organisational\u201d and said he believed one goal was to expand what is known as the \u201cOverton window\u201d, the range of ideas tolerated in public debate.\n\n\u201cSome of the language we see more widely now, such as \u2018traitors\u2019 and \u2018betrayal\u2019, this is absolutely the language of the far right,\u201d he said.\n\nEntry-level groups, such as the Tommy Robinson channel, which has 50,700 subscribed accounts, act as gateways for like-minded individuals to connect online, with the next step for some being to join closed chat groups and sharing material.\n\nBrexit is not the only issue to interest far-right supporters: other dominant themes are anti-Muslim hatred, white supremacism or cultural nationalism.\n\nIdeas are spread internationally, most notably the conspiracy theory of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d, which is based on the false claim that so-called indigenous European people will be outnumbered by Muslims.\n\nHow Canada\u2019s far right is using anti-Muslim propaganda to target Trudeau Read more\n\nTypically people are asked to prove their belief in order to join a closed group by photographing themselves with Nazi regalia or far-right texts, or asked to undertake a simple task such as distributing fascistic or anti-Muslim leaflets.\n\nIndividuals joining such groups tend to be male, aged 15 to 25, and show some level of technological sophistication, using encrypted communications and trying to hide their true identities online.\n\nDirect incitement is rare but a pressing concern is whether individuals could become radicalised, \u201clone actors\u201d such as Thomas Mair, the reclusive, white supremacist who assassinated Labour MP Jo Cox, or Darren Osborne, who was found guilty of murder after driving a van into a crowd of Muslims near a London mosque.\n\nOne UK based neo-Nazi group, National Action, was proscribed in 2016, becoming the first far-right group to be banned since the second world war. One of its members, who was also a convicted paedophile, was found guilty of a plot to murder Labour MP Rosie Cooper with a machete in May.\n\nHowever, a cluster of offshoots are not banned and remain active in the UK: the Sonnenkrieg Division, System Resistance Network and the Feuerkrieg Division, the last of which last month posted an image of the West Midlands chief constable with a gun pointed to his head.\n\nMI5 became the lead intelligence agency in investigating far-right networks last year. Until then, far-right subjects of interest did not form part of the agency\u2019s files, covering a little over 20,000 people, but since then intelligence officers have been surprised by how often such individuals have been included in the highest category of potential threat.\n\nLast month, police said that the fastest growing terrorist threat in the UK came from the far right, which accounted for a third of all disrupted terror plots since the Westminster attack in 2017. A particular concern is that some people on the far right are able to gain access to firearms, which Islamist terrorists traditionally find difficult to do.", "description": "Experts say extremists respond to mainstream use of words such as \u2018traitors\u2019 or \u2018betrayal\u2019", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83816e39091741d3c688d405d42df0568181f165/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd770d42413966ad5398e9c5902951f4", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
