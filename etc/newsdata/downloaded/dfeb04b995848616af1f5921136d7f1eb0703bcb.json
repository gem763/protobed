When I was younger, everybody was telling me what was wrong with my body \u2014 too this, too that. When I got on \u2018Basic Instinct,\u2019 they hired a makeup artist that put on pounds of makeup every day, and every day I went to my trailer and took the makeup off. But I wasn\u2019t allowed to choose my makeup artist, nor was my name [above the title] on the poster.\u201d\n\nSharon Stone stars in the new issue of Allure. (Photo: Emma Summerton for Allure) More\n\nStone said her appreciation for her body isn\u2019t just about looks, though. It\u2019s also about how she feels and what she thinks \u2014 particularly after her long recovery from experiencing a stroke in 2001.\n\n\u201cI started to understand that I was going to go for being more like a European woman who got more beautiful with age and who could understand that women are more beautiful than girls because they know something,\u201d she said.\n\nSharon Stone is on the cover of Allure's November issue. (Photo: Emma Summerton for Allure) More\n\nStone recalled her early days in Hollywood, when she took that career-making role in \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d or her parts in \u201cCasino\u201d and \u201cThe Quick and the Dead,\u201d and how women, including Shirley MacLaine and Faye Dunaway, were kind to her. She\u2019s tried to do the same for the younger generation.\n\n\u201cI do when I see a talent like Margot Robbie \u2014 she is just the cat\u2019s pajamas. I am nuts about her,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWhen I was going in to the Golden Globes, [Tonya Harding] was in front of me and didn\u2019t know how to go through the press line. She was discombobulated. I\u2019m like, \u2018Let me show you what to do. Put your purse under the arm that you\u2019re going to pick up your skirt with, then go up the stairs.\u201d\n\nSharon Stone says her 40s were her favorite age.
