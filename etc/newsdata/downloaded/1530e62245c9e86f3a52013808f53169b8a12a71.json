The tone was set by an artistic performance that opened the forum, portraying hordes of people from the south and east advancing on Europe.\n\nEurope's south and east worry more about emigration than immigration \u2013 poll Read more\n\n\u201cEurope has become the continent of the empty crib whereas in Asia and Africa they face demographic challenges of the opposite type,\u201d said Katalin Nov\u00e1k, Hungary\u2019s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs.\n\nThe two-day summit was also attended by Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, and Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, who both said boosting birthrates was a priority for the long-term development of their countries. Vu\u010di\u0107 said his country was losing the equivalent of the population of a medium-sized town each year. \u201cSerbian people have one expression for negative population growth: the white flag,\u201d he said.\n\nNov\u00e1k, in previous written responses to questions from the Guardian, said the Hungarian government doubled family spending between 2010 and 2019, with the goal of achieving \u201ca lasting turn in demographic processes by 2030\u201d. Fertility rates have gone up from 1.2 to 1.5 children per woman, according to government figures. This is still far from the 2.1 figure the UN says is the number required for a sustainable population.\n\nGovernments across central Europe have introduced financial incentives for having children, with Poland introducing the 500+ scheme, which pays parents 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a3103) a month per child from the second child onwards. The Polish scheme was extended in July this year to cover every child, including the first one, without any income threshold\n\nBabi\u0161 said the Czech Republic also wanted to encourage big families. \u201cIt is the third child which is of key importance \u2026 We do not wish to bribe anyone to have a third child, but we must provide support primarily to families who voluntarily undertake the third child,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year the Hungarian government introduced a 10m forint (\u00a327,000) interest-free loan for families, which does not have to be paid back if the couple has three children.\n\nNov\u00e1k denied that this could put pressure on women to have children: \u201cContrary to the unjustified and politically motivated accusations, we do not want to force anyone to have children \u2026 It\u2019s shocking that we are constantly attacked for trying to support families by all means available.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2019 to add that the Polish 500+scheme was extended in July this year to cover every child, including the first one.", "description": "Hungarian PM invokes far-right \u2018great replacement\u2019 theory at Budapest demography summit", "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e655487050b1d67a90ee71d10990ba786ef7eb3/0_396_4450_2670/master/4450.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b70c4a160ec813c867f1538aef01ba1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
