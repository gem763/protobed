The financing comes less than eight months after the company raised its $20 million Series A (which we reported on here), bringing its total raised to $78 million.\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nFounded in Europe in 2013, Blueground formally launched in the U.S. in the summer of 2018. The company has a unique strategy. It leases apartments and then upgrades, and fully furnishes them, making them available for renters looking for \u201cturnkey\u201d rentals. Blueground typically leases apartments before they hit the market, with a goal of holding them for many years. The startup, which has partnered with more than 2,000 landlords, leases those apartments to \u201cvetted\u201d renters for time periods ranging from 30 days to a year, or longer.\n\nIt caters to business travelers and remote workers primarily. In addition to offering WiFi, blueground equips its rentals with smart TVs, \u201chigh-end gadgets\u201d and guest support through a Blueground app.\n\nCEO and co-founder Alex Chatzieleftheriou said he founded the company after having spent five years traveling from city to city as a consultant, living almost exclusively in hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, being confined to such a small space gets old fairly quickly, not to mention the amount of money my employer at the time was spending on accommodations, an amount that exceeded $10,000 per month in some cases,\u201d he told Crunchbase News. \u201cHowever, alternative options were limited and hardly made sense for my situation. It was impossible to find an apartment to lease for less than a year, and even if you could, you\u2019d have to furnish the place or compromise with the few available, typically unattractive furnished options.\u201d\n\nThe experience sparked the Blueground concept, which Chatzieleftheriou said offers users an option that is about 30 to 50 percent less expensive than hotels, with about \u201cthree times the space.\u201d The app also offers a relocation function that allows renters \u201cto experience new apartments in different neighborhoods and cities on demand.\u201d\n\nTo date, the company has built a portfolio of more than 2,800 apartments in nine cities around the world, including NYC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Dubai, Istanbul and Athens, Greece. Blueground said its revenue grew 200 percent year-over-year in 2018 (although we don\u2019t know the base from which it grew), a metric Chatzieleftheriou expects to meet again in 2019.\n\nHe also said Blueground has \u201csurpassed more than one million nights spent by over 10,000 guests\u201d in its rentals. The company currently has more than 400 employees, up from 280 at the time of its last raise in March, and from 200 a year ago.\n\nBlueground also plans to keep hiring with the goal of doubling its headcount over the next 12 months as it adds new markets and grows its staff in existing markets. In particular, it\u2019s looking to hire engineers and data scientists, Chatzieleftheriou said.\n\n\u201cOur guests are typically relocating into a new city as part of a work-related or other move,\u201d Chatzieleftheriou said. \u201cThe idea of one\u2019s home being a fixed, long-term commitment is changing as more people are choosing to live in multiple cities.\u201d\n\nBlueground plans to use its new capital in part to further expand its presence in both the United States and Europe. Specifically, by year\u2019s end, Blueground plans to begin offering rentals in London, Paris and Seattle. Its goal is to be in over 50 \u201cbusiness and tech hubs\u201d by 2023. The company also plans to use the money toward technology development, product design and \u201cguest experience.\u201d\n\nWestCap Partner Charlie Young will be joining Blueground\u2019s board as part of the new financing.\n\nIn general, the real estate tech space is heating up. In July, we covered Fifth Wall Ventures\u2019 raising $503 million for its second fund to invest almost exclusively in real estate tech companies. And just last month, we reported on Divvy Homes\u2019 $43 million Series B round it raised to help in its mission to help more Americans \u201cmove from renters to [home]owners.\u201d\n\nBlog Roll Illustration: Li-Anne Dias", "description": "", "authors": ["Mary Ann Azevedo"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAIN-Blueground-Apartment-San-Francisco-e1571782603598.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
