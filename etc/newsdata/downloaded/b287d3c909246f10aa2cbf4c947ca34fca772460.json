Who in 1914 would have thought the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb nationalist would trigger events leading to World War I? Or that in the 1990s, the uncompromising game of another nationalist would bring about new Balkan wars, calling forth the united efforts of NATO?\n\nPopulism is on the rise in key Western nations and events in one region can quickly give impetus to movements elsewhere. The re-election in 2010 of the right-wing populist Fidesz government in Hungary was such an event. And there are now right-wing populist governments in Poland and Serbia.\n\nBleak years\n\nPoland and Hungary are both facing unprecedented EU Treaty Article 7 proceedings over allegations they have breached the common values of the EU, including the rule of law. The EU Commission expressed similar concerns in a report on Serbia\u2019s EU candidature earlier this year.\n\nThe October 13 elections were the most important in Poland since 1989. While exit polls say Law and Justice has won overall, it has apparently lost control of the Senate.\n\nThis may give some small comfort to those in the opposition who remember Solidarity\u2019s victory in 1989.\n\nIt is hard for Westerners to imagine the bleakness of the years when Poles endured imprisonment, persecution and appalling living conditions for the common goal of freedom from communism. I will never forget hearing news of Solidarity\u2019s victory, and that people who had been political prisoners were now ministers in a new, freely elected, government.\n\nSo, it is a strange turn of events when Poland\u2019s ruling party is accused of undermining democracy. Law and Justice faces a long list of charges: attacking the independence of the judiciary; assaults on press freedom; bullying of LGBT activists; rejection of gay marriage; refusal to appoint a lay commission to investigate accusations of paedophilia in the church; and corruption scandals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne explanation is that there were people who felt betrayed when the benefits of change did not come their way. Radical surgery was needed to turn the faltering communist economy into a free market. Large state-owned enterprises closed. Older people, the less educated, the poor felt that after hardships endured under communism, the way they lived was no better.\n\nYet the reforms paid off for Poland as a whole: the economy has boomed; many Poles enjoy unprecedented opportunities; there has been no recession since 1992.\n\nWhen it came to power in 2015, Law and Justice argued that the social costs of these reforms were too high. It spends generously on popular social welfare programs like 500 Plus, giving parents a monthly subsidy of 500 zlotys (or $188), for every child. This makes a tremendous difference to a low-income family. Big spending does not seem to hurt the economy, though it helps that Poland receives high levels of EU funding.\n\nMassive demonstrations\n\nWith the support of the Polish Catholic Church, Law and Justice champions national pride, the traditional family and Christianity. This strikes a chord with those who felt their values were out of step with post-1989 Poland.\n\nLaw and Justice\u2019s messages, however, are not universally popular. Massive demonstrations compelled the government to withdraw church-sponsored laws aimed at tightening the already strict control over abortion. The government\u2019s recognition that it had to back down is characteristic of the shrewdness of its leaders.\n\nLaw and Justice admires and emulates Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and his Fidesz Party.\n\nHungary\u2019s transition to democracy was peaceful. The country joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why would there be an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d in Hungary today? Its fledgling democratic institutions were fragile. The socialist coalition government made financial mistakes. In 2008 Lehman Brothers collapsed and Hungary was saved from bankruptcy by a \u20ac19 billion ($31 billion) loan from the IMF and EU.\n\nFidesz was returned in 2010 with a two-thirds majority. Until this week\u2019s municipal elections, when the opposition joined forces to win the key post of mayor of Budapest, Fidesz had won seven consecutive national municipal and European Parliament elections. Even Orban\u2019s opponents acknowledge that support for Fidesz is \u201cmore like a religion\u201d. Its appeal is deeply rooted in Hungarian nationalism.\n\nEven opponents of Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban say support for his Fidesz party is \u201cmore like a religion\u201d. Bloomberg\n\nOrban\u2019s supporters point out that Hungary is free of the migration issues evident elsewhere. According to Orban, political forces in Europe want a \u201creplacement of population for ideological or other reasons\u201d. He rejects this, instead encouraging population growth at home.\n\nFinancial support for families doubled between 2010 and 2019. An interest-free loan of nearly $50,000 for families is gifted if the couple has three children. Orban\u2019s supporters are also proud that, while other EU leaders may not agree with him, they do pay attention to him.\n\nHungary enjoys growth of 3 to 4 per cent. There is almost full employment. It helps that Hungary benefits from generous EU funding.\n\nBut critics of the government point out that it has rewritten the constitution. The Constitutional Court no longer provides real checks and balances. The electoral laws have been changed, allegedly to favour the government. The government has a near monopoly of the media. The opposition has difficulty even obtaining election billboards.\n\nThe government is also taking over education. In a move against the Central European University (and George Soros, its founder), the Higher Education Act was changed to prevent foreign universities from operating in Hungary unless they have a fully fledged campus in their own country. CEU is being forced to move its core functions to Vienna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerbia\u2019s President Aleksandar Vucic has been described as \u201cSerbia\u2019s Orban\u201d.\n\nThe country\u2019s record of fighting on the right side in two world wars was eclipsed by the toxic nationalism of Milosevic. There was hope that after he fell in 2000, new faces would signal a turn to liberal democracy.\n\nVucic, however, was information minister in the Milosevic government. Some others in his cabinet are also former Milosevic government ministers.\n\nVicious attack\n\nVucic\u2019s ruling Progressive Party has a strong majority. Its economic achievements are impressive. Inflation has been contained; the minimum wage is up 42 per cent since 2012; unemployment has been halved. The government claims that the public debt to GDP ratio is about 50 per cent, better than most EU countries. As in Poland and Hungary, supporters say that at least Vucic is trying to achieve something.\n\nBut in Belgrade this August I witnessed one of the Saturday demonstrations which began on December 8, 2018, after a vicious attack hospitalised the opposition politician Borko Stefanovic. The protesters demand free and fair elections, an end to political violence and greater press freedom.\n\nThese political dynamics in central Europe are being overshadowed by Brexit. And in their eagerness to welcome the region\u2019s positive economic news, some may be turning a blind eye to less appealing aspects.\n\nLast week, the European Commission referred Poland to the Court of Justice to protect judges from political control. The EU Article 7 sanctions case against Poland could theoretically deprive the country of its voting rights. But this would require a unanimous vote by member states, and Poland can count on Hungary\u2019s veto. Hungary, too, faces Article 7 proceedings: accusations include silencing independent media, targeting NGOs and removing independent judges. A defiant Orban knows that he can count on a Polish veto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReporting on Serbia\u2019s EU candidature in May this year, the Commission referred to the Saturday demonstrations, and to an urgent need to allow genuine cross-party debate and progress on freedom of expression.\n\nThe EU hopes the Serbian government will deliver a normalisation agreement with Kosovo, a condition for EU membership. The government claims that President Vucic spends 80 per cent of his time on the relationship with Pristina. His opponents claim he does not genuinely want an agreement, which would be unpopular with many Serbs, and is stringing the EU along.\n\nWhat does all this mean for Europe? If there is a leadership vacuum, there are those who are ready to take advantage of it. This would change the character of the EU, and of Europe itself, fundamentally. But it does matter what the rest of the world, including Australia, thinks and does in response.\n\nClare Birgin is a former Australian Ambassador to Hungary and then Serbia, with accreditation to Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania.
