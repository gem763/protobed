(Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nEveryone is talking about Joker.\n\nThe new film from Todd Phillips, starring Joaquin Phoenix as arguably the most famous comic book villain ever, won\u2019t be out until next month. And yet, after initial reviews, film festival reactions, and the prestigious Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival, it\u2019s already one of pop culture\u2019s biggest stories.\n\nWhich makes sense. There\u2019s a lot going on in the film! But before getting to that, some people may wonder, why make this movie at all? Luckily, Gizmodo was among a group of journalists who got to sit down with Phillips and Phoenix in Los Angeles last month and do a lot of talking.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was an interesting way to tell a story,\u201d Phillips said of his approach to Joker. \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting new approach to the comic book world.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a disturbed clown for hire who, through a series of unfortunate events, ends up becoming an ultra-violent villain named Joker. And yet, the film is almost the antithesis of all other comic book movies. It\u2019s a period piece. There are no real special effects.\n\nIf you think about it, it almost didn\u2019t have to be called Joker at all. \u201cCould it have been called \u2018Arthur\u2019 and it just be about a clown? Maybe,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI just thought that there\u2019s a new way to tell a comic book movie, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, but let\u2019s do it as a character statement. A big part of what it should be about, more than making a movie called \u2018Arthur,\u2019 was to kind of deconstruct the comic book movie a little bit.\u201d\n\nOne of the many ways Joker does that by leaving its text wide open to interpretation, which was a mantra very early on in the process.\n\nPhillips and Phoenix on the set of Joker. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\n\u201cPart of, like, the joy of this movie is how the audience interacts with the film, and what they think about the character,\u201d Phoenix said of reactions to the film. \u201cWhenever we got to the part where we felt like we were coming up with a definitive reason for anything, we backed away from it. We found a way to kind of circumnavigate it a little bit.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Joker almost becomes a mirror on its audience. Phillips even mentioned that, while the film is absolutely not a part of the larger DC film universe, people have tried to see it that way, trying to square the circle on how it could fit into a DC timeline where the age gap between the Joker and Batman.\n\nIn the film, Bruce Wayne is played by a young actor named Dante Pereira-Olson, who is nine in real life, while Phoenix is playing Arthur probably in his 40s, though neither character is ever explicitly given an age in the film. By that logic, by the time Bruce becomes Batman, Arthur would be much older than the traditional Joker \u2014 but even to Phillips, that people approached his movie that way was an intriguing reaction.\n\n\u201cPeople I have shown this movie to, they go \u2018Oh, I get it,\u2019\u201d Phillips said. \u201cAnd by the way, I am not saying they\u2019re right but they go \u2018Oh, I get it. He\u2019s not the Joker, he\u2019s the inspiration for the Joker. He is somebody that inspired the Joker.\u2019 And you go \u2018That\u2019s an interesting way to look at it, why?\u2019 and they go, \u2018Oh, their age difference\u2019 and I go \u2018Oh, that\u2019s interesting.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile people can read into the movie however they want, Phillips and Phoenix aimed for most of that reading to be grounded in our reality \u2014 making those interpretations less about comic book lore and more about real-world issues.\n\n\u201cThe movie, in every way, tries to be grounded in reality as much as possible,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt still has a foot in the comic book world, for sure, but we just kept thinking \u2018Let\u2019s put everything through a realistic lens.\u2019 Like why does he have a white face? Well, [are we] going to drop him in acid?... While it\u2019s amazing in the comic books and Jack Nicholson and all that, it doesn\u2019t feel very real that that would happen if you fell into a vat of acid. So let\u2019s come up with a realistic answer for everything.\u201d\n\nThis is how Joker gets his white face in Joker. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nThe film\u2019s setting \u2014 Gotham City in a once again undefined time period, probably in the late \u201870s, early \u201880s \u2014 is also a key factor in conveying what the filmmakers were going for.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of reasons [to set it then],\u201d Phillips said. \u201cOne reason was to separate it, quite frankly, from the DC Universe. When we pitched it to Warner Bros and handed the script in, [we wanted to] make it clear, this isn\u2019t fucking with anything you have going on. This is like a separate universe so much so that it takes place in the past before everything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother reason is [that], tonally, the movie is very much a character study,\u201d Phillips continued. \u201cThese movies we grew up on and loved, you go \u2018God, those movies don\u2019t get made as much anymore.\u2019 They get made, these character studies, but... in the \u201870s and \u201880s, they were much more frequent. It\u2019s also just an old homage to that time. We\u2019re making a movie that feels like that, why not set it there?\u201d\n\nSo yes, everyone is talking about Joker. But in the end, if Phillips and Phoenix were able to ride that line between comics and reality, between the past and present, between social and political, there should be so much to talk about and consider when the credits roll. But in actuality they\u2019re both really hoping is that you don\u2019t want to speak at all.\n\n\u201cI always enjoy movies that are difficult to speak about right after,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cYou go, \u2018I want to process this a little bit.\u2019 I always find those to be particularly rewarding in a way. It\u2019s not like that was a specific goal, but it is something I always enjoy about movies, where you can\u2019t necessarily distill it down into a one-line thing, really simply. So, yeah, I suppose it was somewhat of a goal.\u201d\n\nJoker is in theatres October 3.", "description": "Everyone is talking about Joker.", "authors": ["Victoria Song", "Germain Lussier"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/v8wmbbmb0fxpiyyfohfw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
