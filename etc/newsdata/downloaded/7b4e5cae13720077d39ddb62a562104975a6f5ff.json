By definition social enterprises refer to set of organization which deals with selective social issue and solve it through innovative yet sustainable business model. These enterprises are strategically positioned between profits and social benefits, although social cause gets leverage through long-term low-cost investment from philanthropists and social impact investors.\n\nThere is another side of the story, which deals with higher strata of investors and policy makers; solution which creates value under any Sustainable Development Goal. The social problem gets more focused approach when the mission, vision, objective and value of organization gets aligned with larger SDGs. As the name suggest, sustainability is one of the important factor to dwell upon by the social enterprise promoters.\n\nSDGs are very important for any country and help in mobilizing resources for a cause, specifically social cause. The whole business cycle becomes complete, as it started with social cause, its innovative solution, policy for strengthening ecosystem, donors, investors for putting money in these solutions, low cost of capital for solving social issues and after all acceptance by international community.\n\nAll this is a recipe for employment creation, innovative solutions for social problems, self-reliant institutions, less burden on state economy, attracting venture capital funds for social cause, leveraging private sector competency and executive professionals etc. We can also see the same happened in our country, government supported this through MUDRA, Make in India, Atal Innovation Mission, establishing incubation centers etc. Government also created a separate ministry to address the needs of new entrepreneurs and support them in different aspect from capital to competency to market linkage.\n\nBut then, how successful these new ventures are, the general answer will be No Idea! Although many will say that that these are failed structure and will scrap the whole idea from scratch, but with all due considerations the act is appreciable and is a way forward for country like ours.\n\nOne thing where I feel most of these enterprises miss out is their EXIT Strategy. Exiting from business, whether it is social or not is like telling someone to plan for death. This is tough for those who don\u2019t have adaptability and innovation in their business plan DNA. As Hinduism believes in incarnation, so do the social enterprises should imbibe in itself, to plan for change and adapt itself for new situation.\n\nOne thing all social enterprise promoters need to understand is \u2013 Social problem needs to be solved, that\u2019s their success indicator and the reason for their existence. With this, they need to prepare and adapt themselves for next relevant issue of present problem and its potential solution. Long term goal of social issue resolution is a Myth to be busted, long term social enterprise can be a reality if one can innovate and respond to new challenges of our fast moving society", "description": "Social enterprise is a buzz word in market today, especially when state is unable to produce large level employment in high return sectors.
