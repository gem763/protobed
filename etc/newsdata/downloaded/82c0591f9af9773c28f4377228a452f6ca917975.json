Facebook says up to 126 million Americans may have seen Russian-linked posts aimed at the 2016 election.\n\nRussian catering tycoon Evgeny Prigozhin, accused by U.S. prosecutors of orchestrating the IRA's activities through Concord Management and Consulting LLC, did not respond to questions sent by Reuters.\n\nAttorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC did not respond to a request for comment but have previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPAYING IN ROUBLES\n\nFacebook, Twitter (N: ) and Google (O: ) have vowed to step up the fight against political manipulation of their platforms after facing fierce criticism for failing to counter alleged Russian interference in 2016.\n\nDespite the increased scrutiny, U.S. officials have repeatedly warned of the threat posed by Russia and other countries such as Iran, who they say may still attempt to sway the result of next year's vote.\n\nAddressing U.S. lawmakers this week, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Nikki Floris said the bureau's foreign influence task force was briefing candidates and running a series of public information videos to help safeguard the election.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMoscow and Tehran have repeatedly denied allegations of election interference. The Kremlin and Russia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRussian efforts to avoid detection by the platforms' security teams have been increasing since the IRA's alleged efforts in 2016 were first exposed, said Ben Nimmo, who has helped Facebook analyze influence operations and currently runs investigations at Graphika.\n\nA campaign exposed by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab in June, which attempted to seed false narratives online such as a bogus plot to assassinate British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, created a new account for almost every single post.\n\nThis made it harder to track connections between the accounts, Nimmo said, but also meant the posts only reached a small number of people.\n\nAnnouncing the takedown of a network in July last year, which it said showed \"some connections\" to previously-identified IRA accounts, Facebook noted that \"bad actors have been more careful to cover their tracks.\"\n\nThe company said operators were using virtual private networks and internet phone services to obscure an account user's location, and paying for advertising via third parties.\n\nIn contrast, previous campaigns linked to the IRA used Russian phone numbers and IP addresses to register their accounts, as well as paying for Facebook adverts in Russian roubles, raising suspicions about Russian involvement.\n\n\"The original IRA activity threw operational security to the wind,\" Nimmo said.", "description": "Russian operatives sacrifice followers to stay under cover on Facebook", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N1HW-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
