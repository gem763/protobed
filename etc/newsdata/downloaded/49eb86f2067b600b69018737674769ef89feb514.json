The government should be thinking of this, not sending them to stadiums,\" it quoted a mother as saying.", "description": "Iranian women fans are free to enter a football stadium Thursday for the first time in decades, after FIFA threatened to suspend the Islamic republic over...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/03/wire-19471758-1570588658-14_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
