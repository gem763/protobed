The 14-year-old texted his big sister on the first day at Reidsville Senior High about all the things that had gone wrong.\n\n\"I sat alone at lunch and got lost three times,\" he told his sister Leal Edwards, who is in college. Wrenn said no one would be his friend because he's short.\n\nEdwards posted a screenshot of the text, along with a photo of her little brother, on Twitter. \"Retweet to let my baby brother know that he is cool before I have to pull up to RHS,\" she wrote.\n\nLittle did she know, the post about her little brother would go viral, and Wrenn's problem would be solved.\n\nThe next day, the tweet had been re-shared thousands of times, and a senior student at the North Carolina school replied to Edwards. \"I'll sit with em today at lunch watch,\" Timothy Thaxton wrote.\n\nI\u2019ll sit with em today at lunch watch \u203c\ufe0f https://t.co/sL1SW3W53P \u2014 Therealist.tt\ud83e\udd75 (@ThaxtonTimothy) August 27, 2019\n\nThen Edwards saw a photo that warmed her heart \u2014 her brother seated at a school lunch table, surrounded by upperclassmen.\n\n\"They simply saw my tweet and wanted to make a difference,\" Edwards told CBS News via direct message on Twitter. \"They surprised him with a whole group of boys and now he has people to sit with at lunch.\"\n\nEdwards, a student at Appalachian State University, said one of the students just happened to see her viral tweet. \"I never thought it'd get so much attention,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe lunchroom kindness wasn't just a one-time thing \u2014 according to his sister, Wrenn has a newfound group of friends.\n\n\"I didn't know the boys prior to this happening and neither did he!
