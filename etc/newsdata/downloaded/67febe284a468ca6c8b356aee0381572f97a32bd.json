Many modern cars are loaded with touchscreens for everything from climate control to stereo volume to the wiper controls in the case of Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Most would argue that using a touchscreen for those tasks is more cumbersome and difficult than the tried and true buttons and dials of yore. Perhaps the touchscreen that has received the most vitriol is the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, which replaces the entire top row of function keys with touch controls that are constantly changing. Needless to say, the Touch Bar has been largely disliked.\n\nSo, I had few hopes for the ScreenPad in the new Asus ZenBook Pro 15 laptop. The ScreenPad is a full-color, 5.5-inch 1080p touchscreen jammed into the trackpad of the ZenBook Pro. Picture a smartphone turned on its side and embedded just below the keyboard of a laptop and you basically have the idea.\n\nIf you have had any experience with Apple\u2019s Touch Bar or anything similar to this, you\u2019d probably expect it to not work very well, not be very useful, and ruin the trackpad experience, which is so crucial when using a laptop. Reader, I\u2019m here to tell you that the ScreenPad is none of those things. It works surprisingly well, it has some actually useful features, and, most importantly, it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the trackpad doing standard trackpad stuff.\n\nOur review of Asus ZenBook Pro 15 Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff ScreenPad is cool and works well\n\nComfortable keyboard\n\nBright 4K display\n\nWindows Hello fingerprint scanner Bad Stuff Greasy, flexible chassis\n\nTerrible battery life\n\nPoor thermal management\n\nExpensive Buy for $2,299.99 from ASUS\n\nHere are the basic things the ScreenPad can do:\n\nControl music playback for either music stored on the laptop or streamed from Spotify\n\nLaunch some of your favorite apps\n\nDisplay a number pad or calculator\n\nDisplay a calendar with upcoming appointments\n\nProvide quick access to commonly used functions in Microsoft Office apps, like Word or Excel\n\nProvide easy controls for pause, timeline scrubbing, volume, full-screen, or even ad skipping when watching YouTube videos in Chrome\n\nAct as a secondary display for Windows\n\nSome of those functions are more valuable than others, and not all of them work spectacularly. My favorite feature is the YouTube controller that works with a special Chrome extension. It\u2019s great to be able to just skip an ad without having to move the pointer over it or even take my finger off the laptop\u2019s deck. The calculator, number pad, and customized toolbars are also useful if you do a lot of data entry or live in Office apps all day.\n\nThe ScreenPad whiffs on the music playback controls, but part of that is because Asus decided to remove the play / pause / skip media controls from the top function row of the keyboard, which basically every other modern Windows laptop has. That means that if you want to pause your Spotify music or skip a track, you have to either go to the full Windows Spotify app and do it there, or go down to the ScreenPad, select the app, and then tap what you want. It\u2019s very tedious, especially if you have to do it often.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the secondary display feature. This is perhaps the most show-offy part of the ScreenPad: you can literally have it be the world\u2019s tiniest secondary display for your laptop. You can move Windows down there and play a video if you want, but the size of buttons, icons, and text is so laughably small, I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would do this. Also, in this mode, the touchscreen part of things doesn\u2019t map directly to where your finger touches, so in order to click something on the secondary display, you have to move the mouse pointer over it and click, which is laughably tedious.\n\nAside from the obnoxious Spotify controls and the silly secondary display feature, the ScreenPad doesn\u2019t force you to change anything else about how you use the trackpad. The trackpad is still a smooth, matte finish Windows Precision trackpad that supports all of the usual multifinger gestures you\u2019d expect. You can even turn off the \u201cscreen\u201d part of the ScreenPad, and it will just look and act like any other trackpad on any other laptop.\n\nNot forcing you to change how you use a laptop or interfering in how basic computer input functions work is the smartest thing Asus did with the ScreenPad, and it\u2019s what separates it the most from Apple\u2019s Touch Bar.\n\nThe one thing that the ScreenPad doesn\u2019t (and, if I\u2019m being fair, can\u2019t) do is make up for the rest of the ZenBook Pro 15, which is an overpriced, not-very-good laptop. The panels are flexible and get covered in fingerprints in seconds, the battery life is abysmal, and even though it has a beefy Core i9 processor and discrete Nvidia GTX 1050Ti graphics card, its poor thermal management means you don\u2019t get to take advantage of all of that power. It\u2019s not a laptop I\u2019d recommend anyone spend $2,300 on.\n\nOn the other hand, the ScreenPad is interesting and works surprisingly well. Right now, its functions are limited and there isn\u2019t a ton you can do with it. But the basics are here, and if Asus is able to figure out some more uses for it, the ScreenPad might be something you\u2019ll want on your next laptop.\n\nHopefully, that next laptop is a better one than the ZenBook Pro 15.", "description": "Putting a full touchscreen in a trackpad sounds like a crazy idea, but the new ScreenPad in the Asus ZenBook Pro 15 actually works.
