This vaping has dangerous consequences and should be prohibited,\u201d Gottlieb, who stepped down in April, said on Twitter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a lung disease tied to vaping has sickened almost 1,300 people, with at least 26 deaths, as of Oct. 11. Public health officials said the majority of those people reported vaping THC products, \u201cparticularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources.\u201d\n\nAs a result, both the CDC and FDA have warned people not to use vaping products that contain THC.\n\nPublic health officials have not conclusively linked the vaping disease to THC, and have specified the data is unclear on whether the cause is THC itself or if it\u2019s a substance associated with pre-filled THC cartridges, like a cutting agent.\n\nGottlieb has also called for a new approach to regulating marijuana, noting in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that a blanket ban on marijuana \u201cis no longer politically practicable.\u201d\n\nThe conflict between states and the federal government over marijuana legalization has allowed THC products to largely fall into a regulatory grey zone. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of marijuana in small amounts for adults, while 33 states and D.C. allow for the use of medical marijuana.\n\nThe federal government has been reluctant to enforce oversight on states that have legalized marijuana, but has also made it difficult for researchers to examine any legitimate medical use.\n\nMarijuana remains illegal at the federal level, and is classified as a Schedule 1 drug.\n\nResearchers have called on the government to change that, and lift restrictions to allow further study.", "description": "Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Monday called for banning THC-based vaping products, as lung injuries tied to vaping have sickened more than a thousand people in the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/e-cigarette.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
