At an early age, when Tenzin was attracted to all things a girl would probably like, she was told by her family and friends that males are expected to behave differently.\n\n\"So, it is not like I woke up one fine morning and decided to become a trans person. There were many challenges, both financial and social,\" Tenzin was quoted as saying.\n\n\n\nBack in the year 2014 when she decided to change things for the better. A video of her dancing in female clothes went viral and that's when things went downhill for Tenzing.\n\nAlso read: In A First, Transgender Model Anjali Lama Shines On The Cover Of L'Officiel India\n\nThe video earned her insulting names and derogatory remarks. But five years down the line, she's Tibet's first ever queer icon.\n\nIn 2015, she underwent surgery and also made her first public appearance as a dancer at the Miss Tibet pageant in Dharamshala.\n\n\"Our Tibetan community is small but they treat me as a celebrity now. It feels good to be known as the first Tibetan transgender. Not because it has turned me into a celebrity, but because I have, in a small way, made it easier for other people to come forward,\" said Tenzin.\n\nFrom a video that once made her an easy target online to the 20k followers she has today, her journey to becoming a social media icon was not without its challenges. And we thank Tenzing Mariko for becoming the inspiration she is.", "description": "Tenzin Mariko, a former Buddhist monk, has gone viral on the internet for becoming Tibet\u2019s first ever transgender model.
