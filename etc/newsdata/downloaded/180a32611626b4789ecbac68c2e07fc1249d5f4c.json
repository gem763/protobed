He would first want to win an election, then negotiate a Labour Brexit deal with Brussels relatively quickly. Within six months of the election, there would be a second referendum to choose between Labour\u2019s deal and remaining in the EU. A special conference would decide how Labour should campaign.\n\nHow would Corbyn himself campaign?\n\nCorbyn has so far refused to say whether he would prefer a Labour-led Brexit deal or remaining in the EU, saying it depends what is negotiated with Brussels. It is not clear whether he could stay above the fray of campaigning in a referendum while the party itself picked a side. His aim would be to play the honest broker carrying out what the people decide. It puts him in a different place from senior Labour figures who want to personally campaign to remain, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, deputy leader Tom Watson, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary.\n\nLabour rows over Brexit worsen before crucial votes at conference Read more\n\nWhy are pro-remain activists challenging Corbyn with their own motion?\n\nMany pro-remain campaigners are unhappy with Corbyn\u2019s stance and want an unequivocal policy of campaigning to stay in the EU going into an election. MPs in marginal seats, including shadow cabinet ministers, are also concerned that the Lib Dems, who have a policy of revoking article 50, could take a significant amount of votes off them at an election without a more pro-remain stance. They succeeded in getting a vote on the conference floor scheduled for late afternoon on Monday, after more than 50 local parties supported a pro-remain text at a \u201ccompositing\u201d meeting on Sunday.\n\nHow will the vote play out?\n\nThe issue is already causing bitter splits among Labour groups and trade unions, with Unite and Momentum backing Corbyn\u2019s position, while Unison and much of the membership expected vote in favour of remain. Pro-remain campaigners say it will be tight but possibly winnable. Half of all votes are weighted to delegates and half to trade unions, so it is difficult to predict, but it could go either way.\n\nWhat would the consequences be for Corbyn?\n\nIt would be a hard blow for Corbyn to lose a vote on such a major policy issue, when the membership have been so overwhelmingly loyal to him for four years. His response will be critical as he would likely face outright revolt if he tried to fudge the issue further. However, the waters could be muddied if both his position and the pro-remain position are advocated by conference (because of abstentions), giving him some room to say the party\u2019s policy for a manifesto would be decided by the traditional clause V meeting before an election.\n\nWould the EU be receptive to Corbyn\u2019s plan?\n\nThe EU has always said it is ready to work with any British government to map out a future relationship, ranging from Norway-style membership of the single market to a Canada-style free-trade agreement putting much greater distance between the bloc and the UK.\n\nWhat has been ruled out repeatedly are substantial changes to the divorce deal: the legally binding withdrawal agreement covering citizens\u2019 rights, the Brexit bill and the Irish border. But a revamped political declaration could be agreed within days, if the UK wanted it. However a new political declaration would only be a prelude to years of post-Brexit negotiations on trade, security and foreign policy.\n\nWhile the EU would welcome a closer trading relationship \u2013 less damaging for economies on both sides \u2013 it has ruled out granting the UK a special status. The EU has repeatedly said non-membership can never be as good as EU membership. That guiding principle makes implausible some ideas circulated by Labour MPs, such as a British veto on EU trade deals, or a British opt out from free movement of people, while having unrestricted free movement of goods, services and capital.", "description": "Pro-remain activists are challenging Corbyn with their own motion \u2013 will his position change?", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Jennifer Rankin", "Andrew Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64a26e886c5b3bcce013c185fe2e3a853c72c87b/0_140_4210_2526/master/4210.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae77cb3b0f168d5940ca9ea76cde2ca6", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
