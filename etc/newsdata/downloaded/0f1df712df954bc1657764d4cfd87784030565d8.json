In police forces with the lowest rates, there was a one in 30 chance of a burglar being charged.", "description": "Repeat victims of burglary have increased by more than 16 per cent in a year as criminals have exploited the decline in the police response, official figures show.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/06/burglars-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgCXocDQF5kP7s3jSjli3eCH0-jRUT4rHK8EgtaGoQwQ.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
