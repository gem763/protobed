Alas, the Republican lawmaker involved quickly dashed the hopes of Never-Trump partisans.\n\nRep. Mark Amodei spoke on the telephone with reporters Friday and the subject of impeachment came up. During the phone call Amodei, who has represented Nevada\u2019s 2nd District since 2011, said what most Republicans have said publicly. He just did so in a less than crisply articulate way. Therefore, some took his remarks to mean Amodei is in favor of impeachment. The only Republican in Nevada\u2019s congressional delegation began by saying, \u201cLet\u2019s put it through the process and see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of oversight, so let\u2019s let the committees get to work and see where it goes,\u201d he added. \u201cUsing government agencies to, if it\u2019s proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it turns out that it\u2019s something along those lines, then there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThose are sensible statements if you ask me. He sounds like most Republicans \u2013 let\u2019s let the process work. He isn\u2019t like the leftists who are demanding impeachment rightthisminute, without any nod to due process. He even says \u201cif it turns out \u2026\u201d which indicates he acknowledges the reporting thus far is probably flawed, as we have seen since the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nNonetheless, the kneejerk reactions on social media streamed in. Amodei is the first GOP congressman to support impeachment inquiries, thus the dam is breaking. Or so some folks hoped.\n\nThe first Republican House member has announced support for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump: Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada See the full list: https://t.co/nnYylNUBSA pic.twitter.com/7SUfyj48Sq \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) September 27, 2019\n\nA reporter for The Nevada Independent wrote up a piece about the call and that\u2019s when the fun began. The tweets were then answered by Jon Ralston, who has a long career history in Nevada as a journalist, political commentator, and former talk show host. He explained that he\u2019s known the congressman for a long time and this is just how he speaks. Ralston noted that Amodei doesn\u2019t want to reflexively support the president but he doesn\u2019t want to act as though the worst interpretation of the Ukraine story is true, either. In other words, Amodei is a fence-straddler. You know, like politicians do.\n\nI'm not surprised at the controversy \u2014 indeed I expected it \u2014 our story on @MarkAmodeiNV2 and impeachment has caused. He's only GOP member of NV delegation. Reax to his comments underscores the hypersensitivity/ hyperventilation in DC over impeachment. Permit me a thread\u2026\n\n1/ \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 27, 2019\n\nHere's the story: https://t.co/PNIdBAx2p2 I have listened to the audio of the call, and our story is accurate. We are going to post the audio ASAP. I am not surprised other media leapt on it, nor am I surprised at Team Amodei's sensitivity. First, let me tell you about him.\n\n2/ \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 27, 2019\n\nI've known @MarkAmodeiNV2 for decades and now, more than ever, he is more accessible than most of them. But it is his way of talking \u2014 full of circumlocutions and tangents \u2014 that can cause confusion. He can be a folksy raconteur but it can be hard to keep his story straight.\n\n3/ \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 27, 2019\n\nHere's what's clear, and I am not surprised: Amodei does not want to reflexively defend the president, nor does he want to jump on the impeachment train. In the current atmosphere, that appears not be be allowed. But listen to what he said: He wants the process to go forward.\n\n4/ \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 27, 2019\n\nSure, anyone who says the \"inquiry\" should go forward is said to automatically favor impeachment, which is a ridiculous logical leap. let me give you some excerpts from the call, some of which did not make the story:\n\n\"A complaint has been filed,\u2026let's see where it goes.\"\n\n5/ \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 27, 2019\n\nRalston goes on to say that Amodei said he\u2019s in support of impeachment inquiries but the leap to supporting impeachment is illogical. Amodei said, yes, if the evidence points to wrongdoing, then he\u2019ll support impeachment. And Ralston notes that he has no doubt that Amodei\u2019s GOP colleagues are angry with him for speaking as he does. He admits the anti-Trumpers are looking for a crack \u2013 any crack in Trump\u2019s support on the Republican side.\n\nIt seems to me that using Amodei\u2019s conversation with reporters to play up that GOP support may be waning by some members is premature and in this case, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Amodei expects to be Trump\u2019s campaign manager in Nevada. He won\u2019t go on record as to if anything he\u2019s seen in the complaint or the memo on the phone transcript rises to the level of an impeachable offense. He\u2019s waiting for the process to play out.\n\nAmodei issued a rebuttal to those finding something supportive of impeachment in his remarks.\n\n\u201cI held a 40-minute telephone press conference today with Nevada media outlets to respond to their questions about the impeachment inquiry made by Speaker Pelosi earlier this week,\u201d said Congressman Amodei. \u201cFollowing that call, Nevada Independent reporter Humberto Sanchez released an article. The first paragraph of Mr. Sanchez\u2019s article reads: \u2018Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House\u2019s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis is absolutely an accurate statement in the sense that the House and Senate have both unanimously supported the resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the whistleblower complaint received on August 12, 2019, by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, should be transmitted immediately to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives. It is also accurate that the White House supports this same resolution. In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment. Rather, I stressed my complete agreement with Senator Cortez-Masto\u2019s (D-NV) statement reported to KTVN Channel 2 from yesterday which is as follows: \u2018I think from all of that information, we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here,\u2019 Cortez-Masto said. \u201cAnyone who reads Mr. Sanchez\u2019s article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out \u2013 as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned \u2013 is simply, individual fantasy. \u201cI now have a full appreciation of how the President feels. Have a nice weekend.\u201d\n\nThis lawmaker\u2019s statements don\u2019t even rise to the level of cynicism that Mitt Romney has shown so far, in my reading of them. I\u2019m with him, though, on just letting the process work. Democrats are hell-bent on impeaching Trump. I say let them do it. The effort will die in the Senate. I still think all of this will unite Republicans, conservatives, and Independents against the over-zealous Democrats. Their rush to judgment is just more of the same we\u2019ve heard since before Trump was inaugurated. Democrats have been in support of canceling the last presidential election since the results came in.", "description": "Cart before the horse?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36f0a9ff-ae04-4bb1-8933-09b9db2ded68.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
