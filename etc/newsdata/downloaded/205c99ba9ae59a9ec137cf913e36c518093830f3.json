The woman, identified in the lawsuit only as Jane Doe, sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and former ICE agent Wilfredo Rodriguez on Saturday. She is seeking $10 million in damages.\n\n\u201cMy only comment is that my client had a choice, cooperate with ICE or be deported with her family,\u201d George Kramer, the woman\u2019s lawyer, said in an email. \u201cShe remains in a very fragile psychological state. She is not only seeking compensation for the physical and emotional damage she suffered but to change the way those who are cooperating with ICE are treated by those in a position of power and who often wield total control over the ability to remain in the United States.\u201d\n\nAn ICE spokesman said he couldn\u2019t comment on litigation but confirmed Rodriguez no longer works for the agency. Homeland Security didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Rodriguez had a lawyer to speak for him, and a phone listing for him could not immediately be found.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Rodriguez found out she was also living in the country illegally and said that to avoid being deported, she had to become an informant and help the agency locate criminals ripe for deportation. She did her job, according to the lawsuit, pointing ICE to three men living in the U.S. illegally who had stabbed her husband.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough for Rodriguez, the lawsuit indicates.\n\nRead more: An Unintended Consequence of Trump\u2019s Repeated Threats of Raids: More Immigrants Know Their Rights\n\nAt one point, while trying to locate someone in 2007, Rodriguez told the woman to go to a motel and tried to have sex with her, according to the lawsuit. When she refused, she says in the lawsuit, he covered her mouth, threw her on the bed, put his gun next to her and said that if she opened her mouth, he would use it. Then, she says, he raped her.\n\nHe called himself the \u201cwolf\u201d and said he was the reason she and her family weren\u2019t deported, she says in the lawsuit.\n\nThe woman alleges she first became pregnant by Rodriguez in 2007, then again in 2009 and a third time in 2013. She had an abortion each time, she said in the lawsuit, and Rodriguez paid for one of them. \u201cThere was no question\u201d that was she was pregnant by Rodriguez and not her husband, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe abuse continued unabated, she says. He made her perform oral sex on him and participate in \u201cabhorrent sexual behavior,\u201d the lawsuit states. He would constantly remind her that he was the \u201cwolf\u201d and threaten to kill her and her family, she says.\n\nShe attempted suicide four times, the lawsuit says.\n\nIn 2014, while working at her job in construction, she received a call. It was Rodriguez, demanding to see her, and she knew it would be for sex, she says. She was so shaken that she fell off a ladder after hanging up and seriously injured her neck, back and ribs. She underwent surgery and tried to use it as an excuse not to see Rodriguez \u2014 but it didn\u2019t deter him, the lawsuit says.\n\nLater, he told her that he was leaving the agency but that if she told anyone what happened, \u201cshe and her family would pay,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe woman finally told her story last year when her father, living in the U.S. and fearing deportation because of her friendliness with ICE, applied for asylum. She opened up to an agent who approached her about her father\u2019s application, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe agent, she says, suggested she consult an attorney.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The lawsuit alleges former ICE agent Wilfredo Rodriguez threatened a Honduran woman with deportation if she didn't have sex with him", "authors": ["Chris Ehrmann"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ice-officer-lmmigrant-rape-lawsuit.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
