You\u2019re a good student, at or near the top of your class. You\u2019ve got natural gifts but you also work hard for your grades and for your future success. You\u2019ve got a classmate, George, also smart but lazy as a 12-term congressman.\n\nGeorge doesn\u2019t study; he just finds a way to sit near you at test time. You get an A, George gets an A. You got a 1550 on your SAT \u2014 hey, so did George. You were a shoo-in for top science project prize, except George\u2019s project coincidently mirrored yours.\n\nGeorge got into Harvard. You missed and settled for Hofstra. You feel cheated and taken advantage of and, worst of all, everyone seemed to know what George was up to, but little was done to stop him. You see, George came from a family that no one much liked but everyone in town wanted to do business with. His family lent out a lot of easy money and undercut prevailing prices. So George was \u2026 tolerated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf countries were high school classmates, Canada and Britain are your lunch table buds, Australia is the party dude, Russia is the brooding wannabe smoking in the boys\u2019 bathroom, and China is George.\n\nChina largely has cheated its way to prosperity. In the U.S., research and development is a healthy investment in painstaking science and education and costly trials. In China, research and development is an internet connection and hacking tools.\n\nIn the past three decades, China has lifted itself from a rural, trinket-based economy to first-string varsity on the global pitch. Its spectacular rise tracks on a straight-line correlation with the advent and proliferation of the internet. This is no coincidence.\n\nBecause of the internet and some dispiriting na\u00efvet\u00e9, data developed through the time-consuming hard work of others was suddenly accessible for copying and pilfering. Everything from weapon systems to computer hardware and software, telecommunications, industrial processes and energy production became a target.\n\nSuddenly, China began producing and exporting a whole lot of products that looked just like stuff invented in the West. Here, we pay for software licenses, the lifeblood of today\u2019s economy. In China, 99 percent of Microsoft licenses are counterfeit and unpaid for.\n\nBecause they didn\u2019t have to recover the considerable sunk costs of R&D or pay for valuable products, China could undercut prices and build massive trade imbalances in their favor. And so, with the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of intellectual property stolen each year from the U.S. and with its resulting trade bonanza, suddenly China was sitting on a nice pile of yuan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, China has announced a goal of global dominance in artificial intelligence by 2030 with a primary application in weaponry. They are currently outspending the U.S. in this area. Easy to do with a massive trade imbalance enabled by theft and forced technology transfer.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they became a loan-shark nation furnishing funds to an insatiable U.S. Congress that makes the prodigal son look like Ebenezer Scrooge. In other words, we\u2019ve gone into debt to a nation that has lent us money it essentially stole from us.\n\nSounds pretty bad, you say. Oh, we\u2019re just getting started. Many in the political class here in the U.S. prefer a policy of averted eyes when it comes to China, including many running for president, favoring instead a focus on climate change.\n\nBut with belching, coal-fired China in the room, any steps we take to clean up our own carbon footprint will be like taking a bath in a smoking chimney. Our leaders would have us tax and inconvenience ourselves to the extreme to solve a problem that China is making worse.\n\nAlso worsening is an opioid epidemic killing tens of thousands each year in the U.S., fueled by fentanyl smuggled into the country from \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 China.\n\nChina has a specific strategy to become the world\u2019s most powerful economy and lone superpower. How do we know this? Because they openly proclaim it. Not only that, but the methods by which they are striving to achieve this goal are not particularly clandestine.\n\nThe FBI considers China to be the top intelligence threat to the United States. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that he considered the Chinese threat \u201cmore deep, more diverse, more vexing, more challenging, more comprehensive and more concerning than any (other) I can think of.\u201d\n\nThe reason he made such a stark statement is the immense complexity of the asymmetrical Chinese intelligence strategy. China is taking active steps to not just steal our intellectual property, but also position itself to cripple our critical infrastructure and financial system if needed.\n\nFormer National Security Agency director Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersTech fight against online extremism gets overhaul Hillicon Valley: 8chan owner defends platform before Congress | Facebook launches dating feature | New York City sues T-Mobile | Top NSA cyber official names ransomware as 2020 threat | Blue Dog Dems urge action on election security 8chan owner defends platform in testimony before Congress MORE has testified that China and one or two other countries likely have the ability to shut down significant portions of our power grid on command. And think of our financial system\u2019s vulnerability to cyber intrusions \u2014 not to steal money but to corrupt, manipulate, or even eliminate data and throw a trust-based system into chaos.\n\nThe FBI sees China executing its plans in a number of ways, but would point to three main vectors.\n\nFirst is the remote assault on our intellectual property via cyber intrusions as outlined above. Second is their full leverage of our generous access to U.S. academia via hundreds of thousands of student visas and even preferential admittance to universities over U.S. students.\n\nThird is their exploitation of our capitalist system itself as they insinuate Chinese companies into our supply chain, engage in joint ventures, and sell Chinese products such as Lenovo and Huawei to our companies and government agencies as platforms for gathering sensitive data.\n\nIn 2017, China was so bold as to pass a law requiring its citizens to collect intelligence as they engage in business and academics worldwide and cooperate with Chinese intelligence agencies. Can you imagine U.S. citizens being required to report their business dealings to the FBI or CIA?\n\nThis threat \u2014 and it is a threat \u2014 is difficult to counter. The first line of defense is to shine a light on its reality and understand with whom we are dealing. The shame of it all is that the Chinese people are brilliant and entirely capable of developing economic prosperity in an honest and trustworthy way and being a major contributor to a peaceful world. But their corrupt and cynical leadership is too fearful to let that happen. Sadly, they\u2019re stuck being George for now. And nobody likes George.\n\nKevin R.
