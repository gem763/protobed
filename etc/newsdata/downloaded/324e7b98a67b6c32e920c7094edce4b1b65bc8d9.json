But which beans, and which pasta, to use?\n\nDescribed by Ligurian-born chef Lucio Galletto in his book The Art of Pasta as \u201cone of the few dishes that unify Italy\u201d, pasta and beans (pasta e fasoi, he says in the north, pasta fazool if you\u2019re Dean Martin) is \u201cpeasant food of the most warming and comforting kind\u201d, according to Russell Norman. It\u2019s also one of those recipes with as many versions as there are cooks, differing not only, Gennaro Contaldo observes, from region to region, \u201cbut also among families\u201d.\n\nSuch hearty, starchy dishes were once an important part of everyday diets all over Europe, beans being both easy to grow and to store \u2013 indeed, the rather austere rule of St Benedict allotted monks a pint of beans and a pound of bread a day \u2013 and though these days we all have access to more exotic fare, it\u2019s hard to deny their attractions as a thrifty, satisfying stomach-filler. But if you don\u2019t have a treasured recipe handed down from your nonna, what\u2019s the best way to enjoy pasta e fagioli?\n\nThe beans\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucio Galletto\u2019s version: one of the few dishes that unify Italy\u2019. Thumbs by Felicity Cloake.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this universally popular dish can be made with a number of different beans \u2013 Marcella Hazan calls borlotti, \u201cbrightly marbled in white and pink\u201d, the \u201cclassic\u201d variety in her Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, recommending the fresh sort when in season. When cooked, she says, \u201cits flavour is unlike that of any other bean, subtly recalling chestnuts\u201d. Outside their summer season, dried, as used by Anna, one of the nonnas in the new Pasta Grannies book, and Norman in his book Polpo, are a \u201cwholly satisfactory substitute\u201d. Contaldo recommends tinned in his Pasta Perfecto!, though, \u201ctime permitting\u201d, you could use dried \u201cif you prefer\u201d; Galletto\u2019s recipe, \u201calla montanara\u201d, deploys dried \u201clarge white beans, called fagioli di Spagna in Italian\u201d, and, I assume, butter beans in English.\n\nHappily, I find fresh, candy-spotted borlotti without too much trouble, and can confirm that they are truly worth tracking down (or planting for next year): plump and nutty, they\u2019re a quite superior product to the dried kind. However, as the season draws to a close, they\u2019re not the most practical recommendation. Tinned work just fine, especially if you\u2019re in a hurry (Contaldo\u2019s recipe can be on the table in half an hour), but dried are a better alternative, simply because you can flavour them as you like during cooking, and use the cooking water to make a really beany broth, of which more later. If you do use tinned, loosen the water in the tin with chicken or vegetable stock.\n\nNorman cooks his beans with onion, garlic and rosemary, while nonna Anna and Galletto pop in carrot and celery. The sharpness of garlic doesn\u2019t feel quite right here for some reason, but the other vegetables are a great pairing with the earthiness of the beans, giving them a fuller, more rounded flavour.\n\nBoth Hazan and Contaldo mash some of the cooked beans into the broth to thicken it, which seems an eminently sensible idea, making the whole dish even more emphatically beany \u2013 on which note, though Galletto\u2019s butter beans work just fine, we find they lack the flavour of the borlotti \u2013 even Hazan\u2019s suggested kidney beans would probably be a more interesting option. So often relegated to a supporting role, beans should be the star ingredient in this dish.\n\nThe base\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gennaro Contaldo\u2019s recipe for fagioli \u2018can be on the table in half an hour\u2019.\n\nInfusing the beans alone is not enough; all the recipes I try include a soffrito, or a base of fried onion, often with carrot and celery, too, sometimes with garlic and, in the case of Galletto, red chilli as well, which is then combined with the beans and their broth. Some, including Contaldo and Anna, add pancetta and crumbled sausage, and some such as Galletto use prosciutto \u2013 this dish is pretty delicious without meat, but if you do eat it, a little pork fat is rarely a bad thing for flavour. Pancetta is the easiest way to achieve this, but for a more substantial, almost rag\u00f9-like soup, Anna\u2019s sausage version is a winner with my testers. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to keep the soffrito fairly simple by adding more in the way of onion, celery and carrot to give the dish a breadth of texture as well as taste: chilli, garlic, celery leaves and so on are entirely up to you.\n\nThe liquid\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Peasant food of the most warming and comforting kind\u2019: Russell Norman\u2019s pasta e fagioli.\n\nTomatoes are very much optional \u2013 they play no part at all in Contaldo\u2019s recipe \u2013 but, simmered down until they become one with the beans, they do add a pleasant dose of umami. Indeed, if you\u2019re really keen on them, try Norman\u2019s version, which stirs in a rich, long-simmered tomato sauce to create a creamily robust tomato and bean soup that is surely the very definition of a cockle-warmer, whatever that is in Italian.\n\nHazan loosens her soup with beef stock and Contaldo with vegetable, but I\u2019m going to stick with the bean cooking liquid, so the predominant flavour is that, rather than meat or aromatics. If you would like to use stock, a neutral chicken would be my preference for omnivores.\n\nMake it as thick or as thin as you like: according to Contaldo\u2019s sister Adriana, \u201cthe real pasta e fagioli should have a thicker consistency\u201d but I\u2019d be very surprised if there weren\u2019t millions of Italians prepared to argue the exact opposite.\n\nThe pasta\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcella Hazan uses \u2018maltagliati, or fresh egg pasta lozenges\u2019.\n\nNaturally, there\u2019s no consensus here, either. Norman writes: \u201cI have seen this made with tagliatelle, bigoli and penne, none of which seems right to me. I like the pasta to be roughly the same size as the beans,\u201d which means small dried macaroni. Contaldo calls for fresh egg tagliatelle or pappardelle, cut into 7cm lengths, Galetto for maccheroncini, ditalini or broken spaghetti, and Hazan and Anna both make their own in the form of maltagliati, or fresh egg pasta lozenges, and cresc\u2019tajat respectively.\n\nThe latter, a speciality of Le Marche, is, according to the woman behind the Pasta Grannies book and project, Vicky Bennison, \u201ca fine example of frugal cooking. It used to be made with leftover polenta and served with stewed wild greens or beans, which is what Anna made for us.\u201d I squidge cold polenta with flour, then roll it out and cut it into diamond shapes before cooking it in boiling water \u2013 it has a satisfying solidity about it that we all love, and if you happen to have any leftover polenta knocking about, I commend the idea to you. Otherwise, this being a simple, frugal dish, use whatever dried pasta you have to hand; I think the slight chewiness is a more pleasurable with the soft beans than the fresh kind, but whatever floats your boat. Personally, I\u2019m not keen on short lengths of spaghetti (so hard to pick up), so I use Norman\u2019s macaroni.\n\nGaletto also uses potatoes, cooking them and the pasta in the residual heat of the broth. My spuds are still crunchy even after the allotted two hours, but I like the idea of them if you\u2019re looking to bulk the dish out even further: some days are just three-starch days.\n\nTo finish\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling fancy, Norman\u2019s garlic and rosemary oil is a lovely, punchy way to finish the dish, but for me it\u2019s all about comfort, so I\u2019m making like Marcella and adding a knob of butter and a sprinkling of parmesan. And a great big spoon.\n\nPerfect pasta e fagioli\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nSoak 8 hr\n\nCook 90 min\n\nServes 4\n\n175g dried borlotti beans\n\n2 celery sticks\n\n2 carrots\n\n1 large onion\n\nSprig of rosemary (optional)\n\n2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n75g fatty pancetta, diced (optional)\n\n2 tinned plum tomatoes\n\n175g small macaroni, or other dried pasta\n\n25g butter\n\n15g grated parmesan or pecorino\n\nSoak the beans in plenty of cold water for about eight hours, then drain. Put in a large pan with one each of the carrots and celery sticks, both snapped in half, and half the onion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Put the soaked borlotti beans in a pot with one carrot, one celery stick and half an onion. Cover with water, bring to a boil and simmer for an hour.\n\nCover with cold water by about 3cm, bring to a boil, then skim the top. Add the rosemary, if using, turn down the heat and cook until the beans are tender (this should take around an hour, depending on their freshness). Make sure the beans are always covered with water, so top up as necessary.\n\nTowards the end of the cooking time, peel and cut the remaining onion, carrot and celery into fairly fine dice, keeping the onion separate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dice and fry the remaining onion, carrot and celery in olive oil until soft and golden.\n\nHeat the oil in a wide, high-sided pan over a medium-low heat and saute the onion until soft and golden, then add the carrot and celery, and do the same. Add the pancetta, if using, and fry until it releases its fat, then stir in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the spoon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stir in the tomatoes \u2013 break them up with a wooden spoon.\n\nOnce the beans are cooked, remove and discard the vegetables and rosemary, and scoop out a ladleful of the beans. Mash these with a little of their cooking water to make a paste, then stir into the soup with all the whole beans and enough of the cooking water to make a thick soup.\n\nLet the soup simmer gently while you cook the pasta in salted boiling water in another pot until al dente.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cook the pasta, mash a few of the beans, then add both to the soup with some butter. Serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.\n\nStir the drained pasta into the soup along with the butter, cover, take off the heat and leave to sit for five minutes. Season to taste and serve with a sprinkling of cheese.\n\n\u2022 Pasta and beans: up there with beans on toast for comfort, or too much of a good thing starch-wise?
