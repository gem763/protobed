Fred Upton, left, greets teachers, parents and students at Edison Environmental Science Academy in Kalamazoo, Mich., on the first day of school on Tuesday.\n\nKALAMAZOO, Mich.\u2014 Rep. Fred Upton had plans to crisscross more than 100 miles of his southwest Michigan district on a recent weekday, which meant \u201cfeet on the ground at 4:30 a.m.,\u201d as he put it.\n\nSo it was still dark when the 66-year-old Republican hopped in his Jeep and headed to a live radio interview at Kalamazoo\u2019s WRKR. Next up were visits to two local elementary schools, then another radio interview, a briefing by scientists at Western Michigan University, and a ribbon ceremony for a World War II veteran\u2014all before noon, when Mr. Upton was scheduled to speak at a local Rotary Club.\n\nMr. Upton is an endangered moderate in a state crucial to President Trump\u2019s re-election hopes, and Republicans here and in Washington wonder if he could be about to join the growing ranks of House GOP retirees. Mr. Upton wasn\u2019t acting like a politician who is ready to throw in the towel. Yet he wasn\u2019t ruling it out either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of time,\u201d Mr. Upton said in an interview last Tuesday. \u201cI like to say we\u2019re checking all the boxes, and we\u2019ll make a decision in a couple months.\u201d\n\nMr. Upton, center, jokes with early diners at McDonald\u2019s during a coffee stop before a radio interview at 7 a.m. in Kalamazoo on Tuesday.\n\nRecent retirements and defeats have taken a toll on Republican centrists. The GOP\u2019s center-right Main Street caucus, which Mr. Upton helps lead, was decimated in 2018, losing 18 of its members in the Democratic wave.\n\nMr. Upton won by the smallest margin of his career last year\u2014about 4 percentage points\u2014and the seat would be even more competitive if he departs. In the past, he had racked up double-digit wins, regardless of whether his district swung to Barack Obama in 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012, or Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nBut in 2018, for the first time, Mr. Upton lost Kalamazoo County, which is home to about 40% of the population in his six-county district.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is there a place for moderate Republicans in the Trump era of polarized politics? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Upton is confident he can win Kalamazoo back in 2020. He blames the loss on off-year, anti-Trump sentiment. The reality, too, may be that the politics of Mr. Upton\u2019s GOP-leaning district are shifting. He noticed with surprise on Tuesday a bumper sticker supporting Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Van Buren County, which Mr. Upton carried by about 2,500 votes in 2018. \u201cThat\u2019s new,\u201d he said dubiously.\n\nNow, the Trump campaign and Republicans are concerned that Michigan\u2014a crucial battleground state Mr. Trump won by less than one percentage point in 2016\u2014has been trending away from the president.\n\nEven Mr. Upton thinks former Vice President Joe Biden could beat Mr. Trump in the state in 2020, should he win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cToday he would,\u201d he said of Mr. Biden, who drew fire from fellow Democrats last year for calling Mr. Upton \u201cone of the finest guys I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d\n\nMr. Upton didn\u2019t endorse Mr. Trump in 2016. He isn\u2019t sure he would in 2020.\n\nMr. Upton heads to an early-morning radio interview at WRKR in Kalamazoo. Mr. Upton speaks with WRKR morning-show host Mike McKelly.

My skin\u2019s a little thicker, probably,\u201d said Mr. Upton, whose car still sports a bumper sticker for the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Trump antagonist. \u201cBut it seems like politics is a lot harsher than it was before.\u201d\n\nMr. Upton first came to Congress in 1987. He was the grandson of a founder of Whirlpool and worked for David Stockman, who directed the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan. Known to constituents as \u201cFred,\u201d he has been re-elected 16 times, earning a reputation for seeking common ground on thorny issues such as gun violence, climate change and immigration.\n\nOn major votes such as the GOP tax cuts and legislation to overturn the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Upton has stuck with Mr. Trump.\n\nBut he has broken with the president in striking ways, most recently by voting to condemn as racist Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets calling for four Democratic congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to unspecified countries. Mr. Upton was one of only four Republicans to vote in favor.\n\nHe said he checked with executives of AT&T , CVS and Walgreens to ask how they would have handled similar statements by an employee. At some point, Mr. Upton decided, we are all accountable for what we say publicly.\n\nThat is what he told the president, when Mr. Trump called him before the vote. Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t angry, Mr. Upton said. \u201cAt the end, he said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we get together for golf?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Upton isn\u2019t much of a golfer. He demurred. \u201cI think I need a few lessons,\u201d he told Mr. Trump.\n\nHis office received nearly 1,100 emails, phone calls and mail about the vote. More than 800 of those expressed support.\n\nMichigan Rep. Fred Upton, center, attends a meeting at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo.

But many Republicans have been forgiving.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always people that send stuff to the letter to the editor and that kind of thing: \u2018Ah, get rid of Fred Upton,\u2019 \u201d said Frank Noble, a mortgage lender in St. Joseph who is more conservative than Mr. Upton. \u201cBut I think people like Fred overall.\u2026I want him to vote his conscience.\u201d\n\nAt a Kalamazoo elementary school on Tuesday, Democrat Don Cooney gave Mr. Upton a bear hug as they both prepared to greet students on the first day of school.\n\nMr. Cooney is a Kalamazoo city commissioner who ran twice against Mr. Upton and lost. But he took note when Mr. Upton voted to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets. \u201cI called him right away. Thanked him for it,\u201d Mr. Cooney said. \u201cIt took courage. He pays a price for that.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Cooney would vote for Mr. Upton in 2020. It\u2019s important to him that Democrats control the House, and he thinks state Rep. Jon Hoadley could finally flip the district blue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve voted for Fred in the past,\u201d Mr. Cooney said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nMr. Upton speaking during the Berrien Springs Michigan Rotary Club luncheon.\n\nWrite to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nMr. Upton won by the smallest margin of his career last year\u2014about 4 percentage points.
