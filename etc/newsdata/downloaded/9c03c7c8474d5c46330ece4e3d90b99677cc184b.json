The All Blacks delivered a timely reminder though of what lines in wait, with the 46-14 demolition of Ireland demonstrating how much of a challenge they will pose I Yokohama.\n\nJones was delighted with England\u2019s record-equalling 40-16 victory over the Wallabies that ensures his side have met their minimum expectation in Japan, but the head coach immediately started preparing them for what will be England\u2019s first World Cup meeting with the All Blacks since 1995.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I thought we were pretty much like that today, but the challenge is how do we get better because there\u2019s always a samurai around the corner, so we\u2019ve got to continue to get better.\n\n\u201cWe just want to keep challenging ourselves. We haven\u2019t played our best yet and the challenge for us is how do we get better next week, how do we get better individually as a player, how do we get better as a team, and these World Cups that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Everyone empties the tank, and you\u2019ve got to find a way in the week\u2019s preparation to get a little bit better. So our challenge this week as a playing squad and coaching squad is how do we find ways to get better? We\u2019ve already decided we\u2019ll have a bit of a rest early in the week and then start training a little bit later.\u201d\n\nThe Australian was delighted with how his side responded to an opening 17 minutes in which they saw very little possession, with two tries from Jonny May in four devastating minutes setting the platform for them to take control of the game.\n\n\u201cParticularly in the first 20 minutes we had to really dig in,\u201d Jones added. \u201cThey had a lot of possession, about 75 to 77 per cent and they were attacking well with good field position. So it was an important part of the game because if they got out into a lead a bit there we know they\u2019re a front-running team.\n\n\u201cWe hung in there, got a bit of momentum back, took our opportunities well and went into half-time in a good position. \u201c\n\nAustralia closed the 17-9 half-time lead to a solitary point with Marika Koroibete\u2019s brilliant score soon after the restart, but further scores from Kyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson plus six points from Owen Farrell saw England equal the 26-point winning margin that they achieved at Twickenham two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe made a couple of mistakes after half-time and let them back in the game,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut what I was really impressed by the players is their ability to refocus and reset after we had a problem in the game, and that\u2019s a great development of the team and a great job by Owen as captain.\u201d\n\nHaving made the big call to drop George Ford from the starting line-up and move Farrell to fly-half to accommodate Henry Slade, Jones was strongly vindicated in his selection, with Farrell delivering his best performance of the World Cup and Slade playing a key role in both of May\u2019s tries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with selection, 10, 12 and 13 had a lot of defensive work early in the game and we thought that might happen, so Sladey did a great job,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThen I thought George Ford came on in the second half and was absolutely spectacular, filled his role superbly, kept turning Australia around when we needed to, helped Owen with the tactical side of the game particularly when it was opening up.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t drop [Ford], I changed his role. I know you guys struggle with that but he changed his role and he was brilliant. Are we vindicated? We\u2019re happy that he played his role well. Rugby\u2019s changed, it\u2019s a 23-man game.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones warned his England\u00a0team to be wary of the \u201csamurais lurking around the corner\u201d following their quarter-final victory over Australia\u00a0at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/19/13/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
