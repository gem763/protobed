Countrywide, buyers were only able to negotiate an average discount of \u00a38,000 (US$9,665 ).\n\n\n\nMore: A Kensington Home With a Sense of Style\n\nIn a few towns, most homes are selling at or over the initial listing price, including more affordable areas like Driffield, Yorkshire; Dronfield in the East Midlands; and Salford, part of Greater Manchester, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis close relationship between initial listing and final sale prices points to a healthy and robust property market, in which estate agents and sellers alike are well-versed in and realistic about property values,\u201d said Laura Howard, a spokeswoman for Zoopla, in the report.\n\n\n\nThe relatively small average discount for U.K. homes follows a drop in overall sales in the country, as buyers and sellers who are able to wait out the political uncertainty hold off on transacting.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, more expensive parts of the country, particularly anywhere in and around London, continue to see more price negotiability, the data shows.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Great Escapes: Mornington Peninsula & McLaren Vale, the Heart of Australian Wine Country\n\nThe affluent down of Ascot, in East Berkshire, has seen some of the biggest discounts for a prime area outside of London. The average home there traded for \u00a3550,000 over the past 12 months, an average discount of nearly 8% (or \u00a350,000).\n\n\n\nThe trend is the same in London, where more affordable neighborhoods have logged slim discounts compared to luxury strongholds like Camden and Kensington, Zoopla found.\n\n\n\nBuyers in Camden got an average 9% discount totaling roughly \u00a375,000, while those in Kensington knocked 8.3% off the listing price for a total discount of \u00a3116,000.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-103662?size=1.2660731948565775&width=1280"}
