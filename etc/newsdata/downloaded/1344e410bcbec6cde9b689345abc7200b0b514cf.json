That's more than 10,000 fighters that can threaten us in the region,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Rice praised Trump's decision to use military strikes against Syria in response to chemical weapons attacks, she defended the Obama administration's relatively tepid response during his second term.\n\nSUSAN RICE SLAMS TRUMP'S TROOP WITHDRAWAL FROM SYRIA\n\nRice said that she was the \"lone dissenting voice\" among Cabinet members who thought it was a mistake to ask Congress for authorization to use force.\n\nUpon reflecting on that situation, Rice decided she was wrong to favor force and thought Obama was successful in leveraging diplomacy after the nation's chemical weapons attacks.\n\n\"I was right about the politics -- I didn't think that President Obama would be granted support from Congress and he wasn't -- but I think I was wrong about the policy,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Because at the end of the day, it was possible through diplomacy to get 1,300 metric tons of sarin gas and chemical weapons out of Syria.\"\n\nCritics, however, have argued that Obama's decision led to the chemical weapons attacks that Trump faced under his administration.\n\nTrump's military strikes, she argued, were appropriate but \"led to nothing.\"\n\n\"The use of force -- unless it is translated into diplomacy and action that yields lasting results on the ground -- is not sufficient,\" she said.", "description": "\"View\" co-host Meghan McCain called out former national security adviser Susan Rice on Wednesday, suggesting she couldn't criticize President Trump on Syria given what former President Obama did while Rice served in his administration.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
