This is likely to be a tear-jerker. The VT tells Will\u2019s own story about how he was born with arthrogryposis, then diagnosed with cancer aged seven. He visits Great Ormond Street and dedicates the routine to them. They begin sat side-by-side on the floor, barefoot, then into an emotional routine with lift and sweet changes of pace. Lots of fight and moments of triumph. Will gets Janette's skirt over his face in a slight wardrobe malfunction but inspirational and downright lovely.\n\nMusic: \u201c7 Years\u201d by Lukas Graham\n\nJudges\u2019 verdict: Alfonso is in tears and says \"it gave me chills, incredibly inspiring, little boys and girls will watch that and know that anything is possible\". Craig says \"clear, emotional storytelling and a complete inspiration - however, you need more free movement in your torso, but it had punch and purpose, it was great\". Motsi is also tearful and gets a cuddle from Will. Shirley concludes \"you put your mind to it and did it, you give the whole nation hope, a beautiful number, so well executed\".\n\nJudges' scores: 7, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 32 points. His highest, fifth on the scoreboard so far.", "description": "The third Couple\u2019s Choice routine of the series and, like Saffron last week, they\u2019ve opted for the contemporary style.", "authors": ["Michael Hogan", "Victoria Coren Mitchell", "Flic Everett", "Julie Burchill"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213511653-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3XmyF3YIL3K1caQxZsZv2Ssm-UOV8_Q90I8_c5Af0yY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
