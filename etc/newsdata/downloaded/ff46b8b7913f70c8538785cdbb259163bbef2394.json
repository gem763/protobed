It also said the head of Nestl\u00e9 Waters, Maurizio Patarnello, would leave the company by the end of the year.\n\nThe change mimics a restructuring Chief Executive Mark Schneider pushed through for Nestl\u00e9's infant nutrition arm, where the company says results have since improved.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters currently employs 28,000 people. A spokesman declined to comment on whether there would be job losses. About 60% of Nestl\u00e9's bottled-water sales come from local or regional brands -- like Poland Spring in the U.S. Waters makes up about 8% of overall sales and under 5% of Nestl\u00e9's profits, according to Jefferies.\n\nThe restructuring came as Swiss-based Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said sales in the nine months ended Sept. 30 were 68.37 billion Swiss francs ($68.71 billion), compared with 66.42 billion francs in the same period last year. Organic growth -- which strips out the effects of currency movements, mergers and acquisitions -- was 3.7% for the first three quarters, mostly driven by higher volumes, meeting analyst estimates. It also backed its 2019 estimates and said it would return 20 billion francs to investors over the next few years, primarily through share buybacks. The company didn't release profit figures.\n\nIn the water business, revenue was flat over the nine months, while volumes dropped 2.2%.\n\nWater is a \"problem category\" for Nestl\u00e9, said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo earlier this month, saying the business is losing share to rivals in the U.S., its biggest market. Nestl\u00e9 last year began selling sparkling, flavored water under Poland Spring, Arrowhead and other brands in the U.S. but the company has struggled to stand out in an increasingly crowded category. Apart from LaCroix -- the market leader -- Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. have rolled out sparkling-water competitors, while startups and private-label seltzer brands abound.\n\nOn Thursday, Nestl\u00e9 said organic growth in its North America water business had been flat and declined in Europe, where it sold less water than hoped over the past summer. Bottled water makers -- particularly in Europe -- are facing consumer and regulatory pressure over their use of single-use plastic, amid a backlash about waste.\n\nSince taking over in 2017, Mr. Schneider has tried to focus Nestl\u00e9's energies on a handful of core businesses he views as high-growth. Water is one of these, along with nutrition pet food and coffee. The company has faced scrutiny from activist investor Daniel Loeb to improve its financial performance and sell its stake in L'Or\u00e9al SA.\n\nMr. Schneider has made a string of changes including selling slower-growth, nonfood assets like its skin-health unit and has made big acquisitions like splashing out $7 billion to buy the rights to sell Starbucks Corp.'s coffee and tea in grocery and retail stores. The company on Thursday said it was creating a new strategy and business development role, which would be filled by its head of acquisitions, Sanjay Bahadur. The role is intended to help Nestl\u00e9 identify new growth opportunities.\n\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 04:01 ET (08:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
