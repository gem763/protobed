I don\u2019t really know who will be available,\u201d United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told reporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cPogba won\u2019t be fit unless he has had a miraculous recovery overnight or before the game. But you have players who can come in with loads of experience \u2014 Juan (Mata), Nemanja (Matic), Ashley (Young). They are the ones who have to step up now.\u201d\n\nDiogo Dalot, who is nursing a hip injury, and Eric Bailly (knee) are also ruled out but Solskjaer is hoping that Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jesse Lingard could be involved this weekend after late fitness tests.\n\n\u201cMaybe Aaron, maybe Jesse. But that\u2019s it, from the ones who have pulled out. I can\u2019t promise they\u2019ll be available either,\u201d Solskjaer added.\n\nUnited are looking to turn their season around after failing to record a victory since the opening weekend.\n\nA second league defeat of the campaign would leave United six points behind Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester and heap further pressure on Solskjaer who has failed to deliver results since being confirmed as full-time manager in March.\n\n\u201cWe want to get the results we feel we deserve. We are coming into a busy period now, we don\u2019t want to be behind Tottenham, Chelsea or Arsenal,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk too much about Leicester. I see them as a good team but Man Utd is the biggest and best club in the world. I\u2019m sure they want to get into the top four like we do.\u201d\n\nDE GEA CONTRACT TALKS\n\nGoalkeeper David de Gea\u2019s long-term future at Old Trafford remains uncertain, with the Spaniard in the final year of his contract and free to enter pre-contract talks with clubs from abroad from Jan. 1.\n\nSky Sports reported De Gea was in talks over a new deal with United at the start of the new season, and Solskjaer sees the 28-year-old playing at United for the rest of his career.\n\n\u201cI want David to stay here, he knows that,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cFor me, David is the best goalkeeper in the world. We have seen that over the years.\n\n\u201cI hope I can make sure that he will finish his career at United at the highest level. There have been loads of talks and discussions between David and the club and hopefully we can get it done.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United are facing an injury crisis on their return to Premier League action, with Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw set to miss Saturday's clash against Leicester City.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429407945&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0W8", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
