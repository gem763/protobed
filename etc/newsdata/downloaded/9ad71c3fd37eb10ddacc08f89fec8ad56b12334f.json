Trump\u2019s allies believe Sondland\u2019s testimony will be helpful to their side.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are looking for any silver lining they can get,\u201d the source said. \u201cSondland could be a silver lining \u2026 He donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural. He\u2019s a Trump guy. Whereas [former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie] Yovanovitch is a career person.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
