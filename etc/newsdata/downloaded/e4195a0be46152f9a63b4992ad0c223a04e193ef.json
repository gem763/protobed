Despite making almost two dozen trips to the Communist giant \u2014 trips that probably earned him tens of millions of dollars all told \u2014 he seems to have no idea just what kind of monster his paymaster is.\n\nThe people of Hong Kong \u2014 whose struggle for freedom LeBron prefers to ignore \u2014 know better. They understand that what the Communist Party of China runs across the border is not just a police state but the world\u2019s first hi-tech virtual prison whose goal is literally to monitor all of China\u2019s 1.3 billion people all the time.\n\nThey know that the party runs the world\u2019s largest network of concentration camps, whose millions of political prisoners and ethnic minorities are forced to produce cheap goods for export.\n\nThey know that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has warned them that any attempt to divide the country will end in \u201cbodies smashed and bones ground to powder.\u201d Finally, they know that any sign of American indifference to their plight makes Xi even more likely to act on his vicious threat.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just LeBron James and the NBA who kowtow to China. American individuals and institutions \u2014 even the wealthiest and most prestigious \u2014 have been bowing and scraping to China since the very beginning of US-China relations.\n\nIn the pursuit of profit, American companies have collaborated with the Beijing regime since the 1980s. Hundreds of US companies opened factories to take advantage of the cheap labor that China was willing to supply under slave-like conditions, selling out American workers in the process.\n\nEven today, American hi-tech companies are continuing to help China set up its surveillance state to the detriment of freedom there. Google\u2019s continuing collaboration with China in developing artificial intelligence is just one example.\n\nSuccessive presidential administrations have encouraged American investment in China, while largely ignoring rampant human-rights violations there. Even the deliberate massacre of 10,000 students in the streets of Beijing in 1989, for example, was not enough to convince then-President George H.W. Bush to abandon his pro-China policy.\n\nAnyone who got in the way of America\u2019s decades-long appeasement of China \u2014 like Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey recently did by tweeting support for Hong Kong \u2014 had to be sacrificed.\n\nAsk me. I know. I was the first to be sold down the river. And by no less a prestigious institution than Stanford University. I was finishing up a Ph.D. in anthropology there when I was selected to be the first American social scientist since 1949 to do research in China. I arrived just in time to become an eyewitness to the horrors of the country\u2019s newly announced one-child policy.\n\nMy \u201ccrime\u201d was calling out China in print for arresting, imprisoning and aborting young, pregnant moms.\n\nChina construed this as an \u201cattack on the Chinese people,\u201d and demanded that I be \u201cseverely punished\u201d by the university. And Stanford \u2014 one of the leading universities in the world \u2014 caved, denying me that Ph.D. I had earned, and sending me packing.\n\nWhat was the threat that brought Stanford to its knees?\n\nThough Stanford claimed it was worried that my informants had been put in jeopardy and this contravened anthropological ethics, I knew the real reason for my expulsion: China had threatened to ban all Stanford scholars from China indefinitely.\n\nThe cowardice concerning my case extended all the way to the top of the Carter administration. Even Carter\u2019s National Security Council urged Stanford to comply with China\u2019s demand.\n\nIt turned out that China was threatening to cancel the entire US-China scholarly exchange program.\n\nJust like they threatened to ban the NBA.\n\nDo you see the pattern here?\n\nThe bully of Asia\u2019s default behavior \u2014 when it sees something it doesn\u2019t like \u2014 is to issue threats.\n\nFortunately, we now have a president who is not accustomed to taking a knee. With the help of trade adviser Peter Navarro and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the Trump White House is calling for an end to appeasement, urging both lawmakers and corporate boards to stand up to China \u2014 and to stand for the quintessential American values of liberty and freedom of expression.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t believe that is a very good thing, just ask the protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nSteven W.
