The government built a vast security apparatus to target threats to the United States from extremist groups based overseas, including and extensive effort to identify, track and arrest Americans who give them support.\n\nBut potential domestic attackers, largely untethered to specific organizations and protected from police scrutiny by free-speech rights, have proven more difficult for the government to investigate. An affiliation with a designated international terrorist group makes someone fair game for U.S. criminal investigators; expressing extreme, or even violent, views without such a connection typically does not.\n\n\"In taking on these complicated and dangerous threats alongside our local law enforcement partners, I want our federal agents and prosecutors to have all of the information and resources necessary to accomplish their mission, even if it means at times turning to new partners and experimenting with new approaches,\" the attorney general said.\n\nBarr said the December law enforcement gathering at FBI headquarters would serve as a training conference to address the threat.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: AG William Barr calls for December mass shooting summit", "description": "AG William Barr calls for December mass shooting summit; attacks demand full attention of federal govt", "authors": ["Kevin Johnson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MHot4w19P.fhWt55x19irw--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/6134bb03f1c84285512680fdbbfd0c3e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
