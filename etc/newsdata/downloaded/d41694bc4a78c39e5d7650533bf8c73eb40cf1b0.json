Off the back of the rise of Tesla, we\u2019ve got companies like Rivian sprouting up all over the shop \u2013 plus the people tuning all the leccy cars. But there\u2019s also Canoo, a SoCal start-up that thinks it has the answer to the future of mobility with this, the, err, Canoo.\n\nIt\u2019s a subscription-only EV microbus designed by the bloke who penned the BMW i3 and i8. And we can see the arty mood board he used for inspiration from here; The Jetsons, A VW microbus, the Dymaxion, a few bubble cars and a supersized paracetamol tablet. But like all bubbly buses, it\u2019s got serious visual appeal. However, if you don\u2019t like the way it looks, Canoo has a solution.\n\nBeing built off an in-house bespoke electric skateboard chassis (or \u2018proprietary\u2019, as they say in the land of smoothies and shaka hand signals) you can just shove another body on top if you like. It\u2019s very much like VW\u2019s modular electric (MEB) construction where the chassis contains the motors and batteries, freeing up passenger space and theoretically enabling Canoo \u2013 or you \u2013 to stick basically any body they like on top of it. But we\u2019re digging the bus vibes, especially as in the future \u2013 when the machines are driving the Canoo for you as it\u2019s been optimised for autonomy \u2013 the inside of the car will be an even bigger selling point, and Canoo has made a home from home.\n\nAs they\u2019ve handily demonstrated, there\u2019s enough room for a full-blown surfboard inside. When that\u2019s not taking up space, there\u2019s room for seven people. We\u2019re told all seating is designed to feel more like furniture than traditional car seats. That\u2019s why the back seats look like a night club sofa, while the fronts take inspiration from mid-century chairs. Canoo says that the interior is designed to mimic \u2018an urban loft on wheels\u2019. Overpriced and drafty, then. Kevin McCloud won\u2019t be happy.\n\nPowered by one electric motor and an 80kWh battery which it claims is good for 313lb ft of torque, 300bhp, 250 miles of range and a top speed of 125mph. Plus, DC fast charging allows it to be juiced up in 28mins. Better still, it\u2019s rear-wheel drive. So if you\u2019ve ever wanted to know what a giant lozenge looks like sideways, we\u2019re only a few years away.\n\nBut the 2019 soundbites continue, as it\u2019s the Canoo\u2019s purchasing model which is quite leftfield. Just like how we now consume music, films and go to the gym, Canoo will only operate solely as a monthly subscription service. This negates all that boring admin like vehicle registration, maintenance, insurance management, with everything being charged to your credit card through a single app on your phone. The idea, the company says, is to bring the convenience and affordability of a Netflix movie service to the auto industry.\n\nCanoo currently has beta cars on-site at its Los Angeles headquarters, where prospective partners and customers can test out the vehicles with the first cars hitting the road in 2021.\n\nHow do you feel about motoring going the way as music and film?
