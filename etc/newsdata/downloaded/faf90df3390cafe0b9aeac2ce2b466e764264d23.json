No one would have begrudged the company if it rested on its laurels after releasing a console as fresh as the Switch, but it hasn\u2019t done that at all. Quite the opposite in fact.\n\nSince the console\u2019s launch, Nintendo has released a range of extra hardware, including cardboard Labo kits and a VR headset. But now? It\u2019s getting into the fitness game with a circular bit of plastic and a leg strap.\n\nYes, welcome to the world, Ring Fit Adventure.\n\nWe had a chance to play with the hardware in Amsterdam and walked away impressed. Here are seven things we discovered in that process.\n\nYou get used to the equipment pretty quickly\n\nThe tools of a fitness WARRIOR.\n\nWhen I first held the Ring-Con and strapped the joy-con to my leg I was\u2026 less than enthusiastic. To put it bluntly I felt like a goofy fuck.\n\nAfter a few minutes of usage though, I got used to it. Such, I suppose, is the human condition.\n\nThe Ring-Con is the main bit of equipment, and you interact with a lot of the game by either squeezing or pulling on it. This bit of hardware also functions as your main tracker, meaning the game can follow your stretches and other movements. It feels well made, tactile, and with enough resistance to keep things interesting.\n\nThe very definition of a Fit Boy.\n\nThe leg strap did make me feel like I was wearing a wedding garter \u2014 and you need to strap it on hard to ensure the joy-con stays put \u2014 but it works fine. I didn\u2019t actually check if it was machine washable, but I\u2019d assume so. Otherwise it might start smelling bad very soon.\n\nWhile I might not want anyone filming (more) video of me using the Ring Fit Adventure gear, it ended up feeling more natural than I thought it would.\n\nThe game\u2019s adventure mode takes your mind off exercising\n\nEven though Ring Fit Adventure literally has \u201cadventure\u201d in the title, I did expect the game to be more like Wii Fit, a title in which you just copied the on screen instructions. This wasn\u2019t the case at all.\n\nRing Fit Adventure finds your character going to different stages, sprinting through the levels, blasting things, and fighting enemies \u2014 all while you\u2019re hunting down the game\u2018s main villain.\n\nNow, I spent under an hour on the main quest, so it could get dull after a bit, but I did find the adventure engaging during my time with it.\n\nWhile you\u2019re traversing the level (which you do by jogging on the spot, as your character runs along a fixed path) you can also squeeze of pull on the ring, which blows or sucks air respectively. As you\u2019re progressing, you can move the ring around, and interact with the area, blowing apart things or sucking in items, such as money or power-up items.\n\nFeeling that buuuuurn.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting an enemy, you choose an exercise (some of which are more effective against certain creatures), and then undertake that to vanquish them. This can be squats, presses, or a range of other activities. The battle mechanics themselves kinda work like a sweaty Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThese interactions do an amazing job of taking your mind off the exercise \u2014 which is fantastic. I do wonder whether this impact will stop working after a while, but it really made my time with Ring Fit Adventure fly by.\n\nThere\u2019s a sick option for people who live in flats or old, creaky buildings\n\nI live in an Amsterdam flat that was built in the 1880s. This means the floors aren\u2019t that thick. Now, I mentioned before that you move through a level in adventure mode by jogging on the spot \u2014 something I can\u2019t really do in my apartment unless I want my downstairs neighbours to hate me.\n\nLuckily though, Nintendo has thought of this in Ring Fit Adventures. There\u2019s an option to switch from running on the spot, to doing micro squats. It\u2019s a small change, but will make all the difference to people living in apartments across the world.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty erotic\n\nThough I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s intentional. The main villain is some sort of dragon/man hybrid with huge, bulging muscles tucked into a tiny little wrestling singlet.\n\nOh, and he talked about \u201crings\u201d a lot. Count me a fan.\n\nLook at this buff, sexy slice of beast.\n\nYou get a genuine sweat on\n\nYes, I am a sweaty man in general, but that moistness was definitely increased by Ring Fit Adventures.\n\nIf I had to describe the exercise the game puts you through, I\u2019d compare it most to aerobics. You do lots of repetitive work-out actions that start to burn over a while.\n\nThe other game modes apart from adventure \u2014 which are a general fitness routine and some really fun mini-games \u2014 also follow this sort of route. Although, there are some intense 20 second exercises that are devastating.\n\nDuring the trial, the options were generally set as moderate, so there\u2019s definitely a chance you can get some HIIT workouts in if you\u2019re that way inclined.\n\nI\u2019m still on the fence about long-term use\n\nFirst off, as far as fitness games go, Ring Fit Adventure is by far the most engaging. I can see many happy (read: sweaty) hours spent hot-stepping in front of my TV.\n\nThe issue comes from how long this will last. Is this something that\u2019s fun for a week? A month? A year? The true value of exercise comes from doing it constantly and consistently, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Ring Fit Adventure keeps my attention after a while \u2014 an issue that impacts pretty much every game in this category.\n\nGetting wet as it dries.\n\nNintendo is great, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLook, I know it\u2019s a multinational corporation designed to make a profit, but Nintendo does feel different to a lot of other companies. Games like Ring Fit Adventure show the company isn\u2019t afraid to experiment and, on some level at least, wants its users to be healthy.\n\nCould this just be so their customers and live longer can spend more money on weird Nintendo equipment? Probably, but who cares when the product is as good as Ring Fit Adventure?\n\nWe\u2019ll be doing another piece after we\u2019ve spent some time with the game, so make sure you check back to Plugged for that.
