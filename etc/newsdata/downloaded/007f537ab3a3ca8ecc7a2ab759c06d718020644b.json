Iron-ore prices this year surged to their highest value since early 2014 on concerns over a shortfall, but have since eased and are widely forecast to edge lower over the coming year.\n\nExecutives at Rio Tinto, which in Australia runs one of the world\u2019s biggest iron-ore operations globally, had previously said they were under no pressure to offload the Canadian business. \u201cI want to clean up the portfolio as quickly as I can but, at the same time, there will not be a fire sale,\u201d Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques had said in 2017 of his strategy to sell assets.\n\nThe decision to tell bankers to stop working on the process for a sale or IPO for the Canadian unit was earlier reported by Bloomberg.\n\nIron Ore Co. of Canada produces iron-ore concentrate and pellets from mining operations and processing facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador. It also runs port facilities in Quebec.\n\nThe business is a joint venture between Rio Tinto, Mitsubishi Corp. 8058, -0.82% , which owns 26%, and the Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Income Corp. LIF, -3.34% , which owns 15%.\n\nIt recorded net earnings of $166 million for Rio Tinto in 2018, down from $235 million the year earlier. Its operations had been suspended for two months during the year amid labor negotiations.", "description": "Executives at Rio Tinto, which in Australia runs one of the world\u2019s biggest iron-ore operations globally, had previously said they were under no pressure to...", "authors": ["Rhiannon Hoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ492_rio_ti_ZG_20181203081131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
