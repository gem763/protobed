She has had 26 surgeries in her life.\n\n\"Usually the comments roll off my back,\" she said. \"But it was really hurtful.\"\n\nBlake came up with the best possible response to the trolls who said she shouldn't post selfies: she posted three.\n\nDuring the last round of trollgate, people said that I should be banned from posting photos of myself because I\u2019m too ugly. So I\u2019d just like to commemorate the occasion with these 3 selfies... \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/9ZuSYFOtwv \u2014 Melissa Blake (@melissablake) September 7, 2019\n\n\"I'm just defiant enough to do the opposite of what they want me to do,\" Blake told \"GMA.\" \"I thought, 'you will not get the best of me.\"'\n\nThat night, Blake, who writes about pop culture, relationships and other topics for such outlets as The New York Times, Cosmo, and CNN, as well as has a blog, gained 100 new Twitter followers. By the next morning, two thousand more. \"I thought it was a glitch,\" she said.\n\nIt wasn't. In days since she tweeted her three selfies on Sept. 7, the post has been liked almost 300,000 times.\n\n\"I have heard from so many people, in all different countries, they're so glad to see something positive on social media for once,\" she said.\n\nShe's been challenging her followers to share their selfies too. \"They tweet their own with the hashtag #MyBestSelfie and say something they love about themselves,\" Blake said.\n\nWhile she wasn't lacking in self-confidence before, the recent events have made her more secure than ever, she told 'GMA.\"\n\n\"I hope this starts a conversation about disability. What we consider beautiful is so narrow,\" she said.\n\nAnd she has a message for young people, one she wishes she could tell her younger self: \"I would say not to care so much what other people think.\"", "description": "Journalist Melissa Blake responds to trolls online.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190919melissablakemain_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
