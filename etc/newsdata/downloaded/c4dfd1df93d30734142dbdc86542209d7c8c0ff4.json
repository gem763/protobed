Elizabeth Warren has gained support among New York Democrats and is now tied with former Vice President Joe Biden, a poll released Tuesday shows.\n\nBoth Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were the choice of 21% of registered Democrats surveyed last week by the Siena College Research Institute. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders garnered the support of 16% of Democrats, and all other candidates won support in the single digits.\n\n\u201cBiden no longer holds the title of front-runner in the Empire State,\u201d poll spokesman Steven Greenberg said. \u201cWith six months until New Yorkers cast their ballots in the presidential sweepstakes, a quarter of Democrats are still undecided, and no candidate has even that much support. This race remains wide open.\u201d\n\nSiena spoke to 340 Democrats among the 742 registered voters surveyed, so the Democratic horse-race portion of the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 6.5 percentage points. A similar survey by the college last month showed Ms. Warren at 17% and Mr. Biden at 22%.\n\nThe New York bump is in line with Ms. Warren\u2019s rise in national polls and comes less than a month after she attracted thousands to a rally in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park.\n\nThe Siena poll also found a majority of New Yorkers surveyed support ways to direct money to college athletes. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they supported legislation to allow athletes to get compensation for use of their name, image or likeness. Another 60% of New Yorkers surveyed said they would support sharing 15% of ticket revenue with student athletes.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a bill last month that would allow student athletes to receive money from endorsements. A similar measure is pending in the New York State Legislature.\n\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com", "description": "Sen.
