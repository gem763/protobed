As Congress pursues impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, lawmakers now want access to that information, and because the Trump administration has nothing to hide, the White House is eager to provide those materials in the name of transparency.\n\nNo, I\u2019m just kidding. The Trump administration is actually fighting tooth and nail to block the grand jury materials from reaching Capitol Hill.\n\nLawyers for House Democrats on Tuesday urged a federal judge to release grand jury testimony from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation as Congress conducts an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Douglas Letter, an attorney for the Judiciary Committee, said the materials are needed to investigate what Trump knew about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. The committee is seeking access to grand jury witness transcripts that could demonstrate obstruction of justice, among other things. Attorneys for the Department of Justice, however, told Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell that the House Judiciary Committee has not gone through the correct legal process necessary to obtain the secret material, which was redacted in the version of Mueller\u2019s report given to Congress and released to the public.\n\nBecause if there\u2019s one thing we know about Trump administration lawyers, it\u2019s their unyielding fealty toward correct legal processes.\n\nIn terms of the underlying legal dispute, grand jury transcripts are kept secret, though they can be shared as part of \u201cjudicial proceedings.\u201d The ongoing case is testing whether an impeachment process counts as a judicial proceeding, and whether the U.S. House\u2019s current impeachment inquiry is legitimate.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell hasn\u2019t yet ruled, though she seemed skeptical yesterday of the Republican arguments. But as Rachel noted on the show last night, of particular interest was Trump\u2019s Justice Department arguing against Watergate-era precedent.\n\nDuring Richard Nixon\u2019s scandal, a federal judge ruled that the impeachment process is, in fact, a judicial proceeding and ordered the Justice Department to turn over Watergate grand jury materials to Congress. The result became known as the \u201cWatergate roadmap.\u201d\n\nSo, problem solved, right? All officials have to do now is follow the existing precedent? If only it were that easy. Trump\u2019s Justice Department, led by Attorney General Bill Barr, suggested yesterday that the Nixon dispute was resolved incorrectly.\n\nHowell asked the Department of Justice if they disagreed with that [1974] ruling. [Elizabeth Shapiro, an attorney in the DOJ\u2019s civil division] said that the department\u2019s position has evolved since the 1970s. \u201cThe answer would be that if that same case came today, a different result would be obtained,\u201d Shapiro said. That briefly left Judge Howell in silence. \u201cWow, OK,\u201d Howell said. \u201cAs I said, the department is taking extraordinary positions in this case.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer, but I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s a problem when a federal judge hears your argument and responds, \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nConsider the implications of the Justice Department\u2019s pitch: if Watergate grand jury materials should\u2019ve been hidden from Congress, then lawmakers would never have had the \u201cWatergate road map,\u201d articles of impeachment wouldn\u2019t have been drawn, and Nixon might not have been forced to resign in disgrace.\n\n\n\nAs Jess Dweck joked yesterday, \u201cYou know your presidency is going well when you\u2019re at the \u2018Watergate was fine actually\u2019 stage.", "description": "I'm not a lawyer, but I think it's fair to say it's a problem when a federal judge hears your argument and responds, \"Wow.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/158214905.jpg?itok=LMiPNEz_", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
