The Bad News is that along the way there are harrowing declines (think -40% or more) as well as long stretches of 0% returns (From Dec-2000 through Sep 2011 the Index registered a total return of -4%. The stock market also went sideways from 1927 to 1949 and from 1965 to 1982).\n\nLarge declines and long flat periods can shatter investors financial goals and/or affect an investor\u2019s thinking for years to come. Given the rip-roaring bull market we have seen in the last 10 years it may be wise to reiterate that \u201ctrees don\u2019t grow to the sky.\u201d Don\u2019t misunderstood, I am not attempting to \u201ccall the top\u201d (as if I could), it\u2019s just that I have been in this business a while and \u2013 paraphrasing here \u2013 I\u2019ve seen some \u201cstuff.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is NOT intended to be the \u201cbe all, end all\u201d of trading systems. In fact, since 1971 this \u201csystem\u201d has beaten the S&P 500 Index by just a fraction. So, one might argue in the end that it is not worth the trouble. But here is the thing to consider: If you would like to earn market returns WITHOUT riding out all of the harrowing declines and the long sideways stretches \u2013 it is at least food for thought.\n\nThe Monthly LBRMomentum Strategy\n\nA Buy Signal Occurs\n\nThere are two indicators involved: a 21-month moving average of the closing price of the S&P 500 Index and a momentum indicator that I call LBRMomentum. The calculations for LBRMomentum appear at the end of the article. LBR is an acronym for Linda Bradford Raschke as it uses a calculation that I first learned about from something written by, well \u2013 who else \u2013 Linda Bradford Raschke (If you want to learn what the life of a professional trader is all about, I highly recommend you read her book,).\n\n*When LBRMomentum drops to negative territory then turns higher for one month, AND\n\n*SPX currently or subsequently closes above its own 21-month moving average (in other words, if LBRMomentum rise from below to above 0 while SPX is below it\u2019s 21-month MA, then the buy signal does not occur until SPX closes above its 21-month MA)\n\n*A Buy signal remains in effect for 18 months (if a new buy signal occurs during those 18 months then the 18-month bullish period is extended from the time of the new buy signal)\n\n*After 18-months with no new buy signal sell stocks and move to intermediate-term treasuries until the next buy signal\n\nSee Figures 1 and 2 for charts with \u201cBuy Signals\u201d displayed\n\nLBRMomentum Buy Signals\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 LBRMomentum Buy Signals\n\nLBRMomentum Buy Signals\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 LBRMomentum Buy Signals\n\nFigure 3 displays the cumulative total return for both the \u201cSystem\u201d and buying-and-holding SPX. As I mentioned earlier, following the huge bull market of the past 10 years the next results are roughly the same (Strategy = +11,769, buy-and-hold = +11,578%).\n\nLBRMomentum System (blue line) versus S&P 500 Index buy-and-hold; 1971-2019\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Growth of $1,000 invested using LBRMomentum System (blue line) versus S&P 500 Index buy-and-hold; 1971-2019\n\nBut to get a sense of the potential \u201cLet\u2019s Get Some Sleep at Night\u201d benefits of the System, Figure 4 displays the growth of $1,000 invested in the S&P 500 ONLY when the System is bullish.\n\nSPX ONLY while LBRMometnum System is Bullish\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Growth of $1,000 invested in SPX ONLY while LBRMometnum System is Bullish\n\nFigure 5 displays the growth of $1,000 invested in the Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) Treasury Intermediate Index ONLY when the LBRMomentum System is NOT bullish.\n\nSPX ONLY while LBRMometnum System is NOT Bullish\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Growth of $1,000 invested in SPX ONLY while LBRMometnum System is NOT Bullish\n\nThe things to notice about Figures 4 and 5 are:\n\na) the lack of significant drawdowns and,\n\nb) the lack of long periods with no net gain.\n\nIn other words, this approach represents the Tortoise and not the Hare. The intent is not so much to \u201cBeaten the Market\u201d but rather to avoid being \u201cBeaten Up by the Market.\u201d\n\nFigure 6 displays some relevant comparative performance figures.\n\nPerformance Figures\n\nNote that the Compounded Annual Growth Rate is virtually the same. However, the System clearly experienced a great deal less volatility along the way with a significantly lower standard deviation as well as far lower drawdowns (-17.6% for the System versus -50.9% for buy-and-hold). Note also that the System showed a 12-month gain 93% of the time versus 80% of the time for buy-and-hold. The System also showed a gain 100% of the time over 5-year periods (versus 89% of the time for buy-and-hold).\n\nThe last \u201cBuy Signal\u201d occurred on 3/31/2019 and will remain in effect until 9/30/2020.\n\nFor the record, this \u201cSystem\u201d has significantly underperformed buy-and-hold over the past 10 years. Still, if earning a market return over the long-term \u2013 without worrying as much about massive declines and long, flat stretches is appealing \u2013 it is food for thought.\n\nLBR Momentum\n\nLBRMomentum simply subtracts the 10-period moving average from the 3-month moving average as shown in the code below\n\nLBRMomentum is simpleavg([close], 3) \u2013 simpleavg([close], 10).", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Jay Kaeppel covering: S&P 500, Barclays PLC.
