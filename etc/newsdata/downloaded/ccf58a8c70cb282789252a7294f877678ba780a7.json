The left-stream media, whose sources purport to be leakers from inside the White House, are reporting that Mr. Trump called the prime minister of Australia at the request of Mr. Barr.\n\nAgain, like the \u201cWhistleblower\u2019s\u201d claims from Mr. Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president, these are second- and third-hand statements from unnamed sources that are being improperly leaked by a bad actor in the White House. The persistent attacks against this president by the deep state are typified by these unsubstantiated claims.\n\nLeftists in the media never mention that the FBI started its fraudulent investigation of then-candidate Trump based, in large part, on what an Australian diplomat told the FBI. The media also fails to disclose that the ultimate investigation of the Mueller team found no conspiracy, coordination or cooperation with Russians who attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe fact is that the attorney general is investigating the 2016 election interference and how the corrupt leaders of the FBI, such as James Comey, were able to use the government police apparatus against their political opponents.\n\nThat is the attorney general\u2019s job. But Democrats do not want the truth to come out. That is why they spin everything in the opposite direction.\n\nThe leftists are relying on information from leakers in the White House. They insist by innuendo that Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr are seeking information on political opponents, but this is simply projection. The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) used foreign informants and elites in government to protect Hillary Clinton from prosecution and to spy on then-candidate Trump.\n\nHow did Andy McCabe, James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce and Nellie Ohr work with Fusion GPS and foreign nationals to try and control the outcome of our 2016 presidential election? That is the objective of the current investigation being conducted by the Department of Justice.\n\nAll who have followed this story for the last three years understand that foreign interests played a role in the Russian collusion hoax. As this administration attempts to get to the bottom of how this started, we must certainly investigate all avenues to uncover the truth. It is natural to communicate with leaders of those nations and, where possible, obtain cooperation.\n\nSome in the media and their puppets in Congress instead project their own weaponization of the federal government, including the DOJ and FBI in the 2016 election, to accuse the Trump administration. But unlike in the Obama era, the Trump team is investigating past crimes, not political opponents.\n\nConversely, the leftist warriors who dominate the media are more concerned over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to bring justice to those who misused their position and abused their authority. This is one of the cardinal political sins in a constitutional republic like the United States of America. But they have no interest in investigating and bringing former Vice President Joe Biden to justice, who bragged about extorting the Ukrainian government into firing the prosecutor. This prosecutor was investigating a corrupt company, that featured on its board of directors Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden.\n\nAnd the corrupt media wonders why many Americans do not trust the stories they produce.\n\n\u2022 Andy Biggs, a Republican U.S. representative from Arizona, is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
