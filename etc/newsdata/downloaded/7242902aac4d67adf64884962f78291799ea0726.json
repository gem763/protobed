It was the latest development in a far-reaching saga that\u2019s cast a shadow over some of big pharma\u2019s most influential players.\n\nAllergan (AGN), which also settled with Ohio, will shell out $5 million. Meanwhile, Purdue Pharmacy, the maker of OxyContin, is already working on settling the more than 2,000 lawsuits it faces, and is also filing for bankruptcy. Insys Therapeutics, another opioid maker, was the first to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after announcing a $225 million settlement in its case.\n\nAccording to a recent report by ratings firm S&P Global, JNJ and AGN face the lowest risk in the legal battle \u2014 an argument bolstered by their recent actions on their credit. Both Moody\u2019s and S&P recently affirmed J&J\u2019s top-notch AAA rating, after a landmark ruling in Oklahoma slapped the giant with a $572 million judgement.\n\nThe JNJ Ohio settlement shines a favorable light on the companies for investors, according to a report by Credit Suisse issued on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe increased clarity regarding the range of potential litigation-related liability facing the company should increasingly return the stock to trading and valuation based primarily on fundamentals,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts wrote. \u201cWe view this news as a solid step in this direction, and reiterate our Outperform rating and $156 target on JNJ.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Hunter, Oklahoma Attorney General, listens during the Opioid trial in Norman, Okla., Monday, June 24, 2019.

Analysts say the potential weight of a big legal judgement could force smaller players to either fold completely, or be bought out.\n\n\u201cEvery company has a different incentive to settle,\u201d S&P analyst David Kaplan told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \u201cWhen we take the pattern together, it really all collectively points to this being a greater risk than we had thought.\u201d\n\nThere have already been a number of smaller settlements, ranging from the tens of millions to hundreds of millions. The largest settlement came from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma\u2014which offered a little more than $10 billion.\n\nYet every company has a different level of exposure that depends on the drug\u2019s market share, or who had the strongest pain medications. According to S&P\u2019s analysis, companies like Mylan (MYL), Cardinal Health, McKesson and AmerisourceBergen are considered \u201cmedium risk bucket\u201d \u2014 but names like Teva (TEVA), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP) face the highest risk.\n\n\u201cAll these companies have been downgraded by S&P over the past year, and opioid issues contributed to downgrades in some cases,\u201d S&P\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\nMallinckrodt has already reportedly hired a restructuring firm, the news of which resulted in a negative hit in the markets earlier this month. And Teva has indicated greater anticipated liabilities, Kaplan said on Tuesday.\n\nTeva is not required to indicate further liabilities unless it is probable, and the company indicated they were keeping reserves at $646 million. Given that the most recent settlement was $85 million, the larger provision hints at greater anticipated liability.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the bigger companies like Johnson & Johnson are concerned about their level of exposure, given their relative financial strength \u2014 and the lack thereof of the other defendants, analysts say.\n\nRecent reports suggest the remaining companies are trying to piggyback on Purdue bankruptcy settlement, but without filing bankruptcy themselves, to be free of any future opioid liabilities. One company, Endo Pharmaceuticals, confirmed to Yahoo Finance on Tuesday that the option was on the table.", "description": "Opioid litigation increasingly affecting credit outlooks for drug makers and distributors.", "authors": ["Anjalee Khemlani", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pz45OXGwCuCfcnAO0z2kPw--~B/aD0zMzY1O3c9NTA0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ace344b0-d866-11e9-affd-c12cab872883", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
