Operators say the platform charges hidden commissions on top of its 20 to 25 per cent franchise levy, adding up to half or more of their revenue on bookings. Hundreds claim to have abandoned the platform, while two operators filed police complaints against it in September; a judge has stayed one. The unrest is significant for Agarwal and SoftBank, which owns about 45 per cent of the firm. Unlike Airbnb, Oyo mostly lists rooms in existing hotels, not private residences, and it invests in the renovation of the properties in addition to providing standardized training and fixtures.
