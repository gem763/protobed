If there\u2019s no water fish simply have no way to survive, so the objective is to relocate them to a more secure habitat,\u201d he said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nBut he also said the relocation would still allow fish to migrate back down the river to their normal breeding grounds when water levels return to normal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be creating a modern day Noah\u2019s Ark to ensure that regardless of what pans out this summer, our native fish species are protected for future generations.\n\n\u201cDoing nothing is simply not an option. We know the risks from last year and that\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative we act quickly.\u201d\n\nHowever, the government has not specified exactly which species and how many fish it believes it can move, and locals remain concerned more fish than ever could die amid another record heatwave.\n\nLast year the fish died in sweltering conditions when a heatwave brought temperatures of over 40C to the Darling-Murray river basin.\n\nCombined with lack of rainfall, the temperatures set off huge algal blooms which sucked oxygen from the stagnant water, killing the fish, which then rotted rapidly in the heat.\n\nCritics have said the droughts in recent years have been exacerbated by management decisions in the river basin, in which numerous dams, locks and weirs control the flow of water through the river. Irrigation systems also draw water from the river for agricultural use.\n\nLast year, oxygen pumps were used in a futile attempt to make the water liveable for fish again.\n\nAt the time, the minister for regional water, Niall Blair, who has since stepped down from the post, conceded the aerators were a quick-fix for a bigger problem.\n\n\u201cThey are a Band-Aid solution \u2013 we admit that,\u201d Mr Blair told reporters.\n\n\u201cNothing will stop this fish kill unless we get proper river flows and water levels in our dams back up to normal. We are doing everything we can to try and limit the damage,\u201d he said in 2018.", "description": "Australian authorities are to transport hundreds of thousands of stranded fish from a drying river basin in an effort to avoid another mass die-off after last year\u2019s catastrophic fish deaths.
