Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the country will leave at the end of the month with or without a deal.\n\nTechnical teams from Britain and the EU worked through the weekend to secure a last-minute deal, although both sides said significant gaps remain between their positions.\n\nJohnson's spokesperson, James Slack, said \"the talks remain constructive but there is still a lot of work to do.\"\n\nDiscussions centred on the difficult issue of the future border arrangements between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. Britain has put forward a complex proposal to eliminate the need for customs checks, but EU officials say more work is needed.\n\nAn EU diplomat familiar with the talks said there would likely need to be a three-month extension to Brexit to turn the proposals into a legally binding deal.\n\n\"There are big problems remaining to counter smuggling and fraud because the British outlines are still that vague,\" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing. \"There is momentum but there is still little movement.\"\n\nFinal decision may come down to the wire\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said late Monday it was \"too early to say if it is possible to get a breakthrough this week or whether it will move into next week.\"\n\nAt the EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg, Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said, \"You know in Europe, we always take decisions on the edge of the precipice, on the edge of the cliff.\"\n\nBorrell added that \"even when the last minute comes, then we stop the watch and say that we need technically more time to fulfil all the requirements, all the last-minute requirements.\"\n\nThe EU has been dismayed by Johnson's hard line pro-Brexit language at home and apparent unwillingness to veer far from his last proposals for a deal.\n\nBorrell said: \"In Spain, we will do our utmost to avoid the situation, but if Mr. Johnson continues having the same attitude that he has been displaying at home, it is going to be very difficult.\"\n\nIn London, Queen Elizabeth delivered a speech outlining an ambitious \u2014 and critics say undeliverable \u2014 legislative program for Johnson's government.\n\nThe 10-minute speech, read by the 93-year-old monarch from a gilded throne in the House of Lords but written by the government, included more than 20 bills, including a law to implement an EU withdrawal agreement, should one be reached.\n\nJohnson, right, and opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, left, walk through the Commons Members Lobby on Monday.

The speech also included a long list of domestic policies, from longer sentences for violent criminals to no-fault divorce, tougher air pollution rules and new building-safety rules.\n\nThe government's critics called Monday's speech a stunt, because Johnson's Conservative administration lacks a majority in Parliament and an election looks likely within the next few months, whether or not Britain leaves the EU as scheduled on Oct. 31.\n\nThe speech was part of the State Opening of Parliament, a ceremony steeped in centuries-old symbolism of the power struggle between Parliament and the British monarchy. Lawmakers are summoned to listen to the Queen by a security official named Black Rod \u2014 but only complied after slamming the House of Commons door in their face to symbolize their independence.\n\nThe state opening is usually an annual event, but amid the country's Brexit chaos there has been no queen's speech for more than two years \u2014 the longest gap for more than three centuries.\n\nEU leaders, including Johnson, are due to meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday to see whether a Brexit deal is possible before Oct. 31.\n\nThe challenge of maintaining an invisible border on the island of Ireland \u2014 something that underpinned both the local economy and the region's peace deal \u2014 has dominated Brexit discussions for three years since U.K. voters chose in 2016 to leave the EU.\n\nNegotiations intensified last week after Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said they could see a \"pathway\" to a divorce agreement that avoids a no-deal Brexit, something economists say would hurt both the U.K. and EU economies.\n\nIf a Brexit deal is reached, it still needs to be approved by both the British and European parliaments. Many British lawmakers \u2014 on both pro-Brexit and pro-EU sides of the debate \u2014 remain unconvinced.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Sunday his party was unlikely to support any deal agreed upon by Johnson.", "description": "The United Kingdom and the EU said Monday that Brexit talks were making progress \u2014 but not yet enough to ensure a deal by the end of the month \u2014 as the government tried to look beyond the country's stalled EU exit with a policy platform read by the Queen in Parliament.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320350.1571069714!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-eu-parliament.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
