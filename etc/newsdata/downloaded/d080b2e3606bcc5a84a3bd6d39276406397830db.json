Treasury yields rose, and the yield on the 10-year note broke above 1.7%.\n\nAfter being lower for much of the session, the Dow turned positive during intraday trading following a South China Morning Post report that China was considering a deal to purchase more American agricultural goods ahead of the next round of trade meetings between U.S. and Chinese negotiators.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market by the end of regular equity trading:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): +0.03%, or 0.96 points\n\nDow (^DJI): +0.28%, or 73.92 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): -0.04%, or 3.28 points\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): +10.8 bps to 1.73%\n\nGold (GC=F): -1.03% to $1,495.50 per ounce\n\nChina data\n\nOverseas, signs of a worsening slowdown in China continued to mount, with new data pointing to weakening pricing power for producers and steeper prices for consumers in the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nChina\u2019s producer prices index (PPI) fell 0.8% in August over the year prior, yawning from a 0.3% decline in July and marking the steepest decline by this measure in three years. At the same time, the country\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) rose a faster-than-expected 2.8% over last year during the month.\n\nBeijing, however, has increasingly unveiled stimulus measures to try and reignite growth. On Tuesday, the Chinese government removed limitations to make it easier for foreign investors to purchase Chinese stocks and bonds, in a move to encourage foreign capital into the country. This comes after the government on Friday reduced the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves to try and boost lending and inject liquidity into the country\u2019s financial systems.\n\nApple event\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) product launch event in Cupertino, California, took centerstage Tuesday. The company unveiled its newest set of smartphones, as well as updates to its other hardware and services offerings.\n\nThese unveilings come at a critical juncture for Apple, which has faced skepticism over the longevity of demand for its premium hardware, as well as concerns over the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on the company. However, Wall Street was mostly unfazed by Tuesday\u2019s event, with the stock ending higher by just over 1%.\n\n\u201cAs expected, updates can generally be described as more incremental than dramatic,\u201d PiperJaffray analyst Michael J. Olson, who rates shares of Apple as Overweight, wrote in a note. \u201cFor iPhone, the expectations going into the event regarding improved cameras and faster processors were largely accurate.\u201d\n\nCEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 11 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam More\n\nThe company\u2019s newest smartphone, the iPhone 11, will be priced starting at $699, or $50 less than the iPhone XR. The new specs include a 6.1-inch display, dual-camera setup on the back panel, a battery that lasts an hour longer than that in the XR and an A13 Bionic chip capable of faster processing. Apple unveiled two premium phones as well, called the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, which each feature a new triple-lens camera set in the back, and hours more of battery life compared to that of the previous iPhone XS and XS Max.\n\n[Read more: Apple reveals iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max]\n\nThe company also announced the launch dates and pricing for some of its new services offerings, including Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade gaming subscription.\n\nApple priced its original video subscription service, set for launch November 1, at $4.99 per month. This was lower than the base streaming subscription packages offered by competitors including Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS). Shares of both companies each fell shortly following Apple\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThe pricing of Apple\u2019s streaming TV service at $4.99 per month is a \u2018show stopper\u2019 and a major shot across the bow at the likes of Netflix and Disney among others,\u201d WedBush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note. \u201cThe Street was anticipating a $7.99-$9.99 price point as clearly Cupertino is looking for market share coming out of the gates with these surprising price points that we loudly applaud.\u201d", "description": "The S&P 500 and Dow ended slightly higher Tuesday as a rotation into value stocks from their growth counterparts persisted.
