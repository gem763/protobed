Without changing its rules, Metro would likely have been forced to either run the cartoon as an ad, as Geller had requested, or face a possible lawsuit.\n\nGeller\u2019s organization was not mentioned during Thursday\u2019s meeting, the spokesman said.\n\nMuslims consider depictions of the Prophet Muhammad to be offensive.\n\nIn early May, the AFDI advertised a $10,000 prize for the winner of its \u201cDraw Muhammad\u201d event in Garland, Texas, which supporters claimed was an exercise of the right to free speech.\n\nAfter driving 1,000 miles from Phoenix, two gunmen opened fire on a police car outside the event; they were quickly killed by guards.\n\nMetro stations and buses are common canvasses for political groups in Washington, and have occasionally become the subject of fierce controversy.\n\nIn 2012, a federal judge forced the Washington and New York transit systems to run AFDI posters that said: \u201cIn Any War Between the Civilized Man and the Savage, Support the Civilized Man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.\u201d\n\nThis year, the AFDI also won lawsuits in Philadelphia and New York forcing bus and subway lines to display their ads.\n\nNew York's transit agency voted to ban political ads on subways and buses in April.\n\nThis story was updated at 3:53 p.m.", "description": "The D.C. transit system banned all political and religious ads through the end of the year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/metro_silverline_farragutwest_040914aw.jpg", "published_at": "2015-05-28"}
