More\n\nYemen's Houthi rebel group, part of a regional network of militants backed by Iran, claims to be behind the strikes on two Saudi oil facilities that have the potential to disrupt global oil supplies.\n\nA report from the United Nations Security Council published in January suggests that Houthi forces have obtained more powerful drone weaponry than what was previously available to them, and that the newer drones have the capability to travel greater distances and inflict more harm.\n\nThese \"so-called 'suicide or kamikaze drones'\" include UAV-X drones with a maximum range of 1,500 kilometers, or 930 miles, which would give Houthi forces the ability to launch drones from their Yemen territory to the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSmoke is seen following a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, September 14, 2019 in this picture obtained from social media.

Sare'e said 10 drones were used in the attack, which he said was in retaliation to Saudi military intervention in Yemen that has devastated the country, which has been at war since 2015.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Houthi forces are the definite source of the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on Twitter that Iran was behind the attacks, which the country's foreign minister denied on Sunday, calling the remarks \"maximum deceit,\" The New York Times reported. The Houthi rebel group is aligned with the Iranian government, which the US believes has trained Houthi forces on drone and missile technology.\n\nPompeo also said on Twitter that there is \"no evidence\" the attack came from Yemen. The Saudi Arabian government has not yet issued any statements identifying or accusing a specific attacker. The last drone attack on a Saudi oil facility was carried out by an Iran-backed militia in Iraq.\n\nThe US position on the attack is that it stemmed from cruise missiles fired from Iraq or Iran, as opposed to drones sent from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. On Sunday, the US declassified photos of the attack site showing strikes on 17 different places, with the intention of providing more evidence for the Iran theory.", "description": "A UN Security Council report details the types of drones believed to be used by Houthi forces, who claimed a 10-drone strike on 2 Saudi oil fields.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xAoTKrI8PSCQDTQVF7O5iA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/c26a7e4dce24a29ea59740a243af8933", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
