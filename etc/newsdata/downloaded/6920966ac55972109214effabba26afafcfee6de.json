Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nFor those among us who have been thinking about surrendering to the convenience of a single-serve coffee maker \u2014 where all you have to do to get some coffee is drop in a pod and press a button \u2014 without forgoing taste, the Nespresso Vertuo is an excellent place to start. It\u2019s able to make full cups of coffee and extra-long shots of espresso, in addition to the traditional single shot. (Plus, for those worried about single-use waste, Nespresso pods are made from aluminum and can be easily recycled.) And today is a particularly excellent day to get into the Nespresso game, because you can get this Vertuo machine and 30 pods for just $100 on Amazon. That\u2019s less than what it would cost you to buy just the machine. And even if you\u2019re perfectly content with your existing coffee setup, just know that a Nespresso machine makes a great gift for parents.\n\nNespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville $100 (was $162, now 38% off) $100 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
