The numbers of reported incidents during the previous cold front are as follows:\n\n. 3640 structures affected in Masiphumelele, Imizamo Yethu, Khayelitsha, Burundi, Nomzamo and Wallacedene.\n\n. fallen trees were reported in Parow, Edgemead, Crawford, Panorama, Durbanville and Brackenfell.\n\n. roads flooded across the city \u2013 most notably in Wallacedene, as well as Pelican Park, Ottery and Diep River.\n\n. power outages in Strand, Bonteheuwel, Observatory, Noordhoek, Joe Slovo Park, Athlone, Wynberg, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Sunnydale, Rondebosch, Philippi, Mitchell\u2019s Plain, Hout Bay and Plumstead.\n\n\u201cThis situation will change as repair teams make their way through the list of reported incidents. We ask that residents please bear with us, as assessments have to be completed for purposes of record before assistance like flood kits can be provided. They did make emergency shelters available to the affected communities; however, these offers have not been accepted,\u201d says Mayco member for safety and security, JP Smith.\n\nFollowing the Winter Task Team\u2019s meeting on Wednesday 24 July, blockages in the stormwater system emerged as one of the biggest concerns. These blockages are the result of illegal dumping, but also people storing items in the drains.\n\n\u201cAnother concern raised is the quality of the information provided when members of the public log service requests or alert us to emergencies. This has the potential to slow down response times or results in the incorrect agency responding. A simple example is, if the emergency is at City rental stock, we ask that callers indicate such because that too will help determine the correct department to lead the response.\n\n\u201cTherefore, my appeal to the public when reporting any incidents during heavy weather episodes, but also just in general, is to give as much information as possible, that our response matches their need,\u201d says Smith.\n\nThe City reminds residents of the following tips when making a call for help:\n\n. once you have dialled the number and are through to the operator, give them your contact number first so they can call you back if you lose connection;\n\n. always give your full name;\n\n. describe your location as accurately as you can as the operator might not know your neighbourhood as you do.\n\n. give the details of your emergency and let the operator guide the conversation;\n\n. stay on the line for as long as you can.", "description": "The disaster operations centre logged at least 43 flooding-related incidents; 122 power outages across; nine incidents of trees that had blown over or fallen branches and two incidents where roofs were blown across the metropole.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/1470345243209060/picture", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
