But we weren't a normal band.\"\n\nImage copyright Omega Auctions\n\nImage copyright Omega Auctions Image caption The interior of the bus in its current state\n\nAfter the tour, it eventually ended up at outside a rock cafe in Tenerife before being moved to the cafe owner's garden. \"I went to visit them about 10 years ago and saw this thing rotting away in his back garden,\" current owner Justin James told BBC News. \"I said, 'I want it.'\n\n\"I didn't know what I was going to do with it, I just thought that it should not be rotting away on the wastelands of Tenerife. It took eight years to bring it back (to Oxfordshire) because it was in such a difficult part to get to, how it was buried in this field. We got cranes and I managed to get it back.\"\n\nMr James hoped to use it for musical children's tours, but that plan didn't work out. He is now emigrating to Australia next month.\n\n\"I reckon someone could get that engine going, but I'm not that person unfortunately,\" he said. Mr James said he had spent \u00a325,000 on costs relating to the bus, and if it fetches more than that he will donate any profit to the Arms Around the Child charity, of which he is a trustee.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
