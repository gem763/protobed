More than 3,700 people responded to an online poll circulated on the group\u2019s social media networks with 72% saying they were opposed to the action \u201cno matter how it is done\u201d.\n\nThose findings were fed back to the decentralised groups planning the action on Wednesday afternoon and, according to one source, some backed down while others determined to press ahead.\n\nThose opposed feared the action, taken against what they said were the wishes of the overwhelming majority, would demoralise activists and raised questions about the group\u2019s democratic decision-making processes.\n\nMore fundamentally, they argued that the targeting of public transport \u2013 rather than roads, airports or financial institutions hit earlier in the week \u2013 confused their message.\n\n\u201cOur fear was that targeting public transport, an environmentally friendly way to travel, would alienate the public and muddle what we were trying to say in the minds of the public,\u201d said one of those opposed to the action who did not want to be named.\n\nThere was also concern that by explicitly targeting working Londoners, they would undermine any public sympathy they had built up.\n\nOne activist told the Guardian: \u201cWe were vehemently opposed to it. We feel that the actions of a handful of protesters have jeopardised our movement, turning public opinion against us and creating a potential schism within our ranks.\u201d\n\nHowever, others saw the fallout from the action differently. They argued that the scale of the climate crisis requires disruption of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to create \u201cbreakthrough moments that force people to engage with the reality of the climate crisis\u201d.\n\nThey point out that although there have been more than 1,400 arrests for nonviolent action over the past two weeks, it was Thursday morning\u2019s protests that prompted XR spokespeople to be invited onto television and radio programmes in record numbers.\n\n\u201cOur phones and inboxes have never been as busy,\u201d said Ronan McNern from XR. \u201cWe have had people on radio and TV programmes this morning and have more lined up for this afternoon and this evening.\u201d\n\nHe said despite more than 10 days of protests at sites across the capital the sense of a \u201creal climate emergency\u201d had struggled to cut through.\n\n\u201cThis action has created a disruption. Now conversations will be going on about what we are doing \u2013 and hopefully why we are doing it \u2013 at dinner tables and in pubs up and down the country.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt has been polarising but it has created an emotional space for these ideas and that provides us with an opportunity for some real change.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released by XR on Thursday afternoon it said it was saddened at the way events had escalated. It added that the people who had taken the action \u2013 a grandfather, an ex-buddhist teacher, a vicar and a former GP \u2013 had not taken the action lightly.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn light of today\u2019s events, Extinction Rebellion will be looking at ways to bring people together rather than create an unnecessary division.\u201d\n\nRuth Jarman, 56, from Christian Climate Action, was one of those involved in the transport action joining the protest on the DLR line at Shadwell, although she was not arrested.\n\nShe said she was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the ordinary working people caught up in the action but said the inconvenience caused \u201cpaled into insignificance compared with the chaos of climate breakdown\u201d unless immediate systemic action was taken.\n\n\u201cOur intention was to target the city \u2013 one of the economic powerhouses of the world \u2013 to cause economic disruption, because that is what those in power pay on to.\n\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time blocking roads and are not being heard. People are dying now because of the climate crisis and it threatens all we love.\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry for disrupting the lives of ordinary people \u2013 it was not our intention \u2013 but we have to raise the alarm and are desperate and don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d", "description": "Disrupting London trains was opposed by 72% of activists in poll, but has boosted coverage", "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/834a7cddaa968004b1102a1e9c26b242f4275bb5/0_251_1796_1078/master/1796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80d164bedbecc942088ff2956bca58a1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
