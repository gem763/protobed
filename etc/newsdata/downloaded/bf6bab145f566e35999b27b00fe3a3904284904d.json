We have a historic opportunity to end extreme poverty on our watch, but that will require more commitment in countries like the United States and Britain, and also in countries like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nOne ray of sunshine: Leaders at the United Nations last month committed themselves to achieving universal health coverage by 2030. Here in America, we\u2019re still feuding about access to medical care, but countries like Chile, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Thailand and Kyrgyzstan are showing that moving toward universal coverage is possible even with limited resources.\n\nIf these countries can manage it, why is the most powerful country in the history of the world stymied?\n\nUniversal coverage is championed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, the director general of the World Health Organization. He knows as well as anybody the importance of access to medical services, for his younger brother, Yemane, died at the age of 4, apparently of measles.\n\n\u201cThat was always haunting me,\u201d Tedros told me.\n\nUniversal coverage not only saves the lives of children from measles, but it also serves as a global bulwark against epidemics.\n\n\u201cPeople ask what keeps me up at night,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cMy nightmare is a pandemic flu.\u201d One way to protect against such a pandemic \u2014 and against Ebola and other viruses \u2014 is to build up health care systems in the most vulnerable countries.\n\nEbola has been spreading in eastern Congo for more than a year. If it suddenly bounces to Europe or Asia, we\u2019ll belatedly realize that our safety in America depends on improving health systems in Congo.", "description": "Global programs founded in the 2000s have saved tens of millions of lives.
