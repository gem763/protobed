Some of their statements were focused on a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump repeatedly brought up his desire for investigations into political rivals. Others touched specifically on Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in July to hold up the $391 million package of security aid to Ukraine, a development that government officials there said they only learned about at the end of August.\n\nOCT. 16, 2019\n\n1. President Trump\n\n\u201cNow, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn\u2019t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In remarks at the White House\n\n\n\nThe New York Times also found several other instances of Mr. Trump proclaiming \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d on Twitter, in remarks to reporters, in news conferences and at political rallies.", "description": "The president\u2019s acting chief of staff on Thursday undercut a popular Republican talking point about Ukraine.", "authors": ["Linda Qiu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/us/politics/17dc-quidproquo/17dc-quidproquo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
