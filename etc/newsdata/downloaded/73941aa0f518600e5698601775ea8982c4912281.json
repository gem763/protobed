On average, you\u2019ll need a pound and a half to two pounds of cheese per pound of pasta. But the type of cheese can vary depending on the style of macaroni and cheese you are making and your preferred flavors and textures.\n\nCheddar reigns here, somehow always behaving exactly as it should. It melts wonderfully, never breaking or becoming greasy, with just the right amount of salt and tang. Sharp, extra sharp and sharp white are best.\n\nTo bolster flavor, adding a touch of something a bit more assertive like fontina or Gruy\u00e8re is excellent, but be sure that at least half of the cheese used is Cheddar. Fontina and Gruy\u00e8re are richer and fattier and could cause a sauce to break if used on their own. Avoid ultra mild cheeses like Monterey Jack or Colby: While they are fine for melting, they lack the salt or tang to make them worth your while.\n\nA bit of Parmesan or pecorino (up to an additional 1/4 cup grated) can always be added for deeper flavor and saltiness, but too much and the sauce could become grainy.\n\nWhatever cheese you use, it\u2019s always best to grate from a block rather than buying pre-grated cheese (which can contain additives to prevent it from clumping in the bag).\n\nNow, in a perfect world, any cheese worth eating would be a good candidate for your macaroni and cheese, but that\u2019s not the world we live in. There are many factors involved, including fat, salt, protein and water content, that make one cheese more suitable than another. For example, resist the urge to melt your favorite creamy Camembert (too fatty) or salty Gouda (too grainy) into this sauce. They\u2019re much better as a sprinkle here and there.\n\nBeware of too much experimentation, though. If, in adding cheeses, you find your sauce appears broken, you can occasionally remedy it by whisking in more milk (if too thick) or Cheddar (if too runny) while it\u2019s still warm. But unlike, say, mayonnaise, once dairy breaks, it\u2019s often broken for good. It doesn\u2019t mean your sauce is inedible; you may just need to lower your expectations. It\u2019ll still be delicious, but not as creamy.", "description": "Al dente pasta, swirled in a salty, creamy cheese sauce, macaroni and cheese is like a hug wrapped in a warm sweater, unparalleled in its ability to comfort and satisfy. While boxed and frozen varieties have made it impossibly easy to prepare the dish at a moment\u2019s notice, a homemade version is worth the effort. We\u2019ll teach you the foundations of a perfect macaroni and cheese, and how to make two styles: baked and stovetop. There will be no leftovers.", "authors": ["Alison Roman", "A Guide", "Julia Moskin", "Melissa Clark", "Sam Sifton", "Tara Parker-Pope", "Pierre Franey", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Amanda Hesser"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/dining/11MAC4/31MAC2-superJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-11"}
