Celebrating the immigrant experience in the United States is suddenly all the rage in network situation comedies.\n\nThree new sitcoms on CBS, NBC and TBS\u2014along with ABC\u2019s long-running Fresh Off the Boat, which launches its sixth season on Friday\u2014stand as a pop-culture rebuke to White House messaging that generally demonizes immigrants, especially from Third World countries, as rapists, murderers, gang members, drug dealers, or simply leeches on citizen-taxpayers.\n\n\u201cDuring the 2016 election, we saw it coming\u2014this horrible narrative from that guy [Trump] about \u2018making America great again,\u2019 and doing exactly the opposite while complaining [about foreign-born residents],\u201d said Fresh Off the Boat executive producer Melvin Mar, a Los Angeles native whose parents emigrated from mainland China by way of Hong Kong and Taiwan. \u201cIt was disconcerting, but it made us feel like we needed to just keep making the show and keep putting that out there\u201d\u2014that is, a positive, if comedic, image of immigrants.\n\n\u201cOur show celebrates what it means to be American\u2014that\u2019s the total idea,\u201d Mar told The Daily Beast, theorizing that the proliferation of sitcoms promoting a similar theme \u201cis a reaction to the terrible rhetoric of this president and people also realizing, in the business, that there are different voices out there and those voices just haven\u2019t been on television until now. I think it\u2019s a hugely good thing. It\u2019s a major sea-change.\u201d\n\nThe other immigrant-friendly sitcoms are CBS\u2019s Bob Hearts Abishola, about a white sock manufacturer in Detroit (Billy Gardell) who falls in love with his Nigerian cardiac nurse (Folake Olowofoyeku); TBS\u2019s Chad, chronicling the mishaps of a socially awkward Muslim-Persian teenage boy (played across genders by sitcom creator Nasim Pedrad, a former Saturday Night Live performer) braving a cliquish American high school; and NBC\u2019s Kal Penn-created sitcom Sunnyside, about the challenges of a group of foreign-born residents of an ethnically diverse Queens, New York, neighborhood.\n\n\u201cImmigration has always been at the heart of America. Now it just happens to be such a focus because the word \u2018immigrant\u2019 has been vilified somehow,\u201d said actor/comedian Samba Schutte of Sunnyside. A Dutch-Mauritanian who was born in the Sahara and grew up in Ethiopia, Schutte plays Hakim, an Ethiopian heart surgeon who moved from Africa to Queens and must drive a taxi while awaiting certification as a physician.\n\n\u201cWhat I hope this show will do, as well as the other shows, is put a human face to immigrants,\u201d Schutte said. \u201cWe hope that people will let us into their homes every week and show that they are just people like you and me. My African grandfather said that there\u2019s no difference between us\u2014we all have nine holes in our bodies at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s premiere episode of Sunnyside, a character played by Romanian-born actor Tudor Petrut gets hauled away by ICE agents\u2014even though he holds a green card that allows him to live in the U.S. legally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very concerned and try to do something about it,\u201d Schutte said about the episode\u2019s storyline. In real life, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a whole community out there that\u2019s terrified, even though some are legal and some have green cards. There are stories out there about people who have been taken, who are actually American citizens, and have been detained for a couple of days without being released.\u201d\n\nIndeed, just in June, immigration agents falsely arrested an 18-year-old, Texas-born American citizen named Francisco Erwin Galicia at a Border Patrol checkpoint and held him for 23 days, under inhumane conditions, in an immigrant detention facility; government officials tried to force the terrorized teenager into signing self-deportation papers before they grudgingly admitted their mistake and let him go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here on a permanent-resident green card, but at the same time, you feel like, how safe am I on a green card? Anything can happen,\u201d said Schutte, who has lived in Los Angeles for the past eight years and is married to comedian/producer Aria Bruss, a native Californian. In case he\u2019s ever pulled over by the cops, \u201cI don\u2019t travel without my green card or my Dutch passport, just to show that I\u2019m legal, have done everything in a legal way, and have a very clean record,\u201d Schutte said. \u201cYou hope that the people you\u2019re dealing with are wise enough to realize you\u2019re just a human being.\u201d\n\nProminent showrunner Chuck Lorre, best known for such TV hits as CBS\u2019s The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men (which involved an epic, tabloid-ready battle eight years ago with tiger-blood enthusiast Charlie Sheen), told The Daily Beast that he thought about creating a sitcom like Bob Hearts Abishola after vacationing in Africa.\n\n\u201cAbout a year and a half ago, we started knocking around this idea and we thought it was an opportunity not just to explore romantic comedy, but to explore the incredibly courageous experience that is moving to another country and starting over again. I wanted to do a show that honored people who risk everything to build a new life in a strange place. It\u2019s extremely admirable, and very, very brave,\u201d said Lorre, who joked that \u201cI\u2019m politically suffering\u201d under the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re generally highly-focused, ambitious, determined, extraordinarily honest\u2014everything that is great about this country,\u201d Lorre said about his personal experience of immigrants, noting that his immigrant grandfather was a tailor who \u201csewed zippers into winter jackets for 50 years at a penny apiece; he just worked like a dog for half a century and then retired to Miami.\u201d\n\n\u201c I wanted to do a show that honored people who risk everything to build a new life in a strange place. It\u2019s extremely admirable, and very, very brave. \u201d\n\nLorre, whose sitcom airs Monday nights, added: \u201cEvery wave of immigration that\u2019s ever come to this country has had a strand of criminality\u2014every single one of them. That\u2019s just human nature. You take any group of people and two percent of them are going to be \u2018yikes!\u2019 No one culture can claim complete freedom from a couple of bad apples. But, by and large, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a political statement to say that the greatness of this country is predicated on immigrants who came here and worked their asses off.\u201d\n\nWarnerMedia executive Brett Weitz, the general manager of both TNT and TBS, said Chad\u2014which premieres on TBS early next year\u2014is not meant as a pro-immigrant polemic, even though \u201cthe immigrant story will be a core focus as an entry point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just making shows that reflect the way America looks, and I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we\u2019re making a show about an immigrant as we are making a show about a boy coming of age, with a 30-plus-year-old woman playing him. A young man coming of age in America who happens to be an immigrant,\u201d Weitz told The Daily Beast.\n\nTrump White House messaging aside, \u201cwe must tell stories about the world as we see it. We must tell stories about the United States as it looks,\u201d Weitz said. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here in New York City, looking outside, and I\u2019ve seen probably 30 different types of people walk by in seven seconds. If we don\u2019t tell the stories about those people, we\u2019ll become irrelevant and we\u2019ll cease to exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, more than ever, we need to connect to something that brings us joy. More than ever. Right now,\u201d Weitz continued. \u201cAnd if it makes you laugh, and if you\u2019re Persian or Middle-Eastern and watching this young boy going through this, and you can connect to that, then I\u2019ve done my job.\u201d\n\nLike Kal Penn, who was unavailable to The Daily Beast for an interview but insisted recently to The New York Times that Sunnyside has no political agenda, executive producer Matt Murray soft-pedals the sitcom\u2019s obvious pro-immigration stance. Notwithstanding the central theme, Murray hopes that even Trump voters might enjoy tuning in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not trying to hit anybody over the head with any sort of political messaging,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider myself to be well on the left, and I would get tired of being preached to myself. Really we\u2019re just trying to show a bunch of weird, colorful characters. It\u2019s not going to be a show where in every episode we\u2019re going to talk about how hard it is or what the political issues of the day are. We\u2019re going to try to make a funny show about a bunch of friends.\u201d\n\nMurray added, however, that \u201cpeople who are actively making the choice to try to live here can be seen as more patriotic, in some ways, because it took no effort for me, as a person who was born here, to go, like, \u2018Yeah, America\u2019s awesome, and I love it.\u2019 But to leave family and home, and go through this process that takes years, that\u2019s incredibly complicated\u2014that takes a lot of work. I think we\u2019re just trying to show that there\u2019s another side to the issue, that there are multiple sides to the issue. People might think that immigration is just [foreigners] coming to this country and asking for handouts, and it\u2019s really not that at all. It takes years. People are vetted forever.\u201d", "description": "Networks have unveiled a number of primetime TV sitcoms focused on the plight of immigrants this season, from NBC\u2019s \u201cSunnyside\u201d to CBS\u2019s \u201cBob Hearts Abishola.\u201d", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569450396/190925-grove-pro-immigrant-shows_r6mmlj", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
