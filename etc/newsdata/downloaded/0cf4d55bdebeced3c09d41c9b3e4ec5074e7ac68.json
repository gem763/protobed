The video features clips from the 1990s of prominent Democrats speaking out against impeachment proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Democrats know impeachment hurts the country. They don't care,\" the text of the video said.\n\n\"It is simply antithetical to our Constitutional democracy to use impeachment to overturn an election on partisan grounds,\" then-Senator Joe Biden said. \"It would trample on the choice made by the people through the electoral process and do great harm. It violates the independence of the presidency and it usurps the people's voice.\"\n\n\"I think it has a traumatic impact on the confidence that the American people have in government,\" Nancy Pelosi previously said.\n\n\"The effect of impeachment is to overturn the popular will of the voters as expressed in a national election,\" Jerry Nadler said. \"The people elected the president. They still support him. We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people.\"\n\n\"Their hatred of the president exceed their caring about this country and its people,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer said of Republicans.\n\n\"But what the American people are saying loudly and clearly is, 'Let's get on with the business of the American people,'\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"Impeachment of a president is the undoing of a national election!\" Nadler proclaimed. \"They are ripping asunder our votes. They are telling us that our votes don't count and that the election must be set aside.\"\n\n\"Send a message through the ballot box. That's what we do in this democracy,\" Rep. Maxine Waters said.\n\nThe end of the video tells people to visit StopTheMadness.gop, which talks about the facts surrounding the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call Trump asked Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his dad, then-Vice President Joe Biden, had dealings with the country.\n\n\"Democrats promised to reach across the aisle and work with President Trump and Republicans to serve the American people, but instead are now pushing their hyper-partisan impeachment agenda,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. Enough is enough; Americans are sick and tired of these witch hunts. We are going to hold Democrats accountable for their ridiculous charade and remind voters that their Democrat representative turned their back on them.\"\n\nThe RNC has also dropped a $2 million on a TV and digital ad buy in more than 60 districts where Democrats are considered vulnerable.", "description": "Sucks to suck..10/03/2019 3:22:40AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/275/9a6b558f-374a-40f2-a21d-6ae30ff0b004.png"}
