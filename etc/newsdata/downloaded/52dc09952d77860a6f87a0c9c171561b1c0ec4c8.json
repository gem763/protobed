REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\n\nBy Clement Uwiringiyimana\n\nKIGALI (Reuters) - Rwanda\u2019s Mara Group launched two smartphones on Monday, describing them as the first \u201cMade in Africa\u201d models and giving a boost to the country\u2019s ambitions to become a regional technology hub.\n\nThe Mara X and Mara Z will use Google\u2019s Android operating system and cost 175,750 Rwandan francs ($190) and 120,250 Rwandan francs ($130) respectively.\n\nThey will compete with Samsung, whose cheapest smartphone costs 50,000 Rwandan francs ($54), and non-branded phones at 35,000 Rwandan francs ($37). Mara Group CEO Ashish Thakkar said it was targeting customers willing to pay more for quality.\n\n\u201cThis is the first smartphone manufacturer in Africa,\u201d Thakkar told Reuters after touring the company alongside Rwanda\u2019s President Paul Kagame.\n\nCompanies assemble smartphones in Egypt, Ethiopia, Algeria and South Africa, but import the components, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are actually the first who are doing manufacturing. We are making the motherboards, we are making the sub-boards during the entire process,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are over 1,000 pieces per phone.\u201d\n\nThakker said the plant had cost $50 million and could make 10,000 phones per day.\n\nMara Group hopes to profit from the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, a pact aimed at forming a 55-nation trade bloc, to boost sales across Africa, Thakkar said.\n\nThe agreement is due to begin trading in July next year, aiming to unite 1.3 billion people and create a $3.4 trillion economic bloc. But it is still in the very early stages and no timelines have been agreed for abolishing tariffs.\n\nKagame said he hoped the phone would increase Rwanda\u2019s smartphone usage, currently at around 15%.\n\n\u201cRwandans are already using smartphones but we want to enable many more. The introduction of Mara phones will put smartphones ownership within reach of more Rwandans,\u201d Kagame said.\n\n($1 = 924.3110 Rwandan francs)", "description": "Rwanda's Mara Group launched two smartphones on Monday, describing them as the first \"Made in Africa\" models and giving a boost to the country's ambitions to become a regional technology hub.", "authors": ["Clement Uwiringiyimana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439170514&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9619D", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
