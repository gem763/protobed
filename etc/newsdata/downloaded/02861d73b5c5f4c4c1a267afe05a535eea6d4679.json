And it exposes the brutal landscape confronting every other Democratic candidate in the state, even as they become increasingly active in Iowa.\n\nSouth Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg is now running in fourth place, with 9 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris is fifth, with 6 percent.\n\nEarlier this week, Harris\u2019 campaign signaled she planned to nearly double her staff operation in Iowa, while making weekly visits.\n\nThen, hours before the poll\u2019s release, Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, warned in a memo to staff and supporters that \u201ctime is running out\u201d for Booker\u2019s campaign and that \u201cwe do not see a legitimate long-term path forward\u201d if the campaign can\u2019t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30.\n\nThe survey is no anomaly, broadly mirroring an Iowa poll released by Focus on Rural America earlier this week. That poll put Biden and Warren in a statistical tie, at 25 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\n\nBut while Warren and Biden were significantly ahead of the rest of the field in the latest measure, there are still strong indications the race remains wide open: Nearly two-in-three likely caucus-goers, 63 percent, say they could be persuaded to change their mind after picking a top choice.\n\nOnly two-in-10, 20 percent, say their mind is made up about a first-choice candidate. And more Biden supporters (26 percent) than Warren supporters (12 percent) say their minds are made up about whom they would support.\n\nLesser-polling candidates will take a small degree of comfort in the fact that neither frontrunner is pulling even one-quarter of the electorate\u2019s support. In addition, Biden, a centrist, and Warren, a more progressive Democrat, represent different ideological wings of the party, reducing the likelihood that if one of them collapses, his or her supporters would rush to the other.\n\nThe poll on Saturday comes in a state where Warren began investing heavily in organization early in the primary. Biden has worked in recent months to catch up to her there, assembling one of the largest organizations in the state and visiting more frequently.\n\nJeff Link, a Democratic strategist in Iowa and co-founder of Focus on Rural America, said Saturday that Iowans\u2019 views of the candidates have yet to harden \u2013 and the race could still swing.\n\nRecalling that then-Sen. Barack Obama trailed Hillary Clinton in the state in mid-2007, Link said, \u201cRemember where we are in the calendar. We have five months to go.\u201d\n\nBut there is an enthusiasm gap in Warren's favor. Nearly one-in-three Warren supporters, 32 percent, say they are \"extremely enthusiastic\" about caucusing for the Massachusetts senator, compared to 22 percent of Biden's backers.\n\nAnd Warren is the second choice for twice as many caucus-goers, 20 percent, as Biden, who is the second choice for only 10 percent of caucus-goers.\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s been working her butt off in this state. ... She has got boots on the ground everywhere,\" said Tom Courtney, a former Iowa state senator and now co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, \"Joe Biden, he just doesn't have it together,\" said Courtney, who is neutral in the contest.\n\nThe poll comes as all the major candidates descended on Iowa for the Polk County Democratic Party\u2019s annual steak fry, which drew the largest crowd in the event\u2019s history.\n\nThe sharpest divide among likely caucus-goers is between younger and older voters. Biden is the first choice of more than a third of seniors aged 65 or older, 35 percent. But Warren is the top choice for caucus-goers under 35, with 27 percent to Sanders' 11 percent and Biden's 9 percent.\n\nThe Des Moines Register\u2019s poll, conducted by the West Des Moines-based Selzer & Co., is considered the most authoritative measure of caucus-goers among public surveys.", "description": "An authoritative poll reflects both the resilience of Warren's months-long surge and a potential softening of Biden's campaign.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard", "David Siders"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CGpnPcvNiWkanPw11tAZEw--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/bb514d4e3b022afcfa36f0e9700794c7", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
