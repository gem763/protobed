That\u2019s two decades.\n\nI\u2019m just now realising that I\u2019ve lived two decades, most of which was spent in Hong Kong where I was born, and the rest in Britain, where I am studying. This past year has been my first year in university, and what I\u2019ve learned and understood from it is that a university student is no more special, superior, or remarkable than a non-university-educated person.\n\nAs a student of Sociology, I may understand social structures and social conditioning more, just like a doctor with medical knowledge or a lawyer with legal knowledge \u2013 but that does not make me any better than someone without a degree. It\u2019s this understanding of social structures \u2013 in simple terms, fate and chance \u2013 that has helped me realise that I\u2019m just lucky.\n\n5 myths about personality tests such as the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator, and why they are still useful\n\nI\u2019m not more talented or gifted than a person without this education, I\u2019m just lucky that I get to develop it in the way that modern education (a worldwide social structure) asks of me. I\u2019m not attacking myself by saying this \u2013 I\u2019m comfortable enough in myself to acknowledge I am talented, honourable, and focused on my goals. But so are many, many people who don\u2019t go to university.\n\nThat was my biggest realisation of my 19th year of being alive. Coincidentally, my birthday is in July, so the beginning and end of every year is also that of the academic year.\n\nMy biggest realisation of my 20th year is that I\u2019m more aggressive than ever.\n\nLetters from the dorm: you don\u2019t have to explain yourself to others all the time\n\nA lot of adults have said that my feeling of aggression is a common one among people my age, but that is untrue \u2013 from my experience, they\u2019re usually easy and carefree \u2013 anything but aggressive. I believe the adults were trying to give me a reason for my need to be aggressive. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nTrying to make me feel like I\u2019m just another young adult that\u2019s opinionated and stubborn for the sake of it will not calm me down. I\u2019m aggressive for good reasons.\n\nI\u2019m aggressive because there are issues going on in my life \u2013 a whole lot of them \u2013 and I\u2019m here to aggressively address those issues, aggressively think of long-term solutions, and aggressively progress with an awareness of what I am (or am not) capable of.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to be proud of my aggression and to take charge of it. It allows me to observe issues clearly and handle them efficiently. Being aggressive saves time, and being forthright gets things done. Society does not respect shy, timid, nervous people.\n\nMy aggression gives me the right to be furious at wicked people. I don\u2019t need hesitations, indecisiveness, or vagueness in me. Not at all.", "description": "Here\u2019s why aggression isn\u2019t always a bad thing and how possessing a university degree doesn\u2019t make a person better than someone without one", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_703750441.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
