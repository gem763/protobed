James McGovern of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said the resolution provides \u201ca clear path forward\u201d as the House begins a public phase of the impeachment inquiry, which up to this point has largely consisted of closed-door interviews.\n\n\u201cThis is a sad time for our country,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cNone of us came to Congress to impeach a president, but each of us took a solemn oath to protect and defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s Republican allies in Congress have tried to hide the president\u2019s conduct, but the American people will now see the facts firsthand,\u201d he added.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution merely \u201cconfirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.\u201d\n\nThe resolution \u201cdoes nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the administration,\u201d she said, adding that the White House is barred from participating at all until after the intelligence panel \u201cconducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee.\u201d\n\nEven then, rules for White House participation remain unclear, Grisham said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is looking into Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which he asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 to investigate a Democratic rival for president. Democrats say the request and other actions by the administration to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family amounted to a quid pro quo for important military aid for Ukraine, providing sufficient grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the resolution Thursday amid complaints from Trump and his Republicans allies that the monthlong impeachment process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, denounced what he called a \u201cSoviet-style impeachment process\u201d led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nMore than 75% of House members have been unable to view what is happening in closed-door depositions conducted by the Intelligence panel and two other committees, Scalise said. \u201cThat represents more than 230 million Americans whose voices are denied right now,\u201d he said.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, said Democrats \u201chave basically cooked up a process they have been conducting in secret\u201d with the goal of preventing Trump\u2019s lawyers from asking questions of witnesses.\n\nDemocrats \u201care now attempting to sort of put a cloak of legitimacy around this process by saying they\u2019re going to bring it to a vote on the floor,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThey can\u2019t fix it. The process is broken. It\u2019s tainted.\u201d\n\nDemocrats insisted they were not yielding to Republican pressure and dismissed a GOP argument that impeachment can\u2019t begin without a formal House vote.\n\nSchiff and other Democrats defended the process and said the American people will soon hear from witnesses in an open setting, with transcripts of depositions already conducted set for public release.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d Schiff and three other committee chairs said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings, \u201cwhere the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct,\u201d the Democrats said.", "description": "House Democrats unveiled legislation Tuesday authorizing the next phase of the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump as Democrats move to...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU268_impeac_ZG_20191029181358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
