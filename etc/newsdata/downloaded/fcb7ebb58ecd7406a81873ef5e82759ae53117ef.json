And while Apple says it didn\u2019t make iPad Pro with the intent to replace a laptop, even Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested in a recent interview that this could be the case \u2014 because what else could this massive iPad be for? It\u2019s the same question Microsoft has been trying to answer with the Surface since 2012, with mixed results.\n\nBut after a few days of using the iPad Pro, I started to look at iPad differently. The large tablet pretty much demanded it. I\u2019ve always been a bit of an iPad skeptic, never understanding how people can use them all the time for productivity, even with a Bluetooth accessory keyboard attached. By day three with the iPad Pro, I had started to wonder, Could this replace my MacBook?\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Apple has once again hung back and watched others launch a new product category before bursting in and laying claim to it. The company had done this with MP3 players, phablet phones, smartwatches. Now, it was unveiling a high-powered tablet computer with a stylus and accessory keyboard.\n\nWhen I first picked up the iPad Pro at an Apple event this past September, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little bit. For one, its size: it is holy-crap-look-at-this-iPad big. And with a price tag that easily jumps up to around a thousand dollars, it\u2019s the most expensive iPad ever.\n\nRead Next: Mossberg: The iPad Pro can\u2019t replace your laptop totally, even for a tablet lover Let\u2019s just get this out of the way: Apple wants to sell more iPads. This is the visible seam in the story Apple has stitched together about the iPad over the past five years. The iPad Pro is being marketed as a tablet for users of heavy apps and creative types, and it is a very obvious product differentiation strategy. But some people are just going to want to buy the biggest iPad they can get, and this is a very big, very nice iPad. It\u2019s also an expensive iPad. The iPad Pro starts at $799 for a Wi-Fi-only model with 32GB of storage, creeps up to $949 for the Wi-Fi-only 128GB model, and tops off at $1,079 for a 128GB model with both Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. And that\u2019s before accessories. Pricey for an iPad? Uh, yeah. Expensive for a PC even? Yes, if you\u2019re talking about the low- to mid-range PCs that clutter shelves during back-to-school season. It\u2019s basically right in line with something like the Surface Pro 4 ($899) and the MacBook Air ($999). The iPad Pro's hardware quality justifies the price But the Pro\u2019s build justifies the price. It has a 12.9-inch diagonal display, which is bigger than the displays on both Apple\u2019s 12-inch MacBook and the new Microsoft Surface Pro 4. It weighs about a pound and a half, and it\u2019s just over a quarter of an inch thick. It\u2019s hefty by iPad standards, and definitely not suitable for casual stuff like one-handed reading. But as with all tech gadgetry, it\u2019s a matter of relativity. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel thick relative to its size. And to go back to the earlier comparison to a MacBook: it\u2019s still lighter than a laptop. It was easy to throw in a bag and carry around for a day or a weekend trip. The display on the iPad Pro is stunning. With a resolution of 2732 x 2048 at 264 pixels per inch, it\u2019s actually the highest-resolution display on any iOS device, but all that means nothing until you see it. Photos, videos, even text look big and crisp and real. The only knock you could make on the display is that it doesn\u2019t include the new 3D Touch technology Apple introduced with the iPhone 6S, something that arguably could have been more useful on a tablet meant for multitasking than it is on a smaller-screened phone. The tablet\u2019s processing power is even more notable than the display. Apple has rigged the iPad Pro with its latest chip, the A9X, which it claims has twice the CPU and twice the graphics performance of the previous processor. (Apple points out it also \"rivals most portable PCs\" in terms of power.) And it has four strategically placed, self-adjusting speakers that wowed me with their sound when I watched videos on it. In terms of battery life, Apple says you should get 10 hours. In my test, following The Verge\u2019s standard battery test for tablets, I got just about 9.5 hours. In less formal tests, like on the day we shot a video of the iPad Pro while cycling through multiple applications, the Pro would last nearly a full work day without charging. There are a bunch of other tech features to consider: the 8-megapixel rear camera and the 1.2-megapixel front camera, 1080p HD video recording capabilities, and a variety of sensors, including a fingerprint sensor. But it\u2019s not specs that Apple is trying to sell. It\u2019s what you can do with the iPad Pro.\n\nThe first batch of optimized apps for iPad Pro fall mostly into creative or highly visual categories, with some productivity apps thrown in. Over the past week I\u2019ve sketched a kitchen in the Paper app, mocked up a holiday card in Adobe Comp, edited photos (using the Apple Pencil) in Photoshop Fix and Lightroom, attempted to draw a 3D model of a car in a new app called uMake (it looked more like a car crash), and edited a 4K video clip in iMovie. Apps launched super quickly, and navigating between pages or different projects felt fluid. I can\u2019t judge if a professional illustrator or graphic designer or architect would really be able to go full-time iPad Pro, but the mere fact that we\u2019re at a place where the question is even possible is a win for Apple. The Pencil is just plain fun Apple has enabled much of this by introducing its own suite of accessories for the giant iPad. There\u2019s something undeniably Apple about unveiling a snow-white stylus and calling it simply \"Pencil,\" along with a lightweight keyboard cover, and asking customers to pony up $99 and $169, respectively. But the Pencil is just plain fun. It is indeed Apple white, and there are Apple-y things about it \u2014 for example, the fact that it is weighted, and won\u2019t roll away on a table top, and always stops rolling with the word \"Pencil\" facing upward on its metal band (seriously, I\u2019ve tried this at least a dozen times). Unlike Microsoft\u2019s Surface stylus, the Pencil doesn\u2019t have a clip, it\u2019s not magnetized, and the end of it doesn\u2019t work as an eraser \u2014 the end, instead, is a capped Lightning connector for charging. The Pencil\u2019s greatest feature, then, is its precision. In my experience there was almost no latency between the Pencil and the screen; it really felt like I was using a pencil or pen. Unlike styluses that rely on Bluetooth connectivity, the iPad Pro senses when a stylus is near the display and scans for a \"tip signal\" 240 times per second, Apple says. There are also sensors in the tip of the stylus that detect pressure and tilt, for stuff like shading. For digital artists and tablet note takers, the iPad Pro\u2019s palm rejection software is nearly as important as the stylus, if not more so. I pressed and dragged my palm along the iPad Pro\u2019s display while using four different apps \u2014 Apple Notes, Adobe Sketch, FiftyThree Paper, and Notability \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t leave a palm mark no matter how hard I tried. I was also able to switch between using my finger and using the stylus without any lags.\n\nThen there\u2019s the keyboard part of the equation. I liked Apple\u2019s Smart Cover keyboard less than the Pencil. It has the same aesthetic as a \"regular\" Smart Cover for iPad, only a quadrant of it is, well, a keyboard. It doesn\u2019t require charging. And it has the same key travel as the keyboard on a MacBook (half a millimeter). But due to the taut layer of laser-cut fabric covering it, the keys felt comparatively shallow and rough. It\u2019s not backlit. It can only prop the iPad up at one angle (unlike Microsoft\u2019s Surface). And while most common shortcuts work, depending on the app \u2014 Command + Tab tabs through open apps, Command + Z erases your last entry \u2014 the entire top row of the Mac keyboard is missing on the Smart Cover keyboard. This doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal at first until you consider that a) you\u2019re missing things like volume and brightness keys and b) those keys are present on accessory keyboards that cost much, much less than $169. The Smart Cover Keyboard is overpriced Fortunately, the Smart Cover keyboard isn\u2019t the only option, since Apple has opened up the keyboard\u2019s Smart Connector tech to third-party accessory makers. Logitech has already capitalized on this and created a backlit keyboard that does include the top row of Mac keys, though it\u2019s not exactly a bargain at $150, and is bulkier than Apple\u2019s own accessory keyboard. The same goes for third-party styluses. Products like the original Pencil, by FiftyThree, and Adonit\u2019s Jot Dash will work on the iPad Pro.\n\nThe apps are there. The hardware and accessories are there. So... can this thing replace your laptop or not? To (finally) answer that, we need to look at the whole package, including iOS 9. The iPad Pro is so large that you can run two apps side by side, in split-screen view, in their full size (provided that the app supports full split-screen view). This means that I can run Slack and Gmail side by side, or Twitter and Safari, or Microsoft Word and Excel, and have optimal views of each. When I\u2019m done with an app, I slide it over to the left-hand side of the display, and the app that was split off to the right goes into full-screen mode. It's Not a Laptop Replacement, But A large iPad means fewer sacrifices\n\nIt\u2019s not quite like dragging windows around on a desktop, but it\u2019s a mobile, touch-friendly representation of that behavior, and it might just be where we\u2019re all headed, anyway. But even this split-screen mode isn\u2019t enough for lots of the \"laptop\" things I need to do on a daily basis. This is still a mobile OS we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s at least familiar feeling, unlike the foreign hybrid OS that Microsoft introduced with the first Surfaces. But I can\u2019t manipulate more than two app windows at a time on the iPad Pro. I can\u2019t control things with a trackpad. I can\u2019t run Final Cut Pro on the iPad Pro. Entering data into cells in the Google Sheets app on the iPad Pro is still onerous. There\u2019s no way to hand over the iPad to someone else and let them quickly log in as a \"guest\" user.\n\n\n\nAnd while I\u2019ve managed to type away on the iPad Pro on the train or in the passenger seat of a car, there\u2019s still an uncomfortable imbalance between the heavy iPad and the lightweight keyboard on my lap, just as there is with the Microsoft Surface.", "description": "When I first picked up the iPad Pro at an Apple event this past September, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little bit.
