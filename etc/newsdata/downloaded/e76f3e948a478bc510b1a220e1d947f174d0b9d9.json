It\u2019ll be reviewed by the DOJ for redactions before being sent to Congress for public disclosure. At long last, it\u2019s here. It\u2019s finally here. We should all consider this an appetizer of sorts to the larger DOJ investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation. As the media have been peddling this manufactured myth for the past two years, IG Michael Horowitz has been looking into the spy warrant that was issued against Carter Page, Trump\u2019s former foreign policy adviser for his campaign, and why the FBI cited the Steele Dossier as credible evidence when it wasn\u2019t. It was a biased political project funded by the Clintons and the Democrats.\n\nEx-MI6 spook Christopher Steele was hired by Fusion GPS, which was then contracted by the Clinton campaign, to find dirt on Trump. Top officials knew this was a biased political document; Steele was quite open about it, especially towards those at the State Department. Yet, it was mostly unverified. There are glaring errors in it that could be fact-checked by doing a Google search and yet this FISA warrant was renewed three times based off of shoddy information. Even members of British intelligence were skeptical of its contents. This is the holy grail. This is why the collusion rumors were investigated by the FBI, which evolved into the wider special counsel probe.\n\nYet, The Hill\u2019s John Solomon told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity last week that \u201cimportant\u201d documents could be released this month (via Washington Examiner):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hill's John Solomon told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday his sources are telling him that \"important\" records could be released sometime this month. \"To get how bad the situation is, you need those documents to be declassified,\" the investigative reporter said. \"We've been talking about those buckets for a long time. I am hearing that the Justice Department is nearing a decision to release 10 or 12 of the most important documents before the ... IG report comes out, that will allow all of us to see how bad it was before we see the IG's conclusions. I think that could happen later this month.\"\n\nStay tuned I guess. In the meantime, the allegation that the sitting president might have signed off on a surveillance campaign on those working for the presidential campaign of the opposing party remains potent.", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:08:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/308/c0a67761-a89c-454c-b286-2422ef6fafc0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
