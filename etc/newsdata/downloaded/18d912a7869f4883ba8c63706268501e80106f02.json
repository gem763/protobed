(Photo by Pablo Blazquez Dominguez, Getty Images)\n\nNational property has been experienced its biggest monthly jolt in two and a half years, as prices jumped 0.9% in September, according to CoreLogic.\n\nIt was heavily supported by rebounding markets in Sydney and Melbourne. They saw prices soar 1.7% apiece, as both stabilise after prolonged declines.\n\nThe recovery has been built on falling interest rates, a strengthening flow of credit, and heightened investor activity, according to head of research Tim Lawless.\n\nHowever, the level of underlying household debt could threaten further price growth if the economy was to weaken, Lawless noted.\n\nAustralian property prices have seen their biggest lift in two and a half years, as Sydney and Melbourne mount a roaring recovery.\n\nAcross the country, values jumped 0.9%, no doubt helped enormously by the fact its largest two markets both rocketed up 1.7% each, according to the latest figures from property research house CoreLogic.\n\n\u201cAlthough markets outside of Sydney and Melbourne aren\u2019t showing the same recovery trend, most areas have either seen a reduction in the rate of decline or are seeing a modest trajectory of growth as low mortgage rates and a slight loosening in credit policy support buyer demand,\u201d CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia.\n\nIn part, Sydney and Melbourne are being supported by their stronger economies but also a higher investor activity, according to Lawless.\n\n\u201cWhile all regions are benefitting from low mortgage rates and improved access to credit, economic and demographic conditions in New South Wales and Victoria continue to outperform most areas of the country. Population growth is higher, unemployment is lower and jobs growth is stronger, providing a solid platform for housing demand.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Sydney just had its biggest auction weekend in a year \u2013 but an economist says a price rebound could be subdued\n\nThat bounce in Sydney and Melbourne has helped lift quarterly growth to around 3.5% in each city after a prolonged decline from their respective 2017 peaks.\n\nSydney prices are still 11.9% lower than they were in July 2017 while Melbourne prices are down 7.9%.\n\n\u201cAlthough housing values are now consistently tracking higher, at least at a macro-level, the national index remains 6.8% below the October 2017 peak, indicating that buyers still have some time to take advantage of improved housing affordability before values return to record highs,\u201d Lawless said.\n\nREAD MORE: We risk disenfranchising an entire generation, a property expert has warned, as the proportion of millennials priced out of the market soars\n\nHowever, a continued recovery appears well and truly tied to Australia\u2019s economic fortunes, with any further weakness threatening to cannonball further price rises.\n\n\u201cHousehold debt levels reached new record highs relative to their incomes over the June quarter, suggesting the sector is vulnerable to a shock or change in household circumstances,\u201d Lawless said.\n\nREAD MORE: Australian unemployment has just shot up to a 12 month high \u2013 and it\u2019s the \u2018smoking gun\u2019 the RBA needs to cut rates in October\n\nAMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver has also predicted a softer price trajectory going forward.\n\n\u201cAfter an initial bounce, expect prices to be constrained on the back of still-tight credit, unit supply & softer economy,\u201d he tweeted in response to the data.\n\nHow Australian property prices are changing (Source: CoreLogic)\n\nCertainly, the strength in Sydney and Melbourne wasn\u2019t shared across the other state capitals. The only other cities to rise were their eastern seaboard counterpart Brisbane and the federal capital Canberra, modestly budging 0.1% and 1.0% respectively.\n\nElsewhere, home prices in Adelaide held tight, while declines were recorded in the remainder. Perth was the worst performer, as prices slid a further 0.8%, followed by Hobart and Darwin.\n\nWith the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) widely tipped to cut the official interest rate again this year, prices could receive more support yet.\n\nIt will make its next decision on Tuesday.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
