You have definitely inspired me to get off my more than substantial a**e and do something.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nBritish actor Martin Bayfield was left stunned, as he commented: \"Most impressive,\" with a thumbs up emoji.\n\nJust last month, Gregg announced he was down to 12 stone and 13 pounds, with a body fat percentage of only 18 percent.\n\nAlthough his BMI score labels him as overweight, his body fat percentage is healthy for a man between 41 and 60 years of age - which is between 11 and 22 percent.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHis weight loss comes down to a combination of training and his diet.\n\nThe star admitted he has changed his diet, cutting back on fat and choosing lean meats.\n\nIt has proved to work for him, as he used to weigh over 16 stone, and was previously a Weight Watchers ambassador.\n\n(Image: BBC/Shine TV)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nSpeaking on Good Morning Britain, he revealed: \"Let's just say there are certain things you have to cut out.
