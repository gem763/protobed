Olympiakos will travel to Red Star Belgrade next.\n\n\u201cWhen you go 2-0 up after 30 minutes you are in a great position, after that I thought we controlled the game whereas before we didn\u2019t play well but scored two goals,\u201d Kane said.\n\n\u201cThe goal just before halftime changed the momentum and it\u2019s disappointing from our point of view. We have to improve.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get off to a winning start and put ourselves in a great position.\u201d\n\nTottenham welcomed back big-money signing Tanguy Ndombele after injury, handed Alli his first start of the season and gave Lucas Moura, hero of last season\u2019s semi-final win over Ajax Amsterdam, the nod ahead of Son Heung-min.\n\nBut they were slow to get going and were given an early wake-up call when Miguel Angel Guerrero\u2019s first-time volley rebounded back off the post after a chested lay-off by Podence.\n\nTottenham took the lead against the run of play in the 26th minute when Kane was needlessly tripped by defender Yassine Meriah and handed out punishment with an unstoppable penalty.\n\nMoura then showed an exquisite first touch from Ben Davies\u2019s pass to thump a shot past keeper Jose Sa.\n\nIt was harsh on Olympiakos but they responded well with Valbuena\u2019s pass slicing open Tottenham\u2019s defence and Podence\u2019s low shot going in off the post.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nTottenham invited trouble early in the second half when Christian Eriksen was caught in possession on the edge of his area and Valbuena was fouled by Jan Vertonghen.\n\nReferee Gianluca Rocchi pointed to the spot and after a lengthy delay for a VAR check, Valbuena converted the penalty.\n\nAlli had a shot well-saved by Sa and Lamela tried his luck from a tight angle as Tottenham raised the tempo but Olympiakos stretched their unbeaten run at home in Europe to 10 games.", "description": "Last season's runners-up Tottenham Hotspur squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 in their Champions League Group B opener away to Greek club Olympiakos Piraeus on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431338157&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1QP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
