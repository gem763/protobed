Bolton shares a lawyer with his former deputy and longtime ally, Charles Kupperman, who went to court on Friday to ask a judge to decide whether he should obey a House subpoena or a White House order to not testify. Bolton presumably might follow the same course.\n\nIf and when he does testify, Bolton appears positioned to answer fundamental questions surrounding the events that have led the President to the edge of impeachment. As the national security adviser, Bolton was charged with managing the government's foreign policy apparatus. Yet Trump and Giuliani worked around Bolton to try to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats. At the same time, the President froze $US391 million ($573 million) in American assistance to the former Soviet republic.\n\n\"According to the testimony given to Congress so far, Bolton was a central figure in trying to prevent any delay in releasing foreign aid to Ukraine,\" said John Yoo, a University of Berkeley law school professor and senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush. \"I cannot see how any responsible investigation would not seek Bolton's appearance.\"\n\nBut he added that the White House would presumably \"go to the mat\" to fight any effort to interview Bolton. \"If the White House were to fight the House impeachment on executive privilege grounds, Bolton would be the hill on which to die,\" Yoo said.\n\n\"The Trump White House could claim not just that the impeachment investigation is illegitimate, which is its current line of defence, but that it is defending the right of future presidents to have an effective White House and to conduct a successful foreign policy.\"\n\nThe combination of his pedigree and the possibility that he really does have incriminating information about Trump makes Bolton a particularly appealing witness to Democrats.\n\nBut some Democrats warn that they cannot be sure what he will say once he sits for an interview. \"You just can't work from assumptions,\" said Republican Mike Quigley, a member of the House Intelligence Committee from Illinois. \"I don't know what he had. I don't know if he has value. I don't know if he is willing to talk about it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConspiracy theory\n\nAccording to testimony presented so far, Bolton bristled at efforts by Giuliani to bypass the national security process as he pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, intervened in the 2016 election, and did so to boost Democrats, not Republicans. Trump's former homeland security adviser repeatedly told the President that the theory had been \"completely debunked.\"\n\nBolton met on July 10 with Ukrainian officials and Gordon Sondland, a political appointee serving as ambassador to the European Union, who was working with Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, on the issue. When the investigations came up, Bolton grew so irritated that he abruptly ended the meeting, according to Fiona Hill, his former top Europe and Russia adviser.\n\nHill testified that Bolton told her to report what was going on to a White House lawyer. \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" he told her to tell the lawyer. She also testified that, on an earlier occasion, Bolton said, \"Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.\"\n\nBolton unsuccessfully sought to block Mulvaney's effort to arrange an Oval Office visit in May by Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, an authoritarian leader whose criticism of Ukraine reinforced Trump's already hostile views toward the country. Bolton likewise opposed the July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to \"do us a favour\" by investigating the 2016 conspiracy theory and Biden.\n\nBolton went to Ukraine on August 27 to try to prepare for a meeting between the President and Zelenskiy that ultimately did not happen. While there, William B. Taylor Jnr, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, said he raised his concerns about the frozen aid and Bolton recommended he send a cable to Pompeo.\n\nBut Mulvaney and Sondland have said that Bolton never brought any concerns about the Ukraine pressure campaign to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I read that and I was surprised, because John Bolton never complained to me about it,\" Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday last weekend. \"No one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on.\"\n\nSondland testified that Bolton embraced their efforts during a conference call in June. \"We went over the entire Ukraine strategy with Ambassador Bolton, who agreed with the strategy and signed off on it,\" Sondland said. \"Indeed, over the spring and summer of 2019, I received nothing but cordial responses from Ambassador Bolton and Dr Hill.\"\n\nSo now Bolton has been left in the middle, a key witness in the unfolding impeachment drama. His friend, Thomas M. Boyd, an assistant attorney-general in the Reagan and Bush administrations, said Bolton understands his obligations to guard the confidentiality of communications with the President but will also be prepared to give his unvarnished views if it comes to it.\n\n\"I just don't think that he's in an awkward position at all,\" said Boyd. \"He's very comfortable in his own skin and whatever decisions he's made or plans to make, I'm sure he's comfortable with them as well.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The possibility the former national security adviser has incriminating information about Donald Trump and Ukraine aid makes John Bolton a particularly appealing witness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2479%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_87/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4e049498e4c43e8bb448b848d74ce88771d2bb00", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
