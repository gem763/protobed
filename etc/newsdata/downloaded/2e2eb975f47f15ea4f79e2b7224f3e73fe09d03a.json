REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg will join other youth leaders to urge U.S. lawmakers to support \u201ctransformative climate action\u201d during two days of meetings and speeches on Capitol Hill, starting on Tuesday.\n\nThe events are intended to drum up support ahead of a global \u201cclimate strike\u201d on Friday in which students and workers around the world will walk out to demand more action to fight global warming, and to heap pressure on leaders attending a United Nations climate summit in New York later this month.\n\nDemocratic Senator Ed Markey, chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force, will host a news conference kicking off the meetings with the activists on Tuesday morning, before including them at the task force\u2019s weekly meeting.\n\nThunberg, who shot to international fame last year when she started skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden\u2019s parliament for action on climate change, will not speak at Tuesday\u2019s press conference, a spokesperson said. Instead, she will make way for her American and Indigenous counterparts to talk.\n\nIn the United States, organizers of the Sept. 20 strike have put forward a list of eight demands on elected officials, including enacting a Green New Deal - an effort to transform the U.S. economy in a decade by shifting to 100% renewable energy.\n\nMarkey is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal congressional resolution with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile New York Democrat who plans to meet with the activists this week.\n\nThunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this year after the number of students taking part in her strikes - dubbed \u201cFridays for Future\u201d - broke 2 million across 135 countries. She was named one of the world\u2019s most influential people by Time magazine in May.", "description": "Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg will join other youth leaders to urge U.S. lawmakers to support \u201ctransformative climate action\u201d during two days of meetings and speeches on Capitol Hill, starting on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430812452&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0T3", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
