Amazon Care lets users chat, video call, or receive an in-person visit from a Mobile Care nurse seven days a week through a partnership with Washington state-based Oasis Medical Group. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe service also offers two-hour prescription delivery for \"many prescriptions\" \u2014 a service that could potentially be bolstered by Amazon's $750 million acquisition of digital pharmacy startup PillPack. While Amazon Care is currently restricted to Amazon employees, it seems likely that it's destined for expansion to the general public based on Amazon's decidedly consumer-facing release. And with over 100 million Prime members in the US alone, the company possesses a solid launching pad for the new service.\n\nAmazon Care is part of a growing trend of large US employers experimenting with new digital health services in hopes of cutting employee healthcare spend. Nearly half of US consumers get their insurance through an employer, and employer healthcare costs are expected to rise 6.5% in 2020 \u2014 or nearly double the rate of inflation. So, it makes sense that companies like Amazon \u2014 with hundreds of thousands of employees \u2014 are interested in pursuing digital health interventions to deliver better health outcomes for workers at a lower cost.\n\nThe high costs of providing healthcare to its workers was part of the motivation behind grocery chain Kroger's decision to explore how genetic screening for behavioral health medication could improve its bottom line, for example. And Amazon Care isn't the only potential healthcare disruption Amazon is trialing among its workforce: It teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create Haven, a joint venture insurtech currently available to the trio's 1.2 million employees, which the troika plans to scale to the broader US insurance market down the road, per JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nBut we don't think Amazon Care will pose an immediate threat to established telemedicine firms, which can lean on their strong relationships with insurers and robust service offerings to fight back. Amazon Care is still in a trial period with no official statement from Amazon about plans to scale up the service. And before it expands, the company will need to build out a wide network of medical professionals to field patient calls and conduct in-person visits.\n\nThat will take some time. While Amazon lays the groundwork for expansion \u2014 as I (Zach) think it inevitably will \u2014 telemedicine firms can ink strategic partnerships and strengthen their existing payer relationships to safeguard against Amazon's surge into the space. For example, Teladoc could benefit from doubling down on its partnership with CVS-Aetna to get out ahead of an Amazon entry. If payers can provide their members with non-Amazon telemedicine services, they may be less likely to enter into coverage agreements for Amazon Care, thereby limiting the service's audience to those capable of paying out-of-pocket.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
