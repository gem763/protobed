Farrell was involved in two high-profile incidents where no-arms tackles went unpunished last autumn but directives from World Rugby issued at the end of last season state he should have been punished.\n\nEddie Jones has already warned how the World Cup could be \u201cdestroyed\u201d by inconsistent refereeing of the tackle area but England\u2019s defence coach, John Mitchell, revealed on Sunday that Farrell has taken measures in training to alter his approach, with the squad on high alert over red and yellow cards.\n\nWhen World Rugby issued its directives Farrell\u2019s shoulder charge on South Africa\u2019s Andre Esterhuizen was used as an example in an accompanying video to demonstrate when a yellow card should be awarded. Farrell was not sanctioned during the match by the referee, Angus Gardner, denying South Africa the chance to kick a penalty at goal with the clock red and condemning them to a 12-11 defeat. Three weeks later Farrell\u2019s no\u2011arms tackle on Izack Rodda also went unpunished in England\u2019s victory against Australia with the Wallabies furious they were not awarded a penalty try.\n\nAt the time England played down concerns overs Farrell\u2019s technique but in light of World Rugby\u2019s edict, which led to four red and 13 yellow cards at the Junior World Cup this summer, Farrell has been working specifically with England\u2019s strength and conditioning coach, John Carrington, who also acts as Mitchell\u2019s assistant in defence. \u201c[Owen\u2019s] not overly focused in that area but he has made some adjustments,\u201d said Mitchell, who has attended a meeting with World Rugby\u2019s head of referees, Alain Rolland, to discuss high tackles.\n\n\u201cJohn Carrington is very good at the tackle technique, so they\u2019ve just made some adjustments based on that. If your hand is in front of your shoulder then you\u2019ve got a better chance of making a proper wrap tackle. If your shoulder is ahead of your hands then the law probably doesn\u2019t look after you very well. At the back of everyone\u2019s mind there were a lot of cards issued at the U20s world tournament. There will definitely be some apprehension around, \u2018OK, is it actually going to be like that?\u2019\u201d\n\nLast month New Zealand\u2019s Scott Barrett was sent off for a shoulder charge in the All Blacks\u2019 heavy defeat by the Wallabies and in their final match before the World Cup they chose to play the last 15 minutes of their 92-7 victory against Tonga with only 14 men, removing Ryan Crotty in an effort to practise with a numerical disadvantage. Mitchell revealed that England had planned to do likewise in their record win over Ireland last month and, while circumstances dictated they opted against it, they frequently do so in training.\n\n\u201cWe constantly underload and overload [numbers] in training, to be able to adapt to these situations,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cTo be able to cope with the worst-case scenario is really important. We have trained two down [13 men]. It\u2019s a very complex area as it is, so it is our responsibility as coaches to make it absolutely clear to the players what they can and can\u2019t do. Calmness and clear heads create the ability to make good decisions and collectively you end up working together, and it comes through the way we train.\u201d\n\nEngland begin their World Cup campaign against Tonga on Sunday amid doubts over the fitness of Joe Cokanasiga and Mark Wilson, who both have knee problems. Tonga have a somewhat stereotyped reputation for being overly aggressive and Mitchell has warned that sides who do not focus on reducing the tackle height will come unstuck.", "description": "England\u2019s captain, Owen Farrell, has altered his approach to tackling after a meeting with World Rugby\u2019s head of referees", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d211128e9a12bddc42155706eeb46ded1c30a93/0_158_2314_1387/master/2314.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c2454dff1dc358debaeea0349536dc8", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
