She looks very white, made for white audiences. For me, that was my painting.\u201d\n\nQuituisaca\u2019s choice was both aesthetic and pragmatic. In addition to a course on curatorial practice, he was enrolled in a class on Western depiction of Eastern subjects. Rossiter\u2019s painting linked the two. \u201cIt was a two birds, one stone scenario that worked out for me,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cRebecca at the Well\u201d by Thomas Prichard Rossiter (1852) is part of the American University exhibit. (Joshua Voda/NMAI Photo Services)\n\nRossiter\u2019s work is a highlight of \u201cMoves Like Walter: New Curators Open the Corcoran Legacy Collection,\u201d the university museum\u2019s first show to exclusively feature art from its Corcoran Legacy Collection. A deeply personal and somewhat random selection, the exhibition is both an academic exercise for its student curators and a coming-out party for the dormant art collection.\n\n\u201cTo work with one of the first major museum collections in the country, an institution with a name behind it \u2014 as a student, I jumped at the chance,\u201d said Quituisaca. \u201cWhen you see it in person, you get to the see the cracks, how the light hits it in different ways, you get to walk around it. It\u2019s exactly what you want as a student.\u201d\n\nNamed for the late curator and former Corcoran director Walter Hopps \u2014 a champion of contemporary art who was regarded as a rules-averse maverick \u2014 the student exhibition showcases 88 paintings, photographs and works on paper from 63 artists, including Rossiter, Kenneth Callahan and Robert Goodnough.\n\nIt is organized around five themes, reflective of the interests of its student-curators and a nod to Hopps\u2019s unpredictable and extremely personal approach to exhibitions. For example, \u201cThe Selfless Spirit\u201d examines the nature of motherhood through photographs by Joan Cassis, Arthur Tress and Alexander Lapin. A section that questions how artists represented \u201cthe other\u201d is illustrated by the Rossiter work, along with paintings by Frederic Clay Bartlett, George Biddle and William Tolliver. A feminist look at \u201credefining the gaze\u201d features photographs by Lynn Allen, Ruth Bernhard and Bernis von zur Muehlen.\n\n[The Corcoran gives 9,000 works to American University]\n\nOnce the city\u2019s oldest private museums, the Corcoran closed in October 2014 when the board of the financially struggling institution decided it was no longer possible to continue. Its leaders gave the renowned art school and historical Flagg Building on 17th Street to George Washington University and sent its 19,000-piece collection to the National Gallery of Art, which was given first dibs to acquire what it wanted from the collection. The National Gallery accessioned some 8,300 works, including pieces by Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church, Edward Hopper and Jenny Holzer, transforming its holdings of American and contemporary art and photography. The remaining 11,000 pieces were distributed last year to 22 Washington institutions, with American and George Washington universities getting the largest shares.\n\n\n\nAn untitled work by Joan Cassis. (Joshua Voda/NMAI Photo Services)\n\nThe distribution of the Corcoran collection represented one of the largest gifts of art in American history. This new exhibition offers a glimpse of how the second wave of gifts \u2014 those distributed in 2018, after the National Gallery acquired most of the well-known works \u2014 will continue to define the Corcoran\u2019s place in the city\u2019s art ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are all cognizant of the legacy of the Corcoran, the school as well as the museum,\u201d said Kym Rice, GWU\u2019s Corcoran School of the Arts and Design\u2019s interim director. \u201cThe Corcoran is beloved in Washington and among art aficionados nationwide and internationally. We have people still coming (to the building) looking for the museum.\u201d\n\n[The National Gallery acquires 8,000 works from the Corcoran]\n\nThe National Gallery of Art has integrated some 200 pieces into its permanent galleries, with about 30 pieces hanging in the modern and contemporary galleries of the East Building, and another 43 among its American paintings. Three Hiram Powers marble statues from the 19th century are on display together, and a silver teapot and Italian glazed ceramics are among the pieces showcased with its collection of 18th century French decorative arts.\n\nOther Washington museums have begun displaying Corcoran gems. The Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery recently placed a portrait of Harvey Milk by Crawford Barton in its \u201cThe Struggle for Justice\u201d gallery, and will devote an exhibition next year to the Corcoran gift. The Smithsonian American Art Museum has added a contemporary work by Chris Martin and Carlos Almaraz\u2019s painting \u201cEurope and the Jaguar.\u201d The museum plans a Chicano print exhibition next year that will feature Corcoran pieces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Waiter\u201d by Kenneth Callahan (1964). (Joshua Voda/NMAI Photo Services)\n\nHaving completed its $47.5 million, multiyear renovation of the Flagg Building, the Corcoran\u2019s home near the White House, GWU is unveiling the first major art installation from Corcoran collection this fall. \u201cThe Paradise Institute,\u201d a piece by Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller created for the 2001 Venice Biennale, celebrates and comments on the cinema. Its plywood exterior houses two rows of real movie theater seats that look onto a miniature, old-fashioned movie house. The mixed-media film layers images and sound from the film with the audience\u2019s reaction to it.\n\nThe installation is significant because it marks the return of artwork to the restored building, which was renowned for its galleries and exhibitions.\n\n\u201cIt shows our roots and our connection to the old Corcoran,\u201d Rice said.\n\nOne critical aspect of Corcoran 2.0 remains in limbo. The National Gallery of Art agreed to curate galleries in the Flagg Building, ensuring that the historical space remains a place for important art exhibitions. Although it had said the galleries would open this year, the museum now reports that no date has been set for upcoming exhibitions.\n\n\u201cThe environments continue to be evaluated in preparation for art readiness,\u201d said Anabeth Guthrie, a National Gallery spokeswoman. \u201cIt is premature to share our plans at this time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the AU exhibition spotlights the breadth and depth of the Corcoran\u2019s collecting practices and provides a peek into the future.\n\n\u201cWe hope people will think about what a collection is. It couldn\u2019t be just one idea because so many people were contributing,\u201d student curator Abigail Swaringam said. \u201cThe format of our exhibition reflects how diverse the collection is. We hope people will enjoy seeing the contents of the gift for the first time.\u201d\n\nMoves Like Walter: New Curators Open the Corcoran Legacy Collection Through Dec. 15 at the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center. american.edu/cas/museum.", "description": "\u201cMoves Like Walter\u201d features 88 works from the renowned collection that now has many homes.", "authors": ["Peggy Mcglone", "Reporter Covering The Arts In The Washington Region", "September At Pm", "Peggy Mcglone Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Arts In The Washington Region.
