He usually only spends his capital on those that he views as a threat, or a challenge,\u201d said Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Firefighters, which did not endorse a candidate for president in 2016. \u201cI think our union coming out strongly on behalf of Joe Biden, cut him short at best ... It got under his skin.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s predawn online tirade was a precursor to a period in which Biden appeared to occupy a remarkable amount of his attention. At a May 20 rally in Pennsylvania \u2014 the state where the former vice president was born \u2014 the president laced into the candidate who was then the undisputed front-runner in the Democratic field.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\n\u201cBiden deserted you,\u201d he told the crowd at a campaign rally. \u201cI guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state.\u201d\n\nA week later, Trump stunned even Republicans by taking to the world stage to back a foreign dictator\u2019s harsh assessment of Biden.\n\n\u201cWell, Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,\u201d Trump said at a May 27 news conference in Tokyo.\n\nBy then, news reports had surfaced about an internal, 17-state March polling project that showed the president losing to Biden in key Rust Belt states that were essential to his 2016 victory.\n\nTrump\u2019s first reaction was to dismiss the revelations as fake news. His actions said otherwise. After Biden formally entered the race in late April, Trump moved to shore up his support in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan by paying personal visits to those states \u2014 all of which are home to the Rust Belt workers Biden is believed to appeal to.\n\nYet the bad poll numbers kept coming. A June 5 Quinnipac poll even showed Biden beating Trump in Texas, a red state the president won by 9 points in 2016.\n\nTrump grew defensive when pressed on those results.\n\n\"I don't believe those polls. There's no way [Biden] beats me in Texas,\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos in a June 13 interview. \"No, my polls show that I'm winning everywhere.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, before flying to Iowa for a trip that coincided with Biden\u2019s appearance there, Trump insisted Biden was the opponent he most preferred to run against.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather run against Biden than anybody,\u201d Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. \u201cI think he\u2019s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally.\u201d\n\nNot long after, his campaign fired the pollsters involved in the 17-state polling project, blaming them for leaks.\n\nThe Biden campaign concluded that, based on what they knew about the re-election campaign\u2019s well-financed, sophisticated data operation, Trump\u2019s reaction was a sign there was likely even more bad polling data about Biden\u2019s appeal that didn\u2019t get a public airing.\n\n\u201cThey test all of these different versions, and target communities and they\u2019re getting a real clear understanding of who their voters are and what mobilizes them,\u201d Biden Campaign Manager Greg Schultz said. \u201cWe think Joe Biden is the only person who can break that up, with those kinds of voters, in the battleground states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you punching someone?\u201d Schultz said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re afraid of them.\u201d\n\nBetween May and late July, Trump referred to Biden as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d at least a dozen times on Twitter alone. He also zeroed in on the size of Biden\u2019s crowds.\n\n\u201cWhy are you punching someone? Because you\u2019re afraid of them.\u201d - Greg Schultz, Biden Campaign Manager\n\n\u201cWe have thousands of people \u2026 look at the thousands and thousands of people we have,\u201d Trump said at his Pennsylvania rally in May. \u201cThey said [Biden] had 600 people ... I\u2019d say 150.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies insist his seeming fixation on Biden is based on factors unrelated to Biden\u2019s performance in the polls.\n\nThose who know the president\u2019s quirks say he has certain issues that anger him, and one of them is that he believes his son and namesake was endlessly dragged in the media for his business dealings overseas relative to news coverage about Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not scared of Joe Biden, not at all,\u201d said Michael Caputo, who worked for Trump\u2019s campaign and has had political clients in Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden profited from the proximity to his father and it has to infuriate President Trump that there\u2019s no investigation, barely any media coverage,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cHe resents the double-standard and the hypocrisy of Washington DC. He wants equal treatment.\u201d\n\nBut one former aide to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign saw a different reason.\n\n\u201cThe one thing the president is well aware of is that in his base there are a lot of Obama voters,\u201d the aide said, alluding to what he said was the president\u2019s perception that Biden threatened his hold on those voters. \u201cThey\u2019re union members, they\u2019re rank and file. A lot of those times, if they were campaigning, Obama would send Biden out there.\u201d\n\nIn July, Biden was still very much on Trump\u2019s mind despite the president\u2019s engagement in numerous other controversies. On July 14, Trump unleashed a furor after tweets directed at \u201cThe Squad,\u201d four female minority lawmakers, whom he told over Twitter to \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ctotally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d The House later formally rebuked Trump for his comments.\n\nStill, Trump found time to single out Biden for Twitter abuse at least 8 times in the first two weeks of the month.\n\nBiden disappeared from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed for a brief period in the run-up to Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's July 24 testimony before Congress. The Zelensky call, in which the president asked the Ukrainian president to investigate the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter, took place the next morning.\n\nAs it turned out, Biden would loom over the entire day. Aside from the president\u2019s request \u2014 which would ultimately spark an impeachment inquiry \u2014 FOX News released a poll that day showing Biden with a commanding 10-point lead over Trump.\n\nAnd hours after the call, Trump, his top political advisers and congressional leaders gathered in the White House for an extensive campaign briefing in which Trump adviser Bill Stepien highlighted Biden as a potentially formidable threat.\n\nFive days later, the president gave reporters a peek into his mindset on the campaign ahead.\n\n\u201cI am watching,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think right now it will be \u2018Sleepy Joe.\u2019 I feel he\u2019ll limp across the line.\u201d\n\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Greg Schultz", "Biden Campaign Manager"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/96/80/2ec8eba14460b52d090585fbaec4/190926-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
