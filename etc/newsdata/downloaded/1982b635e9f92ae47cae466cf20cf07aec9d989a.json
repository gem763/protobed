REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nProsus comprises Naspers\u2019 global empire of consumer internet assets, with the jewel in the crown a 31% stake in Chinese tech titan Tencent.\n\nThere is \u201cway more demand than is even available, so that\u2019s good,\u201d said the CEO of Euronext Amsterdam, Maurice van Tilburg. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting hour of trade after opening this morning.\u201d\n\nEuronext had given an indicative price of 58.70 euros per share for Prosus, implying a market value of 95.3 billion euros ($105 billion).\n\nThe shares jumped to 76 euros on opening and were trading at 75 euros at 0719 GMT.\n\nThe spin-off in Amsterdam marks the end of an era for Naspers as it looks to move beyond the legacy of former Chief Executive Koos Bekker\u2019s prescient investment of just $34 million in Tencent when it was a startup in 2001, one of the most lucrative bets in corporate history.\n\nThe stake in Tencent, the world\u2019s biggest videogame company and home to China\u2019s hugely popular WeChat social media platform, is now worth $130 billion and has buttressed Naspers\u2019 rapid growth towards becoming Africa\u2019s most valuable listed company.\n\nThat would make Prosus the third-largest stock on the Amsterdam exchange after Shell and Unilever, and Europe\u2019s No.2 tech firm after Germany\u2019s SAP.\n\nEuropean players are still, however, dwarfed by the likes of Facebook and Amazon in the United States.\n\nThe Tencent stake has been worth more than Naspers itself for years, and dominated the $103 billion group\u2019s finances. One motivation for spinning off Prosus is to narrow that value gap.\n\nThe Prosus listing should see about a quarter of Naspers\u2019 value move to Amsterdam.\n\n\u201cWe believe Prosus will present a new and attractive opportunity for global tech investors to access our unique portfolio of internet businesses, providing a strong foundation for our future growth plans,\u201d said Naspers\u2019 CEO Bob van Dijk.\n\n\u201cThe listing is also designed to reduce our weighting on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which we believe will maximise shareholder value over time.\u201d\n\nNaspers will retain a stake of about 25% in Prosus, with the other 25% distributed to Naspers shareholders and making up the free float.\n\nFOOD DELIVERY FIRMS\n\nProsus also has stakes in fast-growing food delivery, social media and payments companies in China, India, Brazil and Russia. [See Factbox: nL5N26118H]\n\nIn the food and delivery sector, it owns stakes in Delivery Hero, Takeaway.com, Latin America\u2019s iFood, and India\u2019s Swiggy.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended in March 2019, Prosus reported a 15% rise in revenue to $2.65 billion, and its operating loss narrowed to $418 million from $615 million.\n\nProsus accounts for its Tencent stake as an \u201cequity accounted investment\u201d, which added $3.41 billion euros to 2019 pre-tax profit.\n\nProsus\u2019 net profit ended up being $4.25 billion, thanks to a $1.6 billion windfall on its sale of a 10% stake in Flipkart to Walmart.\n\nJasper Jansen, an analyst at the Dutch shareholders\u2019 rights group VEB, said he welcomed the listing of Prosus.\n\n\u201cWe love the fresh blood - finally there\u2019s a real company listing here that\u2019s active in the new economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he criticized Naspers\u2019 decision to maintain a two-class share structure system which gives its biggest shareholders extra voting rights in some circumstances.\n\n($1 = 0.9055 euros)", "description": "Shares in the spin-off of South African e-commerce group Naspers surged more than 25% in the first minutes of their market debut in Amsterdam on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428626273&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0M7-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
