Here are seven times he failed the task.\n\nKangaroo testicles for Bercow\n\nJohnson may well have been the first British prime minister to use the words \u201ckangaroo testicle\u201d in a conference speech. In a segment in which he bemoaned people having more control over voting on celebrity reality shows than they did with parliament, he suggested that \u201cif parliament were a reality TV show the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now\u201d.\n\nBut, he added: \u201cAt least we could have watched the Speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle\u201d. In 2017, Johnson\u2019s own father, Stanley, appeared in the ITV show I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!, declaring before he went into the jungle that he did not \u201cknow that a lamb\u2019s testicle is different from kangaroo testicle\u201d.\n\nKonstantin Chernenko \u2013 who?\n\nJohnson is well known for his classical references, but it was the 1980s cold war era he plundered for his speech. Suggesting that the Scottish National party was trying to drag Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, unwillingly towards No 10, he cited the example of Konstantin Chernenko. He also suggested people look it up. A severely ill Chernenko was elected to succeed Yuri Andropov as head of the Soviet Union, and lasted only 13 months, during which time he could frequently not attend official functions. After his death, in 1985, he was succeeded by Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nMother knows best\n\nAfter a few weeks during which Johnson has had some difficulty with his family \u2013 his brother resigning, his sister suggesting there might be other motives behind Brexit \u2013 he revealed that his mother had voted to leave the EU.\n\nHe suggested she was the origin of his one nation Toryism: \u201cMy mother taught me to believe strongly in the equal importance, the equal dignity, the equal worth of every human being on the planet.\u201d\n\nSajid Javid applauds himself\n\nJohnson dropped a quick unscripted \u201cthank you, Saj\u201d in the direction of the former home secretary and now chancellor, when he referenced the Conservatives\u2019 plans to reinstate the 20,000 police officer jobs axed during the previous 10 years. This led to the awkward sight of Javid furiously applauding himself in the audience.\n\nPulling the skin off a rice pudding\n\nIn a section addressing the UK\u2019s energy usage, Johnson said there were some days when wind and solar power were delivering more than half of the UK\u2019s energy needs. He explained this was in defiance of the sceptics who had once said that \u201cwind farms couldn\u2019t pull the skin off a rice pudding\u201d. The source of that quote? One Mr B Johnson in 2013.\n\nHe also cited the pioneering work of the nuclear fusion research team at Culham, Oxfordshire. He was quieter about the fact that the work had been partly funded by Euratom, which Johnson has committed to leave by 31 October.\n\nBus nut SEO strikes again\n\nFans of the conspiracy theory that Boris Johnson keeps saying things like \u201cmodel of restraint\u201d or that he makes model buses to take control of the Google search results for \u201cboris johnson model\u201d or \u201cboris johnson bus\u201d got another boost today. Describing himself as a \u201cbus nut\u201d, Johnson trotted out the bus-making anecdote again as he announced an ambition to improve bus services.\n\nCorbyn in space\n\nIf Bercow was going to end up eating kangaroo testicles, a worse fate awaited Jeremy Corbyn. In a section on planned space ports, Johnson suggested there was one \u201ccommunist cosmonaut\u201d he would like to \u201ccoax into the cockpit\u201d, and later suggested figuratively, if not literally, putting the Labour leader into orbit.\n\nHe also at one point claimed that Corbyn wanted to abolish the British armed forces, a rather inaccurate reading of Corbyn\u2019s 2012 speech, which said: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if every politician around the world, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, did what Costa Rica have done and abolished their army, and took pride in the fact they don\u2019t have an army.\u201d\n\nFish puns galore\n\n\u201cYou could see that one coming,\u201d said Johnson as he floundered his way through a pun-laden routine, arguing that despite having \u201cnames like Salmond and Sturgeon\u201d the SNP did not want to take control of Scottish fishing. \u201cWe want to turbo-charge the Scottish fishing sector; they would allow Brussels to charge for our turbot,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, what with the kangaroo anatomy references earlier, at least his speechwriter avoided using the word pollocks.", "description": "In his first conference speech as leader, PM offered a clutch of unusual analogies \u2013 plus brain fades", "authors": ["Martin Belam"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d86c28c1f98c77f0d3642979ecc96de27654f4f3/0_0_3858_2315/master/3858.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cf95f89c7db435982785bb345daf190"}
