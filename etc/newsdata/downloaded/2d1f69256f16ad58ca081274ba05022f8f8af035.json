On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to launch a broad investigation touching on who directed the suspension of aid, saying it should be part of a broader probe.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden \u2019s anticorruption efforts in the country while he was vice president and while his son Hunter Biden was working there. Neither Biden has been accused of wrongdoing over their work in Ukraine. Democrats have said the president was wrongfully pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a potential 2020 opponent, and part of a whistleblower complaint concerning Mr. Trump involves the Ukraine call, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThat July conversation wasn\u2019t known to lawmakers trying to get to the bottom of Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to a Ukraine aid package. As lawmakers lobbied Mr. Trump to release the money personally and called officials across his administration, they kept getting shifting responses, according to multiple interviews over the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for foreign aid to be somewhat conditional; we don\u2019t just give aid away under any and all circumstances,\u201d said Steven Smith, a political-science professor at Washington University in St. Louis. But \u201cif the money then is somehow withheld and [lawmakers aren\u2019t] privy to the reason for it, then it\u2019s a pretty serious situation.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration said that with the Ukraine money, it sought to more closely scrutinize how it was going to be used. The administration has sought to restrict foreign-aid disbursements several times, repeatedly drawing the ire of lawmakers who have insisted on the importance of the funds.\n\n\u201cThat good-government process was run by the President\u2019s policy team on this account to ensure that those goals were met,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nPolitico reported on Aug. 28 that Mr. Trump had asked his national security team to review the $250 million in aid, which had been appropriated as part of the fiscal 2019 spending package.\n\nOver a congressional recess, while the country was focused on mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, a handful of lawmakers engaged in a campaign to release the military aid.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) wrote that cutting off aid would be \u201can absolute gift\u201d to the Russians. The co-chairs of the House Ukraine Caucus issued a statement saying the aid shouldn\u2019t be delayed. On Sept. 3, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), Rob Portman (R., Ohio), Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) wrote to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and the Office of Management and Budget and pointedly underscored their congressional prerogatives.\n\n\u201cThis funding is crucial to the long term stability of Ukraine and has the continued backing and approval of the U.S. Congress which appropriated these funds,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe strongly urge you to direct the Department of Defense to obligate these funds immediately,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWe got nowhere,\u201d Ms. Shaheen later said.\n\nPart of the complication was that lawmakers couldn\u2019t get clear answers from the administration on its rationale for holding up the military aid, making it nearly impossible to work through issues.\n\nWhen some lawmakers spoke with Mr. Trump, the president told them that he was upset that other countries weren\u2019t spending enough to bolster Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThat was the same explanation Mr. Trump gave to reporters on Sunday, when asked about Ukraine: \u201cGermany should be spending much more, France, all of the European Union should be spending money. Why are we spending money and they\u2019re not?\u201d\n\nBut on Sept. 3, Vice President Mike Pence suggested the delay in aid was about corruption, saying he had brought up that concern a day earlier in his own meeting with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nMr. Pence said that \u201cto invest additional taxpayer [money] in Ukraine, the president wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMilitary officials seemed less wary, lawmakers said.\n\n\u201cWe were repeatedly promised by the military leaders when we pushed that the money was going to be released,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cWe were assured repeatedly that they saw not only the need for it militarily, but also a clear path forward.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Foreign Relations Committee members were also receiving muddled answers.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of consternation about why this was held up and what was going on,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), a member of the panel. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever hearing a clear response about what the holdup was.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R., La.) tried to find out by asking Mr. Durbin, a co-chair of the Senate\u2019s Ukraine Caucus, and Mr. Murphy why they thought funds had been held up. \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Durbin said.\n\nFed up, senators coalesced around an amendment that Mr. Durbin had sought to attach to a fiscal 2020 defense-spending bill to force the release of funds to Ukraine. The day before the Senate Appropriations Committee was scheduled to vote, the White House released the military aid, along with $142 million in State Department funds.\n\n\u201cWhy was it released?\u201d asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) of Mr. Durbin during a committee markup of the spending bill on Sept. 12. \u201cBecause of your amendment. That\u2019s why it was released, because I was going to vote for it.\u201d\n\n\u2014Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "description": "Lawmakers of both parties struggled for weeks to learn why the administration delayed aid money for Ukraine, which has become another focal point amid news of a pressure campaign toward that country from Trump and his personal lawyer.", "authors": ["Siobhan Hughes", "Siobhan.Hughes Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109869/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
