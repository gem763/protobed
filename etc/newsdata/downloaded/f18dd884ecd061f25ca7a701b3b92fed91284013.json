When you\u2019re in these kind of positions, it\u2019s always exciting,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you play the game, and look forward to the weekend.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick is sixth in the Race to Dubai rankings and is looking to regain his spot in Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team after missing out on the competition last year.\n\nJoachim Hansen of Denmark moved into second at 9 under with a 66 as he looks to improve on his fourth-place finish in last weekend\u2019s Spanish Open.\n\nFormer U.S. Open winners Justin Rose (69) and Graeme McDowell (66) were tied with three other players - Shubhankar Sharma (69), Rory Sabbatini (70) and Andrew Johnston (68) - for third at 7 under.\n\nMolinari, the tournament\u2019s poster boy, struggled to a 76 and missed the cut by five strokes. Molinari was playing in his home country for the first time since winning last year\u2019s British Open and leading Europe to the Ryder Cup trophy with a 5-0 record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to accept and I\u2019m ready to move on,\u201d Molinari said. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry this has happened here - at the Italian Open. My level of play was mediocre at best. Nothing was working.\u201d\n\nAlso missing the weekend was Ian Poulter, a two-time Italian Open champion like Molinari and the winner at Olgiata way back in 2002 when the tournament was last held in Rome. Poulter (71) and British Open champion Shane Lowry (71) each missed the cut by one stroke.\n\nItalian fans can now put their support behind Andrea Pavan (67), who grew up playing at Olgiata, and is in contention at 6 under; and Guido Migliozzi (66), who is at 4-under.\n\nWith a $7 million purse in the Rolex Series, the Italian Open is back in Rome after 17 years as the local federation attempts to boost interest ahead of the 2022 Ryder Cup at the nearby Marco Simone club .\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Five-time European Tour winner Matthew Fitzpatrick took a one-stroke lead after the second round of the Italian Open on Friday, while local favorite Francesco Molinari missed the cut.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
