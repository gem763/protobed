It\u2019s a trend music shops across the country are experiencing.\n\n\u201cIf you are in the piano industry, it\u2019s like the frog [dissection] in biology class. It just creeps up on you,\u201d he said of the decline in sales.\n\nU.S. sales have fallen steadily from 95,518 pianos sold in 2005 to 30,516 sold last year, according to the market and opinion research statistics website Statista.\n\nAfter the Great Recession of 2008, Mr. Marjaritas says he noticed a \u201cserious drop, virtually overnight\u201d in piano sales, and he fears how another recession would affect the industry.\n\n\u201cHistorically, pianos go first in a recession because it is a capital expenditure. It is perhaps the second largest purchase in the house after the car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a 500-pound ship\u2019s anchor in the living room.\u201d\n\nSo now he is selling all of his 300-piano inventory at the 30,000-square-foot superstore in College Park, and will relocate to a 3,000-square-foot store with 30 pianos in Rockville by the end of the year.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mr. Marjaritas realized that selling pianos could be a lucrative business when he took out an advertisement to sell his own piano \u2014 and received calls from 20 would-be buyers.\n\nAs baby boomers were coming of piano-playing age, Mr. Marjaritas saw a market for used pianos and rented a house for $100 a month in 1974 in Baltimore County\u2019s Lansdowne neighborhood, where he sold pianos on the first floor and lived on the second.\n\nSince then, he estimates that he has sold thousands of used pianos from storefronts in Maryland \u2014 about 30 a month.\n\nHe moved to his current location when the building\u2019s previous occupant, Jordan Kitt\u2019s Music, sold him all of its inventory and vacated the space in its own downsizing move.\n\nThis isn\u2019t his first store-closing sale at the College Park location: Mr. Marjaritas said that his lease agreement has allowed the landlord to replace his piano store with a more profitable tenant, but those deals fell through for the landlord. Now he\u2019s leaving on his own terms.\n\nHe began playing piano at the age of 5 but says he didn\u2019t immediately fall in love with it.\n\n\u201cIt was a keyboard on cardboard on a desk,\u201d Mr. Marjaritas said.\n\nHis older brother played, and his family always had a piano in the house, which helped him stick with the hobby that eventually turned into a career.\n\nMr. Marjaritas also owns a 3,000-square-foot storefront in Catonsville, where he grew up.\n\nHe says he hasn\u2019t settled yet on a Rockville location, but he plans to complete the transition by the end of the year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
