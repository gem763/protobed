There is a feeling that he maybe wasn\u2019t quite ready for the exact size of Liverpool during his time there between 2012 and 2015, and that may have led to his more questionable comments and moments.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Because it\u2019s not just Rodgers that has matured. So have Leicester.\n\nThere are some long-term employees who genuinely believe that the current squad is better than the title-winning squad, and that the club is in a much better place.\n\nThat isn\u2019t much of an exaggeration. The title season was in itself a perfect moment in time, where a solid squad with three world-class players came together for a generational run of good form at the exact same period all of the big clubs were suffering generational lulls. It was pretty much unrepeatable, based on a lot of luck going their way, and on relatively out-of-date football ideas that modern managers wouldn\u2019t want to repeat.\n\nThat is not the case now. No one would describe this Leicester squad as \u201csolid\u201d. It is instead one of the brightest in Europe, featuring some of the most promising young players in Europe.\n\nThey have all been introduced in-line with a fully-formed football idea, that was only introduced after the title win, and that glorious season allowed the platform for. It has meant they are now a \u201cmore balanced and intelligent\u201d club.\n\nIn that, this Leicester team have more of an identity and idea of themselves than Manchester United, Arsenal and maybe even Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nAnd this is where Rodgers comes in, rather literally. It is one of those cases where the coach\u2019s own ideas suit the club\u2019s, and the idea is for both to mutually complement each other so everyone improves.\n\nRodgers has undeniably given this squad a better - and more sophisticated - tactical shape to work within. That shape in itself is based on core principles, known among his coaching staff as the \u201cthree Ps\u201d.\n\nThey are \u201cpossession, pressing, penetration\u201d. \u201cThat is what football is really about,\u201d as the staff often say.\n\nThe aim is to get the players to apply these, from an initial core formation - or, as they actually describe it, \u201cdefensive shape\u201d - for when they don\u2019t have the ball. What the staff then most concentrate on is transitions, and how they go from winning the ball to hurting the opposition with it - the three Ps combined in one key spell of play.\n\nThis only truly works, however, if the players actually understand the idea.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s Pedro told The Independent two weeks ago. If the manager can\u2019t transmit his ideas, and the players don\u2019t understand it, you\u2019ve a problem. When your players can follow it, though, you\u2019ve already won a lot in a season.\u201d\n\nAnd this is where Rodgers is seen as especially effective, and even better than he used to be. It is not just the sophistication of his ideas, but how simple he has made them to grasp.\n\nGame insight and communication are these days the most valuable attributes in management,\u201d one source says. \u201cBrendan is good at both of these, and got better.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at good breaking down players\u2019 responsibilities on the pitch into simple and direct instructions.\n\n\u201cI think he is also very effective at taking things on board and making them his. The reality is that all coaches borrow from other coaches, whether via subtle or very direct influence. Brendan is good at spotting things and seeing ways for them to work within the confines of his teams.\n\nIt is also where his maturity comes in. Many say he is just better at connecting with players, and thereby deriving a more emotionally-invested level of performance.\n\nSome, after all, would freely say that his \u201cpersonality\u201d became \u201can issue for Liverpool players\u201d, even though many would reflect positively on their time with him.\n\n\u201cHe has an awareness now that he lacked,\u201d the same source says. \u201cHis manner with the players is friendly and shows them that he has their backs. He often drops some weakness or fault of his own into discussions with players. The message is: \u2018I make mistakes, I\u2019m not asking for perfection, but I need you to do this, this and this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is a feeling that Rodgers was more hurt by how Liverpool ended than he would have let on, and that it could have gone either way afterwards. But he has learnt from it. He\u2019s more likely to reference the source of a story now, rather than pass it off as his studied philosophical approach.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s realised less is more.\u201d\n\nAnd it means that Leicester may well offer Liverpool more of a challenge than they\u2019ve had so far this season. They may well finally be the team to disrupt that winning run.\n\nThere is an acceptance among some at Leicester that they froze a little when losing to United at Old Trafford. That defeat was a bit of a \u201cnarrative-buster\u201d, in that it was fully expected Rodgers\u2019s side would show how much better they are by winning\u2026 only for them to lose.\n\nAnd yet the wider story hasn\u2019t actually changed. Leicester are still well ahead of United in the table, looking much better placed to finish in the top four.\n\nThat is partly because Rodgers has started to change the narrative of his career.\n\nHe, and Leicester, look like they\u2019re going far.", "description": "Back in Brendan Rodgers\u2019s first few weeks as Leicester City manager, one football figure was going for a meeting with the club, and was mindful of some of the\u2026 perceptions of the Irishman.
