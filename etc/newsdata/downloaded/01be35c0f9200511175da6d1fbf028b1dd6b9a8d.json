I don\u2019t know what they do. \u2026 Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You have to ask Rudy. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGiuliani declined to comment when reached by USA TODAY, but his association with Parnas and Fruman has brought new potential trouble to the doorstep of the White House, as Trump already is battling the greatest threat to his presidency in the form of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry.\n\nParnas, Fruman drew scrutiny\n\nEven as Parnas and Fruman were drawing the scrutiny of Congress for arranging a January meeting in New York between Giuliani and Ukraine's then-prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, as part of the campaign to launch an investigation into the Bidens, federal prosecutors in New York were taking aim at the pair for their suspicious movement of money to political campaigns in the U.S.\n\nThese images provided by the Alexandria Sheriff\u2019s Office show booking mugshots of Igor Fruman (left) and Lev Parnas, associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested on an indictment that includes charges of violating campaign finance laws. The men had key roles in Giuliani's efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Biden and his son, Hunter. More\n\nWhat happened: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed Thursday, the dual interests of the Giuliani associates sometimes overlapped.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries of their largess, prosecutors allege, was a U.S. congressman who received $5,400 last year from the pair, who also pledged to raise $20,000 for the lawmaker as they sought to enlist him in an effort to remove Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nIn his July 25 call to Zelensky, Trump makes an apparent disparaging reference to Yovanovitch, suggesting that she was ultimately recalled for criticizing the president. During the same call, he urged the Ukrainian president to work with Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to assist in the investigation of the Bidens.\n\nA visual timeline: The events that led up to Trump's fateful phone call\n\nThe congressman who received the political donations was not named in court documents, but a person familiar with the matter identified the lawmaker as former Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.\n\nSessions wrote Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year, urging the ouster of Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May.", "description": "A criminal case against associates of Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, competes with the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Kevin Johnson", "Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qKVf2_TI2kse.R1bw83k4g--~B/aD01MjE7dz04OTM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a566a5f110b3ad7983780a48f1f039fa", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
