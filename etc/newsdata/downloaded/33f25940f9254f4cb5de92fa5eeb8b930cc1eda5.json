Who would the nominee have to be? And hilariously the example I came up with was Kanye West,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWhatever you think about him as an artist or a personality, Kanye West should not be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think Kanye should have the nuclear codes, you know?\u201d said Hayes, who hosts an hour of primetime each weeknight on MSNBC, in an interview on \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d a Yahoo News podcast.\n\nAt a time when \u201cI think people thought of his politics as, like, roughly liberal,\u201d Hayes wondered what the Democratic Party would be able to do to stop a figure like West, a rap artist, from gaining traction in a party primary.\n\nHayes still thinks about that kind of a scenario. \u201cI play with that idea all the time. Like, I still think about it,\u201d Hayes said.\n\n\u201cI thought more about myself and my own conscience. Like, would I be a person who, on my platform, was talking to my audience \u2014 who was sort of falling in line behind someone \u2014 to be like, \u2018This person shouldn't be the nominee\u2019?\u201d Hayes said.\n\nWest, who has no experience in elected office, has talked publicly about running for president since 2015, when he first said he planned to do so in 2020. In response, the New Yorker magazine published a cartoon on its cover mocking both West and Trump that showed West holding up a newspaper with the headline \u201cTrump Defeats Kanye,\u201d in a nod to the iconic 1948 photo of President Harry Truman holding up a \u201cDewey Defeats Truman\u201d headline.\n\nWest has since continued to play with the idea in public comments, saying last year that he was now looking ahead to a 2024 run. As recently as August, he posted on Instagram asking his followers if he would be a good president.\n\nA year ago, West visited Trump at the White House and spoke with reporters in the Oval Office while wearing a piece of signature Trump apparel: the red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap. That came days after his appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d wearing the same hat. West has surprised fans by defending Trump from criticism and aligning himself with the Republican Party in some of his comments.\n\nHayes wrote about the loss of trust in mediating institutions, such as political parties, in his 2011 book, \u201cTwilight of the Elites.\u201d \u201cThe most important social project we must undertake in the wake of the fail decade is reconstructing our institutions so that we once again feel comfortable trusting them,\u201d he wrote. (The \u201cfail decade\u201d refers to 2000-2010 and specifically to the Iraq War, the financial crisis and the Catholic abuse scandal.)\n\nHe said on \u201cThe Long Game\u201d that there are two forces creating openings for underqualified individuals to run for national or statewide elected office: \u201cstrong polarization, weak parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of mediation combined with polarization just really creates really ugly incentives,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nIn other words, polarization creates a situation where no matter who the two parties produce as their nominees, most voters revert to tribal identity and pick a side when it comes down to Democrat versus Republican, and rationalize away or ignore their nominees\u2019 imperfections.\n\n\u201cI say this all the time when I do events. I'm like, \u2018Anyone in this room, literally anyone in this room \u2026 who became the Democratic Party nominee would have a shot at being president \u2026 a 50-50 chance,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nAnd weak parties create a situation where there are few options for a party establishment if it knows a candidate is unqualified or unprepared for the presidency, but that candidate is able to leverage some combination of celebrity, outrage and appeals to a hard-core element to gain political traction.\n\n\u201cNow the Democrats don't face that right now,\u201d Hayes said.\n\n\u201cEven Andrew Yang \u2014 I think you could make a strong argument he lacks the qualifications necessary to be president \u2014 he's not a sociopath,\u201d Hayes said, contrasting Yang to Trump. \u201cHe's not a pathological narcissist. He's not, like, an obviously dangerous person.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "MSNBC's Chris Hayes on what he would do if a Trump-like celebrity ever ran for president as a Democrat.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S6oDp2s3NqfY9Hm6DLoc7Q--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/bb72d1b0-eebb-11e9-bd57-91538fdbaf93", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
