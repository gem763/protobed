He\u2019ll be remembered \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d as the \u201cdumbest and worst\u201d president, Conway declared in a tweet Friday.\n\nConway was responding to a tweet by conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin commenting on Trump\u2019s controversial July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. The call \u2014 in which Trump repeatedly urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son \u2014 has triggered an impeachment inquiry. Rubin called Trump \u201cso thickheaded\u201d that he \u201cdidn\u2019t even realize what was incriminating\u201d and \u201cso foolish\u201d that he took advice from his \u201cunhinged\u201d attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nKellyanne Conway, meanwhile, was busy lashing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) for caving into the wishes of the \u201cmen around her\u201d and announcing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nShe did the \u201cworst thing a woman in power can do, which is she just changes her mind because the men around her said, \u2019Change your mind. We need an impeachment,\u2019\u201d Conway told reporters at the White House Friday.", "description": "\"Without a doubt.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8ef4322200003400de9f25.jpeg?cache=1y47zhsmcz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
