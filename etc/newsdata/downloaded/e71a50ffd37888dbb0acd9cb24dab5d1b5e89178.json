Maryland-based Lockheed Martin not only consulted on the design of the film\u2019s spacecraft, space stations, moon landers and other tech\u2014it also paid Disney, the studio behind Ad Astra, to slap its logo on the movie\u2019s costumes and props.\n\nLockheed, builder of the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters, the Orion space capsule and other high technology, is a big part of Gray\u2019s fictional world. Hollywood and America\u2019s space sector for decades have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship. Arguably, they\u2019ve never been closer than they are in Ad Astra.\n\nIn Gray\u2019s film, Pitt plays a U.S. military space operator on a lonely and dangerous mission to find his long-lost astronaut father, portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones. Pitt\u2019s character must travel to the moon then onward to Mars in order to activate a laser communication system that can reach Neptune.\n\nThings get complicated. It seems space pirates are involved.\n\nPitt\u2019s company Plan B, which produced Ad Astra alongside New Regency and 20th Century Fox (before Disney completed its acquisition of Fox in early 2019) approached Lockheed back in 2017, when the movie was still in pre-production.\n\nGray wanted his near-future story to feel grounded in our own present. He asked to tap Lockheed\u2019s expertise as a builder of rockets and spacecraft. \u201cThey came to us not necessarily looking for brand involvement\u2026 but first and foremost for advisement,\u201d Mark Lewis, Lockheed\u2019s liaison to the production, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe idea was for the technology in the movie to seem just slightly more advanced than our own is, and for it to fit into the everyday life of the movie\u2019s world in a way that feels realistic. Lockheed helped Plan B design capsules, landers and spacesuits and communication arrays.\n\nThe plane-maker brought in former astronauts Steve Frick and Tony Antonelli, both now Lockheed employees, to advise Pitt and the other actors on the grittier aspects of living and working in space, down to \u201chow astronauts would smell being trapped in a capsule for years on end,\" Lewis said.\n\n\u201cIt lends a feeling of authenticity and focus on detail that you cannot reproduce,\u201d Gray said of Lockheed\u2019s involvement in the film. \u201cYou want to convey a world that people can connect to, that seems like the one that we live in today.\u201d\n\nLockheed offered its advice for free, as did NASA, which also gave the production stock footage and photographs. Both Lockheed and NASA said they viewed their initial involvement as an investment in America\u2019s future technology workforce. \u201cFilms are a really important way to reach people,\u201d Bert Ulrich, NASA\u2019s liaison to Hollywood, told The Daily Beast.\n\nFor Lockheed there also was an opportunity to portray itself on film. For a fee.\n\nGray aimed to populate his space opera with real companies. Major brands lined up to get their logos and products on screen. There\u2019s a DHL booth near an Applebee\u2019s at the movie\u2019s spaceport. Real-life space-tourism firm Virgin Galactic runs a shuttle service to Ad Astra\u2019s moon base.\n\nLockheed ponied up an undisclosed sum to be the film\u2019s main builder of high technology. Virgin Galactic operates Ad Astra\u2019s shuttle, but the fictionalized version of Lockheed actually builds it. You\u2019ll see workers in Lockheed jumpsuits tending to the craft. \u201cI bet this is the first and only time that Lockheed Martin will be partnered with Applebee\u2019s in a sentence,\u201d Gray joked in a Lockheed promotional video.\n\n\u201c Lockheed Martin not only consulted on the design of the film\u2019s spacecraft, space stations, moon landers and other tech\u2014it also paid Disney, the studio behind Ad Astra, to slap its logo on the movie\u2019s costumes and props. \u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a different way we can present Lockheed Martin as that visionary, as a builder of the future,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWhat better way to do that than in major motion picture?\u201d\n\nThe downside, of course, is that the movie could flop. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a risk we took,\u201d Lewis said. Some of the space industry insiders The Daily Beast spoke with still are stinging from their involvement with Gravity, the 2013 Sandra Bullock-starring space-survival film that won praise for its performances, but whose portrayal of technology and orbital physics is, to put it gently, lacking in realism.\n\nBut industry and government have been gambling on flying and space movies for decades, and mostly winning. The very first Oscar-winner, in 1927, was the aviation drama Wings. Eccentric industrialist Howard Hughes, who died in 1976, made movies and airplanes with equal abandon and found any excuse to include the latter in the former.\n\nThe Right Stuff in 1983 and Apollo 13 in 1995 raised the bar for audiences, filmmakers and industry executives. More and more, the makers of real technology want to be a part of made-up stories in order to inspire real investors, voters and future tech workers. \u201cA lot of science institutions have gotten more savvy about outreach,\u201d Peter Westwick, a space historian at the University of Southern California, told The Daily Beast.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ad Astra will do for the space industry what The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 did. The early reviews are glowing. But then, critics loved 2018\u2019s Neil Armstrong-biopic First Man, too\u2014and that flick flopped at the box office.\n\nNASA film-liaison Ulrich caught an advance screening of Ad Astra but agreed not to comment on the movie besides calling it \u201cinspirational.\u201d\n\nLockheed\u2019s Lewis also was coy. \u201cAny space movie that captures emotions and interests in people is a good thing for us.\u201d", "description": "One of America\u2019s biggest tech firms paid Disney to have its spacecraft designs and logo featured heavily throughout the Brad Pitt-starring space epic.
