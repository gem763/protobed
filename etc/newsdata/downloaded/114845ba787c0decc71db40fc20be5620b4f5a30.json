It didn\u2019t bring the Braves good luck. Starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz recorded only one out as the Cardinals took a 10-0 first-inning lead.\n\nThe Braves said they were taking several steps to \u201creduce the Tomahawk Chop during our in-ballpark presentation today.\u201d The team said it would not play the music that accompanies the chant when Helsey is in the game.\n\nThere is no apparent immediate shift in the team\u2019s long-term stance on the promotion.\n\nHelsley, a native of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, speaks the Cherokee language and is one of only a few Native Americans in the majors.\n\nThe reliever said last week he was shocked to hear the chant, a part of the Braves\u2019 tradition since it was borrowed from Florida State in the early 1990s.\n\nHelsley told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he was insulted by what he saw and heard in Thursday\u2019s series opener.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley said.\n\n\u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual. They are a lot more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe Braves said they will continue to examine the issue after the season.\n\n\u201cAs stated earlier, we will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the overall in-game experience,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community after the postseason concludes.\u201d\n\nOne day after Helsley\u2019s comments, the Braves issued their first statement on the matter , saying the team has \u201cworked to honor and respect the Native American community through the years.\u201d\n\nOne of the Braves\u2019 sponsors is Harrah\u2019s Cherokee Casinos, which advertises its North Carolina locations under a video screen behind the left-field seats.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Braves did not distribute their traditional red foam tomahawks to fans before Wednesday's Game 5 of their NL Division Series", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/d28944_nlds-cardinals-helsleys-insult-baseball-82119-in-aug-15-2019-file-photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
