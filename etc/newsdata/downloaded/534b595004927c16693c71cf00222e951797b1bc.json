German diplomats at best looked the other way - and clearly did not do enough for the protection of their compatriots in this colony\".\n\nThe scale of the atrocities committed at the fenced-in mountain commune 350km south of Santiago came to light only after the end of Pinochet's regime.\n\nSchaefer, having initially run from justice, was arrested in Argentina in 2005 and then jailed in Chile for child sexual and other abuses. He died behind bars in 2010 at the age of 88.\n\nHis right-hand man Hopp, who ran the compound's clinic, was convicted in Chile of complicity in Schaefer's sex crimes but fled to Germany in 2011 before the court ruling could be imposed.\n\nA German court initially upheld the jail sentence but a higher court, and state prosecutors, have since found that the evidence provided by the Chilean court fell short of that required by German justice.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Germany said it would pay compensation of up to 10 000 euros ($11 000) each to victims of the former Nazi paedophile sect \"Colonia Dignidad\" in Chile.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6686/d1b01cd1c52247c1a6e26e55439c1b76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-18"}
