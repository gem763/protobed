(AP) - Mississippi State defensive coordinator Bob Shoop will see familiar faces Saturday when the Bulldogs visit Tennessee.\n\nShoop was Tennessee\u2019s defensive coordinator in 2016-17, the final two years of Butch Jones\u2019 coaching tenure. Shoop\u2019s son, Jay, is a walk-on defensive back for Tennessee.\n\nShoop, who is in his second year on Mississippi State\u2019s staff, coached several current members of Tennessee\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cI think Coach Shoop was a great coach, first of all,\u201d Tennessee safety Nigel Warrior said. \u201cSecond, what I remember from him is being a great coach, putting all his guys in position to make a play. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing at Mississippi State.\u201d\n\nShoop wasn\u2019t made available to the media this week as Mississippi State (3-2, 1-1 SEC) and Tennessee (1-4, 0-2) look to get back on track inside conference play.\n\nThe Bulldogs were dominated 56-23 at No. 12 Auburn two weeks ago, when the Tigers were ranked seventh. They had an open date last weekend. Tennessee is coming off a 43-14 home loss to No. 3 Georgia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can ever ignore the emotional component of coaching or playing in a football game against a institution where you\u2019ve been before,\u201d Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said about Shoop\u2019s return to Tennessee. \u201cBut Bob is the ultimate professional and any feelings he may have good, bad or otherwise regarding Tennessee and his time there, he will be able to put aside. His concentration and his defensive staff will be to put a great game plan together and make sure we are putting the kids in position to be successful.\u201d\n\nWhile Tennessee has overhauled its roster since Jones\u2019 staff departed, the Vols started six defensive players last week who also were on the team during Shoop\u2019s tenure. That group includes Warrior, linebacker Daniel Bituli, end LaTrell Bumphus, safety Theo Jackson, cornerback Shawn Shamburger and outside linebacker Darrell Taylor.\n\n\u201cEverywhere he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been successful with his defenses,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHe helped me get (to Tennessee) and I wanted to be part of that.\u201d\n\nShoop wasn\u2019t quite as successful at Tennessee, though.\n\nHis Tennessee defenses were decimated by injuries each year and were vulnerable to the long run. Tennessee\u2019s run defense ranked 104th nationally in 2016 and 126th in 2017 .\n\nThat Tennessee stint came after Shoop had produced top-20 defenses at Penn State and Vanderbilt.\n\nShoop made a triumphant comeback last year at Mississippi State as the Bulldogs ranked first nationally in total defense (268.4 yards allowed per game) and second in scoring defense (12 points allowed per game). Overall, Mississippi State allowed an FBS-low 15 touchdowns for the entire 2018 season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had consistently successfully productive defensive units at just about every place he\u2019s been in college football,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cI know the Tennessee years were a bit of an anomaly, but he bounced back strong last year.\u201d\n\nMoorhead hired Shoop shortly after taking over Mississippi State\u2019s program at the end of the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cBob grew up in the town about 10 or 15 minutes away from me,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve known about him from a coaching standpoint for a really long time. His defenses have been very highly ranked in terms of scoring defense and total yardage for a very long time. His intelligence and the way he motivates players and obviously his production has been good.\u201d\n\nThis season, the Bulldogs have lost much of their bite on defense as they\u2019ve tried to replace first-round draft picks Jeffery Simmons, Montez Sweat and Johnathan Abram while also dealing with suspensions resulting from the NCAA investigation into Mississippi State\u2019s athletic department.\n\nThe dropoff has been evident. Mississippi State ranks 12th in the SEC in scoring defense (28.5 points) and 11th in rush defense (158 yards allowed per game).\n\n\u201cWe knew there was going to be some inexperience,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cWe knew we were going to have to get the younger guys grown up quickly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi State defensive coordinator Bob Shoop will see familiar faces Saturday when the Bulldogs visit Tennessee.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Jones"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/mississippi_state-shoops_return_football_71363_c0-334-3192-2195_s1770x1032.jpg?d658a450cf19620323fd0eca29884eb519be2781", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
