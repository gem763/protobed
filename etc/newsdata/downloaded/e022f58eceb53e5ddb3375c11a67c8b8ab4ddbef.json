The GM-UAW strike shows lawmakers what it must do to restore this national obligation.\n\nUnion members picket outside a General Motors facility in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, in September 2019. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\nLast week, 48,000 UAW members walked off General Motors\u2019 factory floors and warehouses in the company\u2019s first strike in 12 years. The issues in contention \u2014 negotiations over wages, benefits and factory locations \u2014 are deeply important.\n\nI\u2019m not a participant on either side of the strike, nor am I in a position to mediate who is right or wrong on each item being negotiated. I am, however, a federal policymaker, and know that when I consider the issues facing the United States, there is a need to recognize our national obligations to one another and to the country as Americans.\n\nFor UAW members and the overwhelming majority of workers, understanding this obligation is straightforward. These workers aren\u2019t line items on a ledger, but essential contributors to GM\u2019s extraordinary success. Their livelihoods, their families\u2019 future, and the vitality of their communities rely on the ability of American companies to provide dignified work.\n\nWhat's a firm's national obligation?\n\nFor companies like GM, national obligation is a more complicated affair. GM is one of the great icons of American innovation. But the world is a very different place than it was 111 years ago when William Durant, who made his money building horse-drawn carriages, first incorporated the company. Its customers and supply chains are global, as is its competition. Companies face immense pressure from shareholders to generate short-term returns \u2014 pressure that sometimes eclipses the need to invest in America\u2019s future.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (Photo: U.S. Senate)\n\nThis difference in how we conceptualize national obligation is at the core of today\u2019s labor strike, and it will remain even after the UAW and GM reach a deal.\n\nWe see this difference play out in many of today\u2019s political battles. A new consensus is emerging that says America\u2019s companies should act in America\u2019s national interest, as opposed to a global interest or the interests of their shareholders only. President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message carried him to the White House, and Elizabeth Warren is making \u201cEconomic Patriotism\u201d a centerpiece of her presidential run.\n\nWorkers, not businesses, need a bailout: I've worked for General Motors for 25 years. I'm on strike because we're done sacrificing.\n\nThose messages resonate with the American people because they speak to Americans\u2019 growing concern over the destabilizing effects of technological change and broad financialization at home. In the face of a predatory China \u2014 a country whose leaders aggressively seek to destroy our industrial base and allow businesses to flagrantly steal American intellectual property \u2014 the need for solutions has become even more urgent.\n\nThe federal government cannot instill American patriotism into domestic companies by decree. It can, however, realign the incentive structures to make companies \u2014 management and labor both \u2014 more productive in the United States, so they continue to make money and provide stable work here in America. We don\u2019t want plant closures because offshoring is the only viable option for firms. We don\u2019t want American workers, facing intense foreign competition and declining domestic productivity, to be left without jobs or trapped in temporary work arrangements with meager benefits.\n\nInvest in America\n\nIncreasing investment in America is central to repairing an economy that works for American families. For the union members currently on strike, more domestic investment means more jobs, higher wages, and greater economic security. For GM, extending the company\u2019s history of innovation will depend on its investment in American productive capacity.\n\nTo empower industry, lawmakers should first look at full-expensing: How to expand and make permanent the immediate write-off for any business investment in machinery, structures and land. Doing so would help businesses ensure the long-term availability of jobs for workers.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way: GM strike exposes anti-worker flaws in US labor laws. Companies have the upper hand.\n\nWe should also reduce existing tax code incentives for companies to buy back their own shares. Federal policy should not promote financial engineering for short-term gains over long-term investment in capital development \u2014 or over the workers who turn that national capacity into innovation and production.\n\nWhen we fail to invest in physical capital like property or machinery, we fail to provide workers with the tools they need to operate. When we promote offshoring to maintain the bottom line, we fail to promote workers\u2019 essential role as creators of value. More business investment is vital to turn that tide and improve companies\u2019 long-term productivity. A strong labor force depends on it.\n\nI hope the UAW and GM swiftly reach a deal. Every day they don\u2019t, both working families and the national corporate icon that employs them suffer the cost. As the UAW and GM negotiate their shared future, American legislators must now recognize our own responsibility to secure a future of national strength and dignified work for all of us.\n\nMarco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, is U.S. senator.
