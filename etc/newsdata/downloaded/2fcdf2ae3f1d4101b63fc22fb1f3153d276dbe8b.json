On the table there is a mass of ethernet cables, many of which appear not to be plugged into anything.\n\nThe image is in stark contrast to the 2011 photograph, in which Mr Obama is not the focus of the overall image, and in which the national security team, dressed in less formal attire, appear tense and are focused on witnessing what is unfolding on an unseen screen out of shot.\n\nThe differences have led many critics to accuse Mr Trump of staging the photograph, rather than it being a true depiction of what the situation room looked like at the time of the raid.\n\nBut is it really staged?\n\nIn a tweet, which has since been favourited over 50,000 times and retweeted almost 20,000 times in less than 24 hours, former White House photographer Mr Souza wrote: \u201cThe raid, as reported, took place at 3:30PM Washington time. The photo, as shown in the camera IPTC data, was taken at \u201c17:05:24\u201d.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

However, this is not necessarily the case, as the raid likely lasted for hours.\n\nMr Souza later tweeted: \u201cJust to be clear, I didn\u2019t say it was staged. Trump himself said he didn\u2019t arrive to the Situation Room until \u2018around 5pm\u2019. So it\u2019s definitely possible the photo was taken during the raid.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, reports from the Associated Press of the raid in Syria said the attack had taken place after midnight, local time, which corresponds to 6pm in Washington DC \u2013 matching the time of the photograph.\n\nCommentators online have also suggested three people in the photograph, including Mr Trump, are wearing exactly the same suit and tie combinations as they had been two days previously, leading to speculation the photograph could have been posed two days in advance of the raid. This is entirely unproven.\n\nIn an unusual press conference following the raid, Mr Trump described in detail the death of the Isis leader, who he said had detonated a suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel, \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming\u201d while being chased by US military dogs. The blast apparently killed him and three of his children.\n\n\u201cHe was a sick and depraved man,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward.\u201d\n\nBut despite Mr Trump\u2019s strong statement over the death of the leader of a movement he\u2019d repeatedly said America had \u201c100 per cent\u201d defeated, the Pentagon has reportedly said the raid on al-Baghdadi\u2019s residence had been successful \u201cin spite of\u201d Mr Trump\u2019s actions, rather than because of them, The New York Times reports.", "description": "In 2011, 10 years after the terrorist attacks in New York which destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, the architect of the hijackings, Osama bin Laden, was killed by US special forces in a raid in Pakistan.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/14/eh48omcwoaelabe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
