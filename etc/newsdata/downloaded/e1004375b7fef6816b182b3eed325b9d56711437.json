But none of them should properly be viewed as journalists or hosts, but instead as partisan commentators,\u201d a current CNN employee told Fox News. \u201cIt seems we at CNN now have our own Lawrence O\u2019Donnell \u2018Russian oligarch co-signer\u2019 moment of incredibly premature reporting. But will we fess up to it, as MSNBC did?\u201d\n\nWAPO MEDIA CRITIC QUESTIONS IF LAWRENCE O\u2019DONNELL IS 'FIT' TO HOST MSNBC SHOW\n\nCNN did not immediately respond when asked for an official statement regarding whether or not it stands by Sciutto\u2019s report. Sciutto appeared on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d Tuesday in his usual anchor chair alongside Poppy Harlow, who called his report \u201cstunning\u201d and the story remained prominently placed on CNN\u2019s website despite the CIA statement. Sciutto also appeared Tuesday morning on CNN's \"New Day\" to defend his reporting while downplaying the news that the CIA wanted to extract the source before Trump took office.\n\n\u201cIt seems we at CNN now have our own Lawrence O\u2019Donnell \u2018Russian oligarch co-signer\u2019 moment of incredibly premature reporting. But will we fess up to it, as MSNBC did?\u201d \u2014 Current CNN employee\n\n\"You know CNN has gone off the rails when the CIA feels compelled to issue a statement rebuking its reporting,\" Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\nThe rare CIA rebuke came as The New York Times published a bombshell piece late in the evening, which largely contradicted CNN's reporting. According to the Times, CIA officials \"made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia\" \u2014 weeks before Trump even took office.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News that CNN\u2019s report \u201cis not only incorrect\u201d but also \u201chas the potential to put lives in danger.\u201d\n\nSciutto\u2019s report was even questioned by his colleague, CIA official-turned-CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd, who appeared on the liberal network Monday prior to the CIA officially condemning the report. Mudd said the loss of a key informant is \u201cdevastating\u201d but didn\u2019t buy the political angle of his colleague\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cI question whether this angle of the story about whether the president\u2019s engagement with intelligence was actually a spur in the extraction of the informant. I suspect there are other issues here,\u201d Mudd told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\nTapper didn\u2019t press Mudd about his concerns and quickly wrapped up the interview. CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOUTGOING CNN CONTRIBUTOR ELIANA JOHNSON QUESTIONS NETWORK'S DECISION TO SEND HER PACKING\n\nCNN\u2019s media newsletter oddly promoted \u201cJim Sciutto's big scoop\u201d and said that the Times \u201cadded additional details\u201d despite being published after the CIA and Gray Lady both disputed the report.\n\n\u201cIn that newsletter, you falsely claimed NYT \u2018added additional details\u2019 to Sciutto's story when they actually debunked all its key claims, or at very least contradicted them,\u201d Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway tweeted. \u201cWhy would you lie to your readers about such an easily checkable issue?\u201d\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Hemingway\u2019s inquiry.\n\nEX-RUSSIAN SPY SERGEI SKRIPAL'S POISONING: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nCNN\u2019s report has been updated with a vague disclaimer: \u201cThis story has been updated to include additional details about the covert source.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s widely criticized report comes on the heels of MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell being forced to apologize and retract a singled-sourced, unverified report last month \u2013 which bypassed the network's standards \u2013 claiming President Trump possibly had loans co-signed by Russian oligarchs.\n\nO\u2019Donnell admitted that he aired information that \u201cwasn\u2019t ready for reporting\u201d and broke NBC News regulations in the process. The retraction and apology came after Trump's legal team sent a harshly worded letter to NBC demanding the apology and retraction for \u201cfalse and defamatory, and extremely damaging\u201d comments made by the MSNBC primetime host.\n\nWhile O\u2019Donnell admitted his gaffe, Sciutto has doubled down on his contested report. The former Obama crony even told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that the Times \u201cconfirmed\u201d his story without mentioning the contradictions that were also revealed by the paper. Sciutto did read the CIA\u2019s statement condemning his report and admitted that the White House mocked his reporting.\n\nCNN STANDS BY REPORT THAT PRESIDENT KNEW ABOUT TRUMP TOWER MEETING, AS COHEN LAWYER RECANTS\n\n\u201cDespite those statements and those denials, I spoke to five officials who served in the Trump administration, who served in the intelligence agencies, and served in positions on Capitol Hill where they had access to intelligence, and they told me the concerns in the Intel community about President Trump\u2019s handling of intelligence are broad, their consistent and their not based on just one instance,\u201d Sciutto told Cooper Monday evening on \u201cAC360.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating reporting,\u201d Cooper responded.\n\nSciutto also co-bylined another largely debunked \u201cscoop\u201d when CNN reported in 2018 that Michael Cohen had information that President Trump knew in advance about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian officials. Cohen\u2019s high-powered attorney Lanny Davis was eventually outed as the source and admitted he \u201ccould not independently confirm what happened.\u201d\n\nDaily Caller White House correspondent Amber Athey told Fox News that Sciutto \u201cperfectly demonstrates the problem with trying to turn obviously partisan government officials into objective journalists,\u201d which occurred when CNN put the Obama staffer in an anchor chair.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cSciutto blamed the spy\u2019s extraction on Trump, when really the national security issues started under his old boss \u2014 President Barack Obama. The saddest part is that Sciutto won\u2019t be held accountable for this,\u201d Athey said. \u201cHe also bungled CNN\u2019s massive Trump Tower \u2018bombshell,\u2019 and repeatedly falsely blamed Republicans for funding the dossier, yet is still out reporting on major stories for CNN. This is precisely why Americans believe the media has no credibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cSciutto blamed the spy\u2019s extraction on Trump, when really the national security issues started under his old boss \u2014 President Barack Obama.\" \u2014 Amber Athey\n\nMeanwhile, NBC News reported Monday night that a possible Russia spy was now living under apparent U.S. protection in the Washington, D.C., area \u2014 and that his life could be in danger. Sources told NBC News that the Russian was the same individual who was referenced in the reporting by CNN and the Times. An NBC News reporter went to the man\u2019s home and rang the doorbell but was met by \u201ctwo young men in an SUV\u201d that wanted to know what the reporter was doing.\n\nLast year, ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his adult daughter were critically injured after they were poisoned by a nerve agent in Salisbury, England. The U.S. announced it was imposing sanctions on Russia for using a chemical weapon in violation of international law, though the Kremlin repeatedly denied involvement.\n\nMedia watchdogs from both sides of the political spectrum have taken to Twitter to criticize CNN\u2019s report and the way it has been handled:\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re and Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.", "description": "CNN\u2019s Jim\u00a0Sciutto is under fire after the Central Intelligence Agency condemned his report Monday on an alleged spy\u2019s extraction from the Kremlin as \"misguided\" and \"simply false\" \u2013 but CNN doesn\u2019t seem to care that its report has been debunked by everyone from the CIA itself to The New York Times.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Current Cnn Employee", "Amber Athey", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
