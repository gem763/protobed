But we were winning 4-0, so we let our football do the talking. We scored a couple more. That was our answer to to the monkey chants and Nazi salutes: take the three points, and leave the stunning moment that could redefine football\u2019s relationship with racism for another team, another time.\u201d", "description": "John Barnes insists England\u00a0players should have walked off the pitch after suffering racist abuse in their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria.\u00a0 The Three Lions ran out 6-0 winners in Sofia, but the game was marred with The FA confirming their players had suffered \u201cabhorrent racist chanting\u201d.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/21/13/gettyimages-818487596.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
