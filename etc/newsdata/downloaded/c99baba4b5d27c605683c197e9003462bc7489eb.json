Both countries rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full.\n\nIndia's crackdown as it revoked Kashmir's special status was accompanied by severe restrictions on movement, as well as disconnection of telephone services. Though New Delhi has eased some of the movement curbs, no prominent detainees have been freed and mobile and internet connections remain suspended.\n\nWhile warning of the consequences of lifting what he described as an \"inhuman curfew,\" Pakistani premier Khan demanded India do so and free all detainees.\n\nIn some areas in Kashmir -- including the Soura region near Srinagar which has witnessed protests in the past against India's decision -- people clashed with security forces by pelting stones on Friday night, forcing police to use tear gas to disperse them, said the Indian official.\n\nKhan addressed the United Nations a day after the senior U.S. diplomat for South Asia called for a lowering of rhetoric between India and Pakistan, while saying that Washington hoped to see rapid action by India to lift restrictions it has imposed in Kashmir and the release of detainees there.", "description": "Police impose restrictions in Indian Kashmir after Pakistan PM's speech", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8R064_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
