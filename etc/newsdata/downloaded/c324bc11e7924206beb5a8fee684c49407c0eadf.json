From that point, he said nobody is going to be able to do this to me again.\n\n\u2018He worked so hard. It felt like everything had been building to that moment when he scored. It was unbelievable. Even now, I\u2019m getting a bit emotional talking about it.\u2019\n\nAs Sean\u2019s voice wavers, Matty takes over. Mum Michelle was right when she told Sportsmail last week, \u2018They\u2019ve always had each other\u2019s back\u2019.\n\n\u2019They pulled me in here and said, \u201cLook, thanks for coming, but we\u2019re not going to keep you\u201d,\u2019 Matty recalls.\n\nThat is what happens when a teenager scores the winning goal against Manchester United\n\n\u2018I walked out crying. When you look back, it probably fired me up to get to where I am. It really p***ed me off. What I\u2019ve done since then, it all comes from that moment.\n\n\u2018Sean was still in the academy and I\u2019d be here almost every night when he was training. I would have my little ball on the touchline and used to think, \u201cI wish I was playing for Newcastle\u201d.\n\n\u2018Aged 13 I was back. I had more fire in my belly, I didn\u2019t want to be rejected ever again.\u2019\n\nThe goal. It was nil-nil after 72 minutes when the ball rolled into Matty\u2019s path, 25 yards out at the Gallowgate End.\n\n\u2018I shouted to him, \u201cJust hit it!\u201d,\u2019 says Sean. Hit it he did, beyond David de Gea and into the bottom corner. Cue pandemonium.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had that feeling before, but for him to do that on his debut against Manchester United, the emotion was crazy. I actually froze for a second. I didn\u2019t know what do, I didn\u2019t know whether to just fall down on my knees!\n\nIt was nil-nil after 72 minutes when the ball rolled into Matty\u2019s path (left), 25 yards out\n\n\u2018I filled up, I thought I was going to cry - and you can\u2019t do that in the middle of the pitch! I had to jump on someone and hide. It was pure happiness.\u2019\n\nWhat was it like for the scorer?\n\n\u2018From the moment I struck it, I can\u2019t remember much. It was the loudest roar I\u2019ve ever heard from the Gallowgate. And then they\u2019re singing your name, you just think, \u201cThis is absolutely mental\u201d.\u2019\n\nCall it innocence - or perhaps more human decency - but there is genuine appreciation and wonderment between the brothers at where they now find themselves, especially given that one year ago they were playing together in the Checkatrade Trophy at Grimsby in front of 500 fans.\n\nMatty tells one story that captures their boyish charm.\n\n\u2018This might sound dead stupid, but the thing that calmed my nerves down was when I walked out with the mascot and started playing passes with him!\n\n\u2018I was thinking, \u201cJust concentrate on the pass, get some good touches in here\u201d. You\u2019re like, \u201cI know it\u2019s just a little kid, but I might as well make my passes pretty good\u201d.\u2019\n\nMatty Longstaff, Sean Longstaff and Milly Longstaff pictured with their grandad\n\nHe needn\u2019t have worried. His first pass was 40 yards and cross-field, straight to a team-mate. It set the tone for a man-of-the-match display, merited regardless of the Roy of the Rovers storyline that would emerge.\n\nAfterwards, the brothers gave a joyous television interview which Gary Neville said should be shown to all young players.\n\n\u2018I got man-of-the-match, but I thought Sean was the best player by a mile, so I've still got a bit of catching up to do,\u2019 says Matty. \u2018A couple of times when I went a bit headless chicken he was there to cover.\u2019\n\nHis brother disagrees: \u2018I couldn't have done that at 19. He's controlled the tempo of a Premier League game on his debut. He\u2019s miles ahead of where I was at his age.\n\n\u2018It fills you with pride. I remember thinking in the tunnel, \u201cThis is the best seat in the house, getting to watch Matty walk out for the first time at St James\u2019 Park, as a brother and team-mate\u201d.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019d told us a year ago this was going to happen, we both would have laughed. It\u2019s crazy.\u2019\n\nOne year ago they played together in the Checkatrade Trophy at Grimsby in front of 500 fans\n\nIn the hours after Manchester United, Newcastle fans asked on social media if there were any more Longstaff brothers.\n\nOne former Newcastle team-mate, Cal Roberts, tweeted: \u2018Shelly and Davey have some DNA mind!\u2019.\n\nShelly is mum Michelle, a fine netball player. Davey, meanwhile, is dad David, the first ice hockey player to win 100 caps for Great Britain. There is also sister Milly, 15, a rising county-level netball star.\n\nWhat does she think of her brothers\u2019 success?\n\n\u2018She probably gets a bit annoyed in school when people are talking about us,\u2019 says Matty. \u2018The worst thing is, she\u2019s probably the best sporting one in the family, she\u2019s just a lot lazier, she doesn\u2019t like to run around as much as we do!\u2019\n\nThe love for their sister is clear. \u2018Milly is great,\u2019 says Sean. \u2018She has been dragged to football ever since she was three.\n\nMatty's first pass was 40 yards and cross-field, straight to a team-mate against the Red Devils\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s funny, you look at the Neville family - the brothers played in the Premier League and their sister played netball for England. So we\u2019ve said to Milly, \u201cWe\u2019ve done our little bit, it\u2019s up to you now!\u201d. She\u2019s amazing, though, we can\u2019t thank her enough for the sacrifices she\u2019s made.\u2019\n\nThe Longstaffs were fortunate that their corner house had a garden wrapped around it, be that for football, netball or cricket. The brothers, it is said, could have made it as professional cricketers.\n\n\u2018I used to spend hours bowling at Matty and could never get him out,\u2019 says Sean. \u2018There was a time when he gave up football to see if he could make it at cricket. My dad had to have a little word\u2026\u2019\n\nMatty laughs. \u2018People were telling me I could go to the very top. I told my dad I might concentrate on cricket and he gave me a clip round the ear!\u2019\n\nIt set the tone for a man-of-the-match display, merited regardless of the Roy of the Rovers line\n\nAs recently as two years ago Durham wanted to take Sean on trial.\n\n\u2018It was finals day at Tynemouth Cricket Club and some of the Durham coaches were asking about me,\u2019 he says. \u2018The guys from Tynemouth just laughed, \u201cIf you can persuade him to leave Newcastle and play cricket, then best of luck to you!\u201d.\u2019\n\nMichelle says her sons \u2018genuinely love each other\u2019 - they blush, yet accept the suggestion - but there were fights, too, indicative of their competitive spirit.\n\nSean says: \u2019My mam had to go into Newcastle and the coaches had a word with us, \u201cYou need to behave at home and stop fighting!\u201d.\n\n\u2018We realised we had to help each other more than fight each other. There\u2019s not loads of people you can trust in life. Now, I know my brother will have my back, every step of the way.\u2019", "description": "INTERVIEW BY CRAIG HOPE: It was in this very room at Newcastle United's training ground eight years ago, that an academy coach told Matty Longstaff he was not good enough.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19855676-0-image-a-13_1571343126264.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
