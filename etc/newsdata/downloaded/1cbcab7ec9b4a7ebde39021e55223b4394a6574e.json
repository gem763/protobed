(Dave McIntyre)\n\nWine can be vexing to describe. \u201cHow do you taste all those flavors in a wine?\u201d is a question readers often ask me. My usual advice is to pay attention, not just to what\u2019s in your glass, but also to your environment. \u201cSmell everything, taste with discretion,\u201d is my mantra. Your wine may smell like a garden or a locker room. (Just to be clear, a garden in your glass is good. A locker room, not so much.)\n\nBut not all wine terms relate to flavors. Some describe the texture of wine. These are arguably the most important, because we may each perceive different flavors in a wine, but the textural characteristics are more universal.\n\nHere are common wine tasting terms, including some I use regularly to describe the flavors and textures of wine, with brief explanations that can help you interpret tasting notes or those wine-geek conversations at dinner parties.\n\nBalance is the harmony among acidity, tannins, fruit, oak and other characteristics of wine on your palate, even though you may notice each of these attributes. It\u2019s the Goldilocks of wine \u2014 not too tart, not too sweet, not too oaky, but just right.\n\nBody is the impression of weight on your palate as you hold the wine in your mouth. Light, medium and full are the usual descriptors; none is inherently better than the other. Body is similar to structure. A wine without good body or structure is often described as flabby, indicating a lack of acidity.\n\nA full-bodied wine may be described as \u201cchewy,\u201d which seems nonsensical for a liquid. When I see this word, I suspect the wine might be slightly out of balance, a bit rugged and harsh on the palate.\n\nA wine is said to be earthy if its flavors suggest soil, decaying leaves or \u201cforest floor,\u201d rocks, even mushrooms. \u201cBarnyard\u201d may be earthy or animal \u2014 it\u2019s usually considered not a good flavor.\n\nExtraction is the process of steeping a wine, like tea, leaving the juice on the skins for an \u201cextended maceration\u201d or a \u201ccold soak\u201d before fermentation. The idea is to extract maximum color and tannin from the skins before pressing them off the juice, making a bigger, more powerful red wine. These \u201chighly extracted\u201d wines will stain your teeth, your tongue and your shirts a deep purple. This technique can be overdone, resulting in a wine that tastes contrived and manipulated. It has also fallen out of favor among those who favor lighter wines with elegance rather than power.\n\nFinish refers to the aftertaste; the longer it lasts the better. Unless, of course, the finish tastes like a locker room.\n\nHerbaceous is usually considered a negative, but I don\u2019t always agree. Scents and flavors of herbs, especially sage, thyme and rosemary, are common attributes of red wines from southern France, often described as \u201cgarrigue.\u201d However, if a wine tastes \u201cgreen\u201d it signifies underripe grapes. A green wine is usually thin and astringent.\n\nLegs refer to the rivulets that flow down the side of your glass after you stop swirling the wine. To say a wine \u201chas good legs\u201d sounds sexist, so we tend to say a wine has tears, like Pagliacci. (Italian opera clowns, we mean no offense.) Tears indicate full body, and maybe high alcohol.\n\nNose can be a noun or a verb, synonymous with smell. You \u201cnose\u201d a wine by sticking your nose in the glass and taking a sniffy sniff. A wine has a good nose if it smells nice. To elevate the pretentiousness of \u201cnosing\u201d your wine, raise your eyebrows and your pinkie finger.\n\nRipeness is another reference to how the wine tastes. If someone describes the wine as \u201coverripe,\u201d it suggests raisins, prunes or other dried fruits. This can be fine in dessert wines such as Port. In other wines, it may indicate a \u201chot vintage,\u201d or grapes that were left hanging extra long on the vine, allowing more sugar to accumulate. Long \u201chang time\u201d was popular about a decade ago, but many growers now are picking earlier to make more elegant, refreshing wines.\n\nOther commonly used wine vocab. A \u201cracy\u201d wine has notable acidity; it is refreshing and palate cleansing, usually leaving you craving another sip.\n\nSome wine writers rebel against the word \u201csavory\u201d to describe a wine, but I like it. It\u2019s a good contrast to \u201csweet.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201csweet\u201d may be the most misunderstood and abused word in the wine lexicon. Consumers often tell retailers they don\u2019t want a sweet wine, because sweet is the opposite of dry, and we are somehow told that dry is the ideal. But wine is made from fruit, and ripe fruit tastes sweet. Ripe flavors are not bad in wine. A truly sweet wine has considerable residual sugar \u2014 sugar leftover after fermentation \u2014 and can be wonderful for dessert and with cheese. A \u201csemi-dry\u201d or \u201coff-dry\u201d wine can be beautifully balanced (sugar and acidity) to match robust and spicy foods. And let\u2019s face it \u2014 we Americans have a sweet tooth. We should get over our fear of \u201csweet\u201d wines.\n\nWith these words in your vocabulary, you can decipher tasting notes to find wines you might like to try. And you can describe ones you like to retailers, to help you find new gems.", "description": "You won\u2019t sound like a pretentious wine snob, we promise.", "authors": ["Dave Mcintyre", "September At Pm", "Dave Mcintyre Writes About Wine Weekly.
