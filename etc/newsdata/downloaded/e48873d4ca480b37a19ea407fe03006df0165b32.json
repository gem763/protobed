But everyone would know that the true reason is my identity, Joshua Wong.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s protests, which started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have evolved into calls for greater democracy. They have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades, taking a heavy toll on the economy and showing little sign of letting up.\n\nThey have also posed the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nWong said he was the only person disqualified out of more than 1,100 candidates in district council elections set for Nov. 24.\n\nSuch votes have previously attracted little fanfare and been dominated by pro-Beijing candidates. But a summer of unrest has infused a new significance in the poll and prompted a record number of candidates and voters to register.\n\n\u201cIt is questionable whether Mr Wong accepts the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s sovereignty over (Hong Kong) and whether he is of the view that independence and referendum would be options for Hong Kong,\u201d the returning officer for Wong\u2019s district, Laura Aron, said in a statement seen by Reuters.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government separately said one candidate was deemed invalid for contravening electoral laws that bar \u201cadvocating or promoting \u2018self-determination\u2019\u201d. It did not identify Wong by name.\n\nWong has said he supports the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong\u2019s future but that he is against independence, according to a post on his Facebook page on Saturday.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s ruling party said on Tuesday that it \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d the decision to disqualify Wong and urged Hong Kong to offer \u201creal universal suffrage\u201d.\n\nTaiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has been a vocal supporter of democracy in Hong Kong, a stance seen as bolstering her domestic support ahead of elections in January where she has taken the lead.\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan is claimed by China as its own territory. Beijing has proposed to rule Taiwan under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula similar to Hong Kong, guaranteeing certain freedoms.\n\nIn Washington, Democratic U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the action against Wong \u201canother blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong poses during an interview at the Reuters New York office in New York City, U.S., September 14, 2019. REUTERS/JEENAH MOON/File Photo\n\n\u201cThe people of #HongKong should be able to choose their elected officials,\u201d said Pelosi, who this month backed House legislation that would tighten U.S. scrutiny of Chinese rule in Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u2018VERY GRIM\u2019\n\nWong\u2019s disqualification followed another weekend of protests that descended into chaotic clashes with police.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nEmbattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she expected the Asian financial hub to record negative economic growth this year, in part as a result of the unrest.\n\n\u201cOur current assessment is that the full year of 2019 will likely show negative growth, which means we won\u2019t be able to achieve the already revised down positive growth of 0-1%,\u201d Lam said. \u201cThe situation is very grim\u201d.\n\nWith visitors deterred by months of violence, many small firms across the city have already closed or are struggling to turn a profit.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nLam\u2019s gloomy forecast came two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had slipped into a technical recession - meaning two successive quarters of contraction. That is expected to be confirmed by third-quarter GDP data on Thursday.\n\nBeijing-backed Lam said the government would unveil measures to boost the economy once the unrest died down, without giving details.\n\nLam\u2019s popularity is the lowest since she took office, and lower than any other chief executive in history, a poll released on Tuesday by Hong Kong Public Opinion Program showed. The telephone poll covered 1,038 residents in mid-October.", "description": "Hong Kong authorities disqualified prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Tuesday from standing in upcoming district elections, a move likely to sow discord among anti-government demonstrators as an illegal Halloween march looms.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446084104&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0BF", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
