The company\u2019s geographic and brand diversity, strong online growth, and position in the U.S. mean the stock could continue to rise.\n\nAfter peaking at 1,132 pence in August last year, shares dropped 50% over a year due to United Kingdom regulatory pressures and management selling off shares. Since reaching lows of 566 pence this past August, the stock has climbed 50%, to 849 pence, in two months.\n\nBroker Berenberg has a Buy rating and, in a note earlier this month, marked it at a 30% premium of 1,100 pence. Jefferies also has a target price of 1,100 pence, while JPMorgan Cazenove says shares could reach 1,040 pence. GVC trades at 11.4 times future earnings estimates, a 30% discount to its peers.\n\nThe company has a market value of 4.9 billion pounds sterling and reported half-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of \u00a3323.4 million. Earlier this month, the company raised its full-year Ebitda guidance for 2019 to \u00a3670 million to \u00a3680 million, from a previous \u00a3650 million to \u00a3670 million. Online revenue grew 12% in the third quarter, with sports revenue up 16%.\n\nThe company was founded in 2004 in Luxembourg as online casino operator Gaming VC Holdings. GVC has expanded through acquisitions including Bwin Party Digital Entertainment, Ladbrokes Coral, and part of SportingBet. The company now accepts bets in 21 languages and 19 currencies, employing 25,000 people with offices across five continents and thousands of betting shops.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court relaxed a federal law banning sports betting in May 2018, U.K. gambling firms have rushed to capitalize on the market. Sports betting is now legal in 11 U.S. states, with others at various stages of legislation. Flutter Entertainment (FLTR.UK) formerly Paddy Power Betfair, has acquired fantasy sports provider FanDuel and more recently agreed to merge with Sky Bet owner The Stars Group. William Hill (WMH.UK) partnered with casino operator Eldorado Resorts, which has taken over Caesars Entertainment.\n\nGVC signed a $200 million joint venture with MGM Resorts International (MGM) in July 2018, and the BetMGM app was launched in New Jersey in September of this year. While it remains to be seen who will grab the largest market share, the GVC-MGM tie-up has a strong brand, large customer base, and good track record of execution.\n\nTighter U.K. regulation lowered the maximum wager on fixed-odds betting terminals to \u00a32 from \u00a3100, reducing revenue. GVC closed 41 shops in the third quarter and will shut as many as 900 over the next two years. The company, however, has performed better than expected, and further delays to potential legislation in Germany will help retail sales in the coming months.\n\nGVC leads in the online sector. Berenberg analyst Stuart Gordon, who has a target price of 1,100 pence on the stock, said the quarterly results \u201creinforce our view that [GVC] is the name to own in the sector.\u201d JPMorgan Cazenove said that the online brands were \u201cbest in class,\u201d while Deutsche Bank Research said GVC is the \u201cstandout value play\u2019\u2019 in online gaming.\n\nGVC CEO Kenneth Alexander said in a third-quarter earnings statement that \u201conline momentum remains strong across all major territories.\u201d", "description": "Acquisitions have helped GVC become one of the largest sports betting and gaming companies.
