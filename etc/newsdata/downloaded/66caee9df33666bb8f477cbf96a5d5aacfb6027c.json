Jean-Claude Juncker opposes an extension. A constitutional challenge to the deal is underway.\n\nJuncker Does Not Back an Extension European Commission President and the EU have reached a deal. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker opposes and extension. That is not his call but it is what I expected... In the video, Juncker says he is happy for a deal but sad to see the UK go. Reasonable Deal Boris deal sounds better than the WA. End free movement, end ECJ supremacy over UK law, backstop ditched, & can do free trade agreements. I want to read the detail before making up my mind. But well done Boris for getting this far & doing what others said was impossible \u2014 Andrea Jenkyns MP (@andreajenkyns) October 17, 2019\n\nThose who say this is May's deal warmed over are simply wrong.\n\nConstitutional Challenge and Other Details\n\nThe Guardian Live Blog discusses a constitutional challenge, DUP opposition, and other details.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker has tried to help sell the new Brexit deal in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party by pouring doubt on a further Brexit extension in the event of it being rejected. Juncker said he was \u201cruling out\u201d a prolongation, although the issue is solely the remit of the heads of state and government. \u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation,\u201d he added.\n\nConstitutional Challenge\n\nCampaigning anti-Brexit QC Jolyon Maugham has now lodged his petition at the court of session in Edinburgh, which essentially tries to ban parliament from debating the new Brexit deal, on the basis that it is illegal, and which he anticipates will be heard tomorrow. Maugham believes that the deal contravenes s55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, which states that it is \u201cunlawful for Her Majesty\u2019s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain\u201d. With the detail of Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal still emerging, lawyers insist that s55 is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d and that any form of differentiated deal for Northern Ireland will contravene it. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing in the court of session at noon on Monday 21 October, where he could issue court orders forcing Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension to article 50 until 31 January as per the Benn Act.\n\nBoost to Johnson\n\nFolks point out that decision on Brexit extension not down to @JunckerEU but a EU council decision. True....but I think he knew exactly what he was saying and its a big help for Team Johnson. \u2014 norman smith (@BBCNormanS) October 17, 2019\n\nJohnson Likely Has the Votes\n\nI suspect @BorisJohnson and his team think they have the numbers to pass the deal without the DUP - but even if they don\u2019t, they get to run a populist election campaign, which should be enough. But it\u2019s so volatile a change of just a few points could be disastrous. \u2014 Craig Oliver (@CraigOliver100) October 17, 2019\n\nSir Oliver Letwin will back deal\n\nSir Oliver Letwin, who had the Conservative whip withdrawn over his rebellion on a no-deal Brexit vote, has said he will back the Prime Minister's deal on Saturday, calling it \"admirable.\"\n\nNo Deal Says DUP\n\nThese arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland. This drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement. For all of these reasons it is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long-term interests. Saturday\u2019s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons.\n\nAnother Referendum?\n\nI think it is unlikely, but how would it turn out?\n\nEurointellience frames it this way:\n\nfor those who are still holding out for a second referendum, and who believe that it could easily be won: the problem with most of the polls is that they confound a person\u2019s position on Brexit - Remain vs Leave - with how they would vote in a second referendum. We know a lot of Remainers who believe that the first referendum results needs to be respected, and who would vote no in a second referendum. A ComRes poll for Channel 5 news produced a more granular survey, and came up with a 50-42 split in favour Leave under a concrete 2nd referendum setting. When they asked the question whether the 2016 referendum results should be honoured, the response was 54% in favour, and 32% against. It is one poll only - and the numbers are probably going to swing backwards and forwards. But we should be under no illusion that public opinion on Brexit has shifted since the referendum. We see no signs of that.\n\nAll's Well That Ends Well\n\nAs the EU summit got underway, Boris Johnson went around the table greeting each leader in turn. He laughed and joked with Merkel and Macron, and hugged Luxembourg's Xavier Bettel, who had made fun of Johnson for not attending a news conference. All's well that ends well? #Brexit \u2014 Luke Baker (@BakerLuke) October 17, 2019\n\nExcept nothing has ended.\n\nI suspect all the MPs who lost Tory party membership will regain the whip (membership) if they vote for the deal. That makes passage more likely, but not guaranteed.\n\nThere are about 22 Labour MPs who want Brexit and that would likely be enough to offset the 9 DUP votes. This is my guess, Eurointelliugence thinks passage falls short.\n\nIf it does pass, legal challenges loom. And Benn is likely to modify the legislation requiring Johnson to seek an extension if it doesn't pass.\n\nFinal Irony Coming Up?\n\nOne possibility is that if the legal challenge wins, a hard Brexit might happen, which Johnson could blame on Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Remainers.", "description": "A deal has been reached.
