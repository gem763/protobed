Anyone?\u201d\n\nSpoiler alert: No one did.\n\nAs Stone was being driven away from the Mexican resort where the show is filmed, he tried to minimize any distress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, actually. I think I made the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018Paradise.\u2019 You can\u2019t assume it\u2019s going to work out. I shot my shot, man.\u201d\n\nStone sought comfort in Twitter after the show to make light of the rebuff.\n\nYou can see the complete segment above.\n\nGot a rose laying around if anyone wants it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Luke Stone (@LukeStoneDC) September 11, 2019", "description": "The bachelor earned a dubious distinction during the reality TV show's climactic rose ceremony.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d79139d2300001005512d0d.png?cache=2aobapkt6e&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
