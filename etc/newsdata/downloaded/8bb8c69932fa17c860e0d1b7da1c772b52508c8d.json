Some of the ads falsely suggest that Democrats are purging voter rolls; others direct viewers to some version of a voter-registration form, but only after they submit information, such as their names, email addresses and political affiliations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResponding to an inquiry from The Post, Facebook said this weekend that it was removing four of the voting-related ads for violating its policies. A spokesperson for the tech giant said it would send other ads purchased by another pro-Trump group, Great America PAC, to third-party fact-checkers to verify their assertions about states purging voter rolls.\n\nPolitical campaigns have long seized on scare tactics to galvanize voters, bombarding them with direct mail or radio and television advertisements in a bid to get them to register, volunteer and cast ballots on Election Day. What makes Facebook different, experts say, are the tech giant\u2019s powerful tools for finding, targeting and engaging narrow communities. At times that capability has come with great controversy \u2014 such as the massive privacy breach linked to Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy co-founded by onetime Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, that resulted in a record fine for Facebook.\n\nThe power and reach of political ads on Facebook came into sharp relief earlier this month, after former vice president Joe Biden asked the tech company to remove ads from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign because they contained falsehoods about Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine. Facebook declined, citing a policy that essentially allows politicians to lie, which Democrats deride as a form of misinformation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, though, Facebook has shown it\u2019s willing to challenge political ads when they\u2019re purchased by entities other than campaigns, including super PACs. As a result, critics contend the voting ads run by Trump\u2019s surrogates toe the line on what\u2019s appropriate and what should be allowed on Facebook in the first place.\n\nYoung Mie Kim, a professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the paid posts were the \u201cbest examples\u201d she has seen of ads that \u201cbypass transparency measures by appearing as a public education type of message when in fact the main purpose seems to be data collection.\u201d\n\nKim called the tactic \u201cdata-bait\u201d \u2014 harvesting valuable information about a key demographic using \u201ceye-catching, fearmongering content.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLeaders of the two super PACs defended the ads as serving the joint aims of registering Trump-friendly Americans and garnering their contact information to communicate with them and mobilize them to defend the president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Committee\u2019s primary goal is to help President Trump get reelected, and voter registration is the key,\u201d said Ted Harvey, chairman of The Committee to Defend the President. The ads, he said, were part of the \u201cGreat America Voter Drive\u201d launched earlier this year \u2014 an effort that aims to \u201cmobilize a conservative army on behalf of President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe super PAC\u2019s data scientists decided on a targeting strategy, such as the Arizona-specific message, based on public records and \u201cproprietary data modeling,\u201d Harvey added. Facebook users who clicked the ad and submitted their emails, he said, are added to the group\u2019s distribution list, so they can remain \u201cengaged leading up to the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut material implying that an advertiser has specific information about a user is a violation of Facebook\u2019s policy against content that \u201casserts or implies personal attributes,\u201d including race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation and criminal record, among other details.\n\nAD\n\nAsked Sunday about Facebook\u2019s decision to remove the ads, Harvey suggested the move amounted to voter suppression. \u201cOur ads have been running on Facebook for weeks now, and we\u2019d be surprised and disappointed if Facebook suddenly decided to engage in blatant voter suppression,\u201d he said.\n\nVoting, in particular, is a sensitive issue on Facebook. The company has sought to crack down on posts, photos and videos that seek to suppress voting, a tactic that Russian agents deployed in 2016 to dissuade black voters from going to the polls, according to congressional investigators. Facebook has banned some content designed to deliberately confuse voters, including posts and ads that indicate the wrong date of an election.\n\nAD\n\nBut critics, including civil rights groups, say the tech giant has taken a too-narrow view of voter suppression. In the case of the pro-Trump super PAC, the ads aimed to bring certain people to the polls \u2014 using misinformation about voter suppression \u2014 potentially putting them outside the bounds of Facebook\u2019s policies.\n\nAD\n\nEric L. Beach, a Republican strategist and co-chair of the Great America PAC, said the messaging was part of the group\u2019s strategy, honed since the 2016 campaign, of mobilizing \u201clow-propensity voters.\u201d The committee has been able to capture 30 million pieces of data from such voters, according to Beach, who called the targeting effort a \u201cgreat niche for us to keep focusing on.\u201d\n\nBut data collection stands at the center of the president\u2019s reelection effort, which is mobilizing to be able to email or text anyone the campaign has identified as a supporter. The campaign\u2019s digital director, Gary Coby, is also the CEO of Opn Sesame, a platform for peer-to-peer texting, which some digital strategists believe could play a commanding role in the lead-up to next November.\n\nAD\n\nRecently, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, has been touting his team\u2019s success in amassing voter information at Trump rallies around the country. On Twitter, he called a September rally in New Mexico a \u201cdata gold mine,\u201d claiming the campaign was able to match 78 percent of the 45,000 people who registered for tickets to its voter file. Thirty-one percent of those people were Democrats, he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, Parscale told Frontline that Facebook\u2019s ad transparency tools were \u201ckind of like a gift,\u201d enhancing the reach of Trump\u2019s views.\n\nA key question is whether that data can be leveraged to reach new voters. Trump\u2019s 2016 victory was sealed by a combined margin of just 78,000 votes in three states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 making the work of finding new people to cast ballots for Trump, rather than simply motivating his supporters to turn out a second time, critical to his reelection chances.\n\nAD\n\nWhile super PACs are barred from giving the data they garner to a campaign, the law permits them to sell such information to a campaign for a \u201cusual and normal charge.\u201d\n\nPrivacy advocates criticized the ads, some of which ask, \u201cAre you a victim of voter fraud?\u201d and then send users to sites that collect their data.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a technique that\u2019s used by spammers and crooks,\u201d said Bob Gellman, a privacy and information policy consultant.\n\nThe Committee to Defend the President stipulates that it may \u201cautomatically collect\u201d technical information \u2014 such as an IP address, browser type, operating system and time zone \u2014 from those who visit the site.\n\nGellman said the policy \u2014 \u201creserving to themselves virtually unlimited ability to use whatever data they can get from you,\u201d as he put it \u2014 was fairly standard. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good,\u201d he added.\n\nAD", "description": "\"Official records show that your voter registration is incomplete,\" began one ad from a pro-Trump super PAC that Facebook later removed. \"Follow the link below to complete your voter registration NOW!\"", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GgZ6WsR_Dz1lKsgM1BxyOkvGEG4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G25FYYHO2II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
