Joonis Korpisalo turned away 30 shots to net his third win.\n\nBen Bishop made 32 saves for Dallas, who have lost four straight.\n\nZach Werenski got the scoring started at 7:42 of the first, while Wennberg made it 2-0 at 15:01.\n\nMiro Heiskanen cut the lead to 2-1, scoring his second goal of the year for the Stars on a delayed penalty.\n\nMilano gave Columbus insurance at 9:07 of the third with a highlight-reel goal, skating between two defenders and shooting from between his legs to go top shelf over Bishop. Jakob Lilja recorded his first NHL point with the primary assist.\n\n\u201cIt was the best angle to get on net, and it went in,\u201d Milano said. \u201cI was thinking maybe to backhand it, but it went through the legs.\u201d\n\nColumbus coach John Tortorella called the goal \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made a great move to enter the zone, beats a forward at the blue line and there were still two checkers coming on him,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a goal.\u201d\n\nJoe Pavelski scored with 4.5 seconds remaining, but it was too little too late.\n\nThe Stars, who have been hindered by poor starts, came out strong, outshooting the Blue Jackets 17-11 in the first. Columbus had a 9-6 shot advantage through a scoreless second period and continued to dominate in the third.\n\n\u201cI thought we had an excellent first period,\u201d Dallas coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cI thought we were skating. I didn\u2019t love our puck management in the second. I thought in the third we were working, trying to tie it up. We gave up too many odd-man rushes. We didn\u2019t do it together enough. There were a lot of positives to build off of.\u201d\n\nBishop agreed.\n\n\u201cAs frustrated as we are, there is still 90% of the season left,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThere is still time to fix this ship, but it needs to be more urgency from everybody. We have to find.a way to get the W. No matter what it is.\u201d\n\nNOTES:\n\nForward Corey Perry returned to the Stars after recovering from a broken foot. \u2026 Werenski\u2019s 40 career goals put him one away from tying Rostislav Klesla for the all-time Columbus record among defensemen. \u2026 Longtime Blue Jackets announce Bill Davidge took a break from his Florida retirement to watch his old club, this time from the stands.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nStars: visit Pittsburgh on Friday.\n\nBlue Jackets: visit Chicago on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Columbus Blue Jackets knew to be successful this season they needed scoring production from their younger players and strong goaltending.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nicole Kraft"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/stars_blue_jackets_hockey_84371_c0-150-3600-2250_s1200x700.jpg?187bc123cc4510feb7f1966081317bdd024739c4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
