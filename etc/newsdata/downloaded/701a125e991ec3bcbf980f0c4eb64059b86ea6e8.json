He was not arrested. Inquiries are ongoing'.\n\nUnder caution means the interview was recorded and can be used in future prosecutions. British police don't identify suspects until they have been charged.\n\nThe slew of accusations against Spacey led to his firing from 'House of Cards' and his removal from the completed movie 'All the Money in the World,' which was reshot with actor Christopher Plummer.", "description": "The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said on Tuesday they were rejecting a sexual battery case against Kevin Spacey because the accuser has died.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20343330-0-FILE_In_this_June_11_2017_file_photo_Kevin_Spacey_arrives_at_the-a-48_1572380819326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
