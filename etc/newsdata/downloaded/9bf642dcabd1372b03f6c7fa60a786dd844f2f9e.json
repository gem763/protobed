President Donald Trump is currently at about 0.40 to be re-elected\u2026 Under normal assumptions about the uncertainty of future economic growth, the markets rate Trump\u2019s chances of winning at 40%. \u2026it is a useful corrective to the argument that Trump is toast \u2014 or, alternatively, that he is a shoo-in. The market incorporates the relevant uncertainties in both directions. (Interestingly, Trump\u2019s re-election odds have stayed pretty steady over the last week or so of negative news.) In many cases, prediction markets\u2026\u201csee through\u201d the day-to-day volatility that may buffet the polls but not affect the final outcome. \u2026Prediction markets\u2026also made me think that a possible Hillary Clinton candidacy\u2026is perhaps an undercovered story. \u2026It is not a valid criticism of prediction markets to say that they didn\u2019t predict Trump, say, or Brexit. The purpose of prediction markets is not to foresee particular upsets. They can, however, tell you in advance what would be an upset \u2014 much like probability theory can tell you that getting three heads in a row is unlikely but is of no help in predicting exactly when it will happen.\n\nThere are also people who build models that predict elections based largely on economic factors.\n\nThe Washington Post just published a very interesting review of how three of these models show Trump comfortably winning.\n\nPresident Trump is on a fast track to an easy reelection. That\u2019s the conclusion reached by economic forecasters\u2026 Moody\u2019s Analytics projects the president will win handily next year if the economy doesn\u2019t badly stumble \u2014 and in fact, rack up a greater margin in the electoral college than the 304-to-227 victory he secured against Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u2026The finding jibes with those of other forecasting models that rely on measures of the economy\u2019s strength to predict which major party\u2019s candidate will win the White House next. Oxford Economics sees Trump winning 55 percent of the popular vote next year barring a \u201csignificant downturn\u201d in the economy. \u2026by the reckoning of the firm\u2019s model, three key economic indicators \u2014 unemployment, inflation and real disposable income growth \u2014 all favor Trump\u2019s reelection. They outweigh a \u201cnegative exhaustion factor\u201d with Trump that dents his support in the projection. \u2026Another model, assembled by Trend Macrolytics, accurately predicts every presidential victor back to 1952 by focusing on the effects of the economy and incumbency on the electoral college, according to Donald Luskin, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer. It projects Trump will win reelection next year with 354 electoral votes \u2014 a margin that seems staggering on its face.\n\nHere\u2019s the Moody\u2019s electoral map, which doubtlessly will cause sleepless nights for the anti-Trump crowd.\n\nWow, not only do they show Trump winning every state he won in 2016, but they show him picking up New Hampshire, Virginia, and Minnesota.\n\nSo which approach is more accurate, betting markets of election models?\n\nGiven my inaccurate 2016 predictions, I\u2019m probably not the right person to ask.\n\nI\u2019ll simply observe that both approaches have erred in the past.\n\nAnd if you believe in guilt by association, some of the people who put together political prediction models also put together deeply flawed Keynesian economic models.", "description": "There\u2019s an entire field of economics called \u201cpublic choice\u201d that .10/21/2019 10:52:14AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
