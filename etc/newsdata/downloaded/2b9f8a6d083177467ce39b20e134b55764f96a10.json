He also co-wrote the script of the critically-acclaimed 1987 film \u201cWings of Desire\u201d.\n\nThe author of books such as \u201cThe Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick\u201d and \u201cSlow Homecoming\u201d, he attracted widespread criticism after he attended the funeral of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in 2006.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed in Kosovo and almost 1 million were put to flight during a brutal war waged by forces under Milosevic in 1998-99.\n\nKosovo\u2019s ambassador to Washington reacted angrily to Handke\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cHave we become so numb to racism, so emotionally desensitized to violence, so comfortable with appeasement that we can overlook one\u2019s subscription&service to the twisted agenda of a genocidal maniac?,\u201d Vlora Citaku wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe must not support or normalize those who spew hatred. We can do better!#Nobel.\u201d\n\nAlbania\u2019s acting Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj called the award ignoble and shameful on Twitter.\n\nA combination of file photos shows Polish author Olga Tokarczuk attending a news conference to promote the movie 'Spoor' at the 67th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin, Germany, February 12, 2017 (L), and Austrian author and director Peter Handke receiving an art and culture award on occasion of his 70th birthday marked today in Salzburg, December 6, 2012. REUTERS/Michele Tantussi/Dominic Ebenbichler\n\nHandke, visibly moved, said he was surprised to be awarded the prize.\n\n\u201cI was astonished, yes. It was very courageous by the Swedish Academy, this kind of decision,\u201d he told reporters at his home in the small town of Chaville outside Paris. \u201cThese are good people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel a strange kind of freedom, I don\u2019t know, a freedom, which is not the truth, as if I were innocent,\u201d he said.\n\nHandke appeared to have given up the idea of winning the world\u2019s top literary prize. He told the New York Times in 2006 he no longer cared and added: \u201cNow I think it\u2019s finished for me after my expressions about Yugoslavia.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, he told Austrian daily Die Presse that \u201cthe Nobel Prize should be abolished\u201d and that winning brings \u201cfalse canonization\u201d.\n\nLojze Wieser, a publisher in Carinthia who has done several projects with Handke in German and Slovenian, told Reuters that no one had expected Handke\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cHe is the greatest innovator of language and word in global literature,\u201d Wieser said.\n\nCROSSING BOUNDARIES\n\nTokarczuk trained as a psychologist before publishing her first novel in 1993. Since then, she has produced a steady and varied stream of works and her novel \u201cFlights\u201d won her the high-profile Man Booker International Prize last year. She was the first Polish author to do so.\n\n\u201cNobel Prize for Literature! Joy and emotion took my speech away. Thank you very much for all your congratulations!\u201d she wrote on Facebook.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nShe later told Polish broadcaster TVN she was proud that her books covering small towns in Poland can be read universally and be important for people elsewhere in the world.\n\n\u201cI believe in the novel. I think the novel is something incredible. This is a deep way of communication, above the borders, above languages, cultures. It refers to the in-depth similarity between people, teaches us empathy,\u201d she said.\n\nPoland\u2019s culture minister, Piotr Glinski, said the award to Tokarczuk was a success for Polish culture. Earlier this week, Glinski said he had started reading Tokarczuk\u2019s books many times but never finished any of them, a failing that he said on Twitter he would now seek to correct.", "description": "Austrian writer Peter Handke won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday and Polish author Olga Tokarczuk was named as the 2018 winner after a sexual assault scandal led to last year's award being postponed.", "authors": ["Simon Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439286834&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991CW", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
