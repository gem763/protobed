She added that other invitees from California, Arizona, Florida and Georgia had received her invitation without any issues.\n\n\"What the **** lady,\" Domagala wrote. \"First of all, clearly that was not our intention. I put additional postage on it. People in Florida, Washington, Texas have gotten it with no additional postage needed. Second of all you wasted an additional 55 cent to send that letter to us? Next time, refuse the letter if your *** is going to ***** about $3.\"\n\nDomagala wasn't done.\n\n\"I am going to be petty as hell and send her a nasty *** letter back with a check in it for $3.51 to cover her postage and hopefully she doesn't come to the wedding,\" she wrote.\n\nDomagala's wish was granted just days later. In an update, she revealed that Post had died.\n\n\"UPDATE TO POST: So I submitted this on September 22 (approved 30th) as of September 27th SHE DIED!!!!!!!\" Domagala wrote. \"HOW CRAZY IS THAT!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe bride-to-be said she was going to mail her response and the check last Friday but missed the mail pickup. That same day, she and her fianc\u00e9 received a call from his mother about Post's death.\n\nDomagala's post has since gone viral, garnering over 3,600 likes on social media and stunning fellow members of the group.\n\n\"OMG What a turn of events!\" one person wrote.", "description": "A bride-to-be who shamed a wedding guest over a \"petty\" response to her Save the Date was stunned to learn that the guest died just days later.", "authors": ["Justin Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LjoecccYl4gaF7egnyqE_w--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/747x489+85+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cdff69d0-e53b-11e9-9f7f-e8588adbe0f8"}
