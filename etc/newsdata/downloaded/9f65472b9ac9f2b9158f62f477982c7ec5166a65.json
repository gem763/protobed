The biggest hurdle to a deal remains the post-Brexit border arrangements between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\n\u201cIf this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,\u201d the Downing Street source said. Johnson insists Northern Ireland must leave the EU\u2019s customs union with the rest of the UK.\n\nA spokesman for the German chancellor confirmed the call had taken place but declined to comment further.\n\nHowever, Norbert Roettgen, a senior Merkel ally, said there was no new German position on Brexit. \u201cFrankly a deal on the basis of Johnson\u2019s proposals by Oct. 31 has been unrealistic from the beginning...,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nPressured by Brexit jitters, the pound fell 0.5% to $1.2226.\n\nThe EU was scathing about Johnson\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\u201d European Council President Tusk said on Twitter. \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d\n\nSuch abrupt remarks indicate the Brexit blame game has begun in earnest, and that now both London and EU capitals are preparing for an acrimonious and potentially chaotic Brexit for which neither side wants to be held responsible.\n\nAdding to the gloom, European Parliament President David Sassoli said after meeting Johnson on Tuesday there had been no progress in the Brexit talks.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets with European Parliament President David Sassoli (not pictured), at Downing Street, in London, Britain October 8, 2019.

He has also repeatedly demanded an election but parliament has refused to grant one.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nScotland\u2019s top court will rule on Wednesday whether to order Johnson to abide by the law forcing a delay and if it could sign a letter asking for an extension if he refuses to do so himself.\n\nThe Spectator magazine quoted an unidentified source in Downing Street as saying that Britain would take an aggressive stance towards the EU if Brexit talks break down, possibly even by withholding security cooperation.\n\n\u201cThis government will not negotiate further so any delay would be totally pointless,\u201d the source was quoted as saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal.\u201d", "description": "The European Union accused Britain of playing a \"stupid blame game\" over Brexit on Tuesday after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438570666&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971PK", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
