She says that every time they block her from commenting on or meddling in their lives, she considers it a personal assault because it\u2019s like they\u2019re convicting her of bad parenting without letting her mount a defense. The moment is classic Transparent, playfully interrogating modern therapy-speak, while also understanding that when troubled people finally own their feelings, the process can hurt others.\n\nThe scene is also, frankly, kind of hard to watch, because the song itself is so clumsy and corny. But then that\u2019s true to Transparent, too.\n\nThroughout the show\u2019s first four seasons, creator Jill Soloway took huge chances not just with Transparent\u2019s storytelling, but with its characters. Soloway was never afraid to let the members of the Pfefferman family come off as whiny or self-absorbed, because that was the whole point of the series. Transparent suggests that working toward becoming a better person sometimes forces people to elevate personal needs over the comfort and complacency of a group. But that wrenching kind of change ultimately affected Transparent itself, as behind-the-scenes drama and larger cultural trends affected the way even longtime fans saw the show.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Transparent\u2019s legacy without confronting the problem of Jeffrey Tambor, who won an Emmy for playing Maura Pfefferman, the series\u2019 lead character: a well-to-do former UCLA professor who transitions from male to female late in life. (She\u2019s the \u201ctrans parent\u201d of the title.) When Tambor was accused of sexual harassment and abusive behavior in 2017 \u2014 not long after season 4 debuted \u2014 the scandal raised questions about this cutting-edge dramedy\u2019s progressive bona fides.\n\nTambor doesn\u2019t appear in Transparent\u2019s final episode, titled \u201cMusicale Finale.\u201d He predicted in 2017 that he\u2019d be dropped from the show, but he didn\u2019t officially resign. Instead, Amazon Studios conducted an official investigation into the allegations, then cut ties with the actor. The finale\u2019s plot easily explains the absence: it\u2019s set in the wake of Maura\u2019s death, and it\u2019s about how the family struggles to move on.\n\nRemoving the character who\u2019d been the face of Transparent since it launched in 2014 doesn\u2019t seem that jarring, because the truth of the matter is that Tambor had been a thorny issue for the series for a while\u2026 not because of anything he\u2019d done, but because he isn\u2019t transgender himself. Soloway initially defended the decision to cast a cisgender actor as Maura, noting that Tambor\u2019s name and performance (which, for the most part, was brilliant) brought visibility to the project, and gave the show enough clout to fill the cast with trans performers. But the longer the show stuck around \u2014 and the more it illuminated the perspectives of trans women \u2014 the more off-brand that original choice became.\n\nTransparent was never wholly about Maura, though. The show was inspired by the experiences Jill and their sister Faith went through when the person they\u2019d known their whole lives as their father suddenly became their mother. So most episodes of the show spent just as much time following the lives of the Pfefferman children. The restless Sarah (Amy Landecker), the clumsily well-meaning Josh (Jay Duplass), and the adventurous, intellectual Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) \u2014 who in later seasons identifies as the gender non-binary Ari \u2014 are all deeply affected by Maura\u2019s transition. It gives them permission to face up to their own desires and their own pasts.\n\nIn the early episodes, Soloway mostly used the show\u2019s premise to capture and satirize the preoccupations of anxious, upper-middle-class Los Angelenos. But by the end of season 1, Transparent started becoming more ambitious. The flashback episode \u201cBest New Girl\u201d put Maura\u2019s early attempts at understanding the allure of women\u2019s clothes in the context of sexual exploration and the permissive culture of academia. Season 2 went further, developing Soloway\u2019s themes of Jewish suffering and guilt by connecting the Pfeffermans\u2019 story to the gender-bending decadence of pre-Nazi Berlin.\n\nLater seasons were hampered by the kind of repetitiveness that tends to set in with stories about deeply flawed people. Because it would\u2019ve been undramatic for Maura, Shelly, Sarah, Josh, and Ari to fix themselves, Transparent fell into predictable narrative patterns, where the Pfeffermans would have some breakthrough \u2014 reckoning with a buried trauma, embracing an identity, committing to a healthy relationship, et cetera \u2014 before their usual neediness and self-doubt would knock them back to square one.\n\nThat\u2019s why some fans of mature, sophisticated TV never got on board with Transparent. Not only could the Pfeffermans be bad company, they also weren\u2019t so different from conventional television characters, continually making the same mistakes.\n\nBut for the show\u2019s fervent fans, it remained a must-see from start to finish, because any given episode could be another one-of-a-kind classic. Take season 2\u2019s \u201cMan on the Land,\u201d where Maura attends a women\u2019s music festival and is startled to discover that a vocal subset of feminists refuse to celebrate transgender stories, because they see them as another example of men pulling attention away from women. Some Transparent sequences were startling and beautiful, as in season 3\u2019s \u201cTo Sardines and Back,\u201d which starts with a prologue that shows pieces of the Pfeffernans\u2019 life through a pet turtle\u2019s point of view.\n\n\u201cMusicale Finale\u201d is very much in the spirit of these memorable standalone Transparent episodes. It\u2019s overstuffed by default. Soloway doesn\u2019t try to put a pretty bow on every storyline, but nearly all the characters, even the non-Pfeffermans, get some screen time to suggest where they might be headed after the closing credits. The finale also includes some fine examples of the show\u2019s tangled ego-clashes. Shelly feels affronted when her kids chastise her for calling Ari their \u201csister\u201d instead of their \u201csibling,\u201d at a time when they\u2019re all supposed to be more focused on their grief than on their self-identities. Meanwhile, Ari gets offended that they don\u2019t have a say about Maura\u2019s wish to be cremated.\n\nMostly, \u201cMusicale Finale\u201d stands out because of its songs (written by Faith, with Jill\u2019s input). Not all of them are as cringe-inducing as \u201cYour Boundary Is My Trigger.\u201d The episode features some truly lovely numbers, including the opener, \u201cSepulveda Boulevard,\u201d the lilting recurring song \u201cFather\u2019s House,\u201d and the moving \u201cYour Shoes,\u201d in which the actor Shelly has hired to play Maura in a play about her life sings what she\u2019d always wanted to hear her ex-husband say.\n\nEven more than Maura\u2019s death, Shelly\u2019s play is the finale\u2019s unifying element. It\u2019s what gives Soloway (who directed \u201cMusicale Finale,\u201d and co-wrote it with Faith) the chance to comment on Tambor\u2019s absence from the episode, by reminding the audience that this series was always a work of fiction, drawn from real life, but affected by the contributions of the actors and crew. The play also sets up the central clash between Shelly and her children, who resent the way she seems to have replaced them with versions of themselves she can control.\n\nA lot about the finale feels rushed or ill-considered, right up to the catchy but silly closing number, \u201cJoyocaust,\u201d which suggests Jews need to embrace pleasure to put their history of pain behind them. But the meta aspects of Shelly\u2019s play are a conceptual masterstroke. Transparent shouldn\u2019t just be remembered as the show that introduced millions of TV-watchers to a complex, charismatic transgender heroine. It\u2019s also been a show about who gets frame stories, and how. Seen one way, Maura\u2019s journey of self-discovery is inspiring and empowering. Seen another way, her being true to herself has come at the expense of some of her loved ones, and has become a retroactive excuse for lying and infidelity.\n\nThe Transparent finale isn\u2019t wholly about mourning Maura. It\u2019s more about how the culture at large will continue to argue about what we owe to each other and what we owe to ourselves, and whether the two can be reconciled. And it\u2019s a debate worth having, so long as the people involved are honest and open, and can understand that one person\u2019s boundary is another\u2019s trigger.", "description": "Amazon Studios\u2019 signature series came to a triumphant end on September 27th with a musical finale written by creator Jill Soloway and their sister Faith.
