William, 39, doesn\u2019t remember how many years he lived on the streets, stealing to feed his drug habit. He also doesn\u2019t know who set him on fire. But he does remember the year he spent in a hospital recovering from the burns.\n\nSurrounded by one of the biggest slums in one of the world\u2019s most violent cities, the walls of Nosotros Unidos have, over the past 15 years, sheltered more than 20,000 people in search of a way out of the self-destructive cycle of drugs. With high ceilings and little light, and rows of bunk beds occupied by people whose worldly possessions fit into a small locker, the Protestant-church-run centre offers free rehabilitation to people with problems of drug abuse and deprivation.\n\nThe main therapy available to those who enter the program is religion through prayer.\n\nDouglas is on his third and longest stay in the centre. Among the several violent incidents during his life on the street was the time someone shot him with a homemade shotgun that used screws and nails as ammunition. His abdomen still retains the deep gouges from the blast. Inside the shelter it\u2019s impossible for him to hide his joy when his mother and 15-year-old daughter come to visit him. He admits they are the only motivation he has to find a way out of the world in which he was immersed.\n\nThe rehabilitation centre enforces a routine for all the patients. Every afternoon there is a group therapy session in which they read the Bible for over an hour. Three mornings a week they rise at 4 a.m., fast for two hours, and pray. On Wednesdays and Sundays they put on their best clothes and attend a church service. At mealtimes they march into the dining room according to their room number, and stand in rows to say grace before filing past the pots to receive their portions. They eat in near silence, seated at long tables.\n\nThe head of the kitchen is 33-year-old Jose. Until four months ago Jose was a member of a criminal gang. Today, he is responsible for all the food at the shelter, using very few utensils apart from a set of giant pots that show the wear and tear of heavy use.\n\nThe self-discipline with which these 250 men, aged 18-80 and from difficult backgrounds, behaved, impressed me from the moment I began spending time with them. The participants themselves provide cooking, hygiene, security, and guidance for the new arrivals, as well as assistance for the oldest and most helpless.\n\nThe ways they find to help each other provoked everything from surprise to astonishment in me. One morning I found Jesus proudly admiring his teeth in a mirror, showing everyone one incisor in particular that was sitting in his mouth where there had only been a space the day before. One of his companions had hand carved the tooth from a beef bone salvaged from the previous day\u2019s lunch, especially for him.\n\nI couldn\u2019t think of a better gift.", "description": "Thirty-six-year-old Danny Martinez, a patient in drug rehabilitation, helps to move an old man from his wheelchair to his bed, after bathing him at the Nosotros Unidos rehab centre for drug and alcohol addicts.
