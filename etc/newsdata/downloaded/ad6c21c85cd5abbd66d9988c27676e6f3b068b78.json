(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s inaccurate assertion that Hurricane Dorian was going to significantly affect Alabama exposed a flaw in the White House\u2019s storm briefing process \u2014 some of those meetings did not include meteorologists. With additional storms spinning in the Atlantic, this gap could hamper preparedness and response efforts.\n\nThis is the case even though Trump has an advantage compared to his predecessors: the presence of a highly qualified meteorologist on his White House staff. Kelvin Droegemeier, a longtime research meteorologist, serves as the head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the president\u2019s science adviser.\n\nYet he did not attend formal hurricane briefings provided to Trump in the run-up to Hurricane Dorian\u2019s devastating strike in the northwest Bahamas and eventual landfall in North Carolina, according to a senior administration official.\n\nInstead, Trump was sometimes briefed on the storm via a process run out of the National Security Council, with Coast Guard Rear Adm. Peter Brown, who serves as the White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, providing Trump the latest storm information while the president was at Camp David on the weekend of Aug. 30 and 31, and on subsequent occasions.\n\nIt was Brown who issued a statement on Sept. 5 saying he had told Trump that Alabama was at risk of seeing tropical-storm-force winds before the president inaccurately tweeted that the state would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s comments were based on that morning\u2019s Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama,\u201d Brown wrote.\n\nOn Sept. 6, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its highly controversial news release admonishing the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office for issuing a definitive tweet that appeared to contradict the president, though it accurately predicted the storm\u2019s path.\n\nAnother qualified meteorologist serving at a high level in the Trump administration, acting NOAA chief Neil Jacobs, was also not in attendance at certain key briefings. Jacobs has been criticized for his involvement in the Sept. 6 statement that may have violated his agency\u2019s scientific integrity policy.\n\n[Trump pushed staff to deal with NOAA tweet that contradicted his inaccurate Alabama hurricane claim, officials say]\n\nThat statement came about after Trump told his staff that it needed to correct the statement that seemed to contradict him. That led White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to call Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to tell him to fix the issue, which brought NOAA into the mix because it\u2019s a Commerce Department agency.\n\nThere are now at least three investigations into the matter: by Congress, the NOAA chief scientist and the Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general.\n\nBefore his government service, Jacobs ran a weather modeling group at Panasonic Avionics, and his focus at NOAA has been on improving the accuracy of the agency\u2019s forecast models.\n\nJacobs briefed Trump on the forecast for Hurricane Dorian on Aug. 29, when he showed the president the National Hurricane Center\u2019s five-day forecast cone for Dorian, a map that was later altered with a Sharpie to denote a possible impact in Alabama.\n\nJacobs was also in attendance at an afternoon briefing at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sept. 1, after Trump\u2019s Alabama tweet earlier that day, when National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham discussed the storm forecast via video conference from the Hurricane Center headquarters near Miami.\n\n[NOAA\u2019s chief scientist will investigate why agency backed Trump over its experts on Dorian, email shows]\n\nAccording to one participant at that meeting, Graham was asked about the storm\u2019s threat to Alabama, and he told the president the storm was more likely to take a coastal route, missing that state.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president was briefed on the storm every hour as it approached the United States.\n\nA senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid about a sensitive topic said those briefings were probably provided by the rear admiral, who is not a weather expert trained to explain and interpret computer model projections.\n\nThe official said that if Trump had been briefed by a meteorologist, he would not have mentioned Alabama. The same official said Droegemeier did not attend Trump\u2019s hurricane briefings.\n\nAn OSTP spokesperson declined to comment on whether Droegemeier attended the formal storm briefings for the president.\n\n\u201cDr. Droegemeier is in close contact with the White House and NOAA regarding all hurricane and natural disaster briefings,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBush, Obama administrations brought the weather experts into the room\n\nThe hurricane briefings worked differently under the administrations of former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nAccording to Scott Rayder, who served as chief of staff to former NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher under Bush, the agency fought hard to be included in the NSC hurricane meetings and presidential hurricane briefings. Their argument: \u201cYou need somebody who can explain the probability cone, what it means and what it doesn\u2019t mean,\u201d Rayder said in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s important you get a trained meteorologist in the room.\u201d\n\nRayder acknowledged that it can be difficult to gain access to such briefings because there\u2019s \u201calways competition to get in front of the president and brief.\u201d\n\nJohn Holdren, a climate scientist who served as Obama\u2019s science adviser, said Obama consulted with the relevant experts as storms threatened the country.\n\n\u201cIn the case of real-time hurricane threats, President Obama would typically meet with me, the NOAA Administrator, the FEMA Administrator, and the National Weather Service Director \u2014 together and in person \u2014 before making a public statement. \u2026 In addition, because as Assistant to President I could see him and write him memos when needed, I often took the opportunity to update him early in the game on the science aspects of emerging issues,\u201d Holdren said in an email.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama practically always consulted with me (and often with other scientists in the administration) before making public statements on matters involving science,\u201d he added.\n\nHoldren noted that Droegemeier, despite his sterling academic credentials and Senate-confirmed position, lacks the title of \u201cassistant to the president\u201d and therefore does not have the direct access to the Oval Office that he enjoyed during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn addition, he cautioned that any discussions between the OSTP director and Trump are generally not made public, so it\u2019s possible they were in touch about the storm forecast but have not publicly revealed it.\n\n\u201cAlthough Dr. Droegemeier was duly confirmed by the Senate as Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, he was not given the White House title of Assistant to the President. It is only the latter title that makes one a \u2018direct report\u2019 to the President and confers access \u2014 the ability to make an appointment to see the President and the ability to send him a message,\u201d Holdren noted.\n\n\u201cWithout that title, one can only get to the President with the intervention of someone who has it or, alternatively, because the President asks to see you.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s science adviser is a meteorologist, but he did not attend the storm briefings.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "September At Pm", "Andrew Freedman Edits"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lI_g0J0FwnSakP3oi8eYoZi6Llo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XNMKD7WS6EI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
