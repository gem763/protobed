Indictable offences are the most serious and carry the harshest penalties. Murder, for example, falls in this category.\n\nSummary offences are less serious and are punishable by a maximum of up to two years in jail, a fine of up to $5,000 or some combination of the two.\n\nThe type of offence a person has been charged with determines various aspects of subsequent court proceedings. Summary offences move more quickly through the system because the accused loses their rights to a jury trial and a preliminary inquiry.\n\nThere is, however, a third classification of offences called \"hybrid\" offences. These make up the majority of offences outlined in the Criminal Code. They give Crown prosecutors the option to pursue an offence as either indictable or summary, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.\n\nSo hybrid offences allow for greater discretion in how cases move forward.\n\nMore discretion for the Crown\n\nHere's where Bill C-75 comes into the picture. The bill transformed many formerly indictable offences into hybrid offences \u2014 including participation in a criminal organization.\n\nThe change was motivated partly by the fact that the term \"criminal organization\" is broadly defined in law. Such an organization must have at least three members, and one of its purposes must be to carry out criminal activities.\n\nThe definition has been further refined by case law over time, but there's considerable room for interpretation, said Michael Spratt, a criminal lawyer at the Ottawa firm Abergel Goldstein & Partners LLP.\n\n\"We could be looking at the Hells Angels, which is a very serious group, or we could be looking at a group of friends who agreed to a 'criminal enterprise' together to steal from a convenience store,\" he said.\n\nThe change included in Bill C-75 gives the Crown more leeway to assess the facts of a particular case and decide whether opting for an indictable offence is the best option.\n\n'Categorically false'\n\nCraig Bottomley, a criminal lawyer at Bottomley Barristers in Toronto, said any case involving gun crime and a criminal organization will be pursued as an indictable offence.\n\nHe called the suggestion that Bill C-75 has resulted in gang members who committed violent offences walking away with fines \"categorically false.\"\n\nSpratt agreed, calling it an \"outright lie\" to claim the bill lets gang members convicted of violent crimes off the hook with a fine.\n\n\"Just because an offence can proceed one way doesn't mean that an offence will proceed that way. For serious offences for real criminal organizations, the Crown can still proceed by indictment and still seek a very serious sentence,\" Spratt said.\n\n\"So it's extremely misleading to say that Trudeau has reduced sentences for gang crime.\"\n\nVerdict: Misleading.\n\nSources: Bill C-75, Parliament of Canada; Legislative Summary of Bill C\u201175: An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, Parliament of Canada; Criminal offences, Department of Justice", "description": "Liberal government legislation changed how prosecutors can pursue alleged gang members who commit violent crimes.
