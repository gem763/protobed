We said it was not possible and it\u2019s amazing to compare the first half with the second half,\u201d said Villas-Boas.\n\n\u201cWe can accept losing to PSG, given their quality but not like this against Monaco.\n\n\u201cI wanted to win this cup, the team as well. It\u2019s a shame as the fans were there for us, from the first to the last minute. Now, we have to give something back to them.\u201d\n\nDespite making seven changes from the side which started the 1-0 win over Nantes last weekend, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim still had enough firepower to see off Marseille.\n\nBoth Monaco\u2019s goals came in the first half.\n\nOn-loan striker Jean-Kevin Augustin opened the scoring in the 25th minute from a cross from Ruben Aguilar.\n\nAguilar added the second goal five minutes from the interval.\n\nMarseille grabbed a consolation in the 77th minute when Benjamin Lecomte put through his own goal.\n\nThere will be no let up for Marseille this weekend when they welcome third-placed Lille to the Stade Velodrome.", "description": "Monaco (AFP) \u2013 Marseille\u2019s season suffered another setback Wednesday when they were knocked out of the French League Cup 2-1 at the hands of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/2a810a_marseille-coach-andre-villas-boas-applauds-fans-his-team-league-cup-exit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
