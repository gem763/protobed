(The song itself is a nod to his frustrations with studio executives who wanted to restyle his image.)\n\nBy contrast, the title of Mika\u2019s fifth album is \u201cMy Name Is Michael Holbrook,\u201d the first time he\u2019s formally referenced part of his birth name \u2015 Michael Holbrook Penniman Jr. \u2015 in a musical project.\n\n\u201cIt was written as medicine,\u201d the 36-year-old told HuffPost. \u201cI needed to re-find that young guy who was writing songs in his apartment at 17 or 18. I felt this urgent sense, this need to reconnect with the elation and joy of making music after a good three years of having lost that sensation. At a certain point, you\u2019re like, \u2018Well, who am I, really?\u2019 So I kind of used my legal name in order to \u2026 write about myself with more freedom.\u201d\n\nMondadori Portfolio via Getty Images Mika delves into personal territory on his fifth album, \u201cMy Name Is Michael Holbrook,\u201d released last week.\n\nReleased last week, \u201cMy Name Is Michael Holbrook\u201d proves Mika hasn\u2019t lost his flair for disco-tinged exuberance. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the album\u2019s leadoff single, \u201cIce Cream,\u201d a summery bop laden with sexual innuendo. \u201cTiny Love,\u201d meanwhile, harks back to Elton John or \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d-era Queen with its anthemic choruses and vocal harmonies.\n\nBut as its title suggests, \u201cMy Name Is Michael Holbrook\u201d is also an intensely personal affair. \u201cPaloma\u201d is a contemplative ballad Mika wrote about his sister, who nearly died after falling from an apartment window and impaling herself on a fence post. The sultry, if deceptively titled, \u201cSanremo\u201d was inspired by the adolescent awkwardness he experienced at age 13 while visiting the coastal Italian city of the title with his family.\n\nThe \u201cSanremo\u201d video, which dropped Oct. 4, interprets the song\u2019s escapist lyrics in a wildly different way. In it, Mika plays a closeted gay man in the 1950s who, after kissing his wife and daughter goodbye, ventures through the city streets and into a speakeasy-style bar filled with sailors and drag queens, in search of a male companion. The video, viewable below, concludes with Mika, who has been dodging suspicious glances from passersby, being stopped by a police officer as audio from what sounds like a vintage radio broadcast warns of the \u201cdangers\u201d of homosexuality.\n\nThe narrative of the \u201cSanremo\u201d video could be seen as a nod to Mika\u2019s own trajectory as an artist. He came out publicly as gay in 2012, though the media had been scrutinizing the queer subtext of his work for years. \u201cIt\u2019s only through my music that I\u2019ve found the strength to come to terms with my sexuality beyond the context of just my lyrics,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThis is my real life.\u201d\n\nMuch as Mika looked to Mercury and George Michael for inspiration, he has, in turn, helped pave the way for the likes of Troye Sivan and Sam Smith, who have not shied away from expressing their sexuality and gender identity through their music. Still, he believes LGBTQ artists continue to face a \u201ccomplicated\u201d reality when it comes to the world of mainstream pop.\n\n\u201cI refuse to define the challenges associated with being LGBTQ purely with media acceptance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to know you\u2019re going to be given a shot, and from that point of view, you\u2019re going to face less discrimination in the media sense or the music industry sense \u2014 discrimination which I definitely suffered, and a lot of artists did much more than me. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s simpler. Every person\u2019s journey is atypical.\u201d\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images \u201cI refuse to define the challenges associated with being LGBTQ purely with media acceptance,\u201d Mika said.\n\nMika\u2019s defiance of convention has always been present in his live performances, too. In September, he embarked on his six-date Tiny Love Tiny Tour in Brooklyn, New York, with a high-energy set that was, as always, delightfully campy. He\u2019ll return to the concert stage Nov. 10 in London, where he kicks off his Revelation Tour across Europe.\n\nOne thing he isn\u2019t deeply concerned with, however, is commercial viability. After the global breakout of \u201cLife in Cartoon Motion,\u201d his three subsequent releases \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Boy Who Knew Too Much,\u201d 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Origin of Love\u201d and 2015\u2019s \u201cNo Place in Heaven\u201d \u2014 garnered critical acclaim but did not yield an across-the-board hit like \u201cGrace Kelly.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re finding yourself a niche artist \u2014 which I am \u2014 really go to the niche. Mika\n\nThe flip side of that cooling reception, Mika said, is creative freedom. In fact, he\u2019d like to divert even further from the mainstream by writing a movie musical or staging an opera in the future.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re finding yourself a niche artist \u2014 which I am \u2014 really go to the niche,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of 15 people. Think of 100 people. What would those 15 or 100 people think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no delusions about commercial grandeur,\u201d he added. \u201cMy delusions of grandeur are purely storytelling or conceptual ones, and thank God I have those. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t want to get up in the morning.\u201d", "description": "The singer says his new album, \"My Name Is Michael Holbrook,\" was \"written as medicine,\" but he hasn't lost his sense of campy queer fun either.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b3b2f210000b103ab8df7.jpeg?cache=03ysntqwag&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
