In a shock, these investment may need to be unwound, setting off asset fire sales similar to the financial crisis.\n\nInstitutional investors worldwide \u2014 insurance companies, asset managers and pensions funds \u2014 are taking more and more risks and that\u2019s creating some potential pockets of danger for the global economy, the International Monetary Fund said, in a new report.\n\nAll around the world, interest rates have been falling. The amount of government and corporate bonds with negative yields has increased to about $15 trillion.\n\nYield on U.S. 10-year bonds TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.85% have fallen to around 1.7% from closer to 3.5% last fall.\n\nThe problem is that these firms have sold products to their customers with a promise, and in some cases a guarantee, of higher yields.\n\nInstitutional investors \u201chave return targets that are much higher than what you can get in the financial market place today,\u201d said Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF\u2019s monetary and capital market department, in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nFor example, the wedge between what German life insurance companies say is their return target and what they can get in the marketplace is a huge 300 basis points or 3 percentage points. It is similar scenario for insurers in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nAs a result, \u201cthese investors are going to riskier and riskier assets, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing, reach for yield everywhere,\u201d Adrian said.\n\nOne of the most popular assets for these firms are collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, an investment structure that was a fairly resilient financial product during the financial crisis.\n\nA CLO involves securitizing corporate loans into a single pool and selling them to investors in tranches.\n\nThe IMF is worried that the collateral now going into CLOs is deteriorating, Adrian said.\n\nIf downside economic risks were to materialize, these loan instruments might have to be unwound and amplify any downward shock.\n\n\u201cEven relatively small shocks can be amplified due to vulnerabilities,\u201d he said, pointing to the case of sub-prime mortgage loans in the United States.\n\nIn their hunt for higher yields, Asian insurance companies - in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, have increased their foreign assets to almost $1.5 trillion. Their combined share of the U.S. dollar credit market has risen to 11% from 8% over the past five years.\n\n\u201cIf they withdraw, there will be a price adjustment here,\u201d said Fabo Natalucci, a financial counselor in the IMF\u2019s monetary and capital market department.\n\nThe capital adequacy of Taiwanese insurers is weaker relative to peers, Adrian said.\n\nThe IMF financial stability report published earlier this week said that the U.S. equity market has become overvalued since the spring. Investors seem to think the Federal Reserve will ride to the rescue of the market, the international agency said.\n\nRead: U.S. stock market is overvalued, IMF says\n\nThe IMF is not forecasting a global recession but has cut its global growth forecast after trade wars have undermined business confidence around the world.\n\nSee: IMF says global economy to grow at slowest pace since 2008 financial crisis\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, governments have focused most of their attention on shoring up the banking sector. As a result of stricter regulation and supervision, resilience of banks has improved, Adrian said.\n\nNow is the time for financial regulators to introduce new tools to mitigate financial stability risks in for non-bank financial firms, or shadow banks, and institutional investors, the IMF said.\n\n\u201cThey should tackle risks among institutional investors through strengthened oversight and disclosures,\u201d Adrian said.\n\n\u201cWith financial conditions still easy \u2014 and with vulnerabilities building \u2014 policy makers should act now to reduce the vulnerabilities that could exacerbate the next financial crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. stocks were down Wednesday on a weak retail sales data but remain near record high levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.35% was down 22 points to 27,001 on Wednesday.", "description": "Institutional investors are taking more risks because of low interest rates and that\u2019s dangerous for the global economy, the International Monetary Fund said...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC592_Balanc_ZG_20190124113611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
