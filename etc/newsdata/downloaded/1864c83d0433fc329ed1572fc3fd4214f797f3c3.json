They had me locked in the cage so I can be an animal inside of the ring. I think that was Manny\u2019s plan, but it was a good idea though. He\u2019s going to have some tricks up his sleeve, but so are we,\u2019 Ruiz said at a press conference after the work-out.\n\n\u2018It was pretty hard at first because the altitude was pretty high.\n\n\u2018We were running in the mountains and doing a lot of different drills. All of the hard work we did in Guadalajara will show.\n\n\u2018Ten pounds isn\u2019t going to make any difference, if anything it\u2019s going to make me stronger, it\u2019s going to make me faster, especially because he\u2019s going to be running around.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s going to be trying to win by points and my job is to cut the ring and do what we got to do and let my hands go, it\u2019s exactly what we been training on in the gym.\u2019", "description": "Andy Ruiz Jr revealed he plans to be 10 pounds lighter when he takes on Anthony Joshua in their December rematch.
