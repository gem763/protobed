Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\n\u201cI mean obviously it\u2019s a tough situation that we\u2019re all in right now, as an association,\u201d said James, who added that he often feels that his words are taken out of context. \u201cUs as athletes, owners, GMs, whatever, so forth. I think when the issue comes up, if you feel passionate about it or you feel like it\u2019s something that you want to talk about, then so be it.\u201d\n\nJames said Monday \u2014 after the Lakers returned from a tour in China \u2014 he believed Morey was \u201ceither misinformed or not really educated on the situation\u201d and didn\u2019t consider the consequences before posting his tweet.\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d James said Monday. \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nAfter backlash to James\u2019 comments, he tweeted a follow up on Monday night, writing, \u201cLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of (Morey\u2019s) tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 Monday comments and tweets drew plenty of criticism, including from many in Hong Kong, where protesters were seen stomping on and burning his jerseys on basketball courts in the city. Speaking from the Lakers\u2019 facility Tuesday, James said he hadn\u2019t see those images and wasn\u2019t monitoring the backlash.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been paying attention to it much besides what I said and what we\u2019re trying to do here,\u201d he said.\n\nJames elaborated somewhat on the discussion about free speech Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI also don\u2019t think that every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem, as well,\u201d James said. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple things that we haven\u2019t talked about that happen in our own country that we don\u2019t bring up. There\u2019s things that happen in my own community. ...\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s issues all over the world, and I think the best thing we can do is, if you feel passionate about it, talk about it. If you don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about it or you don\u2019t quite understand it, I don\u2019t think you should talk about it. I think it just puts you in a tough position.\u201d\n\nJames finished his media session by saying he won\u2019t discuss the subject moving forward, with hopes of avoiding distractions around the team.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t talk about it again, because I\u2019ll be cheating my teammates by continuing to harp on something that won\u2019t benefit us,\u201d James said.\n\nMorey has not been disciplined for his since-deleted tweet that included a logo and the words, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta spoke out against Morey and his tweet, and Rockets star James Harden said afterward, \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\u201d while standing next to teammate Russell Westbrook in Tokyo.\n\nAccording to an ESPN report Monday, players asked NBA commissioner Adam Silver whether Morey would face any ramifications from the league, with several arguing the point that if a player did or said something that cost the league millions, that player would face repercussions.\n\nIn the days following Morey\u2019s tweet, Chinese state television decided to not air the Brooklyn Nets-Lakers preseason games played in China, and numerous Chinese companies suspended business with the NBA.\n\nHong Kong, a semi-autonomous region in China, is in the midst of months-long protests \u2014 sometimes violent \u2014 with Beijing sensitive to foreign influence on the unrest.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James told reporters Tuesday he believes his comments on Monday -- regarding a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in favor of an independent Hong Kong -- were taken out of context, calling the circumstances as a whole \"tough.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441297460&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F01I-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
