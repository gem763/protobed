In some cases, this provision is not meeting the quality standards we expect for our children, which is why we are working with the sector and Ofsted to tackle any issues related to poor practice where it occurs.\n\n\u201cWe are building our evidence base to better understand how unregulated accommodation or out-of-area placements are used. We are also improving how local areas respond when a child in care goes missing and helping local areas tackle the risks vulnerable young people face, like exploitation from \u2018county lines\u2019 gangs, through our \u00a32m national programme.\u201d", "description": "Local councils are acting as \u201crecruiting sergeants\u201d for drug dealers and grooming gangs by sending children to areas where they will be exploited, a report has found.
