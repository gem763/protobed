The more qubits that can be strung together, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.\n\nBut there's a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool the qubits to close to absolute zero to limit vibration, or \"noise,\" that causes errors to creep into their calculations. It's in this extremely challenging task that Google's research team has made significant progress.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave the Earth's atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.\n\n\"For those of us working in science and technology, it's the 'hello world' moment we've been waiting for - the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to date to make quantum computing a reality,\" Pichai wrote in a blog here", "description": "Google said on Wednesday it achieved a breakthrough in computer research by solving a complex problem in minutes with a so-called quantum computer that would take today's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105913060-1557866582084gettyimages-50800376.jpeg?v=1563461381", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
