The suits' fabric is designed to contain body temperature and manage moisture with design features compatible with the passenger cabin and seating design.\n\nDuring a press tour of Virgin Galactic's New Mexico facilities in August, company representatives said seating is designed to adjust passenger's physical positions at different stages of takeoff, flight and landing.\n\nCLOSE In the weightlessness of space, astronauts need to be creative to get some shut eye.

The company announced a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia this summer, a capital firm owned by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. The merger is valued at $1.5 billion.\n\nFollow Algernon D'Ammassa on Twitter: @AlgernonWrites\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/16/virgin-galactic-unveils-under-armour-spacesuits/4005159002/", "description": "Virgin Galactic and Under Armour unveiled the first line of spacewear for space crews and commercial passengers.", "authors": ["Algernon D'Ammassa", "Published P.M.
