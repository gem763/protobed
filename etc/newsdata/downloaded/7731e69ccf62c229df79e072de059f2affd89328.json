HD link in highlights.\"\n\n(Image: visualdon/Instagram)\n\nIt appears that Chris ignored this request and not only removed Don's song choice and replaced it with the Natural Disaster/ Aura song from his Indigo album but also wrote his own caption, posting: \"Imagination vibrate wit me\".\n\nDon spoke to Radio 1 Newsbeat about the incident.\n\nHe said: \"I want people to know it's me who created it. I think that's fair.\n\n\"When he posted it with some hip-hop song over it, it's really not the kind of vibe I wanted for that piece of work. But he just put some weird hip-hop song on it and then made some caption which doesn't really make any sense.\"\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nThe artist added: \"But if he had tagged me and just gave credit I would have been cool with that, and that would have brought a lot more eyes to my actual work.\"\n\nAfter attempting and failing to get in touch with the singer and his management, The Manchester artist took to reddit to call out the singer publicly.\n\nAiming to 'bring some attention to it', Don placed the two videos side and by side and was shocked by the positive response when over 80,000 users supported him.", "description": "Don Mupasi aka Visual Don has called out singer Chris Brown for allegedly stealing one of his Instagram videos", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Chrisbrownofficial Instagram", "Visualdon Instagram", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20684157.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2019-Tycoon-Music-Festival.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
