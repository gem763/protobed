Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nWhite House refuses to cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\n\nIn an eight-page letter made public on Tuesday, the White House counsel announced there is no intention to cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, and arguing that the inquiry into the Ukraine situation is without merit and \u201cviolates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter capped off a day of defiance as House Democrats continue to seek answers from administration officials, over Republican objections. Most recently, the State Department blocked a scheduled deposition by Gordon Sondland \u2013 a key figure in the Ukraine controversy \u2013 prompting three House committee chairmen to announce they would issue a subpoena for his testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe White House decided to respond to the situation by putting their implied opinions in writing,\u201d says congressional reporter Karoun Demirjian , \u201cand basically challenging the House to more formally start this impeachment inquiry with a vote on the floor. They don\u2019t think that this is fair until that happens.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nChina cracks down further on Uighur Muslims\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has intensified efforts to \u201cSinicize\u201d the country, or make a more homogeneous, secular China, by targeting ethnic minorities and curtailing religions they consider to be carriers of foreign influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor two years on the Xinjiang frontier, China has sent hundreds of thousands from its mostly-Muslim Uighur population to what it calls \u201creeducation centers,\u201d where they are taught to renounce their religion and culture and embrace state-prescribed identities as secular Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of brainwashing, in a way,\u201d Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield says.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the country\u2019s campaign to forcibly assimilate its Uighur population into the Han majority is entering a new phase, as Uighurs living abroad start to hear reports of family members being arrested and jailed on suspicion of financing terrorism after sending money to relatives abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely spurious charge,\u201d Fifield says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ode to the lithium-ion battery\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to three scientists who developed rechargeable lithium-ion batteries \u2013 the kind that provide energy to mobile phones, pacemakers and electric cars. The batteries also increasingly used to store power from sources that fluctuate, such as solar and wind energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBatteries are one of the most exciting technologies that we have in terms of energy,\u201d science reporter Ben Guarino says. \u201cThis award is a good recognition of the work that\u2019s been done, but there\u2019s a lot more exciting things to come.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Karoun Demirjian tracks how the White House has pushed back against impeachment.
