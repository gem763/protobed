I was in bed for three days.\n\n\"I believed I had the flu and I was treating myself with over the counter medication. I suffered all of the symptoms of TSS but I confused it for the flu - nausea and diarrhoea, dizziness, achy muscles.\n\n\"The only thing I didn't get was a rash which is often a symptom of it.\n\n\"But I was getting sicker and sicker. My fever was so high, I was shaky and weak.\"\n\nAfter Greta's sister, a nurse, urged her to get to a hospital, she was rushed to A&E in an ambulance.\n\nShe said: \"When I got to the hospital they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. My blood pressure was very low. I had X-rays and a CT scan.\n\n(Image: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\n\"I was scared and extremely ill. I had a serious pain in my side because my spleen was swollen from trying to fight the infection.\n\n\"The only doctors they hadn't consulted was gynaecology and it was a blessing that one of the nurses thought that it might be toxic shock because I had my period. She put two and two together.\n\n\"They discovered it was a staph infection in my blood after taking a vaginal swab and it stemmed from microscopic cuts in my vagina from a tampon.\"\n\nGreta was admitted to Onslow Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville on February 3 this year, where a line was inserted into her chest to administer antibiotics, fluids and morphine to fight the infection and manage her pain.\n\nShe underwent a blood transfusion to help restore her body's red blood cells and to prevent the further spread of the infection throughout her bloodstream.\n\nGreta's husband, Cas Zarate, 30, a military logistics chief, rushed to be by her side as she battled her illness.\n\n(Image: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\nThe stay-at-home mum said: \"They said if I waited another day it could have had dire consequences.\n\n\"People who get toxic shock syndrome can end up losing limbs or even dying so I do feel so lucky.\n\n\"My sister flew in to take care of my kids and my husband was released from his training. He rushed home.\n\n\"In total I spent 11 days in the hospital and four in the ICU.\"\n\nToxic shock syndrome, which impacts less than one in 100,000 people in the US, is often associated with tampons because the blood that builds up is a culture for bacteria.\n\nGreta said there is a common misconception that the condition is always caused by leaving a tampon inside your body for an extensive period of time.\n\n(Image: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\nHowever, she stressed that using \"super\" tampons when they were not necessary caused trauma to her vaginal walls and allowed bacteria to enter her body through microscopic abrasions.\n\nGreta said: \"I never knew that the size of the tampon should move with your flow. Like super tampons should only be for really heavy days, regular for normal days, and light for the end of your flow.\n\n\"When you pull a dry tampon out of your body, it actually leaves tiny scrapes on your vaginal wall which allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream and that's what happened to me.\n\n\"I change my tampon every time I use the bathroom, so I knew it wasn't because I had left it in there for a long, long time.\n\n\"There should be clearer instructions on the box.\"\n\nGreta, who is a mum to Ethan, 14, Lezley, 12, Nayeli, ten, Zoie, six, and Bree, three, has made a full recovery but can no longer use tampons.\n\n(Image: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\nShe said her brush with death prompted her to undergo a genetic test for the BRCA2 gene, which increases a woman's risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer.\n\nGreta said: \"My sister was 26 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and I always planned to get the test but life got in the way.\n\n\"I have my blood tested regularly now to make sure I don't get sick again and my doctor asked if I might want to take the test so I did.\n\n\"I do have the gene so now I am preparing for preventative surgeries.\n\n\"I'm having a hysterectomy at the end of the year and a mastectomy in February.\n\n\"Going through toxic shock made everything clearer for me.\n\n\"I want to be around for my children for a long time. These preventative surgeries will reduce my risk of developing cancer and that's my main priority.\"", "description": "Greta Zarate, 32, from Jacksonville, North Carolina, underwent a blood transfusion after going into septic shock", "authors": ["Patricia Murphy", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Greta Zarate", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537645.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_TAMPON_INFECTION_07.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
