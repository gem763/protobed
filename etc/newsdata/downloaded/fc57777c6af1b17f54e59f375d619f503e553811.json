The fox then leaps over the side of the cage and briskly scurries off into the bushes, which is where the video ends\n\nIt then leaps over the side of the cage and briskly scurries off into the bushes, which is where the video ends.\n\nA spokesman for the Bristol Animal Rescue Centre said: 'Believe it or not this is the second one like this we've seen this year.\n\n'This little guy was spotted in a safe storage yard [with] some talk of having to get the fire brigade involved to cut the wheel off.\n\n'Thankfully, all that was needed in the end was a lot of lubricant and a little bit of know-how from a couple of wily old vets and out he popped!\n\n'After a brief check-up he was taken back to where he was found and happily ran off back to the wild.'\n\nIt is thought that foxes get their heads stuck in the hubs of wheels as they try to scavenge for food in the dark cavities.", "description": "The creature was spotted by a concerned passerby at a storage yard in Bristol. A team of experienced vets decided to apply lubricant to free its head rather than cut the wheel off.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19502628-0-image-a-2_1570641137939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
