But after 6 a.m., as the flight was boarding, he came into some kind of contact with airline employees. As workers approached him, the man took off running, according to Miami-Dade Police Detective Lee Cowart, a department spokesman.\n\nAmerican Airlines spokeswoman Alexis Aran Coello said in an email that the passenger bypassed the gate agent as he ran by.\n\n\u201cHe fled into a jetway and onto a plane that was parked at the gate,\u201d Cowart says.\n\nA passenger on the plane, Ari Teman, told Local 10 News that the man was screaming that it was his plane and that he was the FBI.\n\n\u201cThe business class passengers blocked him from getting further into the plane (probably so they could get upgraded to Executive Platinum, but a good deed is still a good deed),\u201d he wrote in a Facebook account.\n\n[Turns out, misbehaving on a plane could cost you big money]\n\nAirline workers called police; Cowart said they responded within a minute or two and took the man off the plane. Video that Teman posted showed him in handcuffs, facedown on the ground in the airport and surrounded by police.\n\n\u201cThe plane was subsequently searched for damage and contraband, firearms, explosives, et cetera, and the plane was searched and all clear,\u201d Cowart says. Police determined the man was \u201cin crisis\u201d and took him to a hospital under a Florida law that allows people to be temporarily detained for mental health evaluation.\n\nIt was the second time in three days that unauthorized passengers got onto a plane.\n\nOn Saturday, also in Florida, a woman somehow got onto a Delta flight at Orlando International Airport without a boarding pass. After the person who was supposed to be in her seat flagged the woman\u2019s presence to staffers, she was forced off the plane. The airline, Transportation Security Administration and local police are investigating that incident.\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman managed to sneak onto a Delta flight \u2014 then refused to move when caught\n\nRecent incident over attire highlights the ambiguity in airline dress codes\n\nTell us what you think of By The Way", "description": "A passenger on the flight said the man, who was ticketed, was screaming that it was his plane and that he was the FBI.", "authors": ["Hannah Sampson", "Reporter Focusing On Travel News", "October At Pm", "Hannah Sampson Is A Staff Writer At The Washington Post For The Way", "Where She Reports On Travel News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tMdMk9RNBQnBdyZ5R_-J8-db3D8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AUGQOM2RWRDDHED2EKP4EJI4A4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
