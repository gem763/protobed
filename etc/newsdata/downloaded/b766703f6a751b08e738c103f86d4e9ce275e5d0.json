Zelda reads all your letters but regrets that she cannot answer them all personally\n\nMy daughter\u2019s best friend is too controlling\n\nMy daughter is very shy and for the past three years she has had a very dominant friend at her all-girls school, who has perhaps prevented her from making other friends because this girl is not very popular. Now they are in their final year and filling out university applications, which I thought might be a chance for my daughter to get away from her and start afresh. However, this girl is saying that they need to stay together and is insisting that they apply to the same places. My daughter wants to do a specific course that only a few universities offer (good ones that her friend is unlikely to get into), so now this girl is putting pressure on her to choose a different course. She doesn\u2019t want to but I think she is scared to refuse. My husband and I are trying to get her to stand up to this girl but unfortunately she lacks confidence and says she doesn\u2019t want to upset her. She told me that she doesn\u2019t want me to get involved and will be furious if I say anything to anyone. I\u2019m worried that she\u2019ll cave in and about the impact it will have on her future.\n\nIf the relationship you describe was between boyfriend and girlfriend instead of two friends, it would be like coercive control (now a criminal offence). Your daughter\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 sounds toxic and this is a form of bullying. I think you need to gently explain to your daughter that, though she doesn\u2019t want you to get involved, you have to override her on this because you think that she is too scared to stand up to this girl (she may be angry but stay calm and gently insist that this is what you will do). I suspect she hasn\u2019t told anyone at school about this but her teachers need to know what is going on. Contact her head of sixth form to ask for a meeting with you and your husband (without your daughter) and explain the situation.\n\nHer school will almost certainly intervene and make sure that your daughter applies for the courses and universities she wants. They will probably also talk to her so-called friend and tell her that it\u2019s not up to her which course your daughter chooses. However, it sounds as though your daughter has pretty low self-esteem (probably largely as a result of this girl\u2019s controlling behaviour over the years) and needs some help with moving away from her influence. Talk to her and explain that a true friend wouldn\u2019t try to scare or control her and that you are going to help her. Try to persuade her to either see the school counsellor or to contact Relate (relate.org.uk), which offers a young people\u2019s counselling service. Meanwhile, you could tell the girl that she is not welcome at your house.\n\nI wish I had supported my husband more with his grief\n\nI feel so guilty because I gave my husband barely any attention and support when his mother was dying six months ago. My mother was also dying (they died within two weeks of each other). I was caring for her while also trying to help our daughter with her postnatal depression, as she has a toddler to look after. It was just terrible timing. My mother had been ill for a long time but my mother-in-law\u2019s death was quite sudden (from an aggressive type of cancer) and my husband is still grieving. I feel that it\u2019s my fault because I let him down. I was nice to him, of course, but I feel that if I had had more time to listen to him, he would be coping better.\n\nI am so sorry for your losses \u2013 this has obviously been a very difficult and painful time for both of you. But you need to be a little kinder to yourself. You say your husband totally understands that you had to prioritise your own mother and your daughter, but you are blaming yourself for his sadness when, in fact, you sound lovely and could not have done more. Try reading The 15-Minute Rule for Forgiveness by Caroline Buchanan, which focuses on forgiving yourself as well as others and might help you to see that your guilt is misplaced. As your mother had been ill for so long, you had already started grieving for her before she died. But your husband may take longer to feel less intensely sad. Support and listen to him now; try to enjoy your grandchildren together and he will feel better in time. Tell him to get in touch with Cruse Bereavement Care (cruse.org.uk).", "description": "My daughter is very shy and for the past three years she has had a very dominant friend at her school, who has perhaps prevented her from making other friends because this girl is not very popular", "authors": ["Zelda West-Meads You For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/19/15/3606804-0-image-a-34_1568903877593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
