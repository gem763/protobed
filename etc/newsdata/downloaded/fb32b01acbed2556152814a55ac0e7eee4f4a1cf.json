While you're running around cooking Thanksgiving dinner, getting gifts, baking cookies, and attending parties, your floors might not get the attention they deserve. But you can easily remedy dirty floors without lifting a finger\u2014just have a robot vacuum do it for you. Plus, you don't even have to spend too much to get a great one.\n\nThe Eufy Robotvac 11S is typically priced at $220, but right now you can get it on Amazon for $180. That's $50 off and the lowest price we've ever seen outside of Black Friday. Although it may drop down lower this Black Friday, this is a great price to get one to take care of the most tedious chore before the holiday rush starts.\n\nAfter putting the 11S through a rigorous obstacle course to determine its cleaning power, we found that its the best affordable robot vacuum we've ever tested. Not only does it start at a reasonable price point, but it has the cleaning power to boot, picking up 11.6 grams of dirt in a single run during our tests. It was also relatively quiet during its run and has a slim profile, which means it can get under every nook and cranny for a better clean.\n\nWhile robot vacuums aren't the answer to not vacuuming ever again (you'll still have to deep clean every once in a while), they're a great assistant for keeping things nice and tidy throughout the week. At this low price, you might as well get one for yourself and as a gift for a loved one who hates vacuuming as much as you do.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
