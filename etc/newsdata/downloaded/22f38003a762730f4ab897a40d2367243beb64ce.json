We were also reassured by his request that the material be retained by a solicitors' firm, in consideration of the possibility that a further production order may be sought in the future.\u201d\n\nMs Begum is among high-profile Isis members to have been stripped of their British citizenship and has called for the government to repatriate her to Britain.\n\nOfficial guidance states that the home secretary can deprive citizenship for the \u201cpublic good\u201d if a person can apply for alternative nationality, but Bangladeshi officials said Begum was not a dual national and would not be allowed to enter the country.\n\nHer lawyers are taking the case to the Special Immigration and Appeals Commission, which previously found the decision to remove British citizenship from two alleged Islamists of Bangladeshi heritage unlawful.\n\nSajid Javid said he used the controversial powers to \u201cprotect the country\u201d and prevent them from returning to the UK.\n\nThe UK has so far refused to repatriate captured British Isis fighters to face trial, despite mounting international pressure and pleas from Kurdish officials in Syria.\n\nA Home Office source told The Independent that the government\u2019s position on detained British jihadis has not changed since Mr Javid was replaced by Priti Patel in Boris Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nOnly one in 10 of more than 400 jihadis who have already travelled back from Syria have been prosecuted and the government has introduced a suite of new terror laws aiming to make the move easier.\n\nA report released earlier this year by the UN Security Council warned that reductive \u201cjihadi bride\u201d stereotypes were causing female Isis members to be dangerously underestimated by security services.\n\nIt called on the UK and other member states to recognise the \u201cmany different roles, including as supporters, facilitators or perpetrators of terrorist acts\u201d that women play, adding: \u201cThe gendered assumption that women lack agency can have serious security implications by letting dangerous actors slip through the cracks.\u201d", "description": "The Metropolitan Police has lost a legal bid to seize unpublished notes made by journalists who interviewed Shamima Begum.
