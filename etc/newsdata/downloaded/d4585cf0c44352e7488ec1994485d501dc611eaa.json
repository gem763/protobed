There were lines and lines of police and dogs. I was surprised at how intense it was,' she said of the experience.\n\nSniffer dogs, strip searches and an overwhelming police presence at music festivals could soon be banned\n\nAlex Ross-King (left), 19, and Joshua Tam (right), 22, are two of the young people whose deaths are being discussed during the coronial inquest\n\nShe has taken into account the opinions of experts across a range of fields, including psychologists, psychiatrists and the NSW Police Force.\n\nDr Stephen Bright, a psychologist who gave evidence at the inquest, suggested the overwhelming police turnout may have contributed to the latest string of festival deaths.\n\nPoll SHOULD PILL TESTING BE INTRODUCED AT FESTIVALS? YES NO SHOULD PILL TESTING BE INTRODUCED AT FESTIVALS? YES 313 votes\n\nNO 132 votes Now share your opinion\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Ross-King, 19, Joshua Tam, 22, Callum Brosnan, 21, Diana Nguyen, 21, Joseph Pham, 23, and Nathan Tran, 18, all died from drug related cause at various festivals across the state between 2017 and 2019.\n\nNSW Police Force's powers at festivals have been scrutinised after young people came forward claiming they had been unfairly targeted for strip searches.\n\nThe state's law enforcement watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, confirmed it will conduct a three-day investigation into allegations NSW Police are abusing their strip searching rights.\n\nStrip searches are supposed to be carried out on the field when police believe the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it.\n\nThe youngest person subjected to the procedure between 2016 and 2018 was just 10 years old.\n\nThe coroner heard a 28-year-old reveller - whose name was suppressed - was told by female officer at a festival she would make the strip search 'nice and slow' after she denied carrying any drugs.\n\nThe strip search resulted in no drugs being found on her body, but left her feeling humiliated.\n\nNSW Police and the state government are expected to reject the recommendations.\n\nOne source told the publication: ''You might as well legalise drugs at festivals from what is contained in the \u00adreport.'\n\nSniffer dogs could soon be banned after the coroner releases her findings\n\nReveller at Groovin The Moo in Canberra wore a statement jacket supporting the introduction of pill testing\n\nNSW frontbencher Andrew Constance argued the recommendations, if enforced, would do little to stop drug overdoses at festivals.\n\n'If the pure form of the drug is tested and found not to be laced and people still take it, they can still lose their life,' he told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday.\n\n'What we're seeing is young people at these festivals ... dehydrated, overdosing, and they're losing their lives. So I don't see pill testing as the answer.'\n\nMr Constance said education and awareness about the dangers of illicit drugs was instead the best route to safety.\n\nGroovin The Moo in Canberra trialled pill testing earlier this year. Samples of the drugs were measured and weighed before the testing continued. All results were recorded for future reference\n\nCallum Brosnon (pictured) was admitted to Concord Hospital with a suspected drug overdose and died little more than three hours later at 4:30am\n\nFellow NSW frontbencher Sarah Mitchell suggested pill testing could create additional safety problems.\n\n'Pill testing might lead people to have a false sense of security when it comes to using drugs and it's risky,' Ms Mitchell told reporters.\n\nBut NSW Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said in a statement the recommendations 'appear to confirm that the government's zero tolerance approach is doing nothing to save lives'.\n\n'No government in the world has been able to stop people taking drugs,' she said.\n\n'More and more countries are recognising that the war on drugs has been a colossal failure and are adopting harm reduction measures and saving lives.'\n\nThe recommendations are among 40 others that will be finalised in the coming weeks.", "description": "Coroner\u00a0Harriet Grahame is expected to release her recommendations after conducting a coronial inquest into the deaths of six young people at NSW festivals last summer.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19712502-0-image-a-122_1571089726103.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
