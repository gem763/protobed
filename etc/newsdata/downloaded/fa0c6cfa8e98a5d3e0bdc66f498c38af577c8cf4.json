Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nOn Instagram, I am sick of almost everything and everyone. Corporations that are emphatically not my friends displayed as if they are; Kayla Itsines\u2019s tan, taut legs lunging and lunging in an endless loop; an ad for a $65 athletic crop top that is neither supportive enough to be a sports bra nor loose enough to fit a sports bra beneath it. I have winnowed my feed to the essentials \u2014 friends, national parks, dogs \u2014 but still I resent the undertow-tug of this app. I grow warier by the minute of its invasive algorithm, how it mutates with a genuinely frightening alacrity, prompting me to purchase things before I even know I want them.\n\nBut there is exactly one good thing about Instagram. It is a perfect thing, worth wading through all the other consumer bait and nonsense flotsam and #sponcon and other such indignities. It is Patti Smith\u2019s account.\n\nIt\u2019s not all that radical an endeavor, on paper: She takes photos, she writes captions. She honors birthdays, anniversaries, friends living and long gone. She posts dispatches from her travels and tours. Sometimes she just writes about her setlists or her beloved detective shows. But it\u2019s different when she does it. You\u2019ll see.\n\nIf you apply the Heisenberg Principle to social media, then no one can ever be their unaltered self on Instagram, because the sustained observation built into the platform renders authenticity impossible. You\u2019re performing even when you\u2019re not performing. But \u2014 no offense to science \u2014 Patti\u2019s account is a quiet refutation of this law of quantum mechanics. In her daily posts, she seems earnest and fully present, behaving as she would even if we weren\u2019t there to see it. Her writing is so much more than the app calls for or deserves. It\u2019s black tie at a backyard barbecue, a big, gift-wrapped box for a host who insisted \u201cno presents\u201d on the invite.\n\nThis spring I scrolled into a carousel of three photos of Patti meandering the streets of Verona at night with her daughter, about which Patti wrote:\n\nThis is night-walking with Jesse in Verona. Stumbling the ancient cobblestone streets where the children Of Shakespeare loved and wept.\n\nShe shows how work persists amid horror, as if proving to the guy Lana Del Rey is singing to (\u201cYour poetry\u2019s bad, and you blame the news\u201d) that he has no excuse. After the Notre Dame fire, she shared a photo of her coffee and her hand on an open notebook page with this message:\n\nThank you all for your poems, tears and words of resilience. Worlds are created, torn down, yet we abide. Now turning our thoughts to humankind and the needs of our children and our precious earth.\n\nOn August 4, after the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, left dozens dead in under 24 hours, she wrote:\n\nThis is a mourning wreath nothing but grief nothing but blooms cascading as dust nothing but hatred and the terrible cost\n\nWhat would be insufferable from almost any other source \u2014 coffee and an open notebook, arranged just so \u2014 feels generous and welcoming from her. They\u2019re posts that make plain what her work requires, the ritual that makes her art and the art that\u2019s present in the ritual itself.\n\nUsually poetry on Instagram is placed in the image, not the caption (think of that Rupi Kaur aesthetic). There is something about this construction that makes every line look like it is trying very hard to be profound and, as a result, it reads like a parody. Patti writes her poetry in the caption text. I don\u2019t quite know why this is better, but it is.\n\nHere she is on Emily Bront\u00eb, on what would be the writer\u2019s birthday:\n\nThis is a portrait of Emily Bronte, by her brother Bramwell. Writing under the name of Ellis Bell, she produced the masterpiece Wuthering Heights, before she died of consumption at the age of 30. Emily was said to possess the eyes of a half tamed creature. One can imagine her spirit, entirely untamable, united with her dog Keeper, roaming free, in her beloved wild and desolate Yorkshire moors. Happy birthday Emily Bronte now truly unfettered, may your cup runneth over.\n\nMaybe the most unsavory aspect of social media is the way our ache for validation just radiates out of us, no matter what we do or how we frame our posts. The blaring neon \u201cLIKE ME\u201d of it all. I am awed at how deeply uninterested Patti seems in that pursuit, how she can be on the platform without bending herself to fit its contours. Every day, she makes something small but genuine and singular in a space that all but mandates artifice and sameness. I come across her posts and it\u2019s like a birthday card in a pile of bills. Something sacred, or close to it, in a space that is anything but, like the Bible in the nightstand at a Motel 6.\n\nHer Instagram feels of a kind with \u201cThe Red Hand Files,\u201d Nick Cave\u2019s advice column, in which the Bad Seeds frontman tends to the insecurities, curiosities, and wonders of his readers \u2014 from \u201cWhat is your earliest memory?\u201d to \u201cHow do you deal with evil?\u201d to \u201cHave your own songs ever made you cry whilst performing them onstage?\u201d \u2014 with generosity and care, and without an intermediary. (\u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he told fans. \u201cThere will be no moderator. This will be between you and me. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d)\n\nCave began his column in September 2018. Patti joined Instagram a bit earlier, in March of that year. She has 467,000 followers, but her account still feels like a wonderful secret, so much so that I hesitated writing this because I did not want to ruin it. Just as I hesitate to tell you my favorite thing about this favorite thing: Her DMs are open. Anyone could just reach out to her and maybe she would read it and write back. (Right now, she\u2019s soliciting feedback on her new memoir, Year of the Monkey.) Even you or me. I haven\u2019t, but I could. I might! I am just trying to figure out the right thing to say. But knowing it is theoretically possible has delighted me for months.\n\nI watch people comment on her posts all the time, often to tell her that it is their birthday, and she will reply \u201chappy birthday,\u201d sometimes with emoji. I\u2019m writing this on my birthday. Maybe this will be the day I write to her, and see if, when she drains the last of her coffee and sets her notebook aside, she writes back.", "description": "Every day, she makes something small but genuine and singular in a space that all but mandates artifice and sameness.", "authors": ["Jessica Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/20/20-patti-smith.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
