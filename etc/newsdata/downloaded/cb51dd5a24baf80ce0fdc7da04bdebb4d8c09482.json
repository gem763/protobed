(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA new study found that the vast majority of baby foods tested contain heavy metals, which can harm a child\u2019s brain development.\n\nIn the study, commissioned by Healthy Babies Bright Futures (HBBF) and conducted by the toxicology and economic research firm Abt Associates, tests were performed on 168 different containers of baby food from 61 U.S. baby food brands. Researchers found heavy metals \u2014 specifically, arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury \u2014 in 95 percent of the baby foods tested.\n\nAs the report points out, all of the heavy metals are \u201cdevelopmental neurotoxins,\u201d adding, \u201cthey can harm a baby\u2019s developing brain and nervous system\u201d and \u201care linked to IQ loss from exposures early in life.\u201d\n\nThe majority of baby food tested (40 percent) contained three different heavy metals, with 26 percent of baby foods containing all four heavy metals. Only nine baby foods (5 percent) were free of heavy metals. Lead was the most common heavy metal, found in 94 percent of baby foods, followed by cadmium, which was in 75 percent of baby foods. That was followed by arsenic (73 percent of baby foods) and mercury (32 percent).\n\n\u201cWe were surprised that so many of the baby foods had more than one heavy metal,\u201d Charlotte Brody, a registered nurse and the national director of Healthy Babies Bright Futures, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe impact is additive. A little bit of lead, a little bit of arsenic and a little bit cadmium add up.\u201d\n\nInfant rice cereal and rice-based snacks were the worst offenders. \u201cThese popular baby foods are not only high in inorganic arsenic, the most toxic form of arsenic, but also are nearly always contaminated with all four toxic metals,\u201d according to the report.\n\nHeavy metals in foods\n\nHeavy metals, like arsenic, are found naturally in the environment (as well as through pollution) and can \u201center the food supply through soil, water or air,\u201d according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nCertain crops are more likely to absorb these heavy metals \u2014 notably, rice, leafy greens and root vegetables, such as carrots and sweet potatoes, which the reports says retain more than most other types of fruits and vegetables.\n\nBut in some cases, fresh is the better way to go. The report found that peaches and green beans from the baby food aisle are \u201cless likely to contain detectable levels of lead than canned versions of these foods, while carrot and sweet potato baby foods have higher lead detection rates than their peeled, fresh counterparts.\u201d\n\nImproving food safety standards can make a significant difference. The report urges the FDA to take action by establishing health-protective standards, including a heavy metals testing program for baby food, as well as factoring the cumulative health effects of infants consuming multiple types of heavy metals found in baby foods. \u201cWhen FDA and baby food companies address one contaminant in one type of food, children benefit,\u201d noted the report. \u201cBut truly protecting children necessitates addressing the many contaminants that collectively harm a child\u2019s healthy development.\u201d\n\nAdds Brody: \u201cParents shouldn\u2019t have to worry about this. Parents should be able to buy any food that\u2019s on the shelf and know that it\u2019s as safe as it can be.\u201d\n\nHow to protect your baby\n\nThere are steps that parents can take to reduce their baby\u2019s exposure to heavy metals found in food. It\u2019s worth noting that going organic may not necessarily help. According to the report, \u201cOrganic standards do not address these contaminants.\u201d Consumer Reports\u2019 own testing of baby foods in 2018 reached the same conclusion, stating, \u201cOrganic foods were as likely to contain heavy metals as conventional foods.\u201d\n\nHowever, peeling produce when possible can help by removing some of the heavy metals in the skin \u2014 although, as Brody says, \u201cit\u2019s a shame because there are nutrients in the peel.\u201d\n\nIn general, regularly giving your baby different types of foods \u2014 not just relying on sweet potatoes and carrots multiple times a week \u2014 also helps. \u201cIt\u2019s like mercury in tuna \u2014 the best way around it is to just not eat tuna every day,\u201d says Brody.\n\nParents can also make specific food swaps to help reduce a baby\u2019s risk of exposure to these heavy metals. The researchers recommend:\n\nSwap infant rice cereal for oatmeal, barley, quinoa, buckwheat or multigrain infant cereals\n\nSwap puff (rice) snacks for rice-free ones, such as cut-up apples, unsweetened applesauce, bananas, cheese, peaches and yogurt\n\nSwap teething biscuits and rice husks for frozen bananas or peeled, chilled cucumber\n\nSwap rice from Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas or ones labeled \u201cU.S.\u201d (all of which have the highest arsenic levels, according to Consumer Reports) with basmati rice grown in California, India and Pakistan or U.S. sushi rice, which have the lowest arsenic levels. Brown rice tends to have more arsenic than white rice.\n\nSwap fruit juice (which can contain traces of arsenic and lead, along with being high in sugar) for plain water\n\nReduce how often babies consume carrots and sweet potatoes (both high in lead and cadmium) each week and serve a variety of fruits and vegetables instead\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A new study that tested U.S. baby food found that 95 percent contained heavy metals, including arsenic and lead, which are harmful to children's brain development.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6f2wSSDEBl9Mjx5QmN37XA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/647b81d0-f10f-11e9-8d1f-484b8d2d2beb", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
