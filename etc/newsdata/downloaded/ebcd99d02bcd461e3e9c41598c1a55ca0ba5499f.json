USA TODAY\n\nDestination Maternity, which owns its namesake brand and the Motherhood Maternity chain, is closing more than 180 of its stores as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection case, according to court documents.\n\nThe New Jersey-based retailer, which was already closing about a dozen stores before it filed for bankruptcy, has about 436 domestic standalone locations.\n\nThe retailer warned it may close additional stores depending on how its bankruptcy goes. The company operates stores under several brands, including Motherhood Maternity, Destination Maternity and A Pea in the Pod.\n\nLiquidation sales at the closing locations are expected to wrap up before the end of the year and will be handled by Gordon Brothers Retail Partners.\n\nAccording to store locator websites as of Thursday, there were 62 Destination Maternity stores, 40 A Pea in the Pod, and 799 Motherhood Maternity stores, which includes outlet stores and shops-within-a-shop at various department stores and baby specialty retailers.\n\nMore store closings coming: An estimated 12,000 shops could close by the end of 2019\n\nDestination Maternity bankruptcy: Retailer files for Chapter 11 and announces upcoming closings\n\nBankruptcy allows companies to escape unprofitable leases and allows companies to stay in business as they work on turnaround plans. In some cases when retailers announce a portion of stores will close, additional closings follow.\n\nFounded as a mail-order catalog business called Mothers Work in 1982, the company went public in 1992, acquired the Motherhood Maternity and A Pea in the Pod brands in 1995 and expanded rapidly in the years thereafter.\n\nBut the company, in a court document, blamed the retail industry's turmoil, declining birth rates, high rents and leadership turnover for faltering. The company has had five CEOs in the last five years.\n\nMore than 10 months into 2019, there have already been 48% more store closings announced than in all of 2018, according to a recent report from global marketing research firm Coresight Research.\n\nBased on Coresight's figures, retailers' earnings reports, bankruptcy filings and other records, so far more than 8,600 stores are slated to shutter this year and thousands of locations already gone.\n\nBlack Friday store closings: REI encourages shoppers to #OptOutside on Black Friday\n\nHoliday shopping time: Walmart kicks off shorter holiday shopping season with deals starting Friday\n\nPhase 1 closings\n\nThese stores were already closing before the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMotherhood Maternity\n\nCentral Mall: 5111 Rogers Ave., Fort Smith, Arkansas\n\nThe Avenue Viera: 2261 Town Center Ave., Melbourne, Florida\n\nWaterford Lakes Town Center: 385 N.
