It makes it tough to run a business,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan thinks the Fed will cut interest rates three more times, by a quarter-point in October, December and the first-quarter.\n\nBrown had penciled in one more rate cut this year - in December - but said the weak ISM makes an October move more likely.\n\nBeth Ann Bovino, chief economist at S&P Global Ratings, thinks the fractious Fed interest-rate committee may not ease in October.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a heated discussion but at think point in time I think they are going to stay on the sidelines in October,\u201d Bovino said.\n\nEconomists said that the pace of Fed action could ultimately depend on the U.S. September employment report, set for release on Friday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect the economy created 147,000 jobs in the month.\n\n\u201cIf we get deterioration in the labor market, the Fed will come in a lot quicker,\u201d Brown said.\n\nStocks DJIA, -1.28% also took a sharp turn lower after the ISM data.
