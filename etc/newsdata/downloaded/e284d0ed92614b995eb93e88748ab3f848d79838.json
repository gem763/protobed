REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nGlobally, the company reported better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 5.9% on strong sales in markets such as the UK and France.\n\nNet income fell 2% to $1.61 billion in the quarter from $1.64 billion a year earlier.\n\nTotal revenue, including both U.S. and overseas operations, rose to $5.43 billion, slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations of $5.49 billion.", "description": "McDonald's Corp missed Wall Street estimates for profit for the first time in two years on Tuesday as more investment to spruce up U.S. restaurants and speed up delivery weighed on the world's biggest fast food chain, sending its shares down 3%.", "authors": ["Aishwarya Venugopal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443746550&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L15F", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
