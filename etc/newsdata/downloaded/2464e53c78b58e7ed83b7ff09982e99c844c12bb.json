That's down 80,000 b/d from its August estimate.\n\nThe group, which consists of some of the world's most powerful oil-producing nations, attributed the downgrade to weaker-than-expected economic data in the first-half of the year and deteriorating growth projections for the remainder of 2019.\n\nIn 2020, OPEC said it sees world oil demand increasing by 1.08 million b/d. This represents a downward adjustment of 60,000 b/d from the previous month's assessment, \"mainly to accommodate changes to the world economic outlook.\"\n\nThe report comes as OPEC and allied non-OPEC partners, sometimes referred to as OPEC+, prepare to meet in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.\n\nThe meeting is likely to provide crucial clues about how far some of OPEC's most powerful players are willing to go to get prices on a firmer footing.", "description": "The report comes as OPEC and allied non-OPEC partners, sometimes referred to as OPEC+, prepare to meet in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105996228-1561957845624gettyimages-979505604.jpeg?v=1562843461", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
