But there are truths to be known about how a society should flourish. Whenever we think of the welfare of others, questions of intentions, decisions and actions, arise.\n\nNowadays, there are instances galore with politicians and businessmen siphoning off, swindling and laundering money. These deeds are serious threats to the economic prosperity and social wellness of a country.\n\nAcquiring power and amassing wealth are not considered bad, per se, but both become negative only when they are acquired and amassed by deceit, ignoring dharma and used for only selfish purposes. Some believe wealth and power bring happiness along with nature and attainment; others understand it as the moral goal of life or as an aspect of chance, synonymous with luck; still others are deluded in the mirage of accumulating more and more; yet most of those who have made easy gains have fallen from grace.\n\nThe moot question that bedevils every thinker is: How to live a meaningful life, which in turn leads to happy living? There are more questions: Is individual happiness on personal parameters such as good health, power, money and comfortable living enough to make a society better? If personal health, wealth and ease related to happiness are not meaningful, then what in reality make one\u2019s life meaningful to society?\n\nWhen wealth acquisition is motivated by greed, it becomes negative activity. Deceit is linked to immoral/ unethical behaviour. Though power and money have been handy always, yet, happiness eludes most who hanker after selfish gains at the cost of societal good.\n\nFor happiness, one needs to focus on the present, whereas for being meaningful, one has to think more of the present, past and future. Happiness is fleeting with the passage of time, while meaningfulness of life lasts longer. Happiness is what others give to us but giving to others makes one\u2019s life meaningful. So drawing meaning from a larger context: Doesn\u2019t looking beyond oneself make one\u2019s life meaningful and happy?\n\nAs Bhagwad Gita stresses, you have the right to work but not to the fruits thereof. Work done with selfish motives is inferior by far to the selfless service rendered, that is, karma yoga. Selfishness is always thinking about the end product and to create wealth without hard work. When faith replaces doubt, when selfless service eliminates selfish striving, there is scope to find happiness and peace.\n\nPower and wealth have been viewed as both a blessing and curse; as a prerequisite of virtue and as an embodiment of vice; as an expression of merit and of fault. Hence not only is the history of power and wealth contentious, it is also intimately bound with moral evaluations. These differing evaluations themselves indicate a range of divergent cultural judgments.\n\nPower and wealth has a central place in political and economic vocabularies. While there is perhaps a core linkage with the notion of resource, the terms resonate fleeting positive emotions that come with happiness along with a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in life, and these emotions and sense of meaning must reinforce societal stability. In essence, the overall prosperity, peace and happiness of a nation depends on how meaningfully an individual contributes to societal welfare.", "description": "By Vijay Hashia The welfare of a society depends on many factors, ranging from genetics and neurobiology to sociology and economics.
