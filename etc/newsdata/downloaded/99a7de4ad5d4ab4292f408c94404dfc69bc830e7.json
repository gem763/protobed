A cross-country runner who studied design at Parsons, she first conceptualized the company while running on the West Side Highway. Now, the athleisure brand is a favorite among millennial women, and it\u2019s only getting bigger: The label has raised close to $60 million in funding, according to Business of Fashion, and currently has nine storefronts (a 10th is coming to Flatiron in New York soon). Haney lives in Austin, TX, and is expecting her first child with fianc\u00e9 Mark Wystrach, who is a country singer for the band Midland. Here\u2019s how she gets it done.\n\nOn her morning routine:\n\nRight when I wake up I drink a cold glass of lemon water and do 30 grateful breaths. I take a deep breath and think of what I\u2019m grateful for. So this morning it was my dog, Bowie. And then I almost always jog three miles on the hike-and-bike trail down here in Austin. After that, I jump into a cold shower \u2014 in Austin in the summertime that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nOn working out at work:\n\nI have 7 to 9:30 a.m. blocked out as a protected \u201cDoing Things\u201d time. I usually get to the office before 9:30, but it\u2019s important to make sure that exercise time is blocked out and free of meetings. Our headquarters is called the Doing Things Headquarters. We have a lot of activities built into the office culture. Whether it\u2019s walking around the block or playing tennis, it\u2019s central to our reason for being. Now that I\u2019m pregnant, I exercise more frequently and in shorter spurts throughout the day to keep my brain sane so I can show up for the team. Surfing pregnancy-hormone waves is an extreme sport!\n\nOn a typical day:\n\nFor me, creating a framework for doing things is really important, and keeping a routine is how I stay organized. My schedule is the same every day: the creative work I put in the beginning of the day, and the operational and logistical work I put at the end of the day. A monotonous schedule allows me to be creative. I have to be pretty rigorous around that.\n\nOn managing stress:\n\nIt\u2019s all about finding ways to create endorphins to combat stress. I think the best way I do that is through exercising, smiling, sex, and eating bananas. Those are my go-to methods. I know eating chocolate gives you endorphins, and I know that eating does. Eating a banana every day is a trigger for me to feel better. I\u2019m not sure why. I think I\u2019ve trained myself to do that. But it\u2019s part of my stress relief.\n\nOn multitasking:\n\nIn terms of leading OV, my challenge is finding the headspace to do less, and to do one thing at a time. I\u2019m naturally a multitasker, but I have to be conscious of that and combat that because it doesn\u2019t lead to my best work or leadership. Gary Keller wrote a really good book called The One Thing that I\u2019d recommend to anyone who feels like they have too much to do and are always busy. It takes a lot of discipline to do one thing at a time. After I read it, I got in touch with Keller and started working with him in a mentor relationship. [Ed. note: Keller is an investor in Outdoor Voices.]\n\nOn creating Outdoor Voices:\n\nI never thought I\u2019d be in apparel. I grew up in Boulder, which is a super outdoorsy place. We\u2019d go hiking every day. Through high school I was a real tomboy and played every activity really competitively. I went to New York after high school and applied to Parsons. I\u2019ve always been design-inclined. I was jogging one day and it dawned on me that I didn\u2019t have a team to keep me accountable for exercising. And I realized that as you get older, being active takes on a whole new meaning and you don\u2019t have that accountability system. So I thought it would be cool to have that community to help you exercise without the competitive nature of sports. I wanted to create a group around recreational activities that didn\u2019t take itself so seriously.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, I wanted an outfit for activity that was comfortable but more in line with what I wear every day. I wanted something that didn\u2019t scream, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be super fast.\u201d So that was the initial inspiration for creating Outdoor Voices. We talk about it as a community of exercisers, not athletes.\n\nOn positive thinking:\n\nMy personal mantra is \u201ctotally possible,\u201d and I\u2019d like to add to that \u201cif you can think it, you can do it.\u201d I believe that\u2019s true. Something we talk about a lot at OV is \u201cendorphins make you happy, and people want to work with happy people.\u201d\n\nOn ambition:\n\nI would say I\u2019m very hungry. I wake up with an insane drive. That\u2019s something I was born with. I think that drive is really fueled by progress. I wake up every day wanting to be better. And I think that relates to ambition. It\u2019s the same feeling I had in fifth grade when I wanted to win the race running around the school. Feeling like I\u2019m on a path to be great and working at it every day is a really addicting feeling. There\u2019s no finish line, but there\u2019s an opportunity every day to get better. That motivates me and drives me.\n\nOn winding down after work:\n\nI work pretty late. I always do some sort of activity to end my day. Outdoor Voices has an intramural soccer team, and then Barton Springs [a popular swimming pool in Austin] at night is fantastic. We end up there a lot after 9 p.m., when it\u2019s free. A lot of times I end up at a burger joint after that, and then home.\n\nOn her nighttime rituals:\n\nBefore I go to bed, I put my legs up on the wall to get the circulation going. It\u2019s something I used to do when I ran cross country, and it relaxes me. I have a little sleep noise machine that I\u2019ve had for a long time. I call it a sleep sheep. I end my day by reading David Sedaris, because it\u2019s important to give your mind some recess.\n\nStay in touch.
