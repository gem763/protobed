Bus services were also affected.\n\n\u201cThere are calls online for using fake boarding passes, fake air tickets or fake flight booking information to enter the terminal buildings ... The Airport Authority reminds that such behavior could amount to forgery or using false instrument,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nOne man, a 73-year-old retiree from Canada traveling to Hong Kong, said he had no problem with the protests if they were \u201clegal and peaceful\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are just trying to voice their demands. As a civilized resident I think these demands are legitimate,\u201d the man, who asked to be identified only as Chow, told Reuters.\n\nAustralian traveler Jody Paul, 55, who spent a week on holiday in the former British colony, said the protests hadn\u2019t affected her trip.\n\nProtesters react to tear gas after a sit-in at Yuen Long to protest against violence that happened two months ago when white-shirted men wielding pipes and clubs wounded both anti-government protesters and passers-by, in Hong Kong, China September 21, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\n\u201cIt was lovely - we didn\u2019t see any of the protesters or any of the action. I was hoping for a glimpse.\u201d\n\nRIVALS CLASH\n\nThe violence has hit pockets of Hong Kong at different times over more than three months, allowing life to go on as normal for the vast majority most of the time.\n\nBut pictures of petrol bombs and street clashes broadcast worldwide present a huge embarrassment for Beijing just days ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has already called off a big fireworks display to mark the day in case of further clashes. China, which has a People\u2019s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong, has said it has faith in Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to solve the crisis.\n\nPolice fired tear gas to disperse pro-democracy protesters who threw petrol bombs in two new towns on Saturday after pro-China groups pulled down some of the \u201cLennon Walls\u201d of anti-government messages. There were violent clashes elsewhere in the city.\n\nPolice condemned the violence and said there had been many serious injuries in fights between people of \u201cdifferent views\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey threw petrol bombs at police vehicles and police officers, and even attempted to snatch the revolver of a police officer,\u201d police said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe protests picked up in June over legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Demands have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest.", "description": "Hong Kong riot police took up position at the main rail station serving the airport on Sunday to prevent a new anti-government protest targeting air travel after a night of violent street clashes in the Chinese-ruled territory.", "authors": ["Poppy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432479832&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L00T", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
