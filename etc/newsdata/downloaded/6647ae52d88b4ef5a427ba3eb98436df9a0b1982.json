It\u2019s a new high-stakes mission even as American troops are withdrawn from other parts of the country.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper says the military\u2019s oil field mission also will ensure income for Syrian Kurds who are counted on by Washington to continue guarding Islamic State prisoners and helping American forces combat remnants of the group \u2014 even as President Donald Trump continues to insist all U.S. troops will come home.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a policeman in this case,\u201d Trump said Monday, referring to America\u2019s role after Turkey\u2019s incursion in Syria. In the face of Turkey\u2019s early October warning that it would invade and create a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of its border, Trump ordered U.S. forces to step aside, effectively abandoning a Kurdish militia that had partnered with U.S. troops.\n\nEsper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke at a Pentagon news conference to cheer the successful mission by U.S. special operations forces Saturday that ended with IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi blowing himself up. Esper called al-Baghdadi\u2019s death a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to an organization that already had lost its hold on a wide swath of territory in Syria and Iraq.\n\nMilley said the U.S. had disposed of al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains \u201cappropriately\u201d and in line with the laws of armed conflict. He also said U.S. forces retrieved unspecified intelligence information from the site, which he described as a place in northwestern Syria where the IS leader had been \u201cstaying on a consistent basis.\u201d\n\nA U.S. military dog that was slightly injured in the raid has recovered and is back at work, Milley said.\n\nEsper hinted at uncertainty ahead in Syria , even though the Islamic State has lost its inspirational leader, with the Syrian government exploiting support from Russia and Iran.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in Syria remains complex,\u201d Esper said.\n\nA big part of that complexity is the rejiggering of the battlefield since Trump earlier this month ordered a full U.S. troop withdrawal from positions along the Turkish border in northeastern Syria. Even as those troops leave, other U.S. forces are heading to the oil-producing region of eastern Syria, east of the Euphrates River.\n\nTrump recently has proposed hiring an American oil company to begin repairing Syria\u2019s oil infrastructure, which has been devastated by years of war. Repeated U.S. airstrikes against facilities for oil storage, transport, processing and refining starting in 2015 inflicted heavy damage.\n\nEsper said last week that a \u201cmechanized\u201d force would reinforce U.S. positions in the oil region, meaning a force equipped with tanks or Bradley infancy carriers. On Monday he provided no details about the makeup of the force.\n\nHe referred to \u201cmultiple state and nonstate\u201d forces vying for control of Syrian territory and resources, including the oil. He said that while the main U.S. military mission is to ensure the \u201cenduring defeat\u201d of the Islamic State, that now will include denying oil income for the group.\n\n\u201cThe United States will retain control of oil fields in northeast Syria,\u201d Esper said, adding that at the height of al-Baghdadi\u2019s rule, those oil fields provided the bulk of his group\u2019s income.\n\nEsper\u2019s remarks echoed Trump\u2019s focus on the oil. But whose oil is it?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the oil,\u201d Trump said during a speech to police officers in Chicago. \u201cRemember that, I\u2019ve always said that. Keep the oil. We want to keep the oil \u2014 $45 million a month \u2014 keep the oil. We\u2019ve secured the oil.\u201d\n\nEsper emphasized that the purpose of securing Syria\u2019s oil region is to deny income to the Islamic State. But a reporter asked whether the mission includes preventing Russian and Syrian government forces from entering that area.\n\n\u201cThe short answer is yes, it presently does,\u201d Esper said, \u201cbecause in that case we want to make sure\u201d the Syrian Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, \u201cdoes have access to the resources in order to guard the prisons and arm their own troops, in order to assist us with the defeat-ISIS mission.\u201d\n\nThis area has been the scene of unusual confrontations with U.S. forces, such as a one-sided battle in February 2018 in which a pro-Syrian government force reported to be mainly private Russian mercenaries unleashed an artillery barrage near a small U.S. military outpost. As then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recounted the episode in congressional testimony two months later, he ordered the attacking force to be \u201cannihilated \u2013 and it was\u201d after Russian authorities insisted the attackers were not their troops.\n\nEsper said Monday that he has seen no sign of Syrian or Russian forces challenging U.S. control of the oil fields.\n\nIn recent days, however, U.S. officials detected what they considered to be a significant massing of Syrian and Russian forces on the western side of the Euphrates River near Deir el-Zour, a U.S. official said Monday. Russian officials were contacted by phone, and the U.S. was given assurances that the staged forces would not move east, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.\n\nJim Jeffrey, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Syria, seemed to refer to this episode when he said last Friday, \u201cWe are currently very concerned about certain developments in the south, in the Deir el-Zour area. I\u2019ve talked to my Russian colleague about that and we\u2019re having other contacts with the Russians concerning that situation. We think it is under control now.\u201d\n\nAfter expelling Islamic State militants from southeastern Syria in 2018, the Kurds seized control of the more profitable oil fields to the south in Deir el-Zour province.\n\nA quiet arrangement has existed between the Kurds and the Syrian government, whereby Damascus buys the surplus through middlemen in a profitable smuggling operation that has continued despite political differences. The Kurdish-led administration sells crude oil to private refiners, who use home-made primitive refineries to process fuel and diesel and sell it back to the Kurdish-led administration.\n\nThe oil was always likely to be a bargaining chip by the Kurds to negotiate a deal with the Syrian government, which unsuccessfully tried to reach the oil fields to retake them from IS. With Trump saying he plans to keep forces to secure the oil, it seems the oil will continue to be used for leverage\u2014 with Moscow and Damascus.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Pivoting from the dramatic killing of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Pentagon is increasing U.S. efforts to protect Syria's oil fields", "authors": ["Robert Burns"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/syria_oil_fields_pentagon_isis.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
