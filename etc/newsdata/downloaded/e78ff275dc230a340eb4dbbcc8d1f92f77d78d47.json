It\u2019s not all his fault - a patchwork line has given him and Giovani Bernard nowhere to go.\n\nThe Bengals know they\u2019ve got to get that fixed Sunday in Buffalo (2-0) in order to avoid another 0-3 start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to step it up, and you definitely can expect a change real soon,\u201d Mixon said .\n\nIt\u2019s more than just one running back picking up the pace.\n\nMixon led the AFC with 1,168 yards rushing last season, carrying the load in an offense that missed quarterback Andy Dalton, receiver A.J. Green and tight end Tyler Eifert for a significant part of the season.\n\nFirst-year coach Zac Taylor wanted to make the running game a focus of his offensive scheme and showcase Mixon, who has proven a reliable receiver out of the backfield as well.\n\nA line that\u2019s been depleted by injuries failed to give Mixon and Bernard any room in the first two games, forcing Dalton to throw the ball 93 times.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers shut down Mixon on Sunday and pulled away to a 41-17 victory that underscored the Bengals\u2019 imbalance - they managed only 25 yards on 19 carries.\n\nMixon is feeling the frustration.\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no reason right now that I shouldn\u2019t be at least averaging 120 to 125 yards a game,\u201d Mixon said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s all on me.\u201d\n\nNot entirely.\n\nMixon has run for only 27 yards on 17 carries this season, a 1.6-yard average. Of those 17 runs, two went for no gain and five resulted in a loss as defenders poured into the backfield. He has only two runs longer than 4 yards, with his longest going for 9 yards.\n\nMuch of it is linked to a line that\u2019s been a work in progress since left tackle Jonah Williams tore a labrum in the offseason and left guard Clint Boling retired before the start of camp because of a blood clot. Cordy Glenn moved back to left tackle but has missed the first two games with a concussion. Andre Smith moved to left tackle but suffered a groin injury Sunday. Rookie left guard Michael Jordan suffered a knee injury, forcing Billy Price to fill in.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of instability up front, and it shows.\n\n\u201cThis goes way back,\u201d Price said. \u201cFootball is controlled chaos. So you\u2019ve got to go in and throw it around any way you can.\u201d\n\nThe line remains uncertain heading into the game at Buffalo because of the injuries. Mixon twisted his left ankle during the season opener, but returned against the 49ers and said it wasn\u2019t an issue. Bernard hasn\u2019t had much better success, either, managing only 27 yards on 13 carries for a 2.1-yard average in the first two games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing terrible,\u201d Mixon said. \u201cMe personally, that\u2019s not what I do. I\u2019m always on tip-top, A-game performance. But like I said, I\u2019ll get back to doing the things that I do best, and that\u2019s running that rock. I\u2019m going to get it popping real soon.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Smith had a limited practice Thursday after sitting out the previous day, an indication he\u2019ll be able to play in Buffalo. Glenn and Jordan were held out for a second straight day. Price will start at left guard if Jordan can\u2019t go. Defensive end Carl Lawson (hamstring) and cornerback B.W. Webb (forearm) also were held out for the second day in a row.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joe Mixon knows the ugly rushing numbers - his own, and the Bengals' overall.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/49ers_bengals_football_17274_c0-132-3164-1976_s1770x1032.jpg?97d46c7fceceea2a5fef15e9e9a798a2b1fdefd6", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
