About one in eight buyers surveyed by Allianz revealed they wished they had a more realistic view about the properties within their budget and how long the process would take.\n\nMORE: Safety warning puts unit residents on edge\n\nBalmain\u2019s iconic Unity Hall for sale\n\nA fifth wished they knew most about mortgage insurance, while 11.3 per cent wished they were better informed about moving costs. Nine per cent wished they were more clued up about stamp duty charges.\n\nRecent buyers Gemma Hudson and Jake Healey said one of the most stressful parts of the home-buying journey was finding the location where they could get the best value for money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a sense of what\u2019s standard in an area,\u201d Ms Hudson said. \u201cWe ended up looking at almost 80 properties.\n\n\u201cSome we looked at, they weren\u2019t all that great, and then you\u2019d find out the price was $2 million. It was frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe couple eventually settled on a new property in Chifley and walked away \u201cvery happy\u201d. \u201cIt was actually more stressful for us once we had bought the home,\u201d Ms Hudson said. \u201cThere were lots of different things we needed to get quickly.\u201d\n\nAllianz Australia general manager home and lifestyle Rachael Poole said buyers could reduce the stress of the process with education.\n\n\u201cMany homeowners tell us they wished they had known more about the additional costs involved in buying a house,\u201d Ms Poole said. \u201cProspective buyers can reduce potential stress by better understanding the end-to-end costs of purchasing.\u201d\n\nKeeping some perspective also helped \u2014 most buyers wrapped up their searches within six months, she added. \u201cWe know that buying a home is one of the most stressful life events,\u201d Ms Poole said. \u201cWhile this stress is understandable, know that it should be reasonably short-lived.\u201d\n\nBuyers also shared some common strategies for helping mitigate their stress levels: 42.8 per cent were talking to family and friends and 25.5 per cent were trying to readjust their expectations.\n\nAllianz wellbeing advocate Dr Sarah McKay said this was a positive start but many buyers could do more to make the process less stressful.\n\n\u201cWe are social creatures, so connecting with family and friends throughout the buying journey can help alleviate stress,\u201d Dr McKay said, adding people tended to feel stressed when their coping mechanisms were overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cBuying a home represents more than a roof over our head,\u201d she said. \u201cOur homes protect us \u2026 (they) tap into our basic human need for security. With all of this at stake, it\u2019s not surprising that buying a home can be stressful.\u201d\n\nProperty seekers could feel better about their search for a home simply by rethinking their stress response, she said. Doing this meant seeing the positives at the end of the challenge causing the stress, such as visualising a beautiful family home once the buying process was finished.\n\nConnecting with others also helped, she said, pointing out that moving was something most people could relate to. \u201cEven if you feel you lack time or mental energy to socialise, have a coffee with a friend, ask someone to help pack crockery, or cry on a supportive shoulder over the dream home you lost in the auction,\u201d Dr McKay said.\n\nAnother key stress reliever was \u201cletting yourself grieve\u201d. \u201cIf you do not get the house you wanted or the home purchase journey did not go as planned, give yourself time.\u201d", "description": "Searching for property is taking its toll on Aussie home buyers, with more than half saying it affected their well-being, while research also revealed some common points of frustration.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11150136/capi_c24294213fd83757bc6d164a6b611970_e1d61a2a5209589392812a797c6f171e.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
