Buffalo beat Pittsburgh in regulation for the first time since April 23, 2013.\n\nKrueger last coached in the NHL in 2012-13 when the Edmonton Oilers had 19 wins during a shortened 48-game regular season. Buffalo went 33-39-10 under Phil Housley last season.\n\nSheary, who won two Stanley Cups with the Penguins, has four goals and six points in four games against his former team. He scored two goals twice last season, including a March 1 home game against Pittsburgh.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s last game in Pittsburgh was an overtime win in November 2018 when the Sabres snapped an eight-game winless streak in Pittsburgh. The victory Thursday gave Buffalo consecutive road wins in Pittsburgh for the first time since 2012-13.\n\nEvgeni Malkin scored on the power play for Pittsburgh. Matt Murray made 38 saves.\n\nPittsburgh had 15 wins in its past 18 games against the Sabres, dating to Oct. 5, 2013. The Penguins also previously won eight of nine home games against the Sabres and 11 of 15 since PPG Paints Arena opened in 2010-11. Pittsburgh earned an NHL-best 13th-straight playoff berth last season, but was swept from the opening round of the playoffs by the New York Islanders.\n\nThe Penguins didn\u2019t make sweeping changes to the roster. Instead, they brought in wingers Alex Galchenyuk and Dominik Kahun, through trades with Arizona and Chicago, in addition to free-agent pickup Brandon Tanev, as head coach Mike Sullivan seeks a brand of intelligent and responsible hockey that demands responsibility at both ends of the ice.\n\nThe Sabres took control early with 10 of the game\u2019s first 12 shots and the opening goal.\n\nSheary started the scoring at 5:23 following a Penguins\u2019 turnover at their own blueline. He took a pass from Casey Mittelstadt and beat Murray to the blocker side from in close.\n\nMalkin tied it at 5:50 of the second period with a power-play goal. He beat a screened Hutton with a wrist shot from the left faceoff dot. Malkin has points in 10 straight games against Buffalo.\n\nSheary gave Buffalo a 2-1 lead with a power-play goal at 14:03 when he converted a rebound from the slot past Murray.\n\nThe Sabres took a 3-1 lead in the final minute of the second period when Dahlin flipped a shot over Murray\u2019s glove off the rush.\n\nNOTES: Sidney Crosby had an assist to tie Larry Murphy for 42nd on the NHL\u2019s career points list with 1,217. Crosby has a seven-game point streak against Buffalo and one point in 36 of 40 career games against the Sabres. \u2026 Buffalo\u2019s Victor Olofsson and Henri Jokiharju were recalled from Rochester of the American Hockey League. \u2026 Sabres\u2019 D Colin Miller recorded his 100th NHL point. \u2026 Buffalo\u2019s last opener in Pittsburgh was the team\u2019s first game, a 2-1 victory on Oct. 10, 1970.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSabres: Host New Jersey on Saturday night.\n\nPenguins: Host Columbus on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Conor Sheary scored twice against his old team and Carter Hutton stopped 26 shots in the Buffalo Sabres\u2019 3-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday night in the opener for both teams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Scifo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/sabres_penguins_hockey_98602_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
