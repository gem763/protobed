It was proclaimed \u201cComics aren\u2019t for kids any more!\u201d as the superhero genre became grittier and darker, drenched in sex and violence that was much more than a sock on the jaw and a KA-POW! Sound effect.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Steve Ditko: Spider-Man comics Show all 6 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

He could take his arm off and hit people with it), was getting cool again. And that was largely thanks to a concerted effort to bring in British writers and artists to overhaul some of their tired old plotlines and dream up brand new characters.\n\nA little before Sandman was published, DC brought out a comic called Hellblazer, featuring a British, street-level occultist called John Constantine who smoked and drank and screwed people over. Written by Jamie Delano, with art by John Ridgway, it set the tone for what was to come. In late 1988, DC started running ads for Sandman in the back of its comics. They showed a twinkle-eyed, pale-faced figure and the slogan, \u201cI will show you terror in a handful of dust\u201d.\n\nIt was written by Neil Gaiman, with art initially by Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg and covers by Dave McKean. The advertising blurb was a slight mangling of a quote from TS Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d. Gaiman was a name that no one outside of comics would have recognised at that point; he\u2019d been brought over to work for DC by forward-thinking editor Karen Berger after a smattering of comics work, including a graphic novel with the aforementioned McKean called Violent Cases. Sandman was published in the same format as the usual DC superhero comics, and billed as a \u201chorror-edged fantasy\u201d.\n\nSandman certainly wasn\u2019t about superheroes, though they sometimes featured in slightly grotesque ways. It wasn\u2019t really a horror comic, though it was often horrific. It was fantastical rather than the epic fantasy of the doorstep-sized novels that filled the bookstores. If it wasn\u2019t these things, then what was Sandman all about?\n\nThe clever answer is that it\u2019s about everything. In 75 monthly issues, from 1988 to 1996, Sandman covered every conceivable topic, from myth and legend to love and loss to identity politics to horror to birth and death to cats that hunt humans and dogs that talk. In a narrower sense, it\u2019s about the Sandman, also known as Morpheus or Dream, one of a group of immortal siblings known as the Endless who rule over realms that correspond to, really, the components of the human heart. Alongside Dream, the roll call includes Destiny, Despair, Delirium, Destruction, Desire and, of course, Death.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He rules over his domain where humans visit, fleetingly, as their bodies rest. He\u2019s actually \u2013 whisper it \u2013 a bit boring. He doesn\u2019t have much of a sense of humour, isn\u2019t given to snappy rejoinders, and is often brooding over something, some lost love or threat to his realm. So it\u2019s a good job that The Sandman comics are not really very often about him. They\u2019re about the humans who interact with him, and their stories, their lives, which Dream sometimes just witnesses, and sometimes intervenes in.\n\nThough Sandman is a narrative that covers much territory, not always in linear fashion, there is a silver thread running through all 75 issues (later collected into omnibus editions for easier reading) which begins with our introduction to Morpheus, imprisoned for decades by an opportunistic Aleister Crowley-like English occultist. When he\u2019s finally free, the Lord of Dreams returns to his realm to find it crumbling and in disarray, and sets out to retrieve his objects of power, fix things up, and make right all the chaos that has occurred in his absence.\n\nIn early issues, he has to track down the denizens of his domain who have escaped while he\u2019s been gone, and travel to hell to free a lover he wronged thousands of years previously. He meets Shakespeare and gods and ordinary people thrust into ordinary situations. The series ends with his death; but like everything that went before, nothing is as it seems in the land of dreams.\n\nThe series was an instant hit. It was the comic for people who didn\u2019t read comics, and the comic for those that did. Gaiman must have cast some bewitching hex, because he managed to build a fanbase that was full of cool people and outsiders and comic nerds and punks and pretty much everybody. Everybody loved Sandman. The singer-songwriter Tori Amos loved Sandman. The great American man of letters Norman Mailer called Sandman \u201ca comic strip for intellectuals\u201d. Charles Shaar Murray, the music journalist and author, writing in this very newspaper in 1997, on the release of the final volume of the collected Sandman story, called it \u201ca major achievement. There is nothing quite like it anywhere else.\u201d\n\nA plethora of artists have illustrated the Sandman comics. They include Colleen Doran, Jill Thompson, Bryan Talbot, Mark Buckingham, Malcolm Jones III, Charles Vess, Kelley Jones, Matt Wagner, P Craig Russell, and more. All have brought their own touch to Dream and the Endless, but of course the one constant has always been writer Neil Gaiman.\n\nIn a way, Sandman is a timeless tale \u2026 And, as you\u2019d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don\u2019t dream\u2026 or dream too hard\n\nGaiman was pretty much an unknown when he started writing Sandman. He wasn\u2019t even that well known a year or so later when he published, along with Terry Pratchett, the novel Good Omens. By the year 2001, when his first proper solo novel, American Gods, was out, he was a little better known, enough to be interviewed by CNN. He demurred at the suggestions that he was now famous, commenting: \u201cI\u2019m not and never will be a John Grisham.\u201d\n\nStill, he had his fanbase by then, and it was quite a wide-ranging one. He is quoted in the same interview as describing his market as \u201ca handful of beautiful goths and a handful of boys in dresses and a handful of sci-fi fans and a handful of nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal and the people who look like somebody\u2019s mum. I exist at the intersection of a dozen Venn diagrams.\u201d\n\nNow, though, it could be argued that Gaiman has certainly achieved Grisham-esque levels of literary fame, certainly since his 2013 novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane took up residence at the top of the bestseller lists. From then on, Gaiman became a hot property.\n\nHis works Stardust and Coraline have been adapted into movies, but it wasn\u2019t until the rise of the big-budget, ambitious TV series, heralded by the likes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, that his oeuvre found its natural home. American Gods and Good Omens have both been adapted for TV on Amazon Prime, and Sandman is next, snapped up by Netflix earlier this month.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite a case of a goldrush to mine Gaiman\u2019s back catalogue for new hits though. For starters, unlike most of his other work, Sandman isn\u2019t Gaiman\u2019s copyright; he did the work for DC comics, and the characters he wrote and created belong to them. DC certainly hasn\u2019t been resting on its laurels with turning its intellectual property into TV shows\u2026 series such as Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, Titans and Doom Patrol have been big hits. Shows that are more thematically aligned to Sandman, such as Constantine, based on the comic Hellblazer, appeared, while another adaptation at the darker end of the DC universe, Swamp Thing, has just debuted.\n\nPeople have been trying to get Sandman on to the screen for almost as long as the comic has been produced. From the late 1990s, Warner Bros, which owns DC Comics, had been trying to get a Sandman movie made. Roger Avary, who worked alongside Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, was slated to direct, but fell out with the company and it never happened. New attempts were made; one screenplay sent to Gaiman is said to have evoked the response from him that it was \u201cnot only the worst Sandman script I\u2019ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I\u2019ve ever read\u201d.\n\nBy 2013, when Sandman had been in and out of development hell more often than the character had been in actual hell (which was quite frequently; the TV series Lucifer, starring Tom Ellis, is essentially a spin-off series of Sandman, featuring the version of Satan that Gaiman created for the comic), something more concrete appeared to be on the cards. Producer David S Goyer announced that he would be leading a film adaptation, working with actor and filmmaker Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gaiman, with British screenwriter Jack Thorne on script duties.\n\nIt underwent several rewrites and by 2016 Gordon-Levitt dropped out of the project, citing differences with the studio over how he thought the direction of the movie should go. The adaptation petered out, with the general feeling that the scope and breadth of Sandman was just too ambitious to be contained in the movie format.\n\nEnter, not Sandman, but Netflix. On 30 June it was announced in Hollywood Reporter that the adaptation was back on, only as an ongoing series on the streaming TV provider, not as a movie. Which is pretty much the best result for a story of this size. David Goyer is back on board, as is Gaiman, whose stock in the TV world has massively risen since the adaptations of Good Omens and American Gods, which he executively produced.\n\nOne possible question mark people might have over the adaptation is whether the Sandman story has any relevance in 2019, more than 20 years after the main series ended (there have been many spinoffs, and DC recently launched a Sandman Universe of titles featuring the characters, overseen by Gaiman but created by a new team of comic writers and artists). Good Omens is of a similar vintage to Sandman, but its apocalyptic themes were frighteningly recognisable in this year\u2019s Amazon Prime adaptation, and American Gods was brought up to date nicely with its story of the old gods fading as faith in them wanes, and the new gods of technology, money and sex on the rise.\n\nIn a way, Sandman is a timeless tale. It\u2019s character-driven rather than plot-heavy, which suits the Netflix model of delving into characters\u2019 backstories and fleshing out the source material it adapts. And, as you\u2019d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don\u2019t dream\u2026 or dream too hard. And dreams are not merely the stories we tell ourselves in our sleep; they can be hopes and ambitions and wishes for ourselves and others. Perhaps there\u2019s something to be said, also, about how willingly we submit to non-real states, especially online, which wasn\u2019t a real consideration when Gaiman first wrote the series.\n\nOverall, Netflix certainly seems a safe pair of hands, and if anyone can do justice to the sprawling story of Dream and the Endless, then this old comics fan thinks it\u2019ll probably be them. Another misgiving aficionados of the comics might have is that over its 75 issues, The Sandman didn\u2019t really plough the sort of neat, linear furrow that TV series like to follow. Sandman is about everything, and that\u2019s sometimes a big ask for a TV show to take on\u2026 and which led to the general opinion that it was simply not a thing you could adapt.\n\nIt\u2019s also a truth that great comics \u2013 or novels, for that matter \u2013 don\u2019t necessarily make great TV shows or movies. To revisit an earlier point, a comic book isn\u2019t just illustrated fiction. It\u2019s a collaborative medium, it\u2019s its own way of telling stories. It\u2019s writing and art that come together to make a way of communicating a narrative that is different from anything else. Sometimes, that story is best suited to the form in which it was first birthed. And even if it all goes wrong, at least we still have the comics.\n\nBut people are undeniably excited about a Sandman TV show. The beautiful goths, boys in dresses, sci-fi fans, nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal who were Gaiman\u2019s turn of the millennium fanbase. As will, finally, thanks to Gaiman rapidly becoming a household name, \u201cthe people who look like somebody\u2019s mom\u201d.", "description": "At a time when comic book movies rule the box office, it makes sense that one of the most beloved series in recent years gets an adaptation, courtesy of Netflix.
