Whoever has the opportunity to access the data a product generates and collects can derive value from the data. How the data is processed, and then used, depends on the intent of the actor processing it,\u201d she says in the report.\n\nIn the report, she uses the example of Global Tone Communications Technology Co. (GTCOM) as a case study to illustrate how the global expansion of the party\u2019s tech-enhanced authoritarianism can work.\n\nFor starters, GTCOM is a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise that the Central Propaganda Department directly supervises. It openly co-operates with the state\u2019s intelligence services and strategically co-operates with large Chinese firms such as Huawei and Alibaba Cloud.\n\nAccording to AustCyber chief executive officer Michelle Price, it would be wise for Australian business to be alert to businesses that have been flagged to having close ties with organisations such as GTCOM.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough global competition out there that companies going through their procurement processes should be asking more questions around cyber risk,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cA more mature approach to risk management would involve more due diligence around cyber risk but not all local organisations are building those questions in their risk management approach.\n\nMs Price says Australian organisations need to immunise themselves against malicious cyber activity and this will involve getting the right sort of policy settings out of federal government.\n\nAustralia needs a mature approach to cyber security says Michelle Price, chief executive of AustCyber. Peter Braig\n\n\u201cWhile there has been lots of investment on the national security side of the coin, more needs to be done on the economic side.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, a whole range of countries have developed offensive cyber capabilities as well as defensive strategies and Ms Price says it\u2019s very much the \u201cnormal trajectory of how technological development occurs\u201d.\n\n\u201cCyber is just the latest field being developed for strategic advantage and we\u2019re seeing an increasing number of nation states using cyber tools as part of a hybrid war.\u201d\n\nWhile much of the more nefarious cyber activity is often the work of cybercriminal networks, Ms Price warns we\u2019re also seeing more nation states accessing bank details and changing business invoices, for example, in a bid to undermine trust in economies.\n\nShe says the biggest threats are to supply chains and value chains in business and this is where organisations really have to be alert to cyber risks.\n\nAs for individuals, she suggests all Australians need to be aware of cyber risk and \u201clook after their data\u201d.", "description": "Australian business and government need to be better immunised against malicious cyber activity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_307%2C$y_243/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dc8af9e293561b932edfdd59ee191dba29bf705c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
