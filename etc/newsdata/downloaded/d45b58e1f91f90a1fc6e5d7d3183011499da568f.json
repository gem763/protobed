But he has acknowledged the county bungled one case last month where it released on bond an illegal immigrant accused of second-degree rape, even though ICE had sought to take the person into custody.\n\nIn the wake of that snafu, he met with ICE officials Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cWhile the meeting was generally introductory, I believe that the conversation was productive; and more discussions will follow,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nAsked for comment on Mr. Albence\u2019s charge Thursday, a county spokesperson referred The Washington Times back to that statement, where Mr. Elrich said the county\u2019s policies are being misunderstood.\n\nThe number of sanctuary jurisdictions has soared since President Trump took office in 2017 as communities across the country enact policies to shield illegal immigrants from detection. They insist they\u2019re doing it as a safety measure, saying that if they turn illegal immigrants over to ICE other immigrants will stop reporting crimes.\n\nThat\u2019s bunk, said Mr. Albence. He said reporting of crimes involving immigrants has actually increased, based on the number of queries the federal government receives to its databases from state and local law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThose numbers have gone up every year, which means more and more crimes involving aliens are being reported,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Albence said, however, that ICE\u2019s arrests of criminals will fall this year, for the first time in the Trump administration.\n\nHe blamed the illegal immigrant surge at the border, which forced the agency to deploy staff to assist Customs and Border Protection, pulling agents and officers from operations in the interior of the country.\n\nMr. Albence said there will be a \u201cdouble-digit drop\u201d in criminal migrant arrests for fiscal year 2019, which closes out on Monday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
