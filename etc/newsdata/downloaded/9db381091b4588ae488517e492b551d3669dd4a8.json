REUTERS/Charles Mostoller/File Photo\n\nA three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court said the state Senate and state House district lines discriminated against Democratic voters in violation of the state constitution\u2019s free elections, equal protection and free speech clauses.\n\nThe decision is a victory for election reform advocates considering legal challenges to partisan gerrymandering in state courts despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year blocking such cases in federal courts.\n\nIn an opinion running more than 350 pages, the judges said Republican state legislators had employed \u201csurgical precision\u201d to dilute Democratic voters\u2019 strength, ensuring their party would control both chambers of the legislature \u201cin all but the most unusual election scenarios.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 2017 enacted maps, as drawn, do not permit voters to freely choose their representative, but rather representatives are choosing voters based upon sophisticated partisan sorting,\u201d the court wrote after hearing evidence during a trial in July.\n\nState Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Republican, criticized the case as an attempt to \u201cgame\u201d the redistricting process but signaled lawmakers would not appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cTo end this matter once and for all, we will follow the court\u2019s instruction and move forward with adoption of a nonpartisan map,\u201d Berger said in a statement.\n\nThe closely watched case was the first to reach trial since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that federal courts have no authority to curb partisan gerrymandering - the practice of drawing electoral maps to entrench one party in power.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision did not explicitly bar state courts from evaluating gerrymandering cases based on state constitutions, which sometimes have language that goes further than the federal version. North Carolina\u2019s constitution, for instance, has a free elections clause, which has no counterpart in the U.S. constitution.\n\nGovernment reformers have already voiced their intent to file more cases in state courts.\n\nLast year, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a similar ruling, tossing the state\u2019s U.S. congressional map and commissioning an independent expert to redraw the lines. The new map was credited with helping Democrats split the state\u2019s 18 congressional seats in 2018 after years of Republican dominance.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ruling concerned only the state legislative districts, but legal experts have said it could open the door to a similar lawsuit challenging North Carolina\u2019s congressional map, which is also widely seen as gerrymandered.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic victory for the people of North Carolina,\u201d said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, the government reform group that brought the lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile, the new state legislative map will likely improve Democrats\u2019 chances of breaking the Republican majority in the state capitol.\n\nThe party that controls the state legislature following next year\u2019s election will be in charge of drawing new congressional and state legislative maps after the U.S. Census is complete.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to taking back control of the General Assembly using fair maps next November,\u201d the state Democratic chairman, Wayne Goodwin, said.", "description": "A North Carolina court on Tuesday struck down the Republican-drawn state legislative map as an illegal partisan gerrymander and gave lawmakers two weeks to enact new district lines for next year's elections.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425897379&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8220B"}
