He was prime minister for 22 years from 1981, only to come out of retirement last year to head a government after an opposition election victory.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, and have intensified markedly since June. They have also evolved into wider calls for democracy, among other demands.\n\nDemonstrators are angry at what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city's affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.
