It's also just 10km from the centre of the city.\n\nAn unassuming red-brick home sold in Sydney for more than $7million this weekend\n\nTo make the home even more valuable, zoning recently changed to R3 - meaning its new owner will be able to build a substantial apartment block on the land.\n\nWHAT DOES R3 ZONING MEAN? Zone R3 is a zone where multi dwelling housing is appropriate and encouraged. Multi dwelling housing can take the form of townhouses or villas, or a more community focused approach such as a childcare facility. It is normally reserved for 'medium density' residential areas.\n\nThe R3 zoning also means a bed and breakfast, childcare centre, community centre or hostels is approved for the site.\n\nThe value of the land and its development potential was why it sold at auction on the weekend for well above the average for the suburb.\n\nIt sold for a staggering $7.35 million - almost four times Kingsford's average price of $2 million.\n\nOver 2000 other homes were also up for auction across the nation last weekend, up from 1324 the week prior.\n\nCoreLogic data shows a steady improvement in clearance rates of homes this quarter.\n\nMore than 70 per cent of properties that hit the market from July-September were sold.", "description": "The sale is an indication property prices are on the climb again after a lull in the housing market.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/05/19675862-0-image-a-106_1571027489064.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
