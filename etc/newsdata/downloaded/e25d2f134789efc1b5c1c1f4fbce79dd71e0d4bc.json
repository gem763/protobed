(Picture: Shutterstock)dis\n\nIf you\u2019re a big Disney fan there\u2019s now an opportunity for you to make some of the money you\u2019ve spent on cinema trips over the years.\n\nReviews.org are hiring five people to fill the dream job of watching 30 Disney movies or shows in 30 days.\n\nThe lucky film fans will get $1,000 (\u00a3770) for their efforts.\n\nThe tech review website launched the gig in a bit to receive some user feedback on the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, which is due to be launched on 12 November, 2019. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no word yet on when the platform is coming to the UK.\n\nSo who can enter?\n\n\u2018We think it goes without saying that we\u2019re looking for someone who really, really loves Disney,\u2019 said Catherine McNally, a writer at Reviews.org.\n\nThe gig is also only open to US citizens. While we\u2019re sure there are plenty of little ones who can\u2019t get enough of Disney, the position is open to people aged 18 and over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviews.org also notes that applicants must \u2018be swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon\u2019. Naturally.\n\nOh and applicants may or may not get bonus points for video entries.\n\nThe chosen fan will also be gifted a subscription to Disney+ for an entire year, as well as a movie-watching kit including a Mickey Mouse blanket, cups and a Pixar popcorn machine. Even the kernels will be included in the prize pack.\n\nIf picked, what films would you select? Would you go for the modern classic that is Finding Nemo, or perhaps something a little more old-school like The Little Mermaid?\n\nConsidering Disney flicks have been kicking around since 1937 (and there\u2019s just a loooooot of work out there), Reviews.org have narrowed it down with a shortlist of 30 of their favourite Disney shows and movies.\n\nTheir hitlist includes titles Frozen (duh), hate-it-or-love-it High School Musical, and even The World According to Jeff Goldblum.\n\nGet your entries in by 7 November 2019 at www.reviews.org.\n\nMORE: ASOS just released a collab with the designer who dresses Lizzo\n\nMORE: Thrifty mum wears 10p charity shop evening gown to black-tie event\n\nMORE: Someone has been replacing the covers on David Cameron\u2019s book\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Reviews.org are hiring five people to fill the dream job of watching 30 Disney movies or shows in 30 days.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90832316_1571577071.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
