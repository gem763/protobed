And legal experts cast doubt upon its effectiveness.\n\n\u201cI think the goal of this letter is to further inflame the president\u2019s supporters and attempt to delegitimize the process in the eyes of his supporters,\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n\nCourts have been historically hesitant to step in as referee for congressional oversight and impeachment. In 1993, the Supreme Court held that impeachment was an issue for the Congress and not the courts.\n\nIn that case, Walter Nixon, a federal district judge who was removed from office, sought to be reinstated and argued that the full Senate, instead of a committee that was established to hear testimony and collect evidence, should have heard the evidence against him.\n\nThe court unanimously rejected the challenge, finding impeachment is a function of the legislature that the court had no authority over.\n\nAs for the current challenge to impeachment, Vladeck said the White House letter \u201cdoes not strike me as an effort to provide sober legal analysis.\u201d\n\nGregg Nunziata, a Philadelphia attorney who previously served as general counsel and policy advisor to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, said the White House\u2019s letter did not appear to be written in a \u201ctraditional good-faith back and forth between the legislative and executive branches.\u201d\n\nHe called it a \u201cdirect assault on the very legitimacy of Congress\u2019 oversight power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Founders very deliberately chose to put the impeachment power in a political branch rather the Supreme Court,\u201d Nunziata told The Associated Press. \u201cThey wanted this to be a political process and it is.\u201d\n\nG. Pearson Cross, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, said the letter appeared to act as nothing more than an accelerant on a smoldering fire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a response that seems to welcome a constitutional crisis rather than defusing one or pointing toward some strategy that would deescalate the situation,\u201d Cross said.\n\nAfter two weeks of a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe, the White House letter amounted to a declaration of war.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment accusing President Donald Trump of obstructing their investigations.\n\nDemocrats have said that if the White House does not provide the information, they could write an article of impeachment on obstruction of justice.\n\nIt is unclear if Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony \u2014 or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the Ukraine probe, has said Democrats will \u201chave to decide whether to litigate, or how to litigate.\u201d\n\nBut they don\u2019t want the fight to drag on for months, as he said the administration seems to want to do.\n\nA federal judge heard arguments Tuesday on whether the House had undertaken a formal impeachment inquiry despite not having taken an official vote and whether it can be characterized, under the law, as a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nThe distinction matters because while grand jury testimony is ordinarily secret, one exception authorizes a judge to disclose it in connection with a judicial proceeding. House Democrats are seeking grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as they conduct the impeachment inquiry.\n\n___\n\nMustian reported from New York.
