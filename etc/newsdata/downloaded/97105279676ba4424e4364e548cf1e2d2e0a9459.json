Yes, I do check my phones every 10 minutes, but I'm always worried somebody might need me.\n\nAlso, whenever I show her pictures, she says she's not interested and keeps telling me to \"put the phone away and live in reality.\"\n\nI can't relax if I don't have my phones on me. Her lifestyle is very laid-back, so she doesn't understand the pressure I'm under. This friend is very helpful to me, and I don't want to lose her. Any suggestions?\n\n\u2014 Can't Hang Up\n\nCan\u2019t Hang Up: I won\u2019t endorse the virtue-bullying. Your friend has made her point, and her only decent option now is to decide what she\u2019ll put up with, and then hold that line. The harping \u201cwhenever we are together\u201d is just obnoxious.\n\nAll of which I will cover if she ever writes to me.\n\nIn the meantime, for you: Your phone-checking is rude. And your friend is right about living \u201cin reality\u201d \u2014 not despite, because of your high-stress responsibilities.\n\nDon\u2019t tune out the message just because the messenger crossed a line. Like I\u2019m doing with this unsolicited advice.\n\nYou will not remain a good employee or caregiver if you burn out, and you will burn out if the only mental freedom you allow yourself is in 10-minute increments. Can you even feel freedom when you\u2019re measuring it with the sweep of a second hand, for constant fear of calamity?\n\nI don\u2019t have to know you to be certain your standard of 100 percent accessibility is unsustainable.\n\nWe need rest. All of us. We think better with it, we problem-solve better, we perform better; we care more deeply with it, we connect better, we feel better about ourselves.\n\nYou have significant responsibilities, I won\u2019t minimize that, nor will I discount the comfort you take in feeling prepared to meet them.\n\nI am simply, urgently suggesting that you write a new, more carefully thought-out definition of \u201cprepared.\u201d\n\nChoose your times, for example, when you have to be available \u2014 when the difference between being inaccessible for 10 minutes or 60 minutes is life or death, employed or fired, 911 won\u2019t suffice. That stark.\n\nIn those times, yes, be grateful for your phone(s). Though at least program them to chirp at you in special tones for work and family so you never have to \u201ccheck.\u201d\n\nThen, outside those times, create space for rest. Have a system for other people to cover you during these . . . workouts, walks, lunches with friends? . . . and give yourself over completely. Shut. off. your. phooone.\n\nAnd employ some sources of perspective: 1. The Earth has had Homo sapiens for more than 300,000 years; smartphones, not even 30. You can do this. 2. You\u2019re vincible, like anyone else. So treat these restorative personal blackouts as trial runs for a day when you can\u2019t be beckoned or called. 3. Keep your favorite version of the adage \u201cGraveyards are filled with indispensable men\u201d as handy as you can without depressing yourself.\n\nWith your friend: Decide how long you can have your phone off; tell her so; say you\u2019re through \u2014 and be through \u2014 discussing it with her.", "description": "Your friend is right: Checking it every 10 minutes is rude (and counterproductive).", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
