Total shareholder revenue accounts for 65 per cent of the bonus.\n\nBendigo claimed its unique remuneration structure, and relatively high apportionment of bonuses to customer outcomes, is symbolic of the premium it places on customers and community.\n\n\u201cWe do and we will depart from some of the views that others may have in relation to this,\" Ms Baker told The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\u201cHaving too much of your remuneration tied up in short term incentives does not actually create the right behaviours and actions from employees and executive.\"\n\nThe bank's outgoing chairman Robert Johanson \u2014 who presided over his last AGM after 13 years in the role and 31 years of involvement with the bank \u2014 praised the company's pay packages.\n\n\"While we avoided much of the criticism and fall out from the Royal Commission, indeed we were complimented on how our executive remuneration system is structured, we know that we must constantly hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards,\" Mr Johanson said.\n\n'They're not my favourite'\n\nProxy advisory firm ISS criticised the allocation of 35 per cent of the bonus to the customer tranche as \"excessive\", effectively accusing the bank of devaluing shareholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is an inappropriately high weighting devoted to a qualitative customer-focused metric,\" ISS wrote in a research note to investors, adding that the Commonwealth Bank removed customer satisfaction metrics from its long-term performance bonuses.\n\nThe proxy advisory firm urged Bendigo shareholders to vote against the granting of performance rights to Ms Baker.\n\nBendigo director Tony Robinson did not mince words when pressed about the proxy investor concerns by shareholders at the AGM.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not my favourite,\" Mr Robinson said of ISS. \"They dont like anything in long-term incentives other than shareholder returns, but focus on shareholder returns is one of the problems in the banking industry.\"\n\nMs Baker rejected the notion that the bank's remuneration report disadvantages investors.\n\n\u201cI think investors are and should be focusing on the long-term sustainability and our remuneration package is consistent with that view,\" she said.\n\nThe AGM came amid fierce debate over moves to increase the role of non-financial metrics in determining performance bonuses.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority released a draft standard in July which would mandate that 50 per cent of bonuses are based on non-financial factors, in line with a Hayne commission recommendation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile proxy investors and business leaders have criticised the edict, consumer bodies are pushing for sales-based bonuses to be scrapped entirely.", "description": "Bendigo Bank has survived a showdown with proxy firm ISS over the executive remuneration plan it says received a Hayne tick of approval.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3947%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_257%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e35aa1f0dde19b7588bdad800ab1542b688134af", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
