California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, filed a similar suit last year following a six-year investigation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re alleging that Sutter Health Systems is offering care at a higher price and perhaps even undermining quality by the way it goes about doing its business,\u201d Becerra said in a briefing ahead of last month\u2019s jury selection. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not only not fair, but we believe and we allege it is against the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cBottom line,\u201d Becerra said, \u201cthe public is being ripped off.\u201d\n\nOpening statements scheduled to start Thursday were postponed until next week because not enough jurors were present, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo told a packed courtroom.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several months. The lawsuit points to research showing that health care costs in Northern California are higher than elsewhere in the state, including a 2018 study that found unadjusted inpatient procedure prices are 70% higher in Northern California than Southern California.\n\n\u201cMuch of the increased cost of health care in Northern California is attributable to Sutter\u201d the attorney general alleges in a 49-page complaint that details a range of anticompetitive practices it says the Sacramento-based nonprofit has pursued as it gobbled up competition.\n\nIn the 1990s, Sutter embarked on \u201ca deliberate strategy\u201d to gain market power in certain geographic areas through a campaign of mergers and acquisitions, the parties allege, noting that Sutter\u2019s assets rose to $15.6 billion in 2016 from $6.4 billion in 2005.\n\nSutter Health denies the claims, saying it faces fierce competition across the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento Valley and insurance companies are to blame for pushing up costs.\n\n\u201cSutter Health looks forward to demonstrating in court why its integrated care model promotes competition and, most importantly, benefits patients and communities,\u201d Sutter spokeswoman Amy Thoma Tan said in a statement. She said the largest health insurance companies support the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies want to maximize profits by pushing insurance plans that limit their choices and result in surprise billing,\u201d Thoma Tan said.\n\nAt issue are several of Sutter Health\u2019s contracting policies that Becerra says have allowed the company to \u201cthoroughly immunize itself from price competition.\u201d\n\nOne way insurance companies keep costs down is to steer patients to cheaper health care providers through a variety of incentives. Becerra says Sutter Health bans insurance companies from using these incentives, making it harder for patients to use their lower-priced competitors.\n\nBecerra also says Sutter has an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach to negotiating with insurance companies, requiring them to include all the company\u2019s hospitals in their provider networks even if it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to do so.\n\nThe case was originally filed in 2014 by a group of self-funded employers and picked up steam last year when Becerra filed a similar lawsuit and the cases were combined.\n\nBecerra\u2019s lawsuit seeks to halt Sutter\u2019s alleged practices and does not seek monetary damages. But the private litigation brought by a class of about 1,400 self-funded employers seeks damages that could exceed $1 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for antitrust lawsuits of this size to go to trial. Atrium Health, a North Carolina-based hospital system, settled a similar anti-trust lawsuit with the federal government last year. And CHI Franciscan, a health system based in Washington state, also settled similar claims in March that had been brought by the state.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 One of California's largest hospital systems is facing a trial over accusations that it has used its market dominance to snuff out", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/9b0de0_california-hospital-chain-19147-in-sept-20-2019-file-photo-an-american-flag-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
