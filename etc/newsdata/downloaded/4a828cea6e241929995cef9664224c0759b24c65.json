Erdogan views the Kurds who fight with the SDF as an extension of the PKK, a terrorist organization that has sought to gain Kurdish autonomy inside Turkey for decades. On Thursday, President Trump tweeted that he had spoken with Abdi and that the Kurdish leader \u201cappreciates what we have done,\u201d despite criticism that the U.S. exit from northern Syria cleared the way for Turkey to attack the Kurds.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
