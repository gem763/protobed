This year, viewers will see the culmination of the long-running \u2018Sheanu\u2019 affair narrative, as Sharon (Letitia Dean) and Keanu\u2019s (Danny Walters) dalliance is revealed in no doubt an epic fashion.\n\nSpeaking on The One Show about what viewers have to look forward to this holiday season, Danny said: \u2018It\u2019s the most important ep of the year, Christmas Day.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s powerful. There\u2019s always a knees-up, but there\u2019s always going to be some sort of a punch-up going on.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the \u2018Sheanu\u2019 storyline will seemingly take centre stage on Christmas, Danny suggested that several other characters will also be involved in the festivities \u2014 or, in EastEnders\u2019 case, the lack thereof \u2014 saying: \u2018It\u2019s brilliant this year. Every year is brilliant but this year, it\u2019s a culmination of many storylines coming together.\u2019\n\nWhat will Christmas have in store for the Carter clan? Danny\u2019s character Mick is currently at the centre of a huge storyline which has seen him suffering from panic attacks. The stress of this coupled with his worries about son Ollie \u2014 not to mention wife Linda\u2019s (Kellie Bright) recent cancer scare \u2014 has made it an incredibly tough year for the Queen Vic landlord, so Christmas will no doubt be equally stressful.\n\nSenior Executive producer Kate Oates has already teased that Mick and Linda will be heavily featured during the show\u2019s 35th anniversary next February, so it\u2019s possible that the groundwork for their big narrative will be set during the Christmas episodes.\n\nSpeaking of the Christmas episodes, Danny is currently filming festive instalments of the BBC One soap and, as a result, he joked about how odd it is having the decorations up so early.\n\nHe said: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of pressure on it, and it is weird having all the decorations up. Our decorations went up, end of September.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Is it Christmas yet?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/oKbPgvR0_o-0bf1_1570785580.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
