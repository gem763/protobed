Unicef national committees of the United States, Australia, and New Zealand also accept cryptocurrency, the organisation said.\n\nUnicef Australia in April last year announced the project called The Hopepage, a browser-based cryptocurrency mining platform, that uses a third-party computer's processing power to automatically generate funds.\n\nWhen on The Hopepage, an individual's browser uses the computer's processor to solve cryptocurrency algorithms -- users can select how much processor power they want to donate to the task.\n\nThe longer the browser is open, the more processor power is donated, which means more algorithms get solved to earn cryptocurrency.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is then automatically donated to Unicef Australia and is turned into real funds that the organisation has said is used to provide children with supplies such as safe water, therapeutic food, and vaccines.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "You can now use bitcoin and ether to donate to the global agency focused on children's rights.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/23/ea1e5dd9-47ff-4ef1-bdc1-4cc05b9b1126/thumbnail/770x578/80af23a021413cf008fb60e6b7da0728/istock-cryptocurrency-coins.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
