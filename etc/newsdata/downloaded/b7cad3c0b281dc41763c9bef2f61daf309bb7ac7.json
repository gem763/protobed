In the 2018 midterms, Republican candidates won a bare majority of the vote, but wound up winning 10 of the 13 seats in the House. One Republican lawmaker involved in the redistricting process explained that he and his colleagues had settled on that map only because \u201cI do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\u201d\n\nBraggadocio like that was absent on Tuesday. Only hours after the state court\u2019s decision, North Carolina Republicans folded, admitting that they had finally run into a barrier they couldn\u2019t draw their way around. In a statement that should be a finalist for the 2019 Chutzpah Award, the State Senate leader, Phil Berger, accused Democrats of trying to \u201cgame\u201d the redistricting process, blamed the years of litigation over their maps for harming the \u201clegitimacy of this state\u2019s institutions,\u201d and sniffed that they would abide by the ruling and draw \u201ca nonpartisan map.\u201d\n\nThe truth is they would probably have loved to appeal the ruling to the State Supreme Court and keep drawing ever more skewed maps in their favor, but they knew that with a Democratic majority on that court, their chances of victory were slim.\n\nAt least they didn\u2019t behave like their Republican counterparts in Pennsylvania, who responded to a decision by that state\u2019s Supreme Court tossing out their biased maps by trying to impeach the justices who issued the ruling.\n\nPartisan gerrymandering has a long and bipartisan history, and Republicans today see themselves as getting revenge for years in which Democrats were in power and drew the maps in their own favor. But mapmaking technology has advanced strikingly in the past two decades, giving politicians an unprecedented degree of control in carving up the citizenry for their own benefit.\n\nThat\u2019s why Justice Elena Kagan pointed to partisan gerrymanders as an existential threat to democratic self-rule. In her dissent from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June, she explained that gerrymandered maps \u201cmake bipartisanship and pragmatic compromise politically difficult or impossible; and drive voters away from an ever more dysfunctional political process.\u201d Justice Kagan asked, \u201cIs this how American democracy is supposed to work?\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s decision in North Carolina was right to answer that question in the negative, and to claim a space for state courts elsewhere to intervene when partisan gerrymandering has effectively silenced huge portions of the electorate. But state courts shouldn\u2019t have been saddled with this job in the first place. As Justice Kagan wrote in June: \u201cWhat do those courts know that this court does not? If they can develop and apply neutral and manageable standards to identify unconstitutional gerrymanders, why couldn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
