USA TODAY\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Bryce Perkins likes to celebrate his friends' birthdays by posting pictures of them together. So whenever another birthday rolls around, he pulls out his phone and starts to scroll \u2014 looking for the perfect shot and, inevitably, thinking back on his own journey over the past five years, as well.\n\nThere he is at Arizona State, where he thought he'd be the next local kid to star at quarterback.\n\nThere he is at Arizona Western College, trying to salvage his career after fracturing two vertebra in his neck.\n\nThere he is at the University of Virginia, finally proving himself at the Division I level.\n\n\u201cJust because of different locations,\" Perkins told USA TODAY Sports last week, \"it feels longer than five years.\u201d\n\nVirginia quarterback Bryce Perkins runs with the ball against William & Mary during their 2019 game at Scott Stadium.

We\u2019re so lucky he\u2019s here.\"\n\nIn truth, had it not been for a scary neck injury at a 2016 practice, a pivotal rehab decision and a crowded quarterback room at Arizona State, Perkins never would have been here. He might not be playing football at all.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS: Ohio State now No. 1 seed for College Football Playoff\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nAfter breaking two vertebra in his neck during a fall practice in 2016, the 6-foot-3, 215-pounder had a choice: To undergo surgery, which would almost certainly preclude him from playing again, or spend months in a bulky neck brace, hoping his body would heal itself. Both options were risky, but he said the decision \"wasn't really tough.\"\n\n\"I always was going to go with whichever one gave me the best shot of giving me a fighting shot to play,\" Perkins said.\n\nPerkins picked the brace. And by the following spring, he had healed enough to take limited reps without contact but felt himself quickly falling behind amid a quarterback group that featured returning starter Manny Wilkins and Alabama transfer Blake Barnett, among others. The Arizona State coaching staff talked with Perkins about switching positions.\n\nHe knew he'd have to leave his hometown school if he wanted to be a Division I quarterback, so he transferred to Arizona Western \u2014 a junior college two hours away, 20 miles from the Mexico border.\n\n\"It was really that moment when I had a realization that I had to step up and do the things that I wasn\u2019t doing,\" Perkins said. \"It was kind of surreal that this was the last opportunity that I have to go back to D1.\"\n\nTom Minnick, Arizona Western's coach at the time, said he was thrilled to have a quarterback with Perkins' pedigree. But even a year after the neck injury, and despite receiving full medical clearance, there were still signs early on that Perkins wasn't back to his normal self on the field.\n\n\"We laughed at him because he always turned his full body, instead of his neck,\" said Minnick, who is now the head coach at Garden City (Kan.) Community College. \"We used to tease him, 'Bryce, you can turn your neck.' He just had that brace on for so long and he was just used to doing it.\"\n\nThat changed in time, and Perkins went on to lead Arizona Western to the junior college national title game \u2014 putting up big numbers in a win over Snow College, where Mendenhall played and coached, along the way.\n\nBy season's end, Virginia was looking for a dual-threat quarterback to build its offense around, and Perkins was available.\n\n\"I knew they were in the ACC,\" Perkins said, \"but I honestly did not know too much about Virginia.\"\n\nIt seemed like an improbable fit on the surface \u2014 an Arizona native who spent most of his life in the Southwest joining an East Coast school best known for its basketball \u2014 but it's worked out wonderfully.\n\nThe Cavaliers finished 8-5 last year as Perkins set single-season school records for yards of total offense (3,603) and total touchdowns (34). And this year, they were picked to win the ACC Coastal in the conference's preseason media poll \u2014 a notable feat considering that, in each of the past five years, they were picked to finish dead last.\n\n\"He's a magician,\" Miami defensive coordinator Blake Baker told reporters this week. \"And really, to me, he's what drives that machine.\"\n\nPerkins said he wants to use the rest of the season as an opportunity to elevate Virginia football and \"leave my personal story, that can be remembered throughout the years.\" It's an amazing, convoluted tale, to be sure. But he said he's grateful for how it's unfolded so far.\n\n\"I would\u2019ve never thought that I would\u2019ve been here,\" Perkins said. \"(But) I think this is where I was supposed to end up.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "A broken neck and a move to junior college didn't stop Bryce Perkins from giving up on his Division I dream.
