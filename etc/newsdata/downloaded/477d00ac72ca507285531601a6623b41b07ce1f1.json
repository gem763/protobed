If the potential trade deal goes into a second year and all tariffs are removed, China could increase its purchases to between $40 billion and $50 billion, Bloomberg found.\n\nChina has already begun to lay the groundwork for the first phase of the trade deal, by issuing waivers for 10 million tons of soybean purchases this week. China is also considering waivers for another 4 million to 5 million tons of grains including wheat, corn, and sorghum, according to the report.\n\nRead more: The market's favorite recession indicator has stopped flashing red.

In talks in Washington in October, the US agreed to pause further tariff hikes on thousands of products, and China agreed to increase agricultural purchases, as well as roll back some of its tariffs as part of the agreement.\n\nStill, further talks will likely take place before any agreements are finalized. China had expressed that it wanted more discussions before any agreement was signed, and later said it expected the US to roll back tariffs on Chinese products as part of a final trade agreement.\n\nFarmers, who have been caught in the middle of the US-China trade war, have said they're skeptical of the partial deal. This is due to the lack of details about the timeline, prices, and commodities involved. Soybean farmers, for example, have been hit hard over the 19-month trade dispute, as it's dragged down prices and exports of soybeans significantly.\n\nNow read: JPMorgan's quant guru presents his 10 best trades to profit from the peak of a monumental earnings season", "description": "China is willing to buy as much as $20 billion of US farm goods in the first year if a phase-one trade deal is signed with the US, Bloomberg reported.&nbs...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5db1a1f9dee0196e0c372452-2400/2019-07-16t195743z1lynxnpef6f1jprtroptp4paraguay-soy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
