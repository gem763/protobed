Trade and capital flows have plateaued since about 2010.\n\n\"It is possible that this leveling off is just a temporary hiatus and that an unforeseen technological breakthrough will trigger a new wave of globalization,\" he said. \"But such waves are rare.\"\n\nShearing said: \"New technologies have made it less attractive for firms to maintain large and complex supply chains.\n\n\"Governments have increasingly started to question the benefits of some aspects of the financial liberalization that has been a central feature of the most recent wave of globalization. China, in particular, is unlikely to open its capital markets significantly.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Shearing says that for the world's poorest, this trend is likely to damage quality of life.\n\n\"Given that the most common development path begins with labor-intensive manufacturing in sectors such as textiles, life for the poorest countries that have yet to gain a foothold on the development ladder will become more difficult.\"\n\nHe did caveat that the outlook is perhaps not all doom and gloom:\n\n\"In most scenarios, the effects on the world economy as a whole would be negative, but manageable,\" says the economist.\n\n\"Admittedly, it seems unlikely that trade and investment flows between the West and China dry up completely, in a repeat of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union.\"\n\nSee More: The WTO slashed its global trade forecast in half \u2014 citing Trump's trade war, Brexit, and shifting monetary policy", "description": "Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics says globalization has peaked.
