He finished with 2 for 27.\n\nDasun Shanaka top scored with 17 and wicketkeeper Kusal Perera hit 16 before he was bowled by Mitchell Starc.\n\nSkipper Lasith Malinga was still there at the end with an unbeaten 13.\n\n\u201cThe bowlers didn\u2019t bowl in the right line and length. This is a good learning phase for our young bowlers,\u201d Malinga said.\n\n\u201cWe know we are playing against a tough team, but this is an opportunity for the inexperienced players to get used to the conditions before the World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe want to compete well in the next matches. They (batsmen) are playing on drop-in pitches for the first time and didn\u2019t know how the pitch will behave. This is not an excuse. We have to adjust in the next few games.\u201d\n\nFinch bludgeoned three sixes and eight fours in Australia\u2019s innings before holing out to Kusal Mendis at deep mid-wicket off left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan for 64 off 36 balls.\n\nThe Aussie skipper shared in a lively opening stand of 122 with Warner and looked in ominous scoring form before he top-edged the leg-spinner in the 11th over.\n\nMaxwell showcased a wide range of improvised shot-making for his 62 off just 28 balls, studded with three sixes and seven fours.\n\nHe partnered Warner in a 107-run stand and was dismissed, caught behind off Shanaka in the final over of the innings.\n\nIt was Australia\u2019s highest T20 total at home since their 221 against England in Sydney in 2007.\n\nAustralia face the Sri Lankans in Brisbane and Melbourne before Pakistan arrive for T20s in Sydney, Canberra and Perth as they prepare to host the T20 World Cup next October.", "description": "Adelaide (Australia) (AFP) \u2013 David Warner emphatically bounced back to form with a first-ever Twenty20 century as Australia crushed Sri Lanka by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/68da88_australian-batsman-david-warner-hits-out-on-his-way-twenty20-century-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
