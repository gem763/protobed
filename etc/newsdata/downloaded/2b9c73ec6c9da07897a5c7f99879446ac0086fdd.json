That was also up 4.4 per cent from a year earlier, the bureau said.\n\nThe other non-ferrous metals in this group, whose January to August output was up 4.6 per cent year-on-year at 38.63 million tonnes, are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [BEIJING] China's primary aluminium output in August fell 0.5 per cent from the previous month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday, as unexpected outages at two key smelters dented production. .
