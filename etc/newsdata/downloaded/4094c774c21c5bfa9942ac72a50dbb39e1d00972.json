What could possibly go wrong?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nThe Amazon Echo Dot, shown here, is one way users can access Amazon's digital assistant, Alexa. Amazon is crowdsourcing responses to questions for which Alexa doesn't yet have an answer. (Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cAlexa, are you trolling me?\u201d\n\nAmazon made its Alexa Answer program available to the general public this week after several months of beta testing, opening up its artificial intelligence assistant to crowdsourced recommendations for unprogrammed questions.\n\nThe process is relatively simple. Anyone can go to the Alexa Answers site, where questions frequently posed to the smart assistant are published in under 300 characters. The answers \u2014 which do not require a citation \u2014 are fed into Alexa\u2019s algorithms. The responses are rated by other Alexa Answers users via a star system on the site, and by Alexa users via a \u201cDid that answer your question?\u201d audio prompt.\n\nThe most frequently answered questions on the website Thursday included: \u201cCan dogs have oranges?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the longest song in the world?\u201d and \u201cWhen was the fairest wheel invented?\u201d\n\n[Alexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time]\n\nAmazon says it has put in place mechanisms \u2014 both automatic and manual \u2014 to prevent misuse. But experts and users have expressed concern that the program could still be overrun by bad actors, as has been the case with some previous big tech crowdsourcing projects.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re playing with fire, really,\u201d said Ginger Gorman, an online hate expert and the author of \u201cTroll Hunting.\"\n\nWhen the Web was created decades ago, it was envisioned as a place to expand knowledge with potentially limitless resources. But as just a handful of tech giants have increasingly dominated the way consumers search, shop and connect, it has changed introduced significant dangers as those companies struggle with how to source and surface information \u2014 particularly as consumers have less patience for scrolling on their phones.\n\n[Trolls turned Tay, Microsoft\u2019s fun millennial AI bot, into a genocidal maniac]\n\nIn particular, tech companies have struggled with trying to balance harnessing the wisdom of the crowd without falling prey to Internet trolls or disinformation. Companies from Wikipedia to Google have attempted to use crowdsourced information to help improve their knowledge, frequently with severe growing pains as they figure out security measures.\n\nWhen they fail, the results are often spectacularly bad. It took only a few hours for Twitter users to train Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered bot Tay to become racist and genocidal in 2016. A few years before, amateur sleuths on the online message board Reddit misidentified Sunil Tripathi as one of the Boston Marathon bombers.\n\nGorman said sites such as Wikipedia fight trolls by employing an intensive editing structure. She added that, from the outside, that appears to be something Alexa Answers lacks.\n\n[Amazon adds Alexa delete commands]\n\nAccording to Amazon, answers will be automatically rejected if they contain \u201cobscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, or infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights).\u201d Fast Company reported that Amazon\u2019s algorithms will filter out profanity and questions with a political angle, with at least some human editors.\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Kerry Hall said that Amazon has filters that will flag when a contributor is editing an answer multiple times, as well as help prevent potentially offensive questions and answers from surfacing. Users can also up- or downvote answers to help weed out problems.\n\n\u201cHigh quality answers are important to us, and this is something we take seriously \u2014 we will continue to evolve Alexa Answers,\u201d she added in an email.", "description": "\u201cAlexa, are you trolling me?\u201d Amazon opens its Alexa Answers project to the public and gambles on the good will of the internet.", "authors": ["Marie C.
