(Picture: AP/KTVA)\n\nA horrific sex killing was uncovered after a stunned woman found a memory card containing a video the perpetrator had made of himself raping and killing his victim.\n\nBrian Smith, 48, was arrested last week in Anchorage, Alaska after a woman discovered an SD card on the ground that had 39 photos and 12 videos that show a man \u2018beating\u2019 and \u2018raping\u2019 a woman, police said.\n\nDetectives examined the contents of the card, labeled \u2018Homicide at Midtown Marriott,\u2019 and said the digital files show Smith battering the woman while telling her to die. At times he is even heard laughing while carrying out the brutal torture, it is alleged.\n\nPolice later identified the victim as 30-year-old Katherine Henry, whose remains were found dumped off the Seward Highway less than a week before the SD card was found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators said they were also able to identify Smith as the man in the video because of his distinct \u2018English-sounding\u2019 accent. The Alaska Police department said Smith is an immigrant from South Africa.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSmith was already known to police because he was a suspect in a different investigation, although authorities have not released the nature of that investigation, according to KTVA.\n\nHotel records from the TownePlace Suites by Marriott show Smith stayed from September 2-4.
