They aren't dangerous.\n\n\u201cThis is the last thing you need to worry about,\u201d Fan said.\n\n'Bomb cyclone' coming: Powerful coastal storm known as a 'bomb cyclone' will blast the Northeast from New York to Maine\n\nFan and his colleagues studied seismic and oceanographic records from 2006 to 2019 and found a connection between strong storms and intense seismic activity near the edges of continental shelves or ocean banks.\n\nResearchers found evidence of more than 10,000 stormquakes during those years offshore of New England, Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico in the USA, as well as offshore of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and British Columbia in Canada.\n\nOne example the researchers cited was Hurricane Bill, an Atlantic storm in 2009 that strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane and struck Newfoundland as a tropical storm. When the hurricane arrived, numerous seismic events were located off the New England and Nova Scotia coasts\n\nThe study said Hurricane Ike in 2008 and Hurricane Irene in 2011 also produced stormquakes.\n\nThere is still more to learn about stormquakes, Fan said.\n\n\"We have lots of unknowns. We weren\u2019t even aware of the existence of the natural phenomenon. It really highlights the richness of the seismic wave field and suggests we are reaching a new level of understanding of seismic waves,\u201d he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Stormquakes: Strong storms can generate earthquakes", "description": "Scientists discovered\u00a0a phenomenon that occurs when\u00a0a strong storm sparks seismic events in the\u00a0seafloor.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XNv8vWEJ972d6i7Cysi77w--~B/aD0xMzAxO3c9MTk1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d3ef1ce16d310b5c8e00ce1b67d4d890", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
