Bordeaux will be looking to push forward themselves in the clash.\n\nMontpellier v Angers - 7pm\n\nAfter a damp squib of a display against Reims last weekend, Montpellier will have to come out firing when they host Angers.\n\nThey conceded in the second minute and offered little in the way of threat, to the extent that manager Michel Der Zakarian made a change in the 42nd minute.\n\nNot that it had much impact. They failed to score and still sit seventh in the Ligue 1 table going into this one.\n\nIt feels as though Angers have reverted to the mean after losing 4-0 against PSG and then falling to a 1-0 defeat against Brest on Saturday.\n\nThey will be aiming to take a win from Montpellier to keep up their surprise stint towards the top of the table which already feels as though it is fading away.\n\nMontpellier will hope to put on a better display against Angers after their loss at Reims\n\nBrest v Dijon - 7pm\n\nIrvin Cardona's rapid impact on Saturday, scoring within three minutes of coming onto the pitch, earned Brest a second win on the spin and they are now into the top half of the table.\n\nThe visit of a team in the drop zone is cause for optimism, as is the return of Romain Perraud, who has got over his hamstring issue and could be back in their defence this weekend.\n\nDijon, meanwhile, have put aside a genuinely awful start that saw them fail to win any of their opening seven games to pick up two draws and two wins in their last four games.\n\nThey are, however, still stuck in 19th place and need more wins to start climbing out of the drop zone.\n\nLyon v Metz - 7pm - BT Sport Extra 2\n\nRudi Garcia's arrival at Lyon felt like a whimper rather than a bang, given the chatter around the Ligue 1 side had been whether they could tempt Jose Mourinho into taking the job.\n\nTheir follow-up, a 0-0 draw against Dijon, matched the reaction. But Lyon were comfortably the better side, having 24 shots at goal and should really have come away with the three points.\n\nThey also lost in their Champions League match in mid-week very late on.\n\nNow Garcia needs to get a result to give his reign something to hang its hat on. The visit of a team just above 17th-placed Lyon in the table will probably come as a boost, then.\n\nMetz did win their last game against high-flying Nantes, though, although a red card played a big part.\n\nThis is fundamentally a game that both teams will be desperate to win given their tough starts.\n\nRudi Garcia will be desperate to pick up a first win as Lyon manager against Metz on Saturday\n\nReims v Nimes - 7pm\n\nReims have had an impressive start to the campaign, their win against PSG at the Parc des Princes last month looking less like a shock the more they pick up results.\n\nThey are deservedly third in the table and have shown a capacity to grind out wins, earning victories in both of their last two games by a solitary goal.\n\nIn contrast to their high-flying opponents, Nimes are down in the relegation zone and the only positive they can take into the game is that, at the least, they have stopped losing.\n\nA run of two straight defeats has been followed by a pair of score draws, including Saturday's 1-1 with Amiens. They will do well to come away from the Stade Auguste-Delaune with anything.\n\nStrasbourg v Nice - 7pm\n\nThis has not been the season Nice were hoping for after the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain's richest man, as owner.\n\nThey are down in 11th, having lost three of their last five matches, and have offered little to suggest they have benefited from their late transfer window splurge on the likes of Kasper Dolberg.\n\nAt the very least, Strasbourg offer a great opportunity to turn that questionable run of form around.\n\nThey are bottom of Ligue 1 but manager Thierry Laurey is looking up. He pointed out that they are only three points off 12th after last weekend's loss and it is that sort of optimism that he will carry into Saturday.\n\nThierry Laurey is optimistic about Strasbourg's prospects despite sitting in bottom place\n\nSunday\n\nRennes v Toulouse - 2pm - BT Sport 2\n\nRennes might have looked at this home game against 15th-placed Toulouse as an opportunity to overcome a dire run of form.\n\nThey have tasted defeat in three of their last five matches and drawn the other two, last winning a game in any competition towards the end of August.\n\nThat is not good enough for a side who qualified for the Europa League last season, and they are only in lower mid-table rather than worse because they won three on the spin to start the campaign.\n\nToulouse might also be hoping that they have turned a corner after their 2-1 win against Lille, with Yaya Sanogo and Max Gradel bagging. They impressed in that game, only conceding late on and having 17 shots at goal.\n\nIt was Antonio Kombouare's first game in charge and it could be a signpost for the future. This Toulouse side should start looking up.\n\nSaint-Etienne v Amiens - 4pm - BT Sport ESPN\n\nThis is a mid-table showdown in every definition of the term, although Amiens will do well to watch out for the resurgent hosts.\n\nTenth-placed Saint-Etienne have won their last three games on the spin, batting aside Bordeaux at the weekend, and have climbed up to 10th in the table as a result.\n\nAmiens, 13th, have been more up and down, drawing against Nimes but managing to overcome Marseille before that.\n\nThey will be hoping top scorer Serhou Guirassy keeps up his decent form, while they showed a never-say-die spirit against Nimes by nicking a 95th minute equaliser through Arturo Calabresi.\n\nArturo Calabresi won the game against Nimes for Amiens late on and will look to keep it up\n\nPSG v Marseille - 8pm - BT Sport 1\n\nFrance's biggest rivalry caps off the weekend with PSG meeting Marseille in Le Classique at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe country will want to know whether Marseille can take any points off their great rivals, given PSG are already five points clear at the top of the table and it feels as though they are going to stretch that further.\n\nNot that Andre Villas-Boas' side are in particularly good form. They have won just one of their last five, their game against Strasbourg at the weekend.\n\nThere will be a slight boost though, in that Neymar will be out with a hamstring problem. Not that it stopped PSG on Tuesday night as they thrashed Brugge 5-0, with Kylian Mbappe scoring a hat-trick.\n\nMauro Icardi scored twice too, suggesting Marseille will still have a potent strike force to contend with, Neymar or no Neymar, when they face their most hated rivals.", "description": "This weekend's Ligue 1 action is dominated by league leaders Paris Saint-Germain's clash with fierce rivals Marseille.
