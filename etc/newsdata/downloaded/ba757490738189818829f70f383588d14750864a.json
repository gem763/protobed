A growing risk is that the Fed could come close to saying they are done for a while, as they look to mirror the playbook in the 1990s that saw them deliver three cuts to keep the economic expansion going. If the Fed delivers a hawkish cut, as long as they leave the door open for more cuts, we still could see stocks continue to grind higher. A rate cut, with a wait-and-see on their recent stimulative measures could be the best case for US stocks.\n\n\"While trade and Brexit risks have eased, they are not going away anytime soon. The global outlook will likely remain vulnerable due to bevy of geopolitical risks and we should eventually see the market pricing in anywhere between two and three more Fed rate cuts in 2020.\"\n\nCommodities\n\nVale, BHP's Samarco gets license to resume operations after dam burst: Production is expected to resume toward the end of 2020 at less than one third of its previous rate, Vale said.\n\nChina gobbles up iron ore amid less severe winter steel curbs: Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv show that imports of the ore used to make steel are on track to exceed 100 million tonnes in October.\n\nZinc prices rose on Friday as London Metal Exchange inventories touched the lowest level in 12 years, though analysts said the higher prices failed to reflect large amounts of hidden stock.\n\nInventories in LME-registered warehouses fell to 58,525 tonnes, their lowest since October 2007 after sliding by half this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In the background, we think there are a lot of off-exchange stocks in zinc and that the falls in exchange stocks are misleading,\" said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics in London.\n\n\"All the signs are that demand is very weak. I was just looking at galvanised steel production in China and that's in deep negative territory despite wider steel production growing strongly.\"\n\nThe bulk of zinc production is used for galvanising steel.\n\nLME benchmark zinc gained 0.8% in final open-outcry trading to $US2510 a tonne.

Rowe Price head of Australian equities Randal Jenneke.\n\n\"Valuations are fine because the reality is rates are zero and in a world of zero interest rates, a market trading on 15 times is not expensive.
