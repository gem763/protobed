Every couple of trips to the gym? Whenever you start noticing a stench lingering on your favourite high-waisted leggings?\n\nNobody\u2019s here to preach about how you should be sudsing up after anytime you sweat. Truth is, there\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule everyone should stick to when it comes to washing activewear. There are, however, some helpful tips and guidelines from cleaning pros that can help your workout clothes last longer than a HIIT class.\n\n\u201cHow often you wash activewear is totally dependent on the individual \u2014 the amount of activity, the amount of sweat you produce, personal preference,\u201d says Maggie Oakley, merchandise director at Smartwool, an outdoor activewear brand in the US. (Yeah sorry, sweat monsters \u2014 you likely need to spend more money on washing detergent than your friend who seems to only glisten at the gym.)\n\nYour laundry routine also depends on where you call home, believe it or not: Live in the desert, and you might get away with hanging up sweaty gear to dry between wears; have a humid house where even line-dried clothes stay a little damp, and you\u2019ll want to wash after every wear.\n\nBut keeping your workout gear clean is important \u2014 and the sweat factor is far from the only reason why.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your sweat that produces odour, it\u2019s bacteria \u2014 and they multiply in moist environments like sweaty gym clothes,\u201d explains Dr Kelly Reynolds, professor of environmental science at the University of Arizona.\n\nWe all have some yeast and bacteria on our bodies naturally, and it doesn\u2019t cause a problem, she says. But if you\u2019re in clingy (read: not-so-breathable) workout gear and the balance of bacteria gets out of whack, you can get a rash\u2026or way worse. How much worse? Think staph infection or MRSA. Okay, your likelihood of picking up either of those is slim, but why risk it when washing up will prevent bacteria buildup in the first place?\n\nTo nix as much bacteria as possible, wash your activewear with hot water. And definitely sidestep fabric softener \u2014 it releases a lot of oils that clog up clothing fibres, and bacteria cling to the oils like crazy, says Reynolds.\n\nAdding bleach to the washer helps nix nasty bugs (but can harm colours and some synthetic fibres), and pouring a little vinegar into the rinse cycle does the same trick, as it has antibacterial properties and breaks up bacteria-attracting oils in your gym clothes, says Marilee Nelson, co-founder of an American natural cleaning products brand Branch Basics.\n\nHere\u2019s how often you should be getting all your sweaty gear spic \u2018n\u2019 span.\n\nIf your workout didn\u2019t leave your shirt totally drenched, you might be able to get away with skipping a wash.\n\nThat said, hang it up to dry as soon as you get home, and maybe rinse out any sweat first. \u201cUV light is damaging to bacteria, so line drying in the sun in particular will kill the vast majority of bacteria,\u201d says Reynolds.\n\nOne exception: sports bras, or any top with a built-in bra. The skin under women\u2019s breasts is a common place for yeast infections, warns Reynolds, so you\u2019ll want to wash pieces that cling to this area to make sure you\u2019re not spreading harmful bacteria.\n\nREAD MORE: 11 Ways To Get The Sweat Smell Out Of Your Workout Clothes\n\nWhen it comes to shorts and leggings, you\u2019re better off sudsing them up ASAP.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to wash anything that comes into contact with the groin more frequently,\u201d says Reynolds \u2014 especially if you tend to go commando in said shorts or leggings. Here\u2019s why: This area of your body is super-susceptible to irritations and yeast infections. Give a pair of bottoms the chance to accumulate bacteria, then wearing them again means you risk contracting an infection down there.\n\nDon\u2019t skip washing your socks, even if you think your feet stayed cool and sweat-free during that morning run.\n\nYou might not notice an odour coming up from your kicks, but socks should be washed after every workout since most people rarely wash their sneakers and they could be holding on to harmful bacteria, says Reynolds.\n\nWhen it comes to your kicks, if yours have a removable liner, put them in a laundry bag and wash weekly, suggests Reynolds. Also, spray your sneakers inside and out with a disinfecting spray or dust them with baking soda. Then leave them out in the sun for extra bacteria-killing power between workouts.\n\nYou can stretch more wears out between washes if your gym clothes are made of natural fibres.\n\nSynthetic fibres have been specially constructed to wick away sweat and keep you cool, yes. But when it comes to harbouring nasty bacteria, they\u2019re the worst.\n\n\u201cBacteria cling to synthetic fibres more than natural fibres,\u201d says Reynolds. On the flip side, natural fabrics like wool and cotton breathe better and don\u2019t trap nearly as much bacteria \u2014 and because of that, you might get away with wearing them for several gym sessions without cleaning and still sidestep the stink.\n\nReynolds\u2019s advice if you\u2019re wearing natural fabrics: Keep track of when you work out and how many sessions you can rack up before those gym clothes start to smell \u2014 then just make sure you soap them up a workout or two sooner next time.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "*Asking for a friend*", "authors": ["Laurel Liecht"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9074/7a61caa576cd49cb97a189c3aa529973.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
