It arrives as the climactic day of trade talks is about to get under way in Washington, and presents a challenge to the U.S. president\u2019s efforts to limit portfolio flows to his geopolitical rival. Just as the U.S. is telling Americans not to invest in China, President Xi Jinping is welcoming them with open arms.\n\nCertainly, China\u2019s offer is tempting. The biggest online brokerages in the U.S. are entering a bloody price war, eliminating trading commissions on stocks and options. China remains the last major market on Earth where traders can still make money. And the stock market is significantly cheaper than its U.S. counterpart.\n\nAsset management, in particular, can be lucrative. Unlike much of the world, where passive indexing is on the rise, investors in China still have faith in active managers. Star investors can attract billions of dollars and are able to charge handsome management fees.\n\nMoreover, foreigners can be comforted that China is serious about luring portfolio inflows. As we\u2019ve written, the country is edging dangerously close to twin deficits in its fiscal and current accounts. So it needs as much foreign capital as it can get \u2014 even in the form of hot portfolio flows \u2014 to keep control over the balance of payments and avoid a further buildup of debt.\n\nLurking behind the open invitation, though, are many unanswered questions.\n\nFor instance, how will foreigners make money from plain-vanilla securities brokerage? While advanced technology has eroded commission fees in the U.S., China\u2019s brokers can\u2019t charge a penny either. That\u2019s for a different reason \u2014 an extremely crowded field. With more than 100 players, the return on equity for publicly traded Chinese brokers is just 2.5% compared with 7.8% globally.\n\nThe biggest can make money by lending to credit-strapped China Inc. Fidelity Investments is adopting a similar model by expanding into the field of alternative credit. Whether foreign institutions will want to wade into the murky world of China\u2019s shadow banking is debatable, though.\n\nThere\u2019s also the challenge of overcoming entrenched local rivals that dominate the market. Foreign institutions already active in China are candid that even having 100% control of their operations won\u2019t be a game-changer in the near term.\n\nChinese securities firms will fight to defend their turf. Foreign firms will have to pay up to hire staff and build out offices, and then face a time-consuming wait to obtain licenses. Winning deals won't be easy. So far this year, the top 19 underwriters on Chinese domestic IPOs are all mainland firms. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). was the highest-ranking foreign firm, in 20th place.\n\nFor all that, China has shown that it\u2019s delivering on plans to open its financial markets further. The message for U.S. trade negotiators sitting down in Washington on Friday is not to expect a comprehensive deal. Even as China seeks an end to the trade tensions, it\u2019s moving ahead with Plan B.\n\nTo contact the authors of this story: Shuli Ren at sren38@bloomberg.netNisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "description": "Xi Upstages Trump With a Chinese Welcome Mat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1b85bd86500d4bcd403d61d19e875d21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
