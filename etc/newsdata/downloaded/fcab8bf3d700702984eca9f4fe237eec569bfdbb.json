REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nLam, in a pre-recorded televised message, on Wednesday formally withdrew the bill, acceding to one of pro-democracy protesters\u2019 five demands, although many demonstrators and lawmakers said the move was too little, too late.\n\nThe official China Daily said on Thursday that the withdrawal of the bill was an olive branch that leaves demonstrators with no excuse to continue violence.\n\nThe announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealed that Beijing had thwarted Lam\u2019s earlier proposals to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.\n\nThe Beijing-backed leader is expected to meet the media before she departs for a trip to China\u2019s Guangxi province on Thursday afternoon, local media reported.\n\nSkirmishes broke out in some districts late on Wednesday after Lam\u2019s announcement, which came after a weekend of some of the most violent protests the city has seen in the past three months.\n\nPolice said a suspected petrol bomb was hurled at a luxury property in Kowloon district in the early hours of Thursday and the suspects fled on a motorbike. Local newspaper Apple Daily said the house belonged to Jimmy Lai, who was in the property at the time. Pro-democracy publishing tycoon Lai is an outspoken critic of Beijing.\n\nThe Asian financial hub has been roiled by some of the worst violence in decades, with protesters burning barricades and throwing petrol bombs and police retaliating with water cannon, tear gas and batons.\n\nThe bill, which would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, was seen as the latest example of what many residents see as ever-tighter control by Beijing, despite the promise of autonomy.\n\nThe former British colony was handed back to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d administration which gave the city of more than 7 million people more freedoms than mainland cities, such as an independent judiciary.\n\nChina denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs and accuses Western countries of fuelling the protests.\n\nImages of some of the fiercest clashes have been beamed live to the world on television screens, sending jitters across the international business community and leading to a large drop in tourism.\n\nThe Hong Kong government took out a full-page advert in the Australian Financial Review on Thursday saying it is \u201cdetermined to achieve a peaceful, rational and reasonable resolution\u201d and is resolutely committed to \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d.\n\nIt ends the advert by saying: \u201cWe will no doubt bounce back. We always do\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nMore than 1,100 people have been arrested since the violence escalated in June and Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nChina has strongly denounced the violence and warned it could use force to restore order. Beijing is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct 1.\n\nLam, wearing a navy blue blazer and pink top, said in her televised message that her administration would reach out to the community to start a dialogue to address the discontent with the \u201cforemost priority now is to end violence, to safeguard the rule of law and to restore order and safety in society.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is expected to address the media on Thursday, a day after she withdrew a controversial extradition bill that has triggered mass protests and plunged the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426349148&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8401N"}
