Tchaikovsky had a wide audience in mind in 1888 when he composed \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty,\u201d just as Prokofiev did when he wrote \u201cCinderella\u201d in the early 1940s.\n\nWhenever non-musicians talk to me about music, there inevitably comes the moment when they say they feel they don\u2019t know anything about it. These same people can happily engage in conversations about restaurants, books, cars, movies, the best way to roast cauliflower, the mayor of their town, or whether plaid is back in fashion, without similar hesitancy. Music? Sure, if it\u2019s popular music, and those conversations can get really specific and delightfully passionate.\n\nWhen it comes to classical music, especially the lurking terror of \u201ccontemporary classical music,\u201d people have been made to think they cannot have a valid opinion. But it\u2019s much more like roasting cauliflower than you have been led to believe.\n\n\u201c Classical music deals with adult emotions and ideas, but you can still love aspects of it as a kid. \u201d\n\nThe response to music will always be emotional. All the intellectual arguments fall literally on deaf ears if you don\u2019t like it. Music, as the invisible art form, has an unpredictable way of entering your brain and firing pleasure centers\u2014or not. Just as you are no less of a person for not liking broccoli, the same is true for not liking Mozart. Maybe another vegetable, or composer, is more appealing to you\u2014but as with broccoli, you may come to Mozart later in life.\n\nClassical music deals with adult emotions and ideas, but you can still love aspects of it as a kid. Pre-adolescents can hear dramatically swirling melodies and throbbing rhythms, and if they are attracted to what they have heard, their understanding will only increase as years pass by.\n\nAs a boy growing up in New York City in the 1950s, I first heard the overture to Wagner\u2019s \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d as the theme music for a science-fiction television show called \u201cCaptain Video,\u201d and it was absolutely thrilling. Only later in life did I learn it was music that described a supernatural storm that tossed a ghost across endless seas in the hopes of finding a woman who would love him and break the curse of his eternal wandering.\n\nWhen I first conducted the opera, that childhood imprint of the music from \u201cCaptain Video\u201d was still somewhere in the farthest reaches of my mind. Music can be written to evoke a very specific sound, mood or scene, yet can be heard differently in different contexts. Wagner\u2019s overture gets our attention with a heroic-sounding melody from the horns and then a depiction of a stormy sea, and as a kid, I knew the hero was Captain Video. As an adult, I understood that, far from being merely heroic, the very first notes were meant as the wail of a ghost seeking redemption. The notes were the same, but I certainly was not, and yet there was comfort in revisiting something from my childhood with the benefit of an adult\u2019s knowledge.\n\nIndeed, much of my inadvertent youthful exposure to classical music came from television. I heard it in the opening themes of children\u2019s programs, science and variety shows, news broadcasts and dramas. I encountered Grieg \u2019s sentimental \u201cThe Last Spring\u201d on the series \u201cI Remember Mama,\u201d Khachaturian\u2019s \u201cSabre Dance\u201d with every juggler on the Ed Sullivan show, Debussy \u2019s mysterious \u201cSyrinx\u201d for solo flute on an archaeology show called \u201cWhat in the World,\u201d the Russian dance from Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d on \u201cKukla, Fran and Ollie.\u201d The rescue music from Rossini \u2019s overture to \u201cWilliam Tell\u201d is perhaps most famous as the theme music for \u201cThe Lone Ranger.\u201d And whoever produced \u201cCaptain Video\u201d certainly knew Wagner, whose music popped up again and again in my childhood entertainment.\n\nAll of these shows, across my formative years, pointed ahead to the glorious repertory that awaited me.\n\n\u201c When you hear music that calls out to you, it will tell you something about yourself. \u201d\n\nBut does it still happen today? That question was answered for me last summer when my two great-nephews, 8-year-old twins, were playing with Legos. One of them had successfully completed a task and began singing the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d The other joined in, singing in innocent merriment. They kept going well into the more complex development of the simple melodies, but the words were different. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked. The answer: \u201cCaptain Underpants!\u201d\n\nA time will come when they hear a performance of Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah\u201d and the vague memories of their youth will be transformed and connected to classical music intended to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. Still, two boys born in 2010 absolutely knew that a composition from 1741 was and continues to be music of triumph and joy. No one is teaching them \u201chow to love classical music.\u201d\n\nThe music is there, and it waits for you. You can come to it at any point in your life. There are so many different kinds, spanning a relatively short period of history. When you find that you don\u2019t like something, you are in great company: the company of people who love classical music, because no one loves it all.\n\nWhen you hear music that calls out to you, however, it will tell you something about yourself. Once you enter its domain and it enters yours, it will become a life partner, always illuminating who you are and who you were. It will be beautiful because it is yours.\n\n\u2014Mr. Mauceri has served as music director of four opera companies and three orchestras and is the recipient of a Grammy, a Tony and three Emmy awards.
