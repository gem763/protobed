It\u2019s cruelty.\n\n\u201cI had to give up work in July an operation to remove the tumour, medically I can\u2019t drive, so I\u2019ve had no income at all since then.\n\n\u201cWe thought I was getting Universal Credit but at the Job Centre Plus in Johnstone they told me I wasn\u2019t eligible because my partner Terry works part-time.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cI said \u2018I have worked all my life, paid my tax, my National Insurance, been a legitimate guy and now I\u2019m terminally ill with months to live you are telling me I\u2019m not entitled to anything?\n\n\u201cThe woman said \u2018no\u2019. And when I asked what I was supposed to do? She said, \u2018make yourself available for work.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen we got home, Terry just burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t work - I have radiotherapy everyday, I take a chemotherapy tablet everyday.\n\n\u201cMy specialist has given me nine months.\u201d\n\nFormer BEA Systems engineer Michael says the stress of dealing with constant letters and phone calls has been at times almost too much to bear.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou get these letters from the DWP which are almost impossible to understand, and you worry nonstop about them.\n\n(Image: Andrew Neil)\n\n\u201cAnd then you are told you are getting nothing from them.\n\n\u201cI think people should know that this is how the system treats people. It is so cruel.\u201d\n\nMichael, who has lost three stone since falling ill, had his Universal Credit claim refused because partner Terry works part-time and the application is decided on overall household income.\n\nHe added: \u201cI have been told I can\u2019t take my pension either.\n\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t have that, it has been devastating.\n\n\u201cI will hopefully qualify for a Personal Independence Payment, but that can take up to ten weeks.\u201d\n\n(Image: Andrew Neil)\n\nAfter two years of torment following the murder of his beloved son Craig, his battle for justice and now his cancer battle, dad of three Michael is philosophical about the future.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not scared of death, not in the slightest. I said when Craig died it should have been me.\n\n\u201c My faith tells me that when I die I\u2019ll see him again.\n\n\u201cAnd with the time I have left I\u2019m going to enjoy myself with the family, with Terry, my sons, and my grand kids.\n\n\u201cWe are going to enjoy the time I have left.\u201d\n\nToday the family will find out if their campaign for Fatal Accident Inquiry has paid off when they meet with the Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC.\n\n(Image: Andrew Neil)\n\nFather-of-three Craig McClelland was stabbed to death by serial knife thug Wright in Tweed Avenue, Foxbar, in July 2017.\n\nIt emerged Wright had removed his electronic tag just days after being released early from prison and was \u201cunlawfully at large\u201d when he murdered innocent Craig.\n\nJustice Minister Humza Yousaf rejected the family\u2019s call for a public inquiry, claiming police and prison service watchdog reports were sufficient.\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \u201cWe are looking urgently into Mr McClelland\u2019s case.\n\n\"Our priority is to support people with health conditions and make sure that people nearing the end of their life get the benefits they are entitled to quickly and easily.\u201d\n\nThe department also says it has terminal illness special rules and anyone subject to it can have their work-related requirements waived.", "description": "Michael McClelland is dying of a brain tumour and is fighting for answers over his son's murder - but has been told he's fit for work", "authors": ["David Campbell", "Image", "Andrew Neil", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543348.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DNP_PDE_081019mcclelland_10JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
