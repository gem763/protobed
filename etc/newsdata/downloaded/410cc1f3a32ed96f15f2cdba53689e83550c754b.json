It will be transformed into a \u201csafe zone,\u201d or buffer, between Turkey and Kurdish forces.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Kurdish groups have yet to confirm whether they agree to the deal.\n\nTurkey and Russia both hailed the agreement as \u201chistoric.\u201d Critics like Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the US has now \u201cbeen sidelined\u201d as a decision-maker in the conflict.\n\n\u201cRussia and the murderous Assad regime are calling the shots,\u201d Menendez said at a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from the agreement:\n\nWinner: Putin and Russia\n\ncaption Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. source Reuters\n\nPutin has emerged in the agreement as one of the main power brokers in the fate of Syria\u2019s future, taking over the role the US once held.\n\nThe agreement between Putin and Erdogan may seem surprising, given that Russia backed the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and Turkey supported rebel groups fighting against the regime.\n\nBut the agreement between the two world powers strengthens their influence in Syria as the country tries to rebound after years of civil war.\n\nAccording to CNN, Putin said Ankara and Moscow have agreed to respect Syria\u2019s \u201csovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d which can be framed as a successful foreign policy move by Russia.\n\nAnalysts told The Washington Post that the deal also helps Russia\u2019s ally, Assad, in regaining control over more of the fragmented country.\n\nAssad also \u201cexpressed his full support\u201d for the deal, the Kremlin said, according to the BBC.\n\nWinner: Erdogan and Turkey\n\nThe biggest winner in this deal is Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, which considers Kurdish forces in Syria to be a threat because of their association with the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, which has long fought an armed conflict for independence against Turkey.\n\nTurkey has previously expressed concern that the US was arming its long-standing enemy. Erdogan successfully pushed Trump to pull out the remaining US troops in the region during a phone call earlier this month.\n\nWhen Trump announced the withdrawal of the remaining US troops, Turkey waged a brutal offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nTurkey has also been able to expand a buffer zone along its border, which Erdogan has said will be used to resettle more than 1 million Syrian refugees displaced by the war.\n\nIn effect, Turkey has been able to get exactly what it wanted in terms of securing a \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border, while also skirting US sanctions threatened but later withdrawn by President Donald Trump last week.\n\nTurkey and the US agreed to a 5-day ceasefire on October 17, with the US agreeing not to pursue further sanctions in exchange.\n\nLoser: Kurdish-led forces\n\ncaption A Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) flag flutters as people celebrate the spring festival of Nowruz, in al-Darbasiyah town, on the Syrian-Turkish border, Syria March 21, 2017. source REUTERS/Rodi Said\n\nThough the Kurds have yet to explicitly agree to the deal, they are left with a difficult decision: Fight an intensifying assault from Turkey, or concede defeat and give up land they now control.\n\nBeyond the area along the Turkish border, the Russian-Turkish agreement also demands the YPG to withdraw from the towns of Manbij and Tal Rifaat, which lay outside of the agreed \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Mazloum Abdi, the head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), wrote in a letter to Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday that the SDF had completed their withdrawal from the Turkish \u201csafe zone,\u201d though neither the Kurds nor Turkey has officially confirmed this information.\n\nA senior US official told the Journal that the agreement between Turkey and Russia meant that Turkey was entitled to use force against the Kurds if they are discovered inside the \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Turks can find any inside the safe zone \u2026 the Turks will either let us know or they will shoot them.\u201d\n\nLoser: Trump and the US\n\nsource Win McNamee\n\nThe deal has shown that the US has essentially forfeited its clout in the region, as Turkey and Russia conduct negotiations amongst themselves.\n\nThough the US has not given a clear deadline for the withdrawal of its troops, the deal solidified that it is now beyond the US to make these kind of decisions.\n\nAs the ceasefire agreement between the US and Turkey was set to expire, Sergei Shoigu, Russia\u2019s defense minister, suggested on Tuesday evening that the US had \u201cone hour and 31 minutes left\u201d to exit Syria, CNN said.\n\nA senior US official told The Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration was still reviewing options for leaving troops in Syria, though US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters on Saturday that most US troops in Syria will soon be moved to neighboring Iraq to prevent a resurgence by the Islamic State.\n\nRussian troops have already entered the region and have begun to take over US military bases.\n\n\u201cHumiliation doesn\u2019t begin to cover what the US forces are feeling right now,\u201d one coalition military official told Business Insider.", "description": "Business Insider - Here are the winners and losers from the agreement reached Tuesday, and what it means for the region's future as it tries to rebuild..
