But on Thursday, just before midnight, the temperature in the city plunged to a wintry 13 degrees \u2014 a record low for this time of year.\n\nThe 70-degree temperature drop from one day to the next nearly broke a local record. It tied for the second-largest temperature change in the city since 1872, when records began, according to CBS Denver.\n\nThe biggest two-day temperature change occurred in 2008, when temps dropped 76 degrees between December 14 and 15, CBS Denver reports.\n\nAnd while this week's temperature plunge wasn't the most drastic drop ever, it was certainly the largest temperature swing to occur in October. The frigid weather was accompanied by the area's first snowfall of the season, which left Denver coated in 1 to 3 inches of snow.", "description": "The 70-degree difference in temperatures was one of the largest drops in history", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/9335ecf8-7e99-4512-b1e7-23c63b52a4d5/thumbnail/1200x630/24944a87e046b3d21d7b91fbc79b3cc5/ap-19283651866653.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
