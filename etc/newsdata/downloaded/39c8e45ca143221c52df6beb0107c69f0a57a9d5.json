The currency was pounded 25% lower last month when business-friendly President Mauricio Macri performed poorly in the Aug. 11 primary, clearing the way for a likely victory by Peronist Alberto Fernandez in the Oct. 27 general election.\n\nMacri's administration said last month it would renegotiate terms of local and international sovereign bonds, after a sharp crash in the peso currency in August left Argentina teetering on the edge of default.\n\nThe draft law reviewed by Reuters seeks to avoid a legally messy restructuring by including collective action clauses, which require amendments made to a single series of bonds be approved by holders of 75% of the capital. The remaining 25% of holders would then be obliged to accept the restructuring terms.\n\nIf the changes affect two or more bond series, then consent would be needed from 66.66% of bondholders and at least half of those for each individual series of bonds. If these levels were met, then all holders would have no choice but to comply.\n\nFitch Ratings expects holders of Argentina dollar bonds to have to write off part of their investments under the revamp of terms, one of the agency's analysts said.
