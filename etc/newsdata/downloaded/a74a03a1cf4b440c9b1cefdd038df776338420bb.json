REUTERS/Sergio Perez\n\nFrancisco Franco y Martinez-Bordiu will play a leading role in Thursday\u2019s low-key ceremony in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid.\n\nHe criticised both politicians and the judiciary for allowing his grandfather\u2019s exhumation, and reburial in a nearby private family vault, to proceed.\n\n\u201cI consider the exhumation a profanation,\u201d he told Reuters late on Wednesday from his home in Madrid\u2019s embassy district.\n\n\u201cI feel a great deal of rage because (the government) has used something as cowardly as digging up a corpse as propaganda, and political publicity to win a handful of votes before an election.\u201d Spain goes to the polls on Nov. 10.\n\nA long-standing ambition of the acting Socialist government, the exhumation was ratified by parliament and approved last year by the Supreme Court, which viewed it as a valid interpretation of a 2007 law promoting recognition of those who suffered under Franco\u2019s regime.\n\nThe same court rejected an appeal against the operation lodged by the Franco family, which was also refused leave by authorities to drape the coffin in the national flag and invite media to the ceremony.\n\n\u201cThey have sought to restrict access to such a point - because they want their own photographs, their own images. It is nonsensical that they would refuse to let us drape the Spanish flag over the casket,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have buried him where they\u2019ve wanted and how they\u2019ve wanted, completely ignoring any right that we (might) have.\u201d\n\nMore than four decades after the dictator\u2019s death in 1975, the exhumation has touched a nerve in a country where divisions over his legacy remain acute.\n\nAn El Mundo poll this month showed 43% of Spaniards favoured the operation, while 32.5% opposed it.\n\nFranco\u2019s admirers saw him as a firm hand who fostered Spain\u2019s longest period of peace after centuries of turmoil.\n\nOpponents, meanwhile, have long questioned the propriety of a man who unleashed a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died being buried alongside some of his victims. Thousands of dead Republicans were moved into the valley without their families\u2019 consent.\n\nFor Franco\u2019s 64-year-old grandson, the impact of the exhumation has parallels with another political crisis, in Spain\u2019s far northeast.\n\n\u201c(This) has only served to divide the country, create ...separatists and unionists, because it\u2019s a way of creating a captive vote. It\u2019s like the separatists in Catalonia, who are so fashionable these days.\u201d", "description": "A decision by Spain's government to remove Francisco Franco's remains from a state mausoleum is simply an act of political opportunism ahead of next month's election, the late dictator's oldest grandson and namesake said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Clara-Laeila Laudette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444279793&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M25I", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
