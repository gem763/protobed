The Hubble data reveals only that water vapor exists in its atmosphere, and cannot tell astronomers how much there is.\n\nThe detection is another milestone in a field that is so packed with exoplanets that the most exciting work in exoplanet research now focuses on studying their atmospheres.\n\nAnd just like the earliest days of exoplanet discoveries, it\u2019s a competitive field; Benneke published his team\u2019s findings the night before a separate team was scheduled to announce the same detection.\n\nBoth papers analyzed Hubble observations that Benneke had designed and requested from the space telescope, but which were made public and accessible to all astronomers. The second team published their findings in the journal Nature Astronomy today, but Benneke, whose paper has been submitted to The Astronomical Journal but not yet accepted, decided to beat them to it by posting his team\u2019s paper on arXiv, an online repository for preprints. The second team, led by Angelos Tsiaras, an astronomer at the University College London, reports the same detection, but stops short of suggesting there\u2019s liquid water suspended in the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nIt is tempting to take these papers and their buzz phrases\u2014exoplanet! water vapor! habitable zone!\u2014and jump right to the idea that K2-18b could harbor extraterrestrial life. But it would take a lot more than a whiff of water vapor to suggest that another world meets the conditions conducive to life.\n\nRead: A glowing clue in the search for alien life\n\nDespite some similarities in the temperatures of their orbits, K2-18b is not like Earth. Its atmosphere is thick and puffy with hydrogen, which suggests that the planet probably doesn\u2019t have a rocky surface. \u201cIf you have a lot of hydrogen in your atmosphere, the pressure keeps increasing as you go deeper and deeper,\u201d says Laura Kreidberg, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who studies exoplanet atmospheres, and who was not involved in this research. \u201cYou get to a liquid hydrogen layer before you reach a rocky surface.\u201d\n\nThese conditions mean that K2-18b is more similar to Neptune, the kind of planet where life is unlikely. The detection of water vapor on an exoplanet in its star\u2019s habitable zone is an exciting start, but astronomers want to find chemical signatures that are less ubiquitous in the universe. \u201cOxygen would be the real exciting thing to detect\u2014because that is actually produced by life,\u201d says David Charbonneau, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in these studies.\n\nIt is difficult to observe the chemical composition of exoplanets, even with powerful telescopes like Hubble. (The next generation of telescopes that can do this kind of work is still a few years away.) Hubble observes the light coming from distant stars, not the planets around them. To find the planets, astronomers must dig into the starlight that has passed through the planet\u2019s atmosphere on its way to Earth. \u201cSome of the stellar light filters through the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, and when it does that, some of that light will be absorbed by the chemistry that is in that atmosphere,\u201d says Ingo Waldmann, an astronomer at the University College London and one of the authors of the Nature Astronomy study. \u201cIf we manage to get these photons that went through the atmosphere of that planet, then we can characterize the chemistry of the atmosphere of that planet.\u201d", "description": "K2-18b probably can\u2019t host life as we know it, but it orbits in a cosmic sweet spot where water vapor in the atmosphere could turn into liquid.", "authors": ["Marina Koren"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/heic1917a-3/facebook.jpg?1568213191", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
