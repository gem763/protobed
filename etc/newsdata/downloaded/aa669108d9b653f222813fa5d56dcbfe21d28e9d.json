But I love doing this show, and I love working with Nicole, and with Simon. But it\u2019s like a whole new X Factor, it\u2019s nothing like it was. The show is great fun, and it pays.\u2019\n\nLol: When asked which seat she would be taking at the press launch on Wednesday, the Don't Hold Your Breath songstress told Dermot O'Leary: 'This side is my good side'\n\nLeft side: Nicole was a firm fixture on the X factor panel from 2012-2013 and again from 2016-2017, with Louis judging from 2004-2014, and 2016-2017 (pictured 2017)\n\nDiscussing the new format, show host Dermot O'Leary, 46, said:\u2018We\u2019re kind of off the map with this. Not sure we\u2019ll find a recording artist at the end of it, but we hope so.\u2019\n\n\u2018Some of Simon\u2019s decisions you can agree with, some \u2013 like 2015 \u2013 you can\u2019t agree with.\u2019\n\nOn who they thought would win the competition, Nicole backed Max and Harvey- identical twin singers from Berkshire who rose to fame on social app musical.ly\n\nShe said: \u2018I think everybody has a shot at winning right now, but if I had to answer like right now then the person that came to mind right now, then it\u2019d be the twins.\n\n\u2018Only because of social media and everything, and they\u2019re actually super talented. I\u2019m not gonna play them down: They sounded wicked up there, they brought the energy, they\u2019ve got everything going on.\n\nKnows her angles: Nicole pulled off her signature pose as she arrived at the 2017 auditions\n\nAnd again: Nicole made sure she sat to the left of Louis in 2013 to show off her best side\n\n\u2018But everybody, I genuinely feel has their own shot at winning\u2019.\n\nLouis added: \u2018I think it\u2019s wide open. I think it\u2019s a popularity contest as well. Martin (Bashir) was a revelation. And everyone\u2019s good.\u2019\n\nWhen asked if people with a huge online presence have an advantage, Nicole responded: \u2018Talent and personality and story and authenticity always shines through. This country knows heart very well, it\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m here, and people aren\u2019t stupid. People know what they gravitate to, what they feel, what they connect with.\u2019\n\nThe celebrity line up is Megan McKenna, 27, The Islanders - made up of Love Island 2018 contestants Wes Nelson, 21, Zara McDermott, 22, Samira Mighty and Eyal Booker, 24, Ricki Lake, 51, Try Star - made up of rugby players Thom Evans, 34, Levi Davis, 21, Ben Foden, 34, Hayley Hasselhoff, 27, The Chase star Jenny Ryan, 37, Cole & Edwards - made up of Strictly star - Brendan Cole, 43 and actor Jeremy Edwards, 48, Glee star Kevin McHale, 31.\n\nOnly recently, in an interview ahead of the launch, Simon revealed the reason why he decided to revamp the normal show into a celebrity version.\n\nHe is a popstar! The reality stalwart and Westlife manager couldn't resist taking a dig at his boss and long-time pal Simon Cowell, 60, for sacking him numerous times, only to bring him back for the celebrity version of the hit show\n\n'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it. I said to the team, \"You\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work.\"\n\n'So that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\nGuess who's back? He said: \u2018He\u2019s sacked me two or three times. But I love doing this show, and I love working with Nicole, and with Simon'\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nMeanwhile, returning judge Louis, 67, revealed why he's so excited about the show, adding that the contestants are not what people will expect.\n\nHe said: 'What we\u2019re doing this year I think is a brilliant idea. I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect. Some of them are really good.\n\n'The show feels more exciting, there\u2019s no bootcamp, no six chair challenge, it feels slick this year. It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.'\n\nReunited: Nicole, Louis and Simon are pictured with Sharon Osbourne and Dermot O'Leary in 2017\n\nWhile Nicole explained why the celebrity version differs from the civilian edition.\n\nShe explained: 'Obviously it\u2019s a lot shorter, which is the difference between The X Factor: Celebrity and the ones in the past. This one doesn\u2019t have boot camp and all that jazz, and I loved that we just cut straight to the chase. I was really excited to see who the celebrities were going to be.'\n\nAnd the Don't Hold Your Breath hitmaker ensured that she'll be as competitive as ever this year.\n\n'Oh always!' she insisted. 'You can\u2019t take that out of me! I\u2019m just going to be very supportive. This year I think the way Simon has done it is that we help them and support them. In the past when I did it, I was quite hands-on and did a lot. But I\u2019m ready to see what they are going to bring to this show.'\n\nThis series, like the civilian version, will see the acts split into three groups; the overs, the unders and the groups.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity starts Saturday 12th October 8:35pm on ITV.", "description": "Nicole Scherzinger wanted to ensure everything was perfect for her comeback to The X Factor: Celebrity as she revealed she only likes to be filmed from one side.", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips", "Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19532958-0-image-a-43_1570701826305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
