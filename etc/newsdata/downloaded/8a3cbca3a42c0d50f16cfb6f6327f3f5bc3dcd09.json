The three-week series of events themed around mental and physical health frames itself as a public conversation. It\u2019s an opportunity, through art, to talk about illness, disability and death \u2013 things that usually languish in agonised or embarrassed silence.\n\nCandoco want to talk about what it is to be a company of disabled and non-disabled dancers. What does it mean when we\u2019re invited to look at this range of different bodies on stage, and how can we discuss that? Made with Hetain Patel in 2014 and reiterated with different groups of dancers, Let\u2019s Talk About Dis plays humorously with candour, awkwardness and polite concealment. In a short series of sketches, the show scratches away at assumptions and identity, while the performers confound typical expectations of what dancing bodies can or should do. A wheelchair gracefully spins, pivots and tilts; a pair of crutches become surprisingly agile extra limbs.\n\nIn An Irresponsible Father\u2019s Guide to Parenting, comedian Laurence Clark addresses the neglected subject of disability and parenting. Before he become a parent, Clark never saw dads with cerebral palsy. His show fills that gap in representation, confronting perceptions of what fatherhood looks like. Taking on the offensive comments left under YouTube videos of a BBC documentary he and his family appeared in, he wittily prods at society\u2019s ideas of responsibility and irresponsibility. If not quite revelatory, it\u2019s a warm and funny hour of assumption smashing, complete with hilarious video appearances from Clark\u2019s two no-nonsense sons.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Confronting perceptions \u2026 Laurence Clark.\n\nIf disability as a topic is skirted around politely, death tends to be outright avoided. Sick! festival is challenging that, with a series of art works designed to get us talking about the end of life. At the Whitworth Gallery, the video installation Death & Birth in My Life shares intimate discussions about the bookends of life. Artist Mats Staub begins with a question: what makes a good conversation? Inspired by Staub\u2019s own grief and the lack of space in which to unpack it, this project brings pairs of people together to talk about birth and death.\n\nShowing speaker and listener simultaneously on two screens, the installation inserts us at the heart of these deeply personal conversations, creating an absorbing oasis of reflection.\n\nArts company Fevered Sleep similarly invites audiences to make room for grief. This Grief Thing takes the form of an unassuming shop in the city centre, inserting death and loss into the familiar landscape of the high street. It\u2019s somewhere visitors can buy things \u2013 clothing, tote bags, cards printed with phrases about grief \u2013 but also somewhere they can start conversations. Small printed cards prompt us to consider those we\u2019ve lost, while one wall is plastered with the thoughts of visitors, from the pained to the profound. Primed by Staub\u2019s installation, personal grief rises to the surface as I move quietly around the space.\n\nWe like to think that we\u2019re beyond taboos, that nothing is off bounds any more. But, when it comes to the health of our bodies and minds and the universal, inescapable experience of death, we\u2019re still pretty tight-lipped. In attempting to break the silence and confront the unspoken \u2013 often with humour and imagination \u2013 Sick! festival has a vital role to play.", "description": "From dance to comedy to video, this series of events confronts illness, grief and death with uplifting candour", "authors": ["Catherine Love"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8440ec604e00a356455a8ff35f7d3f2970e6a27/0_243_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bbb1bf0af6a52fede616dae09bca5e2d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
