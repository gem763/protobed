I know that. I\u2019m not going to delude myself. If it happens, why should I be afraid [of] that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are moments when I have some regrets about having gone public with it because there\u2019s a little too much of Alex Trebek out there, and I regret that,\u201d he added.\n\nTrebek started his second round of chemotherapy roughly a week after he returned to host the show\u2019s 36th season.\n\nDoctors initially believed he could start on a course of immunotherapy after completing a successful first round of chemo, but they advised Trebek to stick with the second round of chemo after he suffered a setback in his treatment.\n\nHe told CTV he will continue to host the show despite his diagnosis, but will step away if he feels the need to focus on his health.\n\n\u201cI will keep doing it as long as my skills do not diminish, and they have started to diminish,\u201d Trebek said. \u201cI talk to the producers about this all the time. I say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m slurring my words. My tongue doesn\u2019t work as well as it used to.\u2019 The chemo has caused sores inside my mouth. It makes it difficult for me to speak and enunciate properly.\u201d\n\nTrebek said producers do not notice a difference in his performance, and hosting the show has not been difficult because Trebek has not suffered from any physical pain.", "description": "Jeopardy! game show host Alex Trebek said he is \"not afraid of dying\" as he continues to battle stage 4 pancreatic cancer.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1157040565-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
