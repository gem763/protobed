And that is, where is Barack Obama in all this? Why haven\u2019t we heard from him? I mean, in the beginning of your administration, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. And now, he\u2019s nowhere to be heard. Where is he?\n\nTRUMP: I think he\u2019s hiding.\n\nPIRRO: Why?\n\nTRUMP: I think he knows all about it. And we are talking about investigate the investigators. We\u2019re talking about the beginning. And it was really before I took office. It was \u2014 if you look at the insurance policy with Strzok and Page, just in case she should lose, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy. That\u2019s what all this stuff has been about, the insurance policy.\n\nThese are bad people. These are evil people. And this was the insurance policy. The two lovers, Strzok and Page. Two beauties.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPIRRO: Well, you know \u2026\n\nTRUMP: And it\u2019s a terrible thing, what they do to this country. Terrible. But we are winning. And we\u2019re winning big. And the American public knows it. And that\u2019s why I think they want to stay away. But they can do whatever they want. But they want to stay away.\n\nIf you look at what\u2019s happening, Jeanine, if you take a look, the electricity for the Republican Party, they are so angry at what has taken place. Because, as an example, everybody knows that Schiff \u2014 we call him \u201cshifty Schiff\u201d \u2014 he made up the story. He made up my phone call.\n\nPIRRO: Right.\n\nTRUMP: And based on that phone call, this is what this whole thing is about. It\u2019s all about a phone call. And the call is perfect. I have given that call to everybody to read it. In fact, Lindsey Graham made a statement.
