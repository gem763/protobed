Mr Yao now heads the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).\n\nBut Mr Morey's tweet prompted a furious backlash in China, with broadcasters vowing to stop airing Rockets games.\n\nThey went further on Tuesday by scrapping plans to broadcast two NBA pre-season games being played in China.\n\nThe NBA is just the latest international business to be embroiled in controversy in both China and the US over the Hong Kong protests. But the organisation's strong defence of freedom of expression is unusual.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Yao Ming - 7ft 6ins tall (2.29m) - played for the Houston Rockets between 2002 and 2011\n\nHow did the controversy start?\n\nOn Friday, Mr Morey posted a tweet with an image captioned: \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\"\n\nHe was referencing months of pro-democracy protests in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.\n\nChinese officials and media have reacted furiously to foreign expressions of support for the protesters and accused the West of interfering in Chinese affairs.\n\nIn response to Mr Morey's tweet, state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said they would stop broadcasting Rockets matches.\n\nOn Sunday the CBA suspended co-operation with the team, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning and the club's sponsor in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Daryl Morey is regarded as an innovative figure in the NBA\n\nOn Monday, Mr Morey deleted the tweet and said: \"I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.\"\n\n\"I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors,\" he added.\n\nBut American fans reacted angrily to his apology, with one tweet saying: \"You shouldn't have to apologise for supporting freedom.\"\n\nHow did the NBA respond?\n\nOn Tuesday Mr Silver issued a statement saying: \"The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\"\n\nHe later told reporters in Japan that the league would not compromise its values on freedom of speech and was motivated by more than money.\n\nThe NBA commissioner said he understood there would be consequences but that \"we will have to live with those consequences.\"\n\nHe said he would travel to Shanghai on Wednesday and meet the officials to try to \"find mutual respect\". But he recognised that \"this issue might not die down so quickly\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Houston Rockets played the Toronto Raptors in Japan on Tuesday\n\nHis defence of free speech in the face of Chinese anger is seen as a bold move, given the potential financial impact for the NBA.\n\n\"The vast majority of foreign companies apologize profusely at the first sign of discontent from Chinese consumers, which makes the NBA's response all the more remarkable,\" tweeted Mark Dreyer, an expert on China's sports industry.\n\nHow has this story played out in the US?\n\nInitially the Rockets and the NBA distanced themselves from Mr Morley's tweet. This provoked accusations from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the league was bowing to Beijing.\n\nFormer US presidential hopeful - and Rockets fan - Ted Cruz accused the NBA of \"shamefully retreating\" in pursuit of profit.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @tedcruz We\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019 Report\n\nMr Cruz said he was proud to see Mr Morey \"call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong\".\n\nFellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse called the NBA's response \"shameful\".\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro tweeted that the US must \"not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @JulianCastro China is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 7, 2019 Report\n\nWho else has angered China over Hong Kong?\n\nAlso on Tuesday, a Hong-Kong professional gamer was banned by game-maker Blizzard from competing for 12 months for staging an anti-government protest.\n\nNg Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,\" after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ng Wai Chung wore the gas mask to show solidarity with Hong Kong protesters, who wear them to avoid tear gas\n\nIn September, Zara became a target of anger on Chinese social media after some of its Hong Kong stores closed on a day of strike action.\n\nChina accused the retailer of encouraging its employees to join the strike but Zara said it was just ensuring its shops were not understaffed if transport was disrupted.\n\nIn August the chief executive of airline Cathay Pacific stood down after the company shifted its stance on whether employees could join protests.\n\nAnd in the same month Versace had to apologise to China after one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories.", "description": "It follows uproar in China over a tweet from a team manager supporting protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/09AB/production/_109157420_adamsilver.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
