Their twin mottos of \u201cGo 1-0 today\u201d and \u201cStay in the fight\u201d gave them the motivation to rebound from a 19-31 start. The \u201cBaby Shark\u201d craze gave them character.\n\nIn the end, the 2019 Nationals used the pressure of not making the playoffs for a second consecutive season to inspire their run. And it made this season unlike any of the previous ones when postseason expectations led to disappointment.\n\nThe oldest roster in the major leagues (average age 31.1) took pride in being able to battle and defeat teams that had enjoyed more regular-season and postseason success. It was no accident.\n\nMANAGER NEWS:Angels hire Joe Maddon as next manager\n\nBODY BLOW?:Mother Nature deals a body blow to the Yankees\u2019 World Series hopes\n\nThe veterans on the roster \u2013 first baseman Ryan Zimmerman (35), starting pitchers Max Scherzer and Anibal Sanchez (both 35), second baseman Howie Kendrick (36) and catcher Kurt Suzuki (36) \u2013 all played important roles down the stretch, something manager Dave Martinez acknowledged before even taking the first question from the media after his team just completed a four-game sweep in the NLCS.\n\n\u201cDon't ever call those guys old,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey're really young in my heart and my eyes. They're playing like they're 22, 23.\u201d\n\nThe veterans saw their age as an asset, not a liability.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like everybody wants younger and younger players. Everybody wants to forget about all the old guys,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cWe see it in free agency. We\u2019re not dumb.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re the oldest team and we went out and won the National League pennant just shows you that we bring a lot of value to clubhouses.\u201d\n\nEven though he only takes the field every fifth day, Scherzer may be the closest the team has to a leader. He famously pitched in June despite a broken nose he suffered trying to bunt in batting practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most impressive things I\u2019ve seen in a while,\u201d second baseman Brian Dozier said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s why you put him in the category of one of the best if not the best in the game.\u201d\n\nZimmerman, the Nationals\u2019 first-ever draft pick in 2005, has been part of all the franchise\u2019s highs and lows. Though he played in just 52 games during the regular season (hitting .257 with six home runs and 27 RBI), he\u2019s been a force in the postseason.\n\nPlaying in all but one of the Nats\u2019 10 playoff games, Zimmerman has hit .290 with a huge three-run homer in Game 4 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the classiest big leaguer I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said of Zimmerman. \u201cHe\u2019s been through some trials and tribulations \u2026 but you see when he\u2019s a healthy player, he\u2019s a pretty damn good one still.\u201d\n\nWhile the veterans have set the tone in the Nationals clubhouse, they\u2019ve also set the example for the team\u2019s younger players to follow.\n\n\u201cI think the mixture of people that we do have is what makes us so good,\u201d said Kendrick, the NLCS MVP. \u201cThe chemistry that we do have, we understand each other.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals have relied on that pitching staff, specifically their starting pitchers, to get to this point. In the NLCS, Sanchez, Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg didn\u2019t give up a single earned run in 21 2/3 innings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not just the starting pitchers, it\u2019s everybody. Everybody has a hand in this,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cYou can give starting pitchers credit, but it\u2019s also been the offense, defense, baserunning. We\u2019re clicking and firing on all cylinders and that\u2019s what makes it so much fun.\u201d\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t fun was missing the playoffs last season. And bowing out early in previous years. After winning four division titles in six years from 2012 to 2017, the Nationals needed to earn a wild-card berth just to make the playoffs this year.\n\nBut being the underdog for a change served as a rallying cry. In both the wild-card game and the Division Series, the Nats had to come from behind to win.\n\nAs the players and coaches were popping champagne bottles and guzzling beer out of the National League championship trophy, no one noticed the absence of a player who occupied one of the large lockers on the left-hand side of the clubhouse for the previous seven seasons.\n\nBryce Harper never got to experience this kind of celebration during his tenure in Washington. Though it\u2019s unfair to say his leaving as a free agent over the winter and signing with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies was a factor in the Nationals getting over the hump, it\u2019s also fair to wonder what kind of an impact it did have.\n\nAnthony Rendon stepped forward and became an MVP candidate at age 29. Left fielder Juan Soto blossomed into a full-fledged star in his first full season in the majors. Adam Eaton and Victor Robles each played over 150 games at the other two outfield spots.\n\nAnd a large chunk of the money the Nationals didn\u2019t spend re-signing Harper instead went toward a six-year, $140 million contract for free-agent left-hander Patrick Corbin, who was the winning pitcher in Monday\u2019s NLCS clincher over the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u201cThe roster that Rizzo and the front office put together, it\u2019s just next man up,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said \u2013 just before dismissing any mention of Harper in a follow-up question about this season\u2019s clubhouse chemistry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been good every year, man. \u2026 Every year we\u2019ve had a great team,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard as heck to get here where we\u2019re at. Every roster is different and I\u2019m just proud of these guys.\u201d\n\nAs they await the identity of their next opponent when the World Series begins next Tuesday, the Nationals are ready to continue their one pursuit of a title.\n\n\u201cWe've had a long season,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWhat I believe in is it takes more than one person to win the championship, and that's been the message since spring training. Everybody's got to participate.\u201d\n\nAs the music blared, the shouting echoed and the dancing continued, it was clear Martinez\u2019s message had been received. Loud and clear.\n\nThe Nationals had found their identity: National League champions.", "description": "Averaging 31.1 years old, the Nationals are the oldest team in MLB.
