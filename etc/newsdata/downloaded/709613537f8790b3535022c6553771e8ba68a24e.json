Peters -- whom the Rams acquired from the Kansas City Chiefs for draft picks in February 2018 -- was dealt in exchange for linebacker Kenny Young and an undisclosed 2020 draft choice that ESPN's Adam Schefter reported would be a fifth-rounder.\n\nThe Peters move cleared $5 million in cap space, helping the Rams acquire Ramsey, who has not been shy about his desire for a robust contract extension. Currently in the fourth year of his rookie deal, Ramsey has a base salary of $2.35 million this season and is due $13.7 million next year on his fifth-year option, the final year of his deal.\n\nESPN reported that the Rams and Ramsey had not yet discussed any parameters surrounding a long-term contract.\n\nIt's unclear if Ramsey will play Sunday at Atlanta, where the Rams will try to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nThe trade leaves the Rams without a first-round pick until 2022. Unless they trade into the first round, they will go five consecutive years without a first-round pick, starting with the 2017 draft, the year head coach Sean McVay arrived.\n\nThat year's first-rounder went to Tennessee in a trade-up for Jared Goff in 2016. L.A.'s 2018 first-rounder helped the Rams acquire Brandin Cooks from the New England Patriots, and the Rams traded out of the first round with Atlanta this past April, with the Falcons selecting offensive tackle Kaleb McGary at No. 31 overall.\n\nRamsey had one pass breakup and one forced fumble in three games this season. He had nine interceptions (one returned for a touchdown) and 44 pass breakups while starting all 48 games his first three seasons.\n\nHe was clear about his desire to be traded during a late-September appearance on Uninterrupted's \"17 Weeks\" podcast on Sirius XM.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I've played my final game for the Jags yet or not, but my trade request still stands. For me, respect is a huge thing,\" Ramsey said, adding, \"Once respect is lost for both parties, I think it is time to part ways.\"\n\nRamsey wasn't the only acquisition by the Rams on Tuesday, as they also picked up offensive lineman Austin Corbett from the Cleveland Browns in exchange for a 2021 fifth-round pick.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Hours after trading away cornerback Marcus Peters, the Los Angeles Rams dealt  two first-round picks and a fourth-rounder to the Jacksonville Jaguars in ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
