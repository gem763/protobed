The leopard made calm and calculated moves, being as sneaky as possible, not letting the prey know of its existence; and it succeeded. It pounced on the dog that awoke instantly and ran for dear life. The leopard was taken aback by the resistance but was unwilling to let go of his game and ran after the dog.\n\nObviously this gave a good scare to people on the Internet. One of them wrote, \u2018I hope the dog is fine! Couldn't they just let the dog inside\u2019.\n\nDon't Miss 7.2 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 386 SHARES\n\nThe video was indeed quite horrifying to watch, here is hoping that the dog ran with all its might to safety.\n\nInput by India Today", "description": "Members of cat family are mostly carnivores, lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards.
