For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nKaepernick hasn\u2019t appeared in an NFL game since the 2016 season, when he began to kneel during the national anthem to raise awareness for social issues.\n\nThe quarterback filed a grievance against the league in October 2017 that accused team owners of colluding to keep him out of the NFL. The sides reached a settlement in February.\n\nInstead of Rihanna, the NFL had Maroon 5 and rapper Travis Scott perform at halftime. During this year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime performance, the league is teaming up with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation, which is helping produce the show starring Jennifer Lopez and Shakira.", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Rihanna opened up on her decision to turn down the NFL\u2019s invitation to perform during Super Bowl LIII last year, saying she", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
