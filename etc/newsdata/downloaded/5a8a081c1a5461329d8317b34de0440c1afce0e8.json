The American women will replace the broken component rather than install new batteries, which was their original job.\n\nLast week, astronauts conducted two spacewalks to replace old batteries that make up the station's solar power network. They have three more spacewalks to complete before finishing the battery work. The next one was supposed to be Wednesday, but that was cancelled.\n\nEach of the new lithium-ion batteries needs a device to regulate the amount of charge going in and out. One of these charge regulators did not kick in Friday night, preventing one of the three newly installed batteries from working.\n\nReplacing one of these regulators is a generic job for which all potential spacewalkers train, officials said.\n\n'The A-team'\n\nThe orbiting lab and its six occupants remain safe, according to NASA, and science operations are unaffected.\n\nNASA originally planned an all-female spacewalk last spring, but had to cancel it because of a shortage of readily available medium-size suits. Koch helped assemble an extra medium suit over the summer.\n\n\"Very good that we have 4 expert spacewalkers on board to shoulder this tough task. They are the A-team!\" tweeted astronaut Anne McClain, who would have gone spacewalking with Koch in March if not for the suit-sizing issue.\n\nSince the first spacewalk in 1965, there have been 227 spacewalkers, only 14 of them women. Meir will be making her first spacewalk and is to become number 15. All but one of these women has been American.", "description": "The initial plan for the mission was cancelled last spring because of a shortage of readily available medium-size suits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/ee791a8d08e24c99ada2aaa10ec5ade7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
