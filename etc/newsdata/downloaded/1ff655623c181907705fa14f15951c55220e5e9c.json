This is a man who has become as well known for his inflated ego as his songs. His music, which fellow rap artists have hailed as \u201cgenius\u201d, has often veered away from gangster posturing in favour of more thoughtful observations on family, sexuality, religion, education, prejudice and wealth.\n\nThis month, Kanye announced he has become a born-again Christian and this is the inspiration for his new gospel-influenced album and accompanying IMAX film, Jesus Is King.\n\nThe projects arrived after months of West travelling the country with his Sunday Service tour, where he announced: \u201cI\u2019m not here for your entertainment. We are here to spread the gospel.\u201d According to some reports, Kanye will no longer record secular music.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe invite-only events were described by his wife, Kim Kardashian West, as a \u201cmusical ministry\u201d and featured faith-based re-workings of West\u2019s repertoire. \u201cThere\u2019s no praying, there\u2019s no sermon. There\u2019s no word,\u201d Kim proudly told Jimmy Kimmel. \u201cIt\u2019s just music and it\u2019s just a feeling.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

On his Yeezus tour he was presented as an apostle, with Jesus rising from the top a glowing pyramid. For The Life of Pablo album tour, he flew from the stage and floated miraculously over the crowds in the arena.\n\nPerhaps this is all some sort of publicity stunt, journalists and fans alike wrote. Sceptics also pointed out that Kanye has a history of mental instability \u2013 in the past he has opened up about his struggle with bipolar disorder.\n\nWhen I heard about the album, I too was sceptical. Then I watched Kanye\u2019s Airpool Karaoke with James Corden. I expected it to be fluffy and contradictory, but it was anything but. His Christian message was genuinely inspiring.\n\nIt goes beyond just Kanye of course. Justin Bieber is another high profile star who had been very open about his Christian faith, even telling the press that he was abstaining from sex with his partner Hailey Baldwin until their wedding day.\n\nWhether you agree, disagree or simply feel indifferent about his views, there\u2019s something powerful and wonderful about someone stepping out and taking a stand rooted in their faith.\n\nModern Christianity is creeping back into society influencing society, and I think this should be something that is celebrated.", "description": "Everyone has an opinion on Kanye West.
