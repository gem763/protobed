The left-wing Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, has always wanted to keep closer economic ties to the E.U. and is now backing a second Brexit vote. But the Liberal Democrats, a smaller centrist force, are wary of ousting Mr. Johnson because they don\u2019t want Mr. Corbyn as prime minister.\n\nStill, the situation is fluid and the math is tight, so the votes this week could go either way.\n\nConflicting signals: Late on Saturday night, after Parliament\u2019s vote, Mr. Johnson sent two letters to the E.U. \u2014 one formally asking for an extension, which he left unsigned, and a signed letter saying that another delay would \u201cdamage the interests of the U.K. and our E.U. partners.\u201d It is now up to the E.U. to decide how to respond.\n\nThe view from Brussels: E.U. officials who once expressed hope that Britain would somehow end up remaining in the bloc now just want the country to leave already so that they can move on to other pressing issues.\n\nOrder! Order! The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, who decided to allow the vote on Saturday that derailed Mr. Johnson\u2019s plans, will soon be stepping down. The hunt is on for his replacement.", "description": "Brexit Deja Vu.", "authors": ["Alisha Haridasani Gupta"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/briefing/21Briefing-Asia-promo/21Briefing-Asia-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
