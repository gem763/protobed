J\u00fcrgen Klopp uses tactics grounded in Rangnick\u2019s fast transitions and his Liverpool team have four players who owe their big break in Europe to Rangnick: Jo\u00ebl Matip (at Schalke), Roberto Firmino (Hoffenheim), Naby Ke\u00efta and Sadio Man\u00e9 (RB Salzburg).\n\nRangnick is a byword for tactical influence and talent development in Germany, even taking some credit for the national team\u2019s 2014 World Cup success. This season\u2019s Bundesliga has been nicknamed the \u201cRangnickliga\u201d, as five teams in the top six positions have head coaches who learned their craft under him.\n\nThe personable German, 61, has embraced a new role as head of sport and development at Red Bull, looking after teams in New York and S\u00e3o Paulo, where the newly purchased Bragantino are on the verge of promotion to the Brazilian top-flight.\n\nThomas Tuchel: \u2018I told Neymar to face the truth and deal with consequences\u2019 | Darren Tulett Read more\n\nIt is a change from last year, when he combined the jobs of sporting director and head coach at RB Leipzig, keeping the coach\u2019s seat warm for Julian Nagelsmann, who arrived from Hoffenheim in the summer. Leipzig finished third and reached the German Cup final. \u201cThis only worked because all the players we had in the squad were those I had already signed as sporting director, so we had an existing relationship,\u201d Rangnick tells the Guardian. \u201cIt would have been impossible to do both in the long term.\u201d\n\nThe pillars of his sporting director role encompass everything on the football side: the first team, academy, medical set-up and recruitment. \u201cWe see it like a jigsaw with 500 pieces, and our role is to ensure that we have each piece available to help every player improve. We help every individual in the whole club develop and flourish.\u201d\n\nRangnick is a pioneer: at Hoffenheim in 2006, he was one of the first coaches to use video analysis. His methodology is a forerunner of gegenpressing: that the best chance of winning back the ball is within eight seconds of losing it, and most goals are scored within 10 seconds of regaining possession. RB Leipzig scored 60% of their goals like that last season. His teams play with a high tempo and always look to play vertical passes \u2013 just like those Bundesliga teams coached by Rangnick disciples.\n\nRangnick looks back with pride at his work with Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, whom he left in 2015. Leipzig were in the fourth division when he joined and are now realistic Bundesliga title contenders. Salzburg are breaking scoring records in Austria (46 goals in 10 games) and had a stunning start to their Champions League campaign, beating Genk 6-2 and losing 4-3 at Liverpool.\n\n\u201cWe can see where they are now and say we took the correct decisions at the time; that gives us a good feeling.\u201d Both clubs have spent money but Rangnick makes the point that they are not the only ones. Salzburg have made a profit of more than \u20ac200m in player sales in the past five years.\n\nRangnick fell in love with English football as a 21-year-old student on a year abroad at Sussex University, as part of his English and PE degree from Stuttgart University. He remembers going to the Goldstone Ground and watching Brighton lose 4-1 to Liverpool. \u201cI remember the Brighton fans singing: \u2018Seagulls! Seagulls!\u2019 despite the scoreline. And the Liverpool fans responded: \u2018Seaweed! Seaweed!\u2019 Scouse humour, huh?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest J\u00fcrgen Klopp (left) and Ralf Rangnick before the Bundesliga game between Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim in October 2010. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe famously played for the local non-league side Southwick FC, 11 games that moulded him as a coach: \u201cThe most important thing for me was the amount of coaching we did on the pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always spurred each other on, coaching among ourselves or motivating each other. That was inspirational for me.\u201d\n\nNow Rangnick is the inspiration, a poster boy for a sporting director model that is increasingly popular in the Premier League \u2013 with one obvious exception. Manchester United let it be known they wanted a director of football more than a year ago but no appointment has followed.\n\nSo would Rangnick, a sporting director with a proven track record, be interested in an approach from Old Trafford? \u201cI am happy where I am but if any club wanted to speak to me, the question would have to be: \u2018Can I be somebody who can influence areas of development across the whole club?\u2019 Otherwise you are only getting half of what I am capable of. If, after that, you can work together in a trustworthy and respectful way, then you are more likely to be successful.\u201d\n\nRangnick understands the reluctance of some clubs to change a traditional set-up. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to follow someone like Sir Alex Ferguson, who was so successful and in place for a long time \u2013 and that\u2019s even harder if you are often changing coaches,\u201d he says. \u201cWith every coaching change, the identity changes and this is reflected in the sporting development. You can look at the money that team has had available in the last five years and say there has been an underperformance.\u201d\n\nIt is no coincidence, he adds, that the two teams currently dominating the Premier League have a clear playing style. \u201cThey have their identity and know what they need to develop, and so it\u2019s no coincidence that they are dominating the league.\u201d", "description": "The German sporting director talks about his philosophy \u2013 \u2018like a jigsaw with 500 pieces\u2019 \u2013 his time at Sussex University and what has gone wrong at Manchester United", "authors": ["Ben Lyttleton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0538b5e0f902e3e53e896c68b7af2723b7498a86/376_168_2029_1218/master/2029.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f20c6df3e0d19311c7730b538f2cf79", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
