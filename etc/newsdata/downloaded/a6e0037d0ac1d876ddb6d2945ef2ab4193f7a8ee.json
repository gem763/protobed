And a recent study by Merrill Lynch found that nearly eight in 10 parents (79%) say they give some financial support to their adult children.\n\n\n\nThat means that more young adults are depending on their parents: \u201dThe share of young adults who could be considered \u2018financially independent\u2019 from their parents by their early 20s \u2014 an assessment based on their annual income \u2014 has gone down,\u201d Pew revealed. \u201cIn 2018, 24% of young adults were financially independent by age 22 or younger, compared with 32% in 1980.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo doubt, there are many reasons to help adults kids. Pew found that household expenses like groceries and bills were the most common things parents paid for, followed by education expenses and medical expenses.\n\nBut whatever the reasons, one thing is clear: Parents are putting their financial future in jeopardy to support their adult children, according to the Merrill Lynch study. Indeed, nearly three in four parents (72%) say that they have put their children\u2019s interests ahead of their own need to save for retirement; and about two in three (63%) say they have sacrificed their financial security for the sake of their children.\n\nAnd when an adult child is unemployed, parents really love to step in \u2014 and it hurts their financial futures, according to a study from think tank Rand Corp.ation. \u201cWhen it comes to financial assistance, parents are more likely to give cash to a child once they lose their job,\u201d the study found. Others decrease savings for retirement.\n\n\u201cOne may assume that since parents willingly help their children, they are not worse off because of that decision,\u201d said Kathryn Edwards, an associate economist and lead author of the RAND study, in a statement. \u201cBut our research shows that these decisions may not result in the best financial outcome for the parent.\u201d\n\nWhen you help your adult children \u2014 unemployed or not \u2014 it saps your retirement coffers. Data released by personal finance site Bankrate found that half of parents with adult kids say that supporting them was detrimental to their retirement savings, and fully 17% of them say it had a significant impact on their retirement savings.\n\nNo wonder: Every year, parents spend twice as much on their adult children as they do on contributing to their own retirement accounts: That\u2019s $250 billion they put into their retirement accounts versus $500 billion in support to adult children, Merrill Lynch estimates.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly a mistake, and it is all too common,\u201d says Kimberly Foss, the president and founder of Empyrion Wealth Management and author of \u201cWealthy by Design.\u201d \u201cI tell my clients who are approaching or in retirement that their first responsibility is to themselves.\u201d\n\nThe issue \u2014 which James C. Kelly, a wealth strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia says he\u2019s seeing \u201cmore and more\u201d \u2014 is a major problem for two reasons: \u201cNot only are parents failing to teach their children financial independence and debt management, but by pilfering their own retirement coffers, they are making themselves a liability that their children will someday need to take on,\u201d says Kelly.\n\nIt comes at a time when most parents already have far too little saved for retirement. The median retirement savings in America is just $70,000, according to the TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies. And while those most likely to have adult children are faring slightly better \u2014 Gen Xers have $71,000 and boomers $157,000 \u2014 that\u2019s still far from enough to retire for most people. In many cases, even $1 million won\u2019t be enough to retire comfortably.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, helping your adult kids financially can send them the wrong message. \u201cWhat advisers and counselors will call \u2018enabling\u2019 is what the enablers will simply refer to as \u2018helping,\u2019\u201d says certified financial planner Mitchell C. Hockenbury of 1440 Financial Partners. While parents \u201cfeel this will relieve the [financial] tension the child is suffering through\u201d instead it \u201cmay have lasting consequences of not teaching the children how to properly manage their finances,\u201d he adds.\n\nOf course, it can be hard to totally cut off your adult kids. So here\u2019s what experts advise:\n\nGive them nonfinancial support instead. You can give to your kids in ways that aren\u2019t financial. Some examples: Instead of paying their rent, have them come live at home with you until they land a job. Instead of repaying their student loans, help them refinance to more manageable payments.\n\nHelp them make a budget. \u201cSometimes a better gift than money is the chance to have one-on-one help with setting up a spending plan, or debt reduction plan,\u201d says Hockenbury. You could do this yourself if you feel qualified, or you can hire a financial planner for a few hours.\n\nGive in the right instances. It\u2019s OK to help kids when they\u2019re \u201cclearly victimized by circumstances beyond their control\u201d like health emergencies or natural disasters, says Foss. And, she adds that she\u2019s \u201cnot necessarily opposed to small helps we can provide to our children as they enter and adjust to adulthood\u2014for example, keeping them on your cellphone plan for a limited period of time, or helping to pay off a vehicle. Even assistance with making the down payment on a first home can be OK, as long as it doesn\u2019t come with expectations of ongoing help with the mortgage or future home purchases.\u201d But remember that any assistance should be \u201cboth specific and clearly limited in scope and duration\u201d and \u201cabove all, they should not become an ongoing part of the adult child\u2019s lifestyle expectations,\u201d Foss adds.\n\nLook at how responsible your child is with money. \u201cIs this a one-off source of assistance that will get the adult child over a hump? For instance, providing the down payment on a house that the kid can afford the mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance [on],\u201d says Hockenbury. That may be an OK thing to do for your kids as long as you\u2019re financially secure. But if you\u2019re consistently giving money to a child who has trouble with money anyway \u2014 \u201cfor instance, taking over a credit card debt freeing the adult child to charge more to that card or another\u2026that would be the bad method,\u201d he adds. In that case, you\u2019re not teaching your child appropriate money-management lessons.\n\nRemember that by putting yourself first, you are actually doing them a favor. \u201cThe very best gifts you can give to your children are, first, self-reliance, and second, the security of knowing that they will not have to provide for you in your advanced age. The best way to do both of these things is to create clear separation between what is their responsibility and what is yours, and to clearly communicate expectations about these boundaries,\u201d says Foss.\n\nThis story was updated on July 9, 2019 and again on October 23, 2019.", "description": "And that can hurt parents financially \u2014 big time.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI052_adultk_ZG_20190422145907.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-24"}
