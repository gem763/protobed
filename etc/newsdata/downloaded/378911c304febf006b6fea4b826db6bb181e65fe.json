Comcast, \u201cfor their anti-competitive censorship\u201d in refusing to carry the conservative channel. In an email to Comcast\u2019s president of content acquisition, Gregory Rigdon, Herring had sought carriage on Comcast\u2019s cable platforms and stated his concern that the cable giant \u201copposes including another conservative counter channel to counter MSNBC,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nA week later, Maddow opened her show by telling her audience that OANN \u201creally, literally is paid Russian propaganda,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cTheir on-air U.S. politics reporter is paid by the Russian government to produce propaganda for that government,\u201d Maddow said in the July 22 segment.\n\nSkip Miller, a partner at Miller Barondess who represents OANN, said in a statement: \u201cOne America is wholly owned, operated and financed by the Herring family in San Diego. They are as American as apple pie. They are not paid by Russia and have nothing to do with the Russian government. This is a false and malicious libel, and they\u2019re going to answer for it in a court of law.\u201d\n\nMaddow made the claim after the Daily Beast ran a story by Kevin Poulsen reporting that one of One America\u2019s on-air reporters, Kristian Brunovich Rouz, also was on the payroll for Sputnik, the Kremlin news outlet. One America then demanded a retraction.\n\nBut One America said in the lawsuit that \u201cRouz has never been a staff employee of Sputnik News. He worked as a freelancer for Sputnik News and his work there had no relation to his work for OAN. Rouz submitted articles to Sputnik on his own and would receive approximately $40 if the articles were accepted.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seeks more than $10 million in damages.\n\nA spokeswoman for MSNBC did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
