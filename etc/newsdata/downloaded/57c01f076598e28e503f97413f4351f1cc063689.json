Chiu alleged that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her in 1998 when they were working together in a hotel room in Venice, Italy. She said she was silenced by a strict non-disclosure agreement that she\u2019d been pressured to sign in order to work with Weinstein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very typical of working with Harvey that generally personal questions and requests, massage and so on, are blended in with conversations about scripts and appropriate workplace questions. So this wasn\u2019t something that happened that took place over this one night,\u201d Chiu said, sitting alongside actor and fellow Weinstein accuser Ashley Judd.\n\n\u201cBut it took place over a number of evenings while I was in the hotel working with him,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd these kind of requests escalate. Harvey is very persistent. He has a tendency to cajole, and frankly, on this particular evening, he\u2019s a very big guy, he pushed me back against the bed, and I was petrified and terrified as he tried to rape me.\u201d (Watch a clip of the interview below or the full interview at the top of this article.)\n\n\"Harvey [Weinstein] is very persistent. He has a tendency to cajole... he's a very big guy, he pushed me back against the bed and I was petrified and terrified as he tried to rape me,\" Rowena Chiu is a new Harvey Weinstein accuser who is speaking out for the first time. pic.twitter.com/YGn0wG5tR4 \u2014 3rd Hour of TODAY (@3rdHourTODAY) September 9, 2019\n\nChiu\u2019s story first appeared in journalists Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cShe Said,\u201d which tracks the reporting that led up to the Me Too reckoning in the fall of 2017. \u201cShe Said\u201d hits stores this week.\n\nIn the book, Chiu describes struggling with depression and a suicide attempt in the 20 years since the assault. She told \u201cToday\u201d that she decided to break the non-disclosure agreement now because she simply hadn\u2019t been ready to speak up about her experience earlier.\n\n\u201cThe NDA asked us to keep a secret about something that happened to me while I was working for 20 years, and that in itself was a very difficult thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201d...When this story broke in the press about two years ago, I wasn\u2019t ready. ... I felt intimidated. I felt terrified. I didn\u2019t know what the repercussions would be both legally and personally, and so it really has taken all of two years to square some of those things away both in terms of my own personal life, in terms of coming forward and speaking to my parents, speaking to my husband, speaking to my closest friends.\u201d\n\nAround 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to sexual assault and rape. He has previously denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. His spokesperson did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on this latest accusation.", "description": "Rowena Chiu, a former Miramax assistant, says the disgraced Hollywood mogul sexually assaulted her in 1998 in Venice, Italy.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7675ad2300009f0351293f.png?cache=jgqes88egh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
