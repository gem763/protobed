But police did not report any arrests or injuries.\n\nResidents are demanding an end to the deal, which seeks to build a factory for electric vehicle batteries and a lithium hydroxide plant. They also want better royalties for the region that is home to one of the world's largest lithium reserves.\n\nLithium is a key component for cellphone batteries and battery parts for electric cars.\n\nProtest leaders say their demands are being ignored by the government. Authorities say the protest is being stoked by members of the opposition ahead of Bolivia's Oct. 20 presidential election, where President Evo Morales is seeking his fourth term in what is expected to be a tight race.", "description": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) - Demonstrators said Monday they will intensify their protest demanding Bolivia's government end a project with Germany's privately...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
