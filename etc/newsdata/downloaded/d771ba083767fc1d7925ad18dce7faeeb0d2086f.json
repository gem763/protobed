(John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nFriday, Sept. 13\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019 at Congressional Cemetery: The sign on the wrought-iron gate of Congressional Cemetery reads: \u201cBeware, all souls who enter here,\u201d but in keeping with the tongue-in-cheeky attitude that this Capitol Hill space is known for, the warning doesn\u2019t refer to anything especially ghastly. It\u2019s simply a reminder that neighborhood dogs (with permits) are allowed to roam free inside the fence, and that the 1807 site, while historical, is still an active burial ground. The emphasis is on \u201cactive\u201d: The last of the seasonal \u201cCinematery\u201d series is a screening of the instant-classic horror film from the mind of Jordan Peele. Gates open at 6 p.m.; movie begins at sunset, around 7:30. $10 suggested donation.\n\nPitch a Friend at Franklin Hall: If you\u2019re looking to mingle and have a high tolerance for public embarrassment, skip the dating apps and head to the Florida Avenue beer hall on Friday night. In some twisted social equation, organizers of Pitch a Friend have merged dating games and apps with \u201cShark Tank.\u201d Presenters will take the stage to deliver a three-minute presentation on why attendees should date their friends. Even if you\u2019re not looking for a mate, it might be a good chance to grab a drink and take people-watching to another level. 8 p.m. Free.\n\n[When your friends are so desperate to get you a date that they resort to PowerPoint]\n\nD.C. Beer Week events: Because nothing goes together like smooth music and hoppy craft beer, DC Brau has commandeered a two-level party barge at the Wharf and is setting sail for two hours of sipping brews and grooving to Michael McDonald, Steely Dan and Christopher Cross. Tickets ($75) for the two-hour Brau Poppin\u2019 and Yacht Rockin\u2019 Cruise on the Potomac include \u201cheavy hors d\u2019oeuvres\u201d and one beer, with additional beers for purchase on board.\n\nNSO in Your Neighborhood at various locations: The National Symphony Orchestra\u2019s effort to make inroads across the District is one of the best free concert programs in the city. For fall, they\u2019re playing all across the eastern neighborhoods. Performances extend through Sunday, with highlighted venues including the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy in Southeast on Friday and two outdoor concerts on Sunday at the National Arboretum and Chuck Brown Memorial Park. Times vary through Sunday. Free.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 14\n\nArt All Night at various locations: With the District\u2019s annual Art All Night event taking place in eight neighborhoods, including Tenleytown, Dupont Circle, Congress Heights and Minnesota Avenue, and featuring hundreds of artists, it\u2019s hard \u2014 make that impossible \u2014 to experience everything. The multisite extravaganza includes visual and performing art at indoor and outdoor venues, on public and private sites. So don\u2019t even try to see it all. Pick a neighborhood that\u2019s convenient and explore it, fully. You\u2019ve got eight hours. (Or maybe pick two: Shaw, for example, and Dupont Circle aren\u2019t terribly far apart by bike). 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Free.\n\n[The best things to see, drink and do in the D.C. area in September]\n\nWalkingTown DC at various locations: Whether you were born at the Columbia Hospital for Women or moved to Washington over the summer, the annual WalkingTown DC can unlock secrets and hidden histories of the city. More than 50 walking tours over nine days uncover the stories behind Washington\u2019s most magnificent cemetery, the experiences of Jewish and German immigrants, and sites important to the struggles for African American and LGBTQ civil rights. Go inside the U.S. Botanic Garden\u2019s collection, or learn about gentrification while exploring H Street NE. Whether you take a short, midweek lunchtime stroll around downtown or an extended weekend bike tour, you won\u2019t look at the city the same way again. Through Sept. 22. Tours are free, but space is limited.\n\nD.C. Beer Week events: The last big day of D.C. Beer Week is one of the busiest. The headline event is Brewers on the Block, an annual party that brings three dozen regional breweries and cider makers to Union Market, including V\u00e4sen, RAR, Dogfish Head and Peabody Heights. The party, which includes unlimited sampling and live music, runs from 2 to 6 p.m., and costs $55. Over in Alexandria, Aslin Brewing marks four years with a blowout 4th anniversary party at its new facility. Beers from 120 brewers flow from 1 to 5 p.m., and there will be games, bands and food trucks. Tickets are $65. We think of Anxo for its dry Spanish-style ciders, but the bar stocks some serious beers, too. Its Cider, Lambic and Lager festival features 22 ciders on tap, with a selection of Lambics including Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen, and all-star lagers made by Allagash, Mahr\u2019s and Oxbow, among others. Additionally, the party, which runs from noon to midnight, will have a txotx \u2014 free-flowing Basque barrels of cider and beer \u2014 and crab paella.\n\n[It just got a whole lot easier to find one of the area\u2019s best and buzziest craft beers]\n\nStreetmarket at Blagden Alley: If you\u2019ve found yourself in a stylish storefront and restaurant somewhere in the District, there\u2019s a good chance that it was designed by the folks at Streetsense. The local design and hospitality firm is bringing a day-long pop-up market chock full of its own clients and trendy vendors to Blagden Alley. See a live mural created before your eyes, sample good eats from the likes of Little Sesame and Tiger Fork, and browse sundries for sale from shops including GoodWood and She Loves Me. 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.\n\nCelebrate Petworth: One of Washington\u2019s best neighborhoods is throwing its annual block party on its best-known street on Saturday. The day-long festival is anchored by hourly live music performances, along with a dog show that will feature such contests as \u201cmost glamorous\u201d and \u201cbest bark.\u201d Various food vendors will set up shop along the 800 block of Upshur Street NW, and standing bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants, including Timber Pizza Company, will have special deals and hours for the occasion. 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.\n\nRock and Rye at South Point \u2014 Port Covington: Before Prohibition, Maryland was known for its rye whiskey \u2014 a style spirits historians say was sweeter and more balanced than ryes from Kentucky or Pennsylvania. While Maryland rye almost went extinct, a new generation of distillers has sprung up across the Free State in recent years. The most prominent is Sagamore Spirit, owned by Under Armour founder Kevin Plank, which opened a vast distillery in South Baltimore in 2017. This weekend, 18 distilleries from across Maryland head to a waterfront park in Port Covington \u2014 not far from Sagamore \u2014 to celebrate the state\u2019s famous spirit, including Lyon (St. Michael\u2019s), Tenth Ward (Frederick) and the Baltimore Spirits Company (self-explanatory). Beyond rye whiskey, participants will pour samples of gin, vodka and shochu as tasters or in sample-size cocktails, while DJs and global funk group Imam Collective provide the soundtrack. 6 to 9 p.m. $65.\n\nQuando Rondo at Milkboy Arthouse: He might not be a numerologist, but Quando Rondo can rap about Rollin 60\u2032s Crips, Glock 21s and Psalm 23 in the same song. And while the first two paint a picture of violence, the last one (\u201cThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want \u2026 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\u201d) is perhaps most instructive. In his brief career, the 20-year-old Savannah, Ga., native has rapped plenty of melancholy melodies about street life with a heart hardened by time in the projects and penitentiaries. 9 p.m. $20-$25.\n\n[4 concerts to catch in the D.C. area over the next several days]\n\nSunday, Sept. 15\n\nFamily day at the Reach: The Kennedy Center\u2019s 16-day festival celebrating its new expansion enters its last week on Sunday, with a day of programming designed for the whole family. There\u2019s a whole host of activities, including family yoga, all-age DJ parties and a performance from singers Dan and Claudia Zanes. The toughest choice comes at night when two excellent films are shown: the monumental documentary \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d (one for older kiddos and adults) and then a singalong with \u201cThe Muppet Movie\u201d (for anyone who likes joy in their life). 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Free with timed pass.\n\n[The Reach: How to make the most of the 16-day festival celebrating the Kennedy Center\u2019s expansion]\n\nEl Grito and birthday party at Dio Wine Bar: Dio is one of the most interesting wine bars in the city, focusing on natural wines from woman-owned vineyards or vineyards with female winemakers. Its second anniversary falls on the same day as the Grito de Dolores, the 1810 speech that launched the Mexican War of Independence, and the bar will be opening special bottles from Mexican and Mexican American winemakers all day. Manos de Maiz, a Mexican street food vendor that is a fixture at local farmers markets, is preparing a menu of tacos and maizopes using heirloom corn. 3 to 10 p.m. Free admission; food and drink priced individually.\n\nYachty by Nature at Cotton and Reed: This is the next-to-last weekend of summer, so when you\u2019ve got a chance to groove to smooth tunes and sip rum cocktails, you take it. This party at the Cotton and Reed rum distillery \u2014 sponsored by Q Mixers \u2014 features a menu of highballs and boat drinks, Timber Pizza and, most crucially, a live performance by New York-based Bad Business, who perform covers of Steely Dan, Toto, Looking Glass and Robbie Dupree, among other Yacht Rock legends. There\u2019s no cover charge, but organizers say registering on Eventbrite will let you \u201cavoid the line.\u201d 1 to 4 p.m. Free admission; drinks and food priced individually.\n\nD.C. Beer Week events: D.C. Beer Week winds up with an event where beer isn\u2019t the only focus. The D.C. Beer Week Record Fair at Right Proper\u2019s Brookland brewery pairs vinyl from some of the area\u2019s best shops, including Joe\u2019s Record Paradise, Joint Custody and Songbyrd, with food vendors, vintage clothing, a tie-dying station and, of course, fresh and funky Right Proper beers. 1 to 5 p.m. Free admission; drinks and food priced individually.\n\n\u2014 Hau Chu, Fritz Hahn, Chris Kelly and Michael O\u2019Sullivan", "description": "This weekend brings the final events of D.C.
