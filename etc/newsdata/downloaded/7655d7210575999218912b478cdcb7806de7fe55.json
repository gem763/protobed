Follow her on Twitter @DanielleRyanJ\n\nBoris Johnson has a \u201cvery good\u201d plan for the Irish border, but prefers to keep the details veiled in \u201cdecent obscurity\u201d for now. With days left to strike a deal, the PM might want to consider decently enlightening everyone.\n\nThe leaked UK proposals to Brussels for a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d along both sides of the Irish border and customs checkpoints scattered at various locations five or 10 miles to the north and south are nothing short of insane \u2014 and have managed to unite the entire Irish political spectrum in outrage.\n\nHere's a map showing what a 10 mile buffer zone along *both* sides of the border would look like.\n\n\n\nThere are over 625,000 people living in the zone. pic.twitter.com/tCsmNwIsEw \u2014 Richard Cantwell (@ManAboutCouch) October 1, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good for a Downing Street spokesperson to brush off the leak and reiterate an \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d to avoid anything that involves \u201cchecks or controls at the border\u201d proper, but that is a mere technicality.\n\nIn practice, customs checkpoints, whether they be two, five, or 10 miles from the crossing points \u2014 represent a hardening of the border which is illegal under the Good Friday Agreement \u2014 a binding international treaty \u2014 and the 2018 EU Withdrawal Act.\n\nBack to the drawing board then, Boris.\n\nAlso on rt.com Boris Johnson rattles Irish peace, but his arrogance may backfire with Irish reunification\n\nIt is truly baffling to hear the British PM remain obstinately tight-lipped on his allegedly brilliant plans, while the livelihoods of so many hang in the balance. Asked if the 10-mile buffer zone would be part of his real plan, Johnson said that is \u201cnot what we are proposing at all,\u201d but admitted checks somewhere would be a \u201creality.\u201d\n\nThis idea rips up whole premise of negotiations, which were about how to avoid a border.\n\nThis is a hard border with mass surveillance of locals crossing it.\n\nIt will be seen as either a deliberate wrecking ploy from a govt that doesn't want a deal, or a sign of hopeless delusion \u2014 Naomi O'Leary (@NaomiOhReally) October 1, 2019\n\nWell, if there will be no checks at the border itself and no checks at the periphery of this imaginary buffer zone, where exactly will they be? Are we back to BoJo\u2019s mystery technology solutions that have still yet to materialize? It should come as no surprise that a European Commission spokesperson said Brussels had \u201cnot received any proposals\u201d from Johnson\u2019s serially obfuscating government that meet the necessary requirements with respect to Ireland.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Johnson on Tuesday again quoted the late Ian Paisley, a sectarian bigot who in his time referred to Catholics as \u201cvermin.\u201d The Tory PM has repeatedly echoed Paisley\u2019s words, saying the post-Brexit landscape could be one in which \u201cthe people are British, but the cattle are Irish.\u201d\n\nAm I the only Irish person living in the north of Ireland absolutely sick of hearing Johnson say the people here are British but the cattle can be Irish. He repeats it constantly. Does the #GFA say I have to change species to be recognised as Irish? \u2014 Treasa (@Treasa5555) October 1, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s well-established by now that BoJo cares little about the GFA \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t take much in-depth study to understand that a fairly sizable chunk of the northern population consider themselves Irish, not British \u2014 and some consider themselves both. Indeed, the ability to identify as one, the other, or both, is foundational to the peace agreement.\n\nThe multitude of reasons why a hardening of the Irish border would be unworkable have been repeated to the Tories ad infinitum, chief among them the threat of rising sectarian tensions and violence that would be almost inevitable following the installation of border infrastructure. But it\u2019s worth also repeating some of the logistical hurdles.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bojo\u2019s leaked Brexit plan for Irish border slammed by Dublin\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a scenario where a buffer zone exists and checks are conducted in warehouses 10 miles out from the border. In a tweet thread responding to the leak, global trade expert Dr. Anna Jerzewska posed some interesting questions: Will traders, who are usually required to do import and export declarations, be forced to stop twice? Once in the northern portion of the buffer zone and once in the south? What about goods produced within the buffer zone itself, or from the farms that straddle the border? How are those goods tracked?\n\nSo many questions remain - do traders crossing the border need to stop twice? Normally you do export and then import declarations. How will that work? And if you're coming from the rest of the UK do you also need to stop along the Irish Sea if standards and regulations differ? /7 \u2014 Dr Anna Jerzewska (@AnnaJerzewska) October 1, 2019\n\nHow would checks away from the border work anyway in preventing smuggling? What\u2019s to stop trucks full of goods just bypassing the checks and driving across the border? Is it meant to be an honesty system? I don\u2019t get the basic logic of it \u2014 Chris Chambers (@chrisdc77) October 1, 2019\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of compliance. With no checks at the border proper, there would be nothing to stop trucks full of goods without tracking devices from driving illegally over the border post-Brexit. This is why the backstop measure, which can at least temporarily ensure regulatory alignment between north and south, is simply necessary to maintain an open, frictionless border. The risk of violence, loss of lives and livelihoods should trump the desires of hardline Brexiteers like the lounging and contemptible Jacob Rees-Mogg, who are unlikely to feel any ill-effects, no matter the outcome.\n\nAlso on rt.com No \u2018credible\u2019 proposals from UK on Brexit backstop, Irish foreign minister says\n\nIn a scenario where checks are conducted at the border itself, things become even more complicated. Some major commuter roads cross the border multiple times. In a video report explaining the logistics, journalist Oli Dugmore highlighted the road from Clones to Cavan, which, with its twists and turns, crosses the border four times. Should thousands of commuters expect to meet four checkpoints on their way to and from work? It\u2019s not just roads either; there are literally houses divided by the border.\n\nBoris Johnson has said that Irish border checks will be a \u201creality.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re not, I\u2019ve been there, it won\u2019t work. pic.twitter.com/sw46Gqy5G9 \u2014 Oli Dugmore (@OliDugmore) October 1, 2019\n\nThere are nearly 300 crossing points along the border. Unless the British government is planning to barricade and spike the \u201cunapproved\u201d dirt roads, erect watchtowers in fields and return the rural borderlands to the militarized zone it was during the Troubles, there will be no way to control this zone absolutely.\n\nIf Johnson thinks sticking checkpoints \u201caway from the border\u201d eliminates the threat of violence, he is wrong. Nine people lost their lives when a customs point was blown up in 1972 \u2014 four miles from the border. \u201cIt is the same thing. It is dividing the country whether the border is there or six miles down the road,\u201d a local told the Irish Times last month.\n\nLondon is set to finally submit its last-ditch Brexit deal proposal to Brussels in the coming days after months of obfuscation and delay. This is your moment of truth, Boris. If you\u2019ve got a better plan up your sleeve, let\u2019s hear it.\n\nLike this story?
