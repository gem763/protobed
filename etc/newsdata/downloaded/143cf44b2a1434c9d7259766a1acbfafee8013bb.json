Jim Himes: Rudy Giuliani testimony key in Trump impeachment push", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic Rep. Jim Himes said getting the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s testimony would be a massive boon for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs a member of the House Intelligence committee, Mr. Himes believes the investigation can be done without Mr. Giuliani\u2019s cooperation, but he remains at the \u201cvery core\u201d of the allegations that the administration used military aid to leverage a foreign ally to investigate the Biden family.\n\n\u201cWhile I guess we could sort of piece together exactly what happened based on what the administration has disclosed, I really think it\u2019s important to talk to Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Himes said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former New York City mayor defied a Congressional subpoena to turn over documents related to the Ukraine investigation.\n\nMr. Giuliani has become one of the central figures in the impeachment inquiry, as he worked to push Ukraine to open an investigation into Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThough the Connecticut Democrat floated the end of the year as the goal for wrapping up the investigation, he acknowledged there\u2019s no hard date yet \u201cbecause, of course, every single day we\u2019re presented with sort of jaw dropping new information.\u201d\n\nHe said the committee wants to look more into the decision to remove former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch from her post and who knew about the delayed aid.\n\nMr. Himes also defended his party\u2019s closed-door approach to the impeachment inquiry, comparing it \u2014 like other members of Democratic leadership have \u2014 to special prosector investigations into the Clinton and Nixon allegations.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is that there is no way for the Republicans to defend the actions of the president here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as a result what they\u2019re doing is that they\u2019re attacking the process.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
