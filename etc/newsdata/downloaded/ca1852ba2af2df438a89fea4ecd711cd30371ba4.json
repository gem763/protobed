Businesses remain shuttered and an estimated 2 million children have not been able to go to school, according to the United Nations.\n\nEarlier in the month, Mo\u00efse announced the creation of a commission charged with finding a solution to end the worsening crisis, but opposition leaders have rejected his call for dialogue and unity, and are demanding his resignation.\n\nMany are also calling for a more in-depth investigation following a report by Haiti's Senate that accuses former top government officials from the administration of former president Michel Martelly of misusing at least $2 billion in funds tied to a Venezuelan subsidized oil program that were meant for social programs.\n\nThe report also names a company that Mo\u00efse once owned. Mo\u00efse, who was Martelly's hand-picked successor, has denied the allegations.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
