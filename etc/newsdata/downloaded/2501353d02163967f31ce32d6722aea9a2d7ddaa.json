Where many rappers sell themselves on their toughness, Drake is known more for his goofy dancing and turtleneck sweaters.\n\nBut the people he surrounds himself with have allegedly been involved in several incidents involving claims of violence over the years, which are listed below.\n\nDuring his first headlining tour in 2010, a fan, Jeremis Perez Soriano, claimed one of the rapper's bodyguards punched him in the mouth when he tried to compliment Drake at a club in Jacksonville, Florida. Soriano told Fox 30 that Drake proceeded to push him, and that he ended up getting six stitches. A friend of Soriano's backed up the claim when contacted by Fox 30, and said that as Drake boarded his tour bus after the incident, he flipped them off and said \"F--- you, you're nothing.\" Fox 30 no longer has the story on its site, but it was republished by several other outlets and blogs including Billboard and Perez Hilton. (Insider tried to reach out to Soriano for comment, but was not able to make contact with him.)\n\n\n\nIn June 2012, Drake and his entourage were involved in a massive brawl at a New York City club involving Chris Brown and his crew. At the time, Drake had been connected to Rihanna, who had previously dated Brown. Brown had been convicted of battering Rihanna three years earlier. According to the New York Daily News, the fight broke out when Brown sent Drake a bottle of champagne as a peace offering, and Drake sent it back with a note that said, \"I'm still f------ Rihanna.\" Photos from the nightclub after the brawl showed the club covered in shattered glass from the bottles and glasses the two groups threw at each other.\n\nDrake is seen flanked by bodyguards a few days after his nightclub brawl with Chris Brown in 2012. Splash News\n\nOne of Drake's collaborators, Detail, sued the rapper, claiming he lured him to his mansion in 2014 and then had his head of security, Chubbs, punch him, breaking his jaw. Detail, who is behind such hits as Beyonce's \"Drunk In Love\" and Ray J's \"Sexy Can I,\" said Chubbs yelled at him during the assault, \"Do you think Drake is soft? You think Drake's a punk?\" Detail claimed that Drake was mad at him for turning down the opportunity to be the rapper's exclusive producer. The lawsuit was dismissed by the court after Detail declined to pursue it. Insider reached out to Detail's lawyers for comment on why he stopped cooperating, but they did not return our emails. (It should be noted that Detail is a controversial figure. Last year, multiple women accused him of sexual assault. And sources close to Drake claim Detail was the aggressor in this incident.)\n\nDrake's security team was caught on video in 2017 bullying drivers on a street in Toronto, forcing them to the side of the road so that the rapper's motorcade could bypass traffic. When one driver complained, Drake's bodyguard told him, \"Run me over bro! I have the right of way, bro. I'll take your Tesla.\"\n\nIn 2017, Drake attended a Weeknd concert where his security guard allegedly roughed up singer Shawn Mendes. Mendes recalled the run-in just a few days later (which he described as a \"funny story\" while also admitting the encounter had him \"terrified\"), during an appearance on The Tonight Show. Mendes said he went up to Drake because they had met before, but the rapper's bodyguard stopped him before he could do so. \"The next thing I know, I'm in the middle of the Weeknd show with my arm hooked behind my back. Drake's security guard has me completely at his mercy,\" Mendes recalled. He said Drake saw what happened and told his bodyguard to let Mendes go, saying: \"Don't do that. You don't know who that is.\"\n\nDrake was connected to another alleged assault at Delilah in 2016. TMZ reported on the incident at the time: A man said he was punched in the face by one of Drake's bodyguards because he wouldn't get out of the bathroom so Drake could come in and use it in private. TMZ later updated the story to say a witness told them that Drake wasn't there, and that there's a private bathroom for celebs. But employees we talked to said they did see Drake's bodyguards clearing the main restroom for him on occasion, as described in the TMZ story. No one Insider spoke to was aware of this alleged incident in particular. However, police logs show a person coming into the station nearly a month later and reporting that they had been hit by a bodyguard at Delilah on that date. Sources close to Drake told Insider that the person who filed the report said he couldn't identify who hit him.\n\nInsider reached out to Drake's lawyers for comment on this story, but they declined to go on the record because of the pending lawsuit.", "description": "Unlike many rappers, Drake isn't known for his toughness.
