Individuals who did not complete their degree or who attended a for-profit institution are more likely to struggle with repayment than those who completed a degree from a public or private not-for-profit institution, even including those who took on a relatively large amount of debt.\u201d\n\nPeople are financing college mostly through student loans. But 24 percent have borrowed with credit cards and 7 percent with a home equity line of credit, according to the Fed.\n\nSome critics argue there isn\u2019t a student loan crisis, pointing to the average amount of debt borrowers are carrying. The typical amount of education debt in 2018 was between $20,000 and $24,999, the Fed said.\n\nBut \u201ctypical\u201d doesn\u2019t tell the full story.\n\nThe nonprofit StudentDebtCrisis.org encourages borrowers to share their debt crisis stories. Here are some of their testimonies.\n\nNicole from Houston: \u201cStruggling mother trying to pay loan $32,000. I don\u2019t even have a degree \u2026 I want to go back to school and do more for us but I just can\u2019t with this debt hanging over my head. It saddens me to know you have to be in all the debt to better your life.\u201d\n\n(There are many people who can\u2019t afford their loan payments. As a result, they place their loans in forbearance or get a deferral. Before they know it their loans have ballooned.)\n\nMark from Los Angeles: \u201cIt\u2019s crushing me and my family. I am 57 yrs. old and constantly putting it in forbearance. I fear it will follow me into retirement.\u201d\n\nStephanie from Illinois: \u201cI\u2019m a social worker and most social work jobs are low paying. I understand that I chose this but in order to be considered for a $30,000 job in my state you need a Master Of Social Work degree. I work more than 40 hours per week and I have $151,000 in debt, mostly it\u2019s all interest because of my payment plan. I have a family and I fear I will never pay this back. It\u2019s like having a second mortgage.\u201d\n\nEmily from Detroit: \u201cI wanted to go to school to help people, and my master\u2019s degree allows me to do that every day. But with over $75,000 in debt, partially due to ever-accruing interest, it feels like I\u2019ll never get ahead and will struggle with this my entire life.\u201d\n\nThen there are the borrowers who are behind on payments.\n\n\u201cAmong those with outstanding student loans from their own education, 2 in 10 adults are behind on their payments,\u201d the Fed said. \u201cThose who did not complete their degree are the most likely to be behind.\u201d\n\nRead: Desperate for relief from student-loan debt? Just don\u2019t fall prey to scammers.\n\nI was a guest recently on NPR\u2019s 1a and the topic: The Staggering Weight Of Student Loan Debt.\n\nYou can listen to the show here.\n\nDuring the broadcast, a listener with the Twitter handle @TheLouRichards asked several important questions.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhose fault is it? Are the loans too easy to obtain? Is the interest rate too high? Do students and families not understand that the money is a debt that needs to be repaid? Is the cost of college too high?\u201d\n\nThe House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing Tuesday in an effort to explore the very questions this Twitter user raised.\n\nSome fault the federal government for making education loans too easy to obtain. Others criticize colleges for letting costs get out of control. Or, pointing fingers at borrowers, some argue they irresponsibly took on too much education debt and now must suffer the consequences of that decision.\n\n\u201cDespite the social media screeds, the student debt crisis did not happen because 44 million Americans all lacked personal responsibility,\u201d Seth Frotman, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center wrote in submitted testimony to the House committee. \u201cLike kerosene on a fire, student debt is driving the systemic economic and racial inequality that is tearing our communities apart and tearing our country apart.\u201d\n\n#1: Is this really a crisis? YES! The weight of $1.6 trillion is impacting all corners of the country and hurting our communities. pic.twitter.com/YajHDMWKHI \u2014 Seth Frotman (@sethfrotman) September 9, 2019\n\nComedian Hasan Minhaj, host of the Netflix show \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d also testified during the hearing. He told legislators that during a taping of his show on the student loan crisis he polled the studio audience. Collectively the 200 audience members had more than $6 million in student loans.\n\n\u201cThis issue is sidelining millions of Americans,\u201d Minhaj testified. \u201cPeople are putting off marriage, kids, homeownership and retirement, especially my generation. I\u2019m 33, and growing up it was drilled into our heads, \u2018You\u2019ve got to go to college if you want a middle class job.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough Minhaj didn\u2019t graduate from college with debt thanks to his immigrant parents, he said he\u2019s still an advocate for consumer protections for student loan borrowers.\n\n\u201cYou often hear the idea that these kids wouldn\u2019t be in trouble if they just took some responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are trying to be responsible. They\u2019re investing in an education \u2026 Americans should not have to go bankrupt pursuing an higher education.\u201d\n\nYou can watch his testimony, which is peppered with humor and passion, by clicking the link for the following tweet.\n\nYou know the student loan crisis is bad when I'm asked to testify before Congress about it. pic.twitter.com/TTqylZZf8k \u2014 Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) September 10, 2019\n\nFor more on the cause of the student loan crisis read:\n\nStudent Loan Debt Crisis Breakdown\n\nStudent Debt: Lives on Hold\n\nStudent loan experts sound alarm on \u2018trillion-dollar black hole\u2019\n\nWhile we wait and debate who\u2019s at fault for this crisis, there are millions of borrowers who are struggling to pay off their student loans. I wanted to share more of their stories. The following comments were posted by NPR 1a listeners.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n\u2014 \u201cWait a minute, did anyone force these students to sign on the dotted line? When you borrow money you have a responsibility to pay it back regardless of where the funds are going. Why did the students borrow so much and why didn\u2019t they go to their local community colleges?\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cMy students and I are both broke and in debt \u2014 who\u2019s profiting?\u201d\n\nFrom 1a\u2019s Facebook page:\n\n\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m ok paying the student loans I borrowed for my Pa. school education. How about a break from the high interest rates? Before I had my Master\u2019s degree it had accumulated an extra 10k of interest to add to the debt! I\u2019d love to work in rural or underserved areas, but my friends who did that were told the funds to pay off their loans had run out. If you wonder why doctors and other practitioners gravitate toward specialty practice in urban communities, it may be because we have crushing school debt.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cLive at home, start at community college, maybe then transfer to 4 year college it will save lots of money. Many students get into debt from spending loan money on far more than tuition. All the jobs I have got were only from connections I made in college not my degree wonder where I would be if I spent that time learning a trade.\u201d\n\n\u2014 One poster responding to the recommendation of going to community college: \u201cIt\u2019s a great idea and I wholly support community college. BUT it still doesn\u2019t address the obscene cost of higher education. Especially for those who pursue graduate level degrees. It also doesn\u2019t factor in access to community colleges, as not every place in the U.S. has a community college within a reasonable distance. Our education system also doesn\u2019t educate teenagers about loans and how to pick the best one for them. So we are expecting 17-18yr olds to make serious financial decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cI owed 50k for college and a master's. What I resent is that I've already paid that back and then some. To borrow 50k I end up paying 250k. And I'll be paying for my college when my son starts his education. THAT'S the actual issue. The repayment process and interest rates.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cI owe more than I did when I graduated. I\u2019ve faithfully paid income-based payments on time the entire time. Interest rates are making it impossible to make a dent in what I owe.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a tenure track college professor whose income based repayments are almost $700/month. It is almost exactly the same as my mortgage payment and only $200 of the payment goes to principle, the other $500 goes to interest. That is absolutely insane. I'm also one of the fortunate ones who have a good job. I also started out at a CC and went to state school while living at home with my parents for the entirety of undergrad and worked 25-30 hours a week. That was barely manageable in 2002 let alone for the students I teach now. Something has to be done about interest rates. Stop blaming students for taking on debt when we have systems that abuse students\u2019 dreams.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe government needs to get out of the business of subsidizing loans. Colleges take advantage of those guaranteed payments and raise tuition. Secondly, who signed on the dotted line?\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cOne of my kids will have especially large loans to pay back, after attending NYU, which never came up with enough aid. I really worry about how it will impact his ability to save for retirement or a house.\u201d\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nWho do you blame for the increase in student loan debt?
