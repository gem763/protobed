The first bio, \u201cBuried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin,\u201d appeared just three years after the singer\u2019s death, and it was by the late Myra Friedman, ostensibly Joplin\u2019s publicist but, like so many others in her life, someone who quickly became an intimate. Perhaps for that reason, \u201cBuried Alive\u201d is, if thorough, emotionally red-hot and often overwritten. There\u2019s also \u201cLove, Janis,\u201d a 1992 memoir by Joplin\u2019s younger sister Laura, which became the basis for the musical of the same name. At any rate, there\u2019s no need to hype any book by Holly George-Warren, an award-winning author whose previous work includes the superb \u201cA Man Called Destruction: The Life and Music of Alex Chilton,\u201d one of the best rock biographies of the past 10 years. Her account is sober and thorough, and it amounts to the last word on a brief candle of an existence, a life whose peaks and valleys make your average mountain range look as flat as an acre of Texas farmland.\n\nNo matter who tells the story, though, it doesn\u2019t end well. That\u2019s why this review begins with a succinct recitation of Joplin\u2019s final moments \u2014 I\u2019m giving you the bad news first. Let us now celebrate one of the greatest soul voices and incandescent stage presences of our time: \u201cIt was as if the earth had opened up,\u201d wrote rock historian Joel Selvin of Joplin\u2019s performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, and guitarist Darby Slick of the San Francisco band the Great Society said that, as Joplin pranced, strutted, shrieked and whispered at an earlier show, \u201cIt was nearly impossible not to stare constantly at her.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way. A kindergarten teacher noted Joplin\u2019s refusal to \u201crest quietly,\u201d and the qualities that took her to the top of the entertainment world made her both enemies and friends along the way. A misfit in her hometown of Port Arthur, Tex., she was nominated for the ugliest man on campus competition as a student at the University of Texas at Austin, her picture on posters all over the school. Not long after, she made her way to the West Coast with fellow dropout and future concert promoter Chet Helms, thumbing rides like the protagonists of \u201cMe and Bobby McGee,\u201d a Kris Kristofferson song she\u2019d later make famous. Helms managed a band that needed a \u201cchick singer,\u201d and in more ways than one, Joplin became a key member of Big Brother and the Holding Company. In the spirit of the times, she and the other band members became more of a family than a business arrangement, making it that much harder for her to part company with them, even after they made mistakes while playing or forgot their parts.\n\nJoplin\u2019s next band, Kozmic Blues, was put together hastily by her manager, Albert Grossman, but the musicians were chosen for their individual prowess, and the group lacked chemistry. Her third band, Full Tilt Boogie, was the charm: The members were picked thoughtfully over time, and Janis loved playing with them. She only had a few months to live.\n\nJoplin took such joy in performing that she made it look effortless, but George-Warren reminds readers how hard she worked, not only doing take after take in the studio but also doing the kind of behind-the-scenes research associated more with musicologists than whiskey-swigging blues shouters. As a ninth-grader, Joplin watched Elvis\u2019s pelvispalooza on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d and become so enamored of \u201cHound Dog\u201d that she tracked down Big Mama Thornton\u2019s 1953 original. \u201cHow a thirteen-year-old white girl in segregated Port Arthur found the R&B single remains a mystery,\u201d writes George-Warren, \u201cbut she did.\u201d During her Big Brother days, Joplin heard Thornton sing \u201cBall and Chain\u201d at a San Francisco club and asked her if she could cover it. Thornton gave her the okay but warned, \u201cDon\u2019t [mess] it up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJoplin was the first female rock star at a time when rock was almost exclusively a boys club, and she had to put up with appalling sexism from musicians, the press and industry pros. Yet she showed other women what to do and taught men to accept them. The hotel where Joplin died is now the Highland Gardens Hotel, and it\u2019s possible to stay in the room where her life ended. Recently I spoke to the manager and asked what it\u2019s like to spend the night there, and he said, \u201cEveryone who has ever booked that room says they love it.\u201d\n\nDavid Kirby is the author of \u201cCrossroad: Artist, Audience, and the Making of American Music.\u201d\n\nJANIS\n\nHer Life and Music\n\nBy Holly George-Warren\n\nSimon & Schuster. 400 pp. $28.99\n\nAD", "description": "Holly George-Warren\u2019s biography of Janis Joplin is sober, thorough and moving.", "authors": ["David Kirby"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_RsRSlltWTFLvRlVjdFv1-V7eWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZRYRMHUCII6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
