And Bakkt\u2019s much-ballyhooed launch is likely going to accentuate this. Drastically.\n\nBitcoin Volatility Tanks\n\nSince early-July, the Bitcoin price has entered into a drawn-out lull, with there being a clearly tightening trade range that has resulted in Bitcoin\u2019s realized volatility falling into a range of 1.2%/day.\n\nNot only is volatility decreasing but so are volumes. Skew pointed out that CME\u2019s BTC futures saw their lowest volumes in four months, implying indirection in this market.\n\nThis declining volume in the CME BTC futures market has been echoed over in the spot market.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency exchanges in aggregate have processed $51 billion worth of trades over the past 24 hours, which is a far cry from the $120+ billion seen during late-June and early-July of this very year. Sure, the data site is known not to be 100% accurate, but the decline in registered crypto volume accentuates the consolidatory period that Bitcoin is in.\n\nBut this lull might be about to come to an abrupt end.\n\nLull May Come to An End\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility index reading on BitMEX has fallen to a zone \u201cwhere massive price moves are born\u201d, as analyst Chonis put it.\n\nIndeed, per this writer\u2019s analysis of the metric, Bitcoin volatility was last week at a point not seen since two weeks prior to that one fateful day in April, during which Bitcoin experienced a 20% explosion from $4,000 to $5,000. The metric is also as low as it was just days before Bitcoin plunged from the $6,000 cliff to the $3,000 bottom in late-2018.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. As analyst Mayne points out, the Bollinger Bands are constricting, moving averages are converging, Bitcoin is nearing the peak of its apex, and Bakkt is hours away from launching.\n\n$BTC $10,088.5 is a key level to regain for bulls, looking weak right now I'm not sure another range low test holds. If we do break $9k I think it'll be a wick when viewed on the HTF.

However, a statistical study from technical trading legend Thomas Bulkowski says that there is a marginally higher chance that BTC breaks higher instead of lower.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Just so you all know, Bakkt's Bitcoin futures will have their first weekend pre-open in thirty minutes after this article is published.
