The Iran-aligned Houthi militant group in Yemen claimed responsibility.\n\nPublicly, the Pentagon has responded by sending thousands of additional troops and equipment to bolster Saudi defenses - the latest US deployment to the region this year.\n\nWashington and Riyadh believe Tehran was to blame for the drone attacks on the Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq on September 14\n\nTwenty-five drones and missiles were used in the attack that forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its oil production\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment about the cyber strikes.\n\n'As a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, intelligence, or planning,' said Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith.\n\nThe impact of the attack, if any, could take months to determine, but cyber strikes are seen as a less-provocative option below the threshold of war.\n\n'You can do damage without killing people or blowing things up; it adds an option to the toolkit that we didn't have before and our willingness to use it is important,' said James Lewis, a cyber expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nLewis added that it may not be possible to deter Iranian behavior with even conventional military strikes.\n\nTensions in the Gulf have escalated sharply since May 2018, when Trump withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the easing of sanctions.\n\nAn insider said the cyber operation took place in late September and took aim at Tehran's ability to spread 'propaganda'\n\nIt was unclear whether there have been other US cyber attacks since the one in late September.\n\nIran has used such tactics against the United States. This month, a hacking group that appears linked to the Iranian government tried to infiltrate email accounts related Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nOver 30 days in August and September, the group, which Microsoft dubbed 'Phosphorous,' made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer accounts, then attacked 241 of them.\n\nTehran is also thought to be a major player in spreading disinformation.\n\nAn investigation last year found more than 70 websites that push Iranian propaganda to 15 countries, in an operation that cybersecurity experts, social media firms and journalists are only starting to uncover.\n\nTensions with Iran have been high since the September attack. Tehran has claimed that an Iranian tanker was hit by rockets in the Red Sea last week and warned on Monday that there would be consequences.\n\nAt a news conference, President Hassan Rouhani reiterated his country's policy toward the Trump administration, ruling out bilateral talks unless Washington returns to the landmark nuclear deal and lifts crippling US economic sanctions.", "description": "Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US operation took place in late September and took aim at Tehran's ability to spread 'propaganda.'", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784346-0-image-a-78_1571225003320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
