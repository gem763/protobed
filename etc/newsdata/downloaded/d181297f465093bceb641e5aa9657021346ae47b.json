A firefighter also received medical treatment for smoke inhalation.\n\nFather of two, Vusumzi Olayi, said he could not save any of his belongings because the fire started next to his shack.\n\n\"I heard screams from a neighbour. I took my wife and kids to safety. My kids will walk barefoot to school. Their clothes were inside the house.\"\n\nCause\n\nResidents suspect that a candle might have caused the fire. This is despite the fact that the area has had electricity since 2010.\n\n\"My brother was out drinking with his friends. He is not back yet. We do not know if the body belongs to him,\" said a woman.\n\nFifty-nine-year-old David Mlangeni did not only lose his house but also his business. His car which he used as a delivery van caught alight.\n\n\"I had to ensure the safety of my family and by the time I thought about my car keys, it was too late. I work as a delivery person and I was using my own car. I have lost it all now. I do not know how I will resume work.\"\n\nIn another fire in Langa, 31 shacks were destroyed, leaving 76 people homeless.\n\nCarelse said there were no injuries in the second fire.", "description": "One person has died in a shack fire at Happy Rest informal settlement in Nomzamo, Strand, Cape Town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7870/d79376a2e41d48feaf29afef8a9389cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
