(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Mystics went through a spirited practice Thursday, according to Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault, who took that energy as the best indication his players have moved beyond the initial shock of losing league MVP Elena Delle Donne to a back injury two nights earlier.\n\nThibault declined to provide an update regarding Delle Donne\u2019s availability for Sunday\u2019s Game 3 of the WNBA Finals on the road against the Connecticut Sun, saying only the two-time MVP continues to receive treatment for a herniated disk that forced her from Tuesday\u2019s Game 2 loss in the opening minutes.\n\nDelle Donne\u2019s status for the rest of the series remains uncertain. She did not speak with members of the media following Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\n[Delle Donne has a herniated disk and the Mystics have issues in WNBA Finals]\n\nThe Mystics went 0-4 during the regular season when the six-time all-star was either not in the lineup or barely played, including one game when she logged one minute before departing with a broken nose.\n\n\u201cIt means collectively the group has to, A, believe that we\u2019re good enough, which they are,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cB, our bench showed the other day offensively that we can do a lot of things.\n\n\u201cI think it took us a while mentally to adjust with Elena being out of the game. Now we\u2019ve got four days to prepare for that possibility.\u201d\n\nThe most significant modifications for the Mystics in Delle Donne\u2019s absence, Thibault indicated, concern rebounding and defense, particularly when it comes to limiting Jonquel Jones, the Sun\u2019s 6-foot-6 center who had a career-high 32 points and a WNBA Finals-record 18 rebounds, including nine offensive, in Game 2.\n\nWashington was outrebounded 41-27.\n\nWith the 6-5 Delle Donne drawing the primary defensive assignment on Jones in Game 1, the former George Washington standout finished with 12 points and six rebounds in Washington\u2019s 95-86 triumph.\n\n\u201cI thought Game 2 was partly us and partly\u201d Jones, Thibault said. \u201cShe was much more aggressive and active, and we have to match that. But we got caught in bad rebounding positions because we tried to help off of her at times when we shouldn\u2019t have.\"\n\nEmma Meesseman moved into Delle Donne\u2019s slot in Game 2 and is in line to start there Sunday if the Mystics\u2019 scoring and rebounding leader does not play. Meesseman led Washington in Game 2 with 23 points and eight rebounds, playing 35:48, second only to point guard Kristi Toliver.\n\nMeesseman, a two-time all-star, had not played more than 28 minutes in any of the past three games in the WNBA playoffs after averaging a shade below 24 minutes during the regular season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked on some big things on defense, like communicating more,\u201d Meesseman said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the big thing for us, and be more physical, so I don\u2019t think it really matters who\u2019s on the court for that. Everybody has to be physical and take a step higher in everything we do on defense and rebounding.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Delle Donne\u2019s availability also likely signals more playing time for reserve forward Tianna Hawkins, who finished Game 2 with 16 points, one short of her career high in the postseason, and six rebounds in 22:47.\n\nIt was the most minutes Hawkins has played during the playoffs this year.\n\nShe averaged 25.3 minutes over the three consecutive games Delle Donne essentially missed three months ago while recovering from the broken nose suffered July 7 against the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\n\u201cI mean, she does a lot for us,\u201d Hawkins said of Delle Donne. \u201cWe all just have to come together and be a little better both on the offensive end and the defensive end. We\u2019ve got to play [Jones] straight up and just be a little more physical with her and make sure we keep her off the boards.\u201d\n\nJones isn\u2019t the only player Washington intends to be more mindful of either, regardless of whether Delle Donne plays.\n\nPoint forward Alyssa Thomas is averaging 20.5 points, eight rebounds, six assists and three steals in the WNBA Finals, providing another rugged presence inside despite a torn labrum in each shoulder.\n\nDelle Donne at times guarded Thomas as well in Game 1, although her length was better served fronting Jones when she established position on the low block with her back to the basket.\n\n\u201cThe issues came regardless of who was on the floor,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cWe did a bad job of rebounding the other day. The goal is to contain one or two of their starters, and you\u2019re going to give up something somewhere. We didn\u2019t control anybody the other day because of the rebounding. That\u2019s a huge focus.\n\n\u201cWe can make some adjustments defensively on a few things and just play better.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nKevin B.
