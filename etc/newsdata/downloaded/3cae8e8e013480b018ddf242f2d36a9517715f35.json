Gavin Newsom fight again on Twitter, this time over gas prices and electric cars", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE California Gov. Gavin Newsom says he believes \u201ccompletely corrupt\u201d President Donald Trump should be removed from office by Congress, but with Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate the best way to boot Trump is at the ballot box. (Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom clashed again on Twitter late Tuesday, with Trump chiding the state for having the nation's highest average gas prices and Newsom slamming the president's \"credibility\" on environmental issues.\n\nThree weeks after Trump announced plans to eliminate California's right to set its own auto emissions standards, he also mocked the state's move to embrace electric vehicles.\n\n\"I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren\u2019t doing the trick!\" Trump tweeted. \"Don\u2019t worry California, relief is on the way. The State doesn\u2019t get it!\"\n\nThe average price per gallon in California was $4.18 per gallon Tuesday, according to AAA, compared to the national average of $2.64. California also charges the highest gas tax in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation, with rates of 61 cents per gallon as of July 2019.\n\nNewsom denounced Trump's claims and sarcastically described electric vehicles as \"gas guzzlers.\"\n\nYou have no credibility on this issue. You\u2019re trying to gut our emissions laws. Deny climate change. And wreck our environment by burning the dirtiest possible energy sources.\n\n\n\nBut yeah, those electric vehicles we\u2019re encouraging car companies to manufacture sure are gas guzzlers! https://t.co/Aia1jgCId8 \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 9, 2019\n\n\"You have no credibility on this issue,\" Newsom tweeted at Trump. \"You\u2019re trying to gut our emissions laws. Deny climate change. And wreck our environment by burning the dirtiest possible energy sources.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups have repeatedly challenged Trump's energy policies, describing attempts to roll back methane regulations and revitalize coal as endangering the climate in the name of industry interests. Trump contended last month that loosening regulations for tailpipe discharges could save money for consumers.\n\n'Drastic change'?: Why automakers may not change their strategies if Trump ends California emissions waiver\n\nRefinery outages that have tightened the supply of gasoline on the West Coast \u2014 not emissions standards \u2014 have prompted the spike in California gas prices, AAA said.\n\n\u201cAll regions are seeing planned and unplanned refinery maintenance, but it is only the West Coast that is really seeing gasoline stocks tighten and gas prices increase,\u201d AAA spokesperson Jeanette Casselano said in a release. \u201cOn the whole, we are seeing gasoline demand mostly push lower amid stable, but healthy gasoline stock levels which are ultimately keeping prices cheaper for most motorists.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration's plan to cancel California's waiver allowing stricter emissions standards will likely face a federal court battle. Revoking the waiver also would affect 13 other states that have signed on: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump and Newsom has been ongoing for nearly a year, with the two politicians arguing over climate, immigration, California's failed high-speed rail plans, the allocation of federal money and wildfire management.\n\nWATCH: Trump bars California from setting fuel standards\n\nIn his first State of the State address, Newsom defied Trump\u2019s administration by ordering hundreds of National Guard troops off the state\u2019s border with Mexico, accusing Trump of creating a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d and stressing that California would not \u201cbe part of this political theater.\u201d\n\nThose comments came a month after Newsom spoke out against \u201ccorruption and incompetence in the White House\u201d during his swearing-in ceremony in Sacramento.\n\nWhile campaigning ahead of last November\u2019s midterm elections, Trump labeled Newsom as \u201ca clown\u201d who wants \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\nContributing: Nathan Bomey, Ledyard King, Steve Kiggins and Todd Spangler, USA TODAY.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/donald-trump-gavin-newsom-california-gas-prices-twitter/3915811002/", "description": "The average price for a gallon of gas in California was $4.18 per gallon Tuesday, according to AAA, compared to the\u00a0national average of\u00a0$2.64.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Published A.M.
