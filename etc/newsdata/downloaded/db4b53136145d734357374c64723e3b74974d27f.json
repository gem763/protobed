The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 28, 2019\n\nThe delay \u2014 which will be the third since Brexit was originally supposed to take place on March 29th 2019, already years after the British people voted to Leave the European Union in June 2016 \u2014 was later all but finalised by President Tusk on social media.\n\n\u201cThe EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK\u2019s request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, the EU27 being the governments of the 27 member-states of the European Union besides the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson had not wanted to ask for another Brexit delay, and had vowed he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than ask for one \u2014 but MPs in the House of Commons, around 70 per cent of whom voted Remain in 2016, thwarted him by ramming a law dubbed \u201cthe Surrender Act\u201d ordering the Prime Minister to ask for one, and even laid out in precise terms how the request should be worded.\n\nUntil almost the last minute, Johnson hinted he would not comply with the Act, but in the end he sent the letter, attempting to appease Brexit supporters by sending it to President Tusk in the form of an unsigned photocopy, along with a signed letter saying he personally did not support an extension.\n\nIt was the unsigned photocopy which had the force of law behind it, however, and the EU has accepted its request for a three-month extension and discarded Johnson\u2019s signed letter asking them not to.\n\nLib Dems, SNP Push for December 9th Election to Stop Boris #Brexit Deal Being Passed https://t.co/wfS7dvL6we \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 27, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "It appears that Brexit will be delayed until 2020, as France's Emmanuel Macron has swung behind a three-month deadline extension.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/macron-tusk-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
