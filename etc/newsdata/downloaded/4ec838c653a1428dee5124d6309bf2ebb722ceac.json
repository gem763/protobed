The former president of the local UAW 1112, who once led workers at the shuttered GM Lordstown plant in Ohio, was forced to relocate to Bedford, Ind., this past summer where he now works on the company\u2019s die-cast production line.\n\nGreen, whom President Trump famously bashed on Twitter when General Motors announced it was closing the plant, is a devout Democrat and union man who does not care for the president. Like many of his peers across the Midwest, he is waiting and hoping for one of the Democratic presidential candidates to do something inspiring.\n\n\u201cThe candidates who have the right message aren\u2019t on the debate stage,\u201d said Green of his former congressman Tim Ryan and Sherrod Brown, the US senator from Ohio who dropped out of the contest before the debates even started. \u201cWe need candidates to actually step up and do more than lip service, do something to help change some of the laws that are anti-worker,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause, quite frankly, we\u2019ve been getting our asses handed to us for 20 years or more. And, if something doesn\u2019t change \u2026\u201d\n\nHis voice trails off in frustration.\n\nAs social media, a socialist-leaning base and each successive debate molds the Democrats\u2019 2020 platform, climate change has emerged as the single most important issue, followed by Medicare for All, more government spending, free college, gun confiscation, reparations for the descendants of slaves, and banning fossil fuels and the jobs they create.\n\nAny emphasis on pro-worker ideals, such as the extension of paid sick days, never seems to come up. \u201cJoe Biden is probably the most pro-union person out of the group running for president. Still, he doesn\u2019t talk about it much when he is on the stage,\u201d said Gary Steinbeck, a retired steelworker from Ohio.\n\nAfter leading the pack for months, Biden\u2019s slipping in the polls. A recent national survey by Monmouth University put the former vice president in a statistical tie with the uber-progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Now many lifelong working-class Democrats are wondering if their party will abandon them completely in 2020.\n\nAs Ron Brownstein wrote in The Atlantic in 2012, Barack Obama mobilized both the Democrats\u2019 new coalition of the ascendant (young people, women, minorities and college-educated whites) as well as \u201cjust enough working-class whites\u201d to hold the critical Great Lakes region in the Midwest. But Hillary Clinton ignored that constituency at her peril. In Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania she failed to earn enough labor votes (winning just 51 percent, down from Obama\u2019s near 60 percent) and lost the 2016 election.\n\nThree years later, the party still hasn\u2019t figured out if they want these voters or not.\n\nSome blue-collar voters, meanwhile, don\u2019t want Trump, but they also don\u2019t want a Democratic Party, which they have built and supported \u2014 often blindly \u2014 since the 1930s, to cede control to a radical left-wing flank.\n\nIt was the promise of \u201ccard check\u201d legislation, which would have made it easier for workers to unionize, which first energized the labor movement for Obama in 2008, fueling donations and grass-roots support.\n\nBut even with Obama in the White House and Democrats holding healthy majorities in both the House and the Senate, working-class voters were rewarded with no labor-law reform in 2009 or 2010.\n\nAs a result, non-college whites fled the Democrats during the 2010 midterms, when they supported GOP candidates by double digits, turning the House of Representatives red.\n\nThis cohort leans Republican now more than ever; a Gallup poll this year shows they favor the GOP by a whopping 25 percentage points.\n\nIt was as if the Democratic Party didn\u2019t understand how much they needed labor. Oddly, it appears they still don\u2019t. \u201cThe working-class voters in my county tend to wonder if the party still wants them,\u201d says Mark Hackel, the Democratic chief executive of Macomb County, Mich., where voters favored Trump over Clinton by 11 percentage points. \u201cThey\u2019re not really sure where they fit in.\u201d\n\nMike Mikus, a Democratic strategist who helped guide Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s successful reelection last year, said it would be folly if his party didn\u2019t start wooing the working-class voter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Mikus said. \u201cThe Democratic Party policies are very helpful and appealing to working-class people. We should most definitely be delivering that message to them and courting them.\u201d\n\nSteinbeck, now a labor leader in Ohio\u2019s Mahoning-Trumbull area, says he finds Trump\u2019s presidency abhorrent and his party\u2019s \u201cinability to make labor part of the conversation or equation\u201d disheartening.\n\nBut, as the nomination race starts narrowing, he is hopeful a candidate will emerge who inspires the labor voter. And he hopes labor will strongly back that nominee in the same way they did with Obama to take back the White House.\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s what we should be able to do,\u201d he said. \u201cRally around someone who can beat Trump.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s 10:30 a.m. and Dave Green is home for the weekend tinkering with his car.
