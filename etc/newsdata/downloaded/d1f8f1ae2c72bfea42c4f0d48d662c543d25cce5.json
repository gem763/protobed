It is a city that knows a thing or two about genius, about charlatans and about boxing fairy tales. Fury is loved in this city of shifting loyalties.\n\nOn Saturday, he fights a Swedish heavyweight prospect called Otto Wallin in the T-Mobile Arena, his second outing here, and there is now a growing sense of a residency. In Las Vegas, the most transient of cities, a man can feel at home quickly after a big breakfast, a free coffee, a dollar-investment in a rolling fruit machine and Fury has embraced the place and sucked in that feeling. The reverse is true and a fighter can feel isolated, unwanted here in a second of precious Las Vegas time. The fights have to get harder after Wallin to keep the public coming.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Their Las Vegas days will now belatedly unite the pair. \u201cCool guy,\u201d they both offered after meeting.\n\nIt is a strange city of the docile and the fabulous, a perfect last resort for heavyweight boxers. It\u2019s boxing\u2019s ultimate melting pot of talent, failures and the men and women who arrive are on missions. The wannabe fighters, having moved from all over the world, queue outside Floyd Mayweather\u2019s gym, hoping for an invite, dreaming of discovery, preening in expectation. It\u2019s a horrible meat market to witness.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

He needed just 130 seconds to ruin Floyd Patterson. Seven years later, Liston, by now a resident, was found dead in his apartment. It was heroin, the police said: \u201cBullshit,\u201d shouted Liston\u2019s loved ones. The death remains a Las Vegas heavyweight mystery. It\u2019s not the only one, old champions die here all the time with or without ceremony.\n\nThe great Joe Louis was next to Ali at Liston\u2019s funeral and Louis, for a time, was a \u201cmeeter and greeter\u201d on the doors at Caesars Palace. Sadly, sweet Joe was heavily sedated most days and he was prone to landing perfect left hooks on the chins of eager tourists. Louis, like Liston, died in the city and there is a mystery attached there. Louis has a statue and Liston a simple sign at the burial ground where he faces eternity as the only adult in the children\u2019s section. Liston\u2019s last resting place is perhaps the perfect Las Vegas parable: The world\u2019s most feared man buried with the innocent.\n\nMuhammad Ali slipped in and out of Las Vegas in the Seventies, fought in the rings and kissed the diamond-studded tunics of Elvis Presley in hotel penthouses. However, it was a few years later that Tyson became the true Las Vegas heavyweight idol; it was his fighting playground, making millions, biting ears and buying tigers that defined his decade of wins and losses. Lennox Lewis tried it, Vitali Klitschko had a pit-stop and Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe shared over 30 unforgettable rounds. A Tyson fight week was a special type of crazy, especially at the end when his legal medication would have dropped a rhino.\n\nAnd way below the popular memory line, heavyweight men like Candy Slim Merritt, the damaged Ike Ibeabuchi, former champion Michael Dokes and giant Cuban Jorge Luis Gonzalez begged and fought and died or vanished in this truly heartless city. They went down into the darkness with their bandaged hands extended, collecting a last dollar for a final fix, a bus fare or just an old-fashioned beer.\n\nSo, welcome back to Las Vegas Tyson Fury, and once again take from this place of trickery, demons and deceit, the finest bits. Take the glory, the money, the fame; leave the vanity of celebrity for all those others walking the acres of casino floors. Wallin is the perfect man for another, slightly more difficult fight in a city which has been searching for a new heavyweight hero now for over 25 years.
