They tricked us,\u201d said one of the rare woman protesters on Saturday, her young son at her side.\n\nSome protesters have directed some of their anger at Sadr and the country\u2019s top Shiite religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who is deeply revered among most Iraqis.\n\n\u201cSadr, Sistani \u2014 this is a shame,\u201d a protester in Tahrir said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe were hit! It\u2019s enough,\u201d he said, waving a tear gas canister fired earlier by security forces.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 The Iraqi government faced more pressure late Saturday from a surprise sit-in by lawmakers linked to populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/e0ec4d_200-people-died-thousands-wounded-in-iraq-anti-government-protests-broke-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
