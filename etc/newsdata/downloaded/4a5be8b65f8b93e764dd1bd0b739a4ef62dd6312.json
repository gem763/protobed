Then the screams start.\n\nThe incident happened on Sunday in Iceland's Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park, CNN reported. A group of sightseers on tours with H\u00e1fjall, a private tour group, were sent scrambling when a piece broke off from the Brei\u00f0amerkurj\u00f6kull glacier, causing a wave to surge.\n\nStephan Mantler, who owns the tour company and guides excursions himself, just happened to record the moment. He later posted it on Facebook.\n\nAfter the chunk of ice broke off, tourists ran away from the shore, and some could be heard faintly shouting.\n\nMantler told INSIDER that those on the tour of the remote region were prepped for what to do in the event of a calving, the term for when pieces of glaciers break off.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody who arrives there is instructed by their guides to immediately leave the beach and search higher ground if a calving occurs,\" Mantler said. \"Most calvings are smaller and more distant, so this was a rather close call but one can see in the video that people started to react immediately and there were a number of guides down there ready to assist if needed.\"\n\nHe does not recommend visiting the region without an experienced guide.\n\n\"While calvings are fairly frequent at this time of the year, this was an extraordinarily large event and much closer to the shore than usual, which is why it was such a close call,\" Mantler told CNN. \"In the end, most importantly, nobody got hurt or even wet.\"\n\nAnd despite what was shown above, Mantler told the Iceland Monitor that some thrill-seekers got a real kick out of the day's events. \"They were not scared, but rather very excited,\" he said.\n\nFor more go to Business Insider South Africa.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "As the piece of glacier cracks off and slides down into the icy waters, things almost seem to move in slow-motion.
