Both automakers are facing a deep slump in demand in their home market as well as in China, where economic woes and stricter emissions rules are hurting sales.\n\nTo deal with this challenging operating environment both companies have announced a major restructuring to revive sales and keep their share prices from weakening. Let\u2019s take a deeper look to see where these automakers stand.\n\nFord \u2014 Demand Outlook Remains Weak\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest automaker is facing powerful headwinds this year. Ford lost $155 million before interest and taxes in China in the second-quarter, with deliveries to dealers plunging 32%, as the company struggles with an ageing product line in one of the most important markets for its cars.\n\n\n\nIn North America, where Ford makes much of its profit, shipments for its Explorer SUV model fell in the second-quarter, hurting earnings and shrinking margins. Struggling operations in Asia and Europe prompted Ford to cut its forecast for 2019, signalling the path to profitability will be bumpy for the automaker.\n\n\n\nTo deal with these challenges, Ford is in the middle of a $11-billion restructuring plan, spread over five years that includes cutting thousands of jobs, rejuvenating its line of SUVs and pickups and abandoning slow-selling sedans.\n\n\n\nThe company is introducing new versions of its popular Explorer and Escape SUVs this year, and it plans to re-launch its Bronco off-roader in 2020. Ford has also concluded a deal with Volkswagen (DE: ) to jointly develop electric and self-driving cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFord price chart\n\nGM \u2014 Benefiting From Local Strength\n\nAs Ford undertakes this massive restructuring exercise to improve profitability and get ready for an era where electric and driverless cars will rule, its stock is showing some signs of life. It has strengthened about 23% since hitting the December low, to close yesterday at $9.34.Even with this rebound, Ford stock is still down more than 40% in the past 12 months and has traded below $10 a share most of this year amid concerns about the sustainability of its generous $0.15-a-share quarterly dividend.\n\nJust like Ford, GM is also facing weakening demand in its key regions. But the company\u2019s latest show significant progress in its turnaround plan execution, and GM has already begun to reap the benefits.\n\nFor the second-quarter, GM easily beat analysts\u2019 average estimate for profit and maintained its outlook for a stronger second half. Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra continues to expect near-record profit for 2019 as revamped heavy-duty pickups begin rolling into showrooms.\n\n\u201cOur results demonstrate the earnings power of our full-size truck franchise, with more upside to come,\u201d Barra said in a statement. According to a report in Bloomberg, the Beefier versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups are helping GM in a big way.\n\nEach truck sold for about $45,500 in the quarter, roughly $8,400 more than the average transaction price for all the company\u2019s vehicles in the U.S. \u201cSince the models are among the top sellers in the industry, they\u2019re enormously profitable,\u201d it said.\n\nCost cuts, including the closing of five plants in North America this year, are expected to boost 2019 profit by as much as $2.5 billion. And, according to Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara, the series of restructuring moves GM has planned will increase earnings by a total of $6 billion by 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nGM price chart\n\nThese bullish estimates are propelling GM shares in 2019. Closing at $38.73 yesterday, they've gained 16% this year.\n\nGM\u2019s performance in China, however, isn\u2019t much better than Ford's. The company said last month its automotive equity income from its operations there plunged 60% to $235 million, and the automaker expects the industry to remain weak through the second half of the year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGM\u2019s local strength and the successful execution of its restructuring plan is a clear differentiating factor when it comes to comparing the two U.S.-based carmakers. Over the long-run, GM has also proved a better bet than Ford \u2014 in the past five years, GM has gained 18% while Ford has lost over 40%. At a time when the future is becoming uncertain for traditional automakers, it\u2019s better to stick with a trusted name \u2014 and GM is certainly is on a stronger footing.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: General Motors Company, Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen AG VZO O.N..
