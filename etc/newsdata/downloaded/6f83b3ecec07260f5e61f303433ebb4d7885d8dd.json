However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nThe best wireless router gives you the fastest performance for your devices at the farthest possible range. It's an easy formula, right? But it can be deceptively difficult to figure out when you need a new router\u2014and even trickier to buy the right one. After researching tons of routers and testing nine finalists over four weeks, we think the best for most people is the D-Link AC1900 DIR-878.\n\nIt's fast, easy to set up, offers enough range for even a large home, and should hold up for years to come. However, you (or your family) own a lot of bandwidth-hogging devices, or you need a router that's packed with as many features as possible, the Asus tri-band RT-AC3200\u2014or a mesh WiFi system\u2014may be a better fit.\n\n1. Best Overall Router: D-Link DIR-878\n\nD-Link DIR-878 (Photo: D-Link)\n\nWhatever wizardry D-Link built into its DIR-878, it's practically Tolkienesque. We were blown away by this AC1900 router's wireless-ac performance, especially at range. The DIR-878 is the router to get if you just want great speeds for minimal fuss\u2014and cost.\n\nCompared to other routers' 5GHz or single-SSID Wi-Fi networks, the DIR-878 achieved the best combined performance across all of our test locations on our wired file transfer test. At our toughest, long-range test location, the DIR-878 had the best combined read and write throughput\u2014and nearly double the speed of the next-fastest router.\n\nPower users will find the DIR-878 a bit dull, but its eye-opening performance for its similarly surprising price makes D-Link's router a must-buy for most. If you have more strenuous networking needs, like devices numbering in the double-digits that are all trying to perform bandwidth-heavy tasks at the same time, you might need a better-equipped tri-band router like Asus' RT-AC3200. Otherwise, the DIR-878 is a great match for most users' typical needs.\n\nGet the D-Link DIR-878 from Amazon for $124.92\n\n2. Best Advanced Router: Asus RT-AC3200\n\nAsus AC3200 WiFi router (Photo: Amazon)\n\nIf you're tired of dealing with routers that only ever give you half of what you want, it's time to plunk down some cash for Asus' RT-AC3200, a tri-band router that has nearly everything you need for a higher $200 price. It's fast and fully featured, and Asus focuses less on future-proofing the router in favor of features you can actually take advantage of right now.\n\nThe RT-AC3200 is a \"tri-band router,\" which means it gives you a single 2.4GHz network and two 5GHz networks to pick from. In practice, you'll want to split your wireless-ac devices between both 5GHz networks, as having too many devices doing too many things on a single network can impact the speeds of connected devices. The RT-AC3200 can help you manage this with its Smart Connect feature, band steering that you have to manually enable within its web-based configuration. However, we found our devices generally performed better without it.\n\nThe RT-AC3200's setup process was incredibly simple. We loved that the router prompts you to update its firmware at the conclusion of the setup procedure, but we hated that its default wireless networks are completely open\u2014no password needed. While it's unlikely that you have a neighbor waiting to see you power up a new router and access its open network before you can, we'd still prefer Asus to provide a unique password for the router's initial wireless networks.\n\nGet the Asus RT-3200 from Amazon for $179\n\n3. TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750\n\nTP-Link AC1750 smart WiFi router (Photo: Amazon)\n\nTypically hovering around $80, TP-Link's Archer C7 is one of the least expensive ways to outfit your home with wireless-ac coverage\u2014or at least, a portion of it. While it's rare to find another AC1750 (or better) router that beats the Archer C7 on price, there are plenty that are faster than TP-Link's router, especially at range.\n\nThe Archer C7's web-based configuration screen contains a lot of options, more than most users will likely be familiar adjusting (if they'll even need to adjust them at all). We love that the router comes with an easy-to-set access point mode, in case you already have a pretty great router and want to use the Archer C7 to extend wireless-ac connectivity to a different area of your house.\n\nGet the TP-Link AC1750 Archer from Amazon for $57.99\n\n4. Nighthawk Netgear X4S\n\nNighthawk Netgear X4S WiFi router (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThis beast of an AC2600 router can deliver incredible speeds for all the 4x4 and MU-MIMO devices you currently own\u2014which, for most people, is a whopping zero. We'd rather have better long-distance performance.\n\nNetgear does a great job walking you through the router's initial setup process, but we were a little annoyed with Netgear's many requests during the setup process, like asking users to download the accompanying Genie app and sign up for a Netgear account. We appreciate that Netgear prompts you to update the router's firmware to its most recent version.\n\nWe also love that the router comes with \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\" tabs in its web-based configuration screen, which helps keep router novices focused on the key settings they need to know. It's easy to access the router's parental controls, ReadySHARE settings for USB-attached storage or printers, and built-in BitTorrent downloader, although one of its most useful settings for those who already own a router\u2014access point mode\u2014is a little buried on the Advanced tab.\n\nGet the Netgear Nighthawk X4S from Amazon for $189\n\n5. Trendnet AC2600\n\nTRENDnet AC2600 WiFi router (Photo: Amazon)\n\nTrendnet's AC2600 TEW-827DRU is overkill for most people's needs, though it's does win a few points for being one of the most inexpensive 4x4 MU-MIMO routers we've yet seen. Don't fall for the future-proofing though; by the time enough devices arrive that can actually make use of this router's capabilities, you'll probably be able to purchase something that performs even better.\n\nWe had a bit of trouble setting up the TEW-827DRU. The setup wizard that supposedly helps users out by checking the status of your Internet and LAN connectivity kept knocking our wireless connection offline. We were able to bypass the setup wizard and adjust the router's settings manually\u2014not a problem for experienced users, but a frustrating issue for those who just want an easy way to set up their routers for the first time.\n\nAdditionally, the router's firmware updating feature indicated that the router's as-shipped firmware (November 2016) was its most current, even though new firmware was available as of July 2017 on Trendnet's website. That's not great for router security and performance, since most people\u2014if they update the router's firmware at all\u2014are much more likely to trust what their routers are telling them than to go to the manufacturer's website to check.\n\nGet the TRENDnet AC2600 MU-MIMO from Amazon for $99.99\n\n6. Netgear Nighthawk R7000P\n\nNetgear Nighthawk R7000P WiFi router (Photo: Amazon)\n\nNetgear's R7000P is an AC2300 router that shares many of the same great attributes as the company's AC2600 R7800 router. For example, both have quality-of-service features that allow you to prioritize bandwidth for different devices in your network, as well as the same readySHARE access to connected USB storage and printers, a super-handy BitTorrent downloader built in, and guest networks\u2014for the three of you that actually run a guest network.\n\nNetgear has boosted the parental controls in the R7000P by integrating Disney's Circle service, which allows you to set access limits by device, filter websites based on your kids' ages and interests, and monitor what websites your kids are looking at and what services they're using. Your kids will hate you, but the comprehensive access limits are a big step above Netgear's standard OpenDNS-based limits (which it also includes).\n\nOn our latency tests, the R7000P delivered the fastest response times on 2.4GHz, but worse latency on 5GHz. On average, around one-fourth of our 5GHz requests took longer than 400ms to complete.\n\nGet the Netgear Nighthawk R7000P from Amazon for $177.93\n\n7. Linksys EA7500 AC1900\n\nLinksys EA7500 WiFi router (Photo: Amazon)\n\nWe were generally impressed by the performance of Linksys' EA7500, even though this $160 AC1900 router costs a bit more than we'd prefer, likely a result of the future-proofing MU-MIMO capabilities Linksys has built into the device.\n\nSetting up the EA7500 was simple, though we found it a bit odd that the EA7500 automatically enables guest networks as part of its initial setup. This isn't a huge security issue, since users still need a password to connect to them, but the onslaught of SSIDs could be confusing for router novices. We love that Linksys quickly asks new users to install firmware updates for the router as part of the setup process, and enabling automatic checks for new firmware is easy within its web-based configuration\u2014though you still have to log into the interface to actually install the update.\n\nLinksys' router comes with a decent number of features, including parental controls, a \"media prioritization\" feature for prioritizing bandwidth among connected devices, and even a built-in network speed test (if your browser has Adobe Flash installed). The EA7500 also works well with Linksys' mobile app, which provides an easy way to view and edit the router's settings.\n\nGet the Linksys EA7500 AC1900 from Amazon for $133.98\n\nHow We Tested\n\nHow We Tested WiFi Routers (Photo: Reviewed / David Murphy)\n\nAbout The Tester\n\nHi! I'm David Murphy. I have tested way, way too many wireless routers in my decade-plus career as a technology journalist. I've spent plenty of hours coming up with great, real-world testing scenarios around my 2,563-square-foot house, and I've either researched or benchmarked almost all of the major routers you can buy nowadays. No joke: I'm pretty sure I've irradiated myself (and/or ruined my neighbors' wireless signals) from my deep love of helping people find the best Wi-Fi router for their needs.\n\nAbout The Tests\n\nWe put our router contenders to the test by approximating a number of real-world scenarios. We set up each router at the same, southernly position in a 2,563-square-foot house. We then set up four testing points: one within the same room as the router; one 44 feet away from the router but within its line of sight; one in an adjoining room (with a wall and some furniture in between); and one 44 feet away from the router with walls and furniture in the way (no line of sight).\n\nWe used each router's settings as shipped, under the assumption that most people do little more than run through a router's default setup utility and call it a day. We tested each routers' wireless networks separately\u20142.4GHz and 5GHz\u2014or just the single SSID for routers that shipped with band steering enabled. We conducted four primary tests for each router at each of our four test locations:\n\nFast.com: We loaded fast.com five times at each test location and averaged each result. We then compared the how a router's speed at each test location compared to the average speed of a desktop system connected directly to the router via Gigabit Ethernet\u2014the fastest and most stable connection a person could have.\n\nLAN Speed Test (Wired): We fired up Lan Speed Test Server on our Gigabit Ethernet-connected desktop PC, and Lan Speed Test on our client MacBook. We then read and wrote 100 packets to the test server, each 1MB in size, to approximate a typical series of file transfers. We recorded the average read and write speeds for each test, and combined them to get a sense of a router's overall performance at our different test locations.\n\nLAN Speed Test (Wireless): We connected a 2017 MacBook Pro (3x3 connectivity) to the same wireless network as our test client, placed it between our first and second wireless testing points (within the router's line of sight), and ran the same LAN Speed Test as before. Since the MacBook Pro can't run LAN Speed Test Server, we opened up a network share and directly targeted a folder on the MacBook Pro from LAN Speed Test on our MacBook Air.\n\nLatency Test: This one gets complicated. We re-enabled Lan Speed Test Server on our desktop PC, still connected to the router via Gigabit Ethernet. We also used a program called Fenix to launch a separate web server on the desktop PC, which we used to host a 128KB PDF file. To begin our test, we fired up a long 1440p YouTube video on our desktop PC. After that, we ran over to our MacBook Air in test position #3\u2014the long-distance, no-line-of-sight location\u2014and began a LAN Speed Test using 1000 packets each 1MB in size.\n\nWe then ran over to our MacBook Pro, now moved to test location #2\u2014long-distance, line-of-sight\u2014and fired up a 4K YouTube video. Finally, we ran to test location #4 and used another 2014 MacBook Air to run NetBurn, a benchmark tool from Ars Technica's Jim Salter. We used this to simulate a typical web browsing session by downloading the 128KB PDF file at random times across a 300-second test. NetBurn tracks the latency of all the requests, and returns the results as averages, medians, and percentiles.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
