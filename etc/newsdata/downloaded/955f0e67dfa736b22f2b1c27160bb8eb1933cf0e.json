A win away from home against fellow promoted side Norwich is a big win, ending a pattern of good performances that failed to deliver the desired results.\n\nMost importantly perhaps, Wesley looks to have gotten underway on the goalscoring front. Replacing Tammy Abraham's output was never going to be simple, but Wesley proved today that he can be a useful talisman (even if he did miss a penalty).\n\nBoth were real poacher's goals. Right place, right time and for Villa, possibly the right man.\n\nNorwich have style in abundance...but do they need more grit?\n\nIt feels like yesterday Carrow Road was rocking after a thrilling 3-2 win that saw Norwich shock the champions.\n\nThe Canaries have been humbled since then. Three defeats on the bounce against Burnley, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa; teams that could well be relegation rivals when the end of season drama ensues.\n\nThis defeat, 1-5 at home to Villa, was particularly concerning. Not even the best attacks can compensate for such abject defending.\n\nDespite the lack of reward, the football has remained attractive. Todd Cantwell, Emiliano Buendia and Teemu Pukki looked unstoppable, but now Norwich are three games without a point and into the relegation zone.\n\nThat's because a by-product of the attacking intent has been a leaky defence, shipping 20 goals in eight games.\n\nTheir defence was one of the main reasons Norwich were tipped by many for the drop. Maybe a young and inexperienced back four needs a proven, senior defender to guide the way.\n\nSilva on his last life?\n\nIf last week's defeat to Man City saw Everton come out with pride in an admirable performance, their defeat at Turf Moor today won't generate the same positivity\n\nThe loss at Turf Moor means seven points now from eight games leaves the Toffees comfortably in the bottom half. Marco Silva is under serious scrutiny once more.\n\nHe has a talented squad at his disposal, and has benefited from substantial financial backing. If Silva doesn't start producing results soon, his days at Goodison Park are numbered.\n\nSheffield United and Burnley the toughest teams to beat?\n\nAside from the big hitters of course, there is a plausible argument that Burnley and Sheffield United are the toughest teams in the league to take a result from.\n\nThere are similarities between the two. Both operate under a disciplined, experienced manager who has graduated from the Football League.\n\nThere's also defensive stability, teams packed with strong physical players and an understanding of their respective limitations.\n\nWith that comes distinguishing features though. Chris Wilder's side, for all their pragmatism, play a brand of football that is perhaps due more acclaim, with technically gifted players from the front line all the way to their overlapping centre halves.\n\nBurnley have stayed true to their largely direct approach, and remain arguably the least enjoyable team to play against.\n\nThey'll both lose more games along the way, but only after the opposition have really worked for it.\n\nWatford fans right to be fearful\n\nSheffield United may have started well this season, and they may have given the European Champions a real game last week.\n\nBut in the context of Watford's season, a home game to a newly-promoted side is arguably one of the most important. The sort of fixture where three points should always be there for the taking.\n\nAnd yet, once again the Hornets have underwhelmed and are now languishing on three points from eight games, no wins and seemingly no inspiration.\n\nThis is baffling when you look at their attacking prowess. Gerard Deulofeu, Roberto Pereyra and Ismaila Sarr should be threatening any team. They may have disappointed so far, but it is surely a formality Watford's forward players soon find their bite.\n\nLike Norwich though, defensive woes have been costly, and that's without an 8-0 defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe back four on paper simply isn't good enough, and is an area that requires serious investment.", "description": "Saturday's action saw great drama.
