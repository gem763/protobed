REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\nThe national unemployment rate held steady, as expected, at 5.7% in August, while wages for permanent employees increased 3.8% year-over-year.\n\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 15,000 jobs. The Canadian dollar strengthened to a one-month high at 1.3179 to the dollar,, or 75.88 cents U.S., after the jobs gain.\n\n\u201cClearly the jobs picture is relatively robust,\u201d said Doug Porter, BMO\u2019s chief economist, when reached by phone.\n\nOf the total number of new jobs, 57,200, or more than two-thirds, were part-time.\n\nStatistics Canada said 20,500 more people were working in educational services in August, largely in Quebec. Finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing were also up, rising by 22,400 in August, while the professional, scientific and technical services sector saw an increase of 16,800 jobs.\n\nThe number of private sector employees increased by 94,300 in August while the number of self-employed workers fell by 11,200.\n\n\u201cA spectacular headline and pretty firm underline details,\u201d said Derek Holt, Scotiabank\u2019s vice president of capital markets economics, adding \u201cat first pass it\u2019s hard to poke holes in it.\u201d\n\nThe latest jobs numbers will likely be welcomed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, who find themselves in a tight race for reelection against Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives.\n\n\u201cGreat news as Canada blows past expectations, creating more than 81,000 new jobs last month!\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau tweeted Friday.\n\n\u201cWith over 1 million new jobs created since 2015, we have a choice to make this election: build on this progress or go back to the Harper years,\u201d he added, referring to former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whom Trudeau defeated in 2015.\n\nScheer and the Conservatives have vowed to focus the pending election campaign on economic concerns, including the cost of living and affordability. Canadians head to the polls on Oct 21.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri said the country is showing a \u201cwelcome degree of resilience,\u201d against negative shocks, in part, because of a strong labor market.\n\nCanada\u2019s central bank, which held interest rates again on Thursday, has not moved since last October, even as some of its counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have eased.\n\n\u201cThe Bank (of Canada) has sent a pretty clear signal that they\u2019re in no rush to cut, this report will reinforce that,\u201d said Porter.", "description": "The Canadian economy gained a larger-than-expected 81,100 net jobs in August, largely driven by increases in part-time work, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday in its last major release of economic statistics before a national election campaign begins.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426917943&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8517D-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
