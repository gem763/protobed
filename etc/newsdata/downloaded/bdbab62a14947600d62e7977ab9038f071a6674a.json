The staffers recommended the whistleblower hire a lawyer and told him to file a whistleblower complaint.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, chair of the committee, was later told about the meeting, but the whistleblower\u2019s identity was not revealed to him.\n\nAt a Wednesday press conference with Finish President Sauli Niinst\u00f6 that took place just hours after the Times published their story, Trump sought to portray the article as proof of what he sees as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d led by Schiff.\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) More\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before. I\u2019d go a step further \u2014 I think he probably helped write it,\u201d Trump said of Schiff. The president\u2019s talking point was quickly echoed by his supporters, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nBREAKING --> Chairman Adam Schiff just got caught orchestrating with the whistleblower before the complaint was ever filed. Democrats have rigged this process from the start.https://t.co/oMdSGByYtf \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 2, 2019\n\nMatthew Rosenberg, one of the authors of the piece in the Times, disputed the president\u2019s characterization of the story.\n\nDespite what Trump claimed today, the @nytimes did NOT report that Adam Schiff helped write the whistleblower's complaint. In fact, Schiff did not even know the whistleblower's identity, officials told the NYT. Read our story here: https://t.co/1Tukg5FxR2 \u2014 Matthew Rosenberg (@AllMattNYT) October 2, 2019\n\nSchiff also disputed that he or his staff had done anything wrong.\n\nWhen a whistleblower seeks guidance, staff advises them to get counsel and go to an IG.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do.\n\n\n\nUnlike a president pressing a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not what a president is supposed to do.\n\n\n\nAnd we all know it. https://t.co/dzVAFGpMen \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) October 2, 2019\n\nThere is no indication that advising a whistleblower to seek legal counsel and file an official complaint is anything but standard practice for members of Congress or their staff, as the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee confirmed Wednesday.\n\nI am told by spokespeople for both @SenatorBurr and @MarkWarner that it would be ***standard practice*** for intel committee to tell a potential whistleblower to hire counsel and file a complaint with an agency IG or the IC IG.\n\n\n\n**Bipartisan. Both parties say this.** \u2014 Olivia Gazis (@Olivia_Gazis) October 2, 2019\n\nBut Trump, who has spent the past week accusing Schiff of treason, among other crimes, for paraphrasing his call to Zelensky on the floor of the House, appeared delighted by the story in the Times \u2014 a publication that at other times, including during the same press conference, he has described as part of the \u201cfake\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d media.\n\n\u201cSchiff, House Intel Chairman, Got Early Account of Whistle-Blower\u2019s Accusations\u201d\n\n\n\nSCHIFF IS A FRAUD! https://t.co/BNXiq5dsXg pic.twitter.com/PHdh8PBTGb \u2014 Donald J.
