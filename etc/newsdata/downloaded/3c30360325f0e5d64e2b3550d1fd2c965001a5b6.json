The basic cause is America\u2019s infatuation with military force. Its political class imagines that force will advance any aim, limiting debate to what that aim should be. Continued gains by the Taliban, 18 years after the United States initially toppled it, suggest a different principle: The profligate deployment of force creates new and unnecessary objectives more than it realizes existing and worthy ones.\n\nIn the Middle East, endless war began when the United States first stationed troops permanently in the region after winning the Persian Gulf war in 1991. A circular logic took hold. The United States created its own dependence on allies that hosted and assisted American forces. It provoked states, terrorists and militias that opposed its presence. Among the results: The United States has bombed Iraq almost every year since 1991 and spent an estimated $6 trillion on post-9/11 wars.\n\nAn even deadlier phase may be dawning. Because the United States pursues armed dominance as a self-evident good, the establishment feels threatened by a rising China and an assertive Russia. \u201cSome of you will join the fight on the Korean Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Mr. Pence told the cadets, noting that \u201can increasingly militarized China challenges our presence in the region.\u201d But China\u2019s rise invalidates primacy\u2019s rationale of deterrence, and shows that other powers have ambitions of their own. Addressing the rise of China responsibly will require abandoning nostalgia for the pre-eminence that America enjoyed during the 1990s.", "description": "", "authors": ["Stephen Wertheim", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Endless-War-America.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
