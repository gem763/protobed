The university asked the writer to give a speech that expanded on the themes of her novel, which she had previously done at Stanford University and Albion College without incident, she said in a statement on Friday.\n\nBut during her lecture and Q&A session on Wednesday, some students reportedly felt that Cap\u00f3 Crucet was \u201cdissing\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d white people, and an exchange became heated.\n\nThe student newspaper, The Georgia-Anne, reported that a white student took to the microphone to accuse Cap\u00f3 Crucet of making \u201cgeneralizations\u201d about white people, and the author responded that white privilege is \u201ca real thing that you are actually benefiting from right now in even asking this question.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer hostile reaction to my work closely mirrored the exchange that I recount in the essay itself. It was very surreal and strange,\u201d Cap\u00f3 Crucet wrote in Friday\u2019s statement. \u201cI answered the question with the same response that I cite in the essay, and mentioned out loud that this moment felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d\n\nWhen the talk concluded, a group of students reportedly gathered and burned Cap\u00f3 Crucet\u2019s novel, while others showed up at her hotel and tagged her in social-media photos of ripped-apart copies of the book.\n\n\u201cDuring the event, and afterward during the book signing, many students remarked on how much the story of the novel\u2019s protagonist mirrored their own, and expressed gratitude for the book\u2014both to me for writing it, and to GSU for selecting it,\u201d Cap\u00f3 Crucet wrote. \u201cTo think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story\u2014effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space\u2014feels devastating.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s department of writing and linguistics said in a statement that it was \u201cdismayed and disappointed\u201d by the night\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cWe assert that destructive and threatening acts do not reflect the values of Georgia Southern University,\u201d said Russell Willerton, department chairman.\n\nCap\u00f3 Crucet said she was moved to a different hotel in another town, but she wasn\u2019t aware of the reasoning\u2014that a group of apparently angry students had gathered outside\u2014until she read Willerton\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThis book began as an act of love and an attempt at deeper understanding,\u201d wrote Cap\u00f3 Crucet. \u201cI hope GSU can act from the same place and work to affirm the humanity of those students who might understandably feel unsafe in the aftermath of the event and the book burning, and that the campus continues the difficult and necessary conversation that began in that auditorium.\u201d", "description": "A group of students burned Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet\u2019s book after she gave an on-campus speech that expanded on the themes of diversity and privilege in her novel.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_378,w_673,x_0,y_85/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570823678/Screen_Shot_2019-10-11_at_3.54.41_PM_fli3b8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
