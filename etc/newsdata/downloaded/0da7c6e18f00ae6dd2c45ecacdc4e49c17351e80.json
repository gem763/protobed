We needed two full-backs who were 100 percent fit.\n\n\"It is no laughing matter to send home Thomas Ramos because he is our full-back and one of our kickers, one of the two or three best in France.\n\n\"It was my decision. I don't know if others would have acted differently but it is on me.\"\n\nFrance have also lost Wesley Fofana, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka to injury.", "description": "France coach Jacques Brunel says it was his decision to send Thomas Ramos home due to injury earlier this month  even though he was fit enough to play for his club Toulouse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2856/15fb9106321947d994ab137209d706e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
