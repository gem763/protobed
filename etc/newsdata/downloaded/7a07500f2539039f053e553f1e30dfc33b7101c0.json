There they face exploitation at the hands of militia groups, which run the centres in all but name.\n\nThe former staff member described a chaotic infrastructure at UNHCR, where he worked for several years, with asylum seekers registered under incorrect nationalities and others forced to wait for months to hear the status of their applications.\n\nMeanwhile, questions about UNHCR in Libya have stretched to procurement. An internal audit found that the agency had purchased laptop computers at inflated prices (eight laptops for just under $50,000) and used two travel agents to purchase almost $200,000 worth of flight tickets. The audit also notes that \u201cno competitive bidding was conducted for the travel services\u201d (sect. D of OIOS report 2019/007).\n\nMedical care\n\nEuronews has spoken to dozens of asylum seekers on the ground in Libya, including a man suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Asyas, 30, was discharged from the hospital by a UN medical partner, the International Medical Corps (IMC), and was now living in a private home in Tripoli.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just waiting to die,\u201d he told us.\n\nAsyas, 30 years old, was hospitalised in Alriyada in Tripoli between 4 and 16 July. He\u2019s now left alone in a house in Gargareshm Tripoli suffering from acute Tubercolosis. He\u2019s not able to move: \"I'm just waiting to die\"\n\nA medical source in Tripoli said that the hospitalisation of migrants and refugees - especially those cases with tuberculosis - is expensive, and some public hospitals lack the equipment to correctly diagnose the cases.\n\nAs a result, NGOs have to find a balance between paying very high bills to private hospitals or discharging patients too early, the source concludes.\n\nThe IMC told Euronews it cannot comment on the case.\n\nThe feeling on the streets is one of abandonment by international institutions. Asylum seekers in urban areas believe that the UN agency will be there to help them find accommodation for example but the UNHCR are not obligated to do so.\n\nIn one case, a group of Sudanese refugees \u2013 including expectant mothers and newborn babies - have been living for several months in an abandoned warehouse in an area of Tripoli known as al-Riyadiya.\n\nThe group were since evicted from the warehouse and are now sleeping in front the UNHCR community day centre, waiting to be moved to safer housing.\n\nTwo months ago, a displaced refugee family in the Libyan capital found shelter in an abandoned warehouse in the area of al-Riyadiya, 400 meters from the UNHCR Community Day Center in Gurji, Tripoli. They feel unsafe, especially at night.

Asylum seekers detained in Libya are held at the centres, where they are often subject to abuse and violence.\n\nThe conditions at detention centres has got so bad that the UNHCR prioritise the processing of refugees and migrants that are held in them - as they are considered among the most vulnerable. This has led to asylum seekers actually bribing their way into centres, sources say.\n\nIn December, migrants and refugees detained in Khoms Suq al-Khamis started a hunger strike to persuade UNHCR to visit the centre and register them in the hope that this might stop them from being sold and disappeared.\n\nMuona, quickly dismissed from the hospital with her newborn baby: \"I don\u2019t have any support for my baby. Nothing at all from UNHCR\"\n\nAmina, a Somali refugee now in Triq al-Sikka facility in Tripoli confirmed to Euronews that she paid money to be \u201caccepted into detention and have a better chance to be registered and evacuated\".\n\nThe former UN staff member detailed one case where he claims a pregnant rape victim had opted to return to a detention centre in order to be considered for evacuation.\n\nAt the Abu Salim detention centre, Eritrean refugees have been begging the detention centre manager to admit them, with the sole hope of being evacuated.\n\nOthers are paying to get themselves in to the UNHCR's Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF) - managed by the Libyan Ministry of Interior, UNHCR and UNHCR\u2019s partner LibAid - in Tripoli, where refugees are normally hosted until their transfer to another state is confirmed.\n\nUNHCR's Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF) in Tripoli, in front of the Triq al Sika detention centre - Photo: Sara Creta\n\nThere, one refugee awaiting evacuation told Euronews: \u201cThe guards who are working at the gate, brought inside Somalian and Eritrean women; they paid 2000 dinars (around 430\u20ac) each. We told this to UNHCR, and they asked us not to tell anyone\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the allegations, Yaxley said: \u201cUNHCR takes any claims of misconduct very seriously. Any claim that is found to be valid following an investigation is followed by a zero tolerance approach. We strongly encourage any victims to directly contact our Inspector General\u2019s Office.\u201d.\n\nLack of information\n\nAside from bribery, the former employee said that the fate of individual asylum seekers and their families in Libya largely relies on luck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the office,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of 2019, the UNHCR registered a woman from Ivory Coast (which is not among the 9 nationalities that are prioritised according to Cochetel), only because there was a recommendation letter from a higher rank.\n\n\u201cSometimes you may wait months to register a case because no one will give you approval; there are cases of favouritism and a lazy attitude. All registration processes are unclear.\u201d\n\nMany refugees and asylum seekers in Tripoli complained to Euronews about the lack of information available to them about their personal case. The former employee said that this is part of a strategy at the agency in order to avoid having to deal with the huge amount of admin involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a general attitude not to answer refugees and keep them blind to avoid more requests. In Tripoli, refugees or asylum seekers are left without a clue. They don\u2019t know if they are accepted or rejected.\n\n\u201cThey receive very little information about their file and most of the time, no proper update about the process, or in case they have to appeal if their request has been rejected.\u201d\n\nThe source said that since September 2017 there is no system in place to appeal against rejection on their refugee status, and asylum seekers don\u2019t know they have the right to appeal the decision within 30 days.\n\nOne family from Nigeria, now detained in Az-Z\u0101wiyah detention centre, described their experience.\n\n\u201cThe first time we managed to meet UNHCR was secretly in Tarik Al Matar centre in July 2018. Since that time UNHCR is refusing to register us. When we try to ask about our cases they kept telling us later, next time, next time,\u201d the father said.\n\n\u201cSometimes they avoid us totally. Once, UNHCR has even advised us to return home. My youngest girl has been born in detention and the eldest have some traumatic effects due to a whole lot of horrible stuff they've experienced.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the situation in Libya is only likely to get worse, with a bottleneck in some states like Niger slowing down the evacuation plan from Libya.\n\nThere are currently 1,174 evacuees from Libya staying in Niger, including 192 evacuated unaccompanied children, according to UNHCR. With the Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) at full capacity, many cases are still pending a decision.\n\n\"The Government of Niger has generously offered additional space for up to 1,500 refugees in the Emergency Transit Mechanism run by UNHCR in Niamey with financial support from the European Union,\" writes Cochetel in May 2018.\n\nKhoms - Photo: Sara Creta\n\nMistakes\n\nTo make the situation worse, according to the former employee, many mistakes have been made including nationalities wrongly assigned to individuals.\n\n\u201cUNHCR was registering Chadians as Sudanese, or Ethiopians as Eritreans. The UNHCR staff in Libya was not qualified to properly understand the situation,\u201d the source said.\n\nCommenting on that claim, Yaxley said: \u201cUNHCR staff are selected through the same processes as in all other operations worldwide, following human resources rules. There are over 100 national staff working in Libya. UNHCR does not work with external contractors.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned concentration on nine specified nationalities was put in place in order to keep numbers down, the former staff member said.\n\nLibya\u2019s Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior for Migration, Mohammed Al-Shibani, said that on the contrary the Libyan government is not refusing to register other nationalities. \u201cThe nationalities are determined by the UN not by us,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed Al-Shibani. Photo: Sara Creta\n\nProcurement\n\nOn issues with procurement, the former staff member points Euronews at the internal UN audit of the operations in Libya, which found that UNHCR designated procurements to 12 partners worth $4.7 million and $4.0 million in 2017 and 2018 respectively.\n\nBut the mission \u201cdid not conduct any cost-benefit analysis\u201d, opting instead for direct procurement \u201cdespite the significant differences between official and market exchange rates.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, \u201cthe mission designated procurement exceeding $100,000 to three partners without them being pre-qualified by the Procurement Service at headquarters\u201d. A lack of procurement plans resulted in ''unnecessary and higher\u201d costs.\n\nFor example, the audit found a transaction for eight laptops with total expenditure of $47,067 (equivalent to a unit cost per laptop of $5,883). Moreover, flight tickets amounting to $128,000 and $66,000 during 2017 and 2018 were bought from two different travel agencies without any clear process for selection, as mentioned in the audit and confirmed by a former UN source.\n\n\"The mission was unable to demonstrate it used its resources effectively and efficiently in providing for the essential needs of persons of concern. The lack of reporting also increased UNHCR's reputational risk\", reads the audit.", "description": "Euronews has been able to speak under the condition of anonymity with a former Libyan UNHCR staffer who has been working in Tripoli.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/14/26/26/1000x563_cmsv2_594a03d4-47a1-5b38-a561-72ea8b82dc26-4142626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
