No doubt Dak\u2019s agents will present the following statistic: he\u2019s the best QB in the entire NFL in 2019 when passing under pressure.\n\nDak Prescott Is Scrambling With the Best in the NFL\n\nThis \u201ccompletions under pressure\u201d statistic does not refer to how well a player is performing in close games. Instead, it shows how Dak Prescott performs when pass-protection breaks down and he is forced to scramble to make a play. When you consider that the Dallas Cowboys may have one of the best offensive lines in the whole NFL, it makes the achievement all the more impressive. Prescott is not scrambling as much as some of his competitors and thus must be more clinical to achieve his 71% success rate.\n\nIf you consider how well Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady have been playing this season, the fact that Dak can top them in any category is highly impressive. If the Cowboys were wondering whether or not to pay their starter, this statistic is proof that the fourth-round pick could still put up meaningful numbers if he weren\u2019t behind a superb offensive line.\n\nDallas Cowboys\u2019 Owner Compares Prescott to Tom Brady\n\nDallas Cowboys owner, president, and general manager Jerry Jones spoke on 105.3 The Fan and was full of praise for Prescott as he likened him to Tom Brady:\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more like [Tom] Brady. Now, I\u2019m not going to. . . .We know Tom Brady, and he\u2019s no Tom Brady. I didn\u2019t say that. But the point is he will evolve and is evolving into a guy that will beat you. He will beat you with different circumstances and different players and different type teams. He will be on teams that have better defense than others. He will be on teams that have better protection than others. I think we got us one in Dak.\u201d\n\nAlways with one eye on the negotiating table, Jones clearly didn\u2019t want to give too much ammunition to Dak\u2019s agents by heaping him with too much praise. Statistically, Prescott\u2019s NFL completion percentage is comparable to Brady\u2019s if you compare their first two years of play. Tom Brady was also a late-round draft pick, so the comparison does make sense, but Dallas\u2019 QB has a lot further to go if the comparison isn\u2019t going to end there.\n\nAverage Yards Per Pass Stats Prove Cowboys QB Killing It\n\nTake a look at Prescott\u2019s passing statistics and it\u2019s clear he isn\u2019t only making short passes, as he is tied second in average yards per pass in the NFL this year. Russell Wilson is also at 9.0, behind only Patrick Mahomes with 9.7 yards per pass. This makes the pass completions under pressure statistic all the more impressive and should silence those who claim he only dumps it off to Ezekiel Elliot.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dak-prescott.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
