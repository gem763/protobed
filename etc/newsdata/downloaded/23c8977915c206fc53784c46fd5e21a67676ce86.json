So it's really exciting. It's happening. It's here now.\u201d\n\nThe Hyperloop system is a futuristic mode of transportation that would put passengers in pods that would magnetically levitate and travel through vacuum tubes across states, or even countries.\n\nThe mode of transportation would move \u201c670 miles an hour,\u201d Walder said. \u201cBut it's going to be really smooth. You could literally hold a cup of coffee if you're if you're doing it.\u201d\n\nThe XP-1 pod in Nevada. (Photo: Virgin Hyperloop One). More\n\nThe Hyperloop race\n\nInterest in the concept was first sparked by a whitepaper published by Tesla and SpaceX Founder Elon Musk in 2013. The promise was simple: to build a safe, fast, cheap, efficient mode of transport that was resistant to weather events or natural disasters.\n\nAside from Virgin Hyperloop One, Hyperloop Technologies is also in the race to build the world\u2019s first mass transit Hyperloop.\n\nAnd Virgin Hyperloop One is clearly ahead. Aside from the first actual track that\u2019s going to be built in India next year, the company has already built a test track in Nevada, near Las Vegas. The pod that was used in that test, XP-1, was on display in New York this week (pictured above).\n\nHyperloop versus maglev system\n\nWhile the Hyperloop is at least a year out from being fully operational, other countries have made much more progress in developing similar systems.\n\nIn China, the Shanghai Maglev has been fully operational since 2004, shuttling between Pudong Airport to the outskirts of the city. The country has also built the body prototype for a high-speed maglev in May this year, and is expecting it to go into commercial production in 2021. Japan is also developing its own maglev trains, parts of which are ready for commercial operation, and the system is expected to link Tokyo and Nagoya by 2027.\n\nA maglev train drives into a terminal station in Shanghai March 14, 2006.
