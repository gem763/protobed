The 31-year-old was benched in last week\u2019s loss against the Giants, with Gruden citing Keenum\u2019s injury as a factor.\n\nThis week, Keenum missed practice Wednesday and was seen in a walking boot. He returned the following two days as a limited participant.\n\nElsewhere, the Redskins will be getting one of their top weapons back Sunday.\n\nRookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin is active after missing the Giants game with a hamstring injury. On Friday, Gruden pegged McLaurin\u2019s odds of playing at \u201c50-50,\u201d but the 24-year-old looked good enough in warm-ups to play.\n\nMcLaurin told reporters on Thursday that his issue was not being able to fully stop on a dime.\n\nBesides Keenum, tight ends Jordan Reed (concussion) and Vernon Davis (concussion), linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring), cornerback Aaron Colvin, center Ross Pierschbacher and right guard Brandon Scherff (ankle) are out for the Redskins.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
