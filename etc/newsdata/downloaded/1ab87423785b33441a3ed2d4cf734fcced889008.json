EDT\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, thank you very much. It\u2019s a great honor to have the President of Italy with us. He is a man of great distinction. He\u2019s highly respected in this country. And it\u2019s nice to have you at the White House. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a great relationship with Italy for a long time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been closer than it is now. We have won a $7.5 billion award from, as you know \u2014 I guess it\u2019s been pretty big news. And I know that this is against the European Union and World Trade \u2014 good ole World Trade. For a long time, they\u2019ve been taking advantage of the United States. And I know Turkey is going to talk to us about their share of it because they feel they shouldn\u2019t have to pay so much.\n\nAnd if you look at what\u2019s going on, Italy is complaining about it. Turkey is com- \u2014 everybody is complaining about it. Turkey is complaining about a lot of things, and we\u2019re handling Turkey very nicely. But we have many countries complaining about the different awards that we\u2019ve been winning lately from the courts. And the reason we\u2019re winning is we\u2019re properly represented.\n\nWe\u2019re winning, in the case of the European Union, $7.5 billion. And Italy has a percentage of that to pay. And, in the \u2014 in other cases, we\u2019ve won. And we have a lot of money coming into the United States for the first time ever. Tremendous amounts of money in many different forms, including tariffs.\n\nOur farmers now have been taken care of well. China has already started their purchases. There was some misreporting, which does not \u2014 frankly, I\u2019m not at all surprised \u2014 but there\u2019s been some misreporting that China will start purchasing when the deal is signed.\n\nThe deal is being papered right now. Bob Lighthizer is with us. Mike Pompeo is with us. And they\u2019re going to be joining us for the discussion.\n\nBut there have been some reports that China is not buying until the deal is signed. No, China has started buying already from the farmers. It\u2019ll be anywhere from $40 [billion] to $50 billion, which is far more than anybody thought or expected. It\u2019s a great deal for the farmers. I think the farmers will come out \u2014 along with many other industries in the United States \u2014 will come out as one of the big beneficiaries of the trade deal with China.\n\nBut they have already started purchasing; in fact, they started purchasing three weeks ago. You can see the numbers for yourself. It\u2019s great for our country. It\u2019s great for \u2014 I think it\u2019s great for China, too. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s already taken effect, even though the deal won\u2019t be signed probably until I meet with President Xi in Chile, where we have a summit. So that\u2019ll be good.\n\nBut the World Trade \u2014 as you know, we won $7.5 billion, and that is being distributed among various countries in the European Union. Italy is one of those countries. And I know that the President of Italy wants to discuss that, and it\u2019s one of the discussions.\n\nAnd the other thing, of course, is trade and numerous elements of the military, and terrorism, and security. So, we\u2019ll be discussing everything.\n\nPlease.\n\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\n\nAnd I\u2019m pleased to report that in Syria, Turkey \u2014 the border \u2014 we only had 28 soldiers, not 50. We thought it was 50. Somebody reported 50. It was actually down to 28. They were removed a while ago. All American soldiers are away from the site.\n\nSyria and Turkey may fight. Syria is friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well protected; plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels, but they were with us. They are no angels. But they are fighting. We are largely out of that area. We\u2019re very well set. We have quite a contingent, right nearby, of soldiers and of the finest equipment in the world. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to use it.\n\nSo, Syria is either negotiating with or talking to Turkey. We\u2019re also talking to Turkey. We\u2019ve put massive sanctions on Turkey. Sanctions work, frankly, better than fighting. Certainly when you\u2019re down to 28 people, we\u2019re not going to be fighting. We didn\u2019t want to fight anyway. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to, from the United States\u2019 standpoint.\n\nNow, as to Syria wanting to take back their land, that\u2019s a whole different story. If Syria wants to fight for their land, that\u2019s up to Turkey and Syria, as it has been for hundreds of years, they\u2019ve been fighting. And the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years \u2014 that whole mess. It\u2019s been going along for a long time.\n\nSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\n\nBut we were supposed to be there for 30 days; we stayed for 10 years. And it\u2019s time for us to come home. We\u2019re not a policing agent, and it\u2019s time for us to come home.\n\nBut we\u2019re working with Turkey. We\u2019re working with talking to everybody in the area \u2014 whatever we can to do keep it stable or stabilize it as much as possible, knowing that it\u2019s possibly never going to be very stable.\n\nAnd we are \u2014 I think we\u2019re in a very good position in the Middle East. I think we\u2019re very, very strong in the Middle East. Iran is going to hell; their economy is in deep trouble. Their GDP went down 20 percent, which nobody ever even heard of before. Probably 25 percent.\n\nWe\u2019ll be talking to Iran also. They want very much to talk. The sanctions with Iran \u2014 all of the things that we\u2019ve done, including some tariffs and different things having to do with countries that are dealing with them that we put on \u2014 all of the economic sanctions are working very well.\n\nSo, Iran will be an interesting case, but we\u2019ll see. They want to talk. We\u2019ll see whether or not they talk. If they talk, good. And if they don\u2019t talk, that\u2019s okay, too. But I think we\u2019re doing a very good job in the sense of, strategically, we have Syria talking about their land. It\u2019s not our land. Turkey has gone on to Syria. And, if Turkey goes into Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria; it\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like us to \u2014 would like you to believe.\n\nAnd I watched, last night \u2014 a couple of people understood. Actually, a couple of the Democrats \u2014 I won\u2019t say which ones \u2014 but a couple of the more competent Democrats actually understood what I was doing and what the plan is.\n\nBut, really, the plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing agents all over the world. If you look at other countries \u2014 Russia, China \u2014 they don\u2019t have countries to take care of. We have \u2014 we\u2019re close to 90 countries, in one form or another. We\u2019re in 90 countries all over the world, policing and \u2014 frankly, many of those countries, they don\u2019t respect what we\u2019re doing, they don\u2019t even like what we\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t like us.\n\nSo, we\u2019re looking all over the world. There\u2019s tremendous amounts of money, manpower, lives that we save by doing it much differently. If people aren\u2019t respecting what we\u2019re going to be doing, that\u2019s too bad.\n\nYou read where we\u2019re sending some troops to Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s true. Because we want to help Saudi Arabia. They have been a very good ally. They\u2019ve agreed to pay for the cost of those troops. They\u2019ve agreed to pay fully for the cost of everything we\u2019re doing over there. That\u2019s something you have never heard before, I think, as long as you\u2019ve been standing out there. I think you \u2014 the media has never heard that before.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia has graciously agreed to pay for the full cost of everything we\u2019re doing for them. We\u2019re sending some tremendous missiles over. We\u2019re sending some great power over to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is paying for 100 percent of the cost, including the cost of our soldiers. And that negotiation took a very short time \u2014 like, maybe, about 35 seconds.\n\nAnd I would like now to introduce the President of Italy to say a few words. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to have many questions for him.\n\nThank you.\n\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA: (As interpreted.) Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for your kind invitation and for a very warm welcome to the White House. Thank you for the very interesting remarks you just made. I\u2019m sure we will be discussing all of these issues during our talks later on in a full spirit of loyalty and cooperation, which is what friends and allies have to do.\n\nItaly and the U.S. share a set of values, a set of cultures. Our bond is fostered by our human relations. And I\u2019m very pleased to be here in this moment in time as we celebrate the Italian-American Heritage Month.\n\nAnd again, I\u2019m very happy to be here to meet with you, Mr. President. It\u2019s a pleasure to see you again after we met at the G20 Summit in Taormina, Sicily. Our meeting, again, is proof of the friendship between our countries, as also testified by our common belonging to the Atlantic Alliance and, of course, by the human bonds that our countries share and by the long friendship and alliance that we have.\n\nAnd as you may remember, Mr. President, when we met in the summit in Taormina, the weather was wonderful. It was also beautiful here yesterday, as well. And, of course, the fact that we can meet in different places around the world testifies to how solid our bonds are.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think the bonds between Italy and the United States have never been more solid. I have so many Italian friends. I can\u2019t tell you how many Italian friends. And we have a lot also in your government. We have a lot of great friends in your government.\n\nI think the WTO award has been testament to a lot of good work by the Trump administration. We never won with the WTO, or essentially never won. Very seldom did we win. And now we\u2019re winning a lot. We\u2019re winning a lot because they know if we\u2019re not treated fairly, we\u2019re leaving. Because we were a piggybank that every other country was robbing. And China became rich because of the WTO. That\u2019s when China really ascended. That\u2019s when China went up. That\u2019s when they made their great rise. They were flat lining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story.\n\nAnd China was taking $500 billion a year out of the United States, plus intellectual property theft and many other things. And it was \u2014 I give China a lot of credit. I give the people that ran our country no credit. I give them discredit for what they allowed to happen.\n\nBut the WTO \u2014 that\u2019s the World Trade Organization \u2014 has been very unfair to the United States. They know I feel that way, and I think since they know I feel that way, all of a sudden, we\u2019re starting to win very big awards.\n\nThe $7.5 billion that we won is going to be discussed. The percentage \u2014 a percentage of that is to be paid by Italy. And Italy thinks that we\u2019re charging them too much, and we will certainly take that under consideration. And we will discuss that today.\n\nWe\u2019re also discussing some very big trade deals. Actually, Italy is a very major trade partner with us. We do a lot of trade together. And they make incredible product. We buy and they buy. And we have a very good relationship \u2014 sometimes stymied by the European Union, which is, frankly, very tough to deal with and very tough negotiators, very unfair negotiators. They know I feel that way. And we\u2019ll see what happens, ultimately, with the European Union. But they have been very unfair to the United States. Italy, on the other hand, they\u2019ve been a great partner.\n\nPlease.\n\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\n\nQ Are you okay \u2014 are you okay with Erdo\u011fan saying that he is not going to do a ceasefire?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: He didn\u2019t say that at all. He\u2019s meeting. And he\u2019s meeting today with some of our representatives. Mike Pence is leaving today, as you know. We needed to take an extra day for security reasons. But Mike is leaving. Mike Pompeo will be meeting also, who is here right now with us. And he is going to be joining the meeting. We have a lot of great people over there. We\u2019ll see.\n\nIn the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way \u2014 as they shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us.\n\nAnd the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight. And, as I said, they\u2019re not angels. They\u2019re not angels, if you take a look. You have to go back and take a look. But they fought with us. We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us, and that\u2019s okay. They did well when they fought with us; they didn\u2019t do so well when they didn\u2019t fight with us.\n\nWhen I refused to allow the Americans, a year and a half ago, to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, I said, \u201cWait a minute, this country, stupidly, just spent a fortune on fighting for, with, around Iraq.\u201d Nobody knows how they spent it. But they spent \u2014 actually, we\u2019re in the Middle East now for $8 trillion, if you can believe that stupidity. But, in Iraq, we\u2019re in for probably $5.5 trillion. So they\u2019re telling me, \u201cWait a minute, we just spent $5.5 trillion fighting in Iraq and with Iraq. And now we\u2019re supposed to spend money to fight with the Kurds against Iraq.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\nSo what happens is, when I said we\u2019re not going to fight with the Kurds, the Kurds left. They didn\u2019t want to fight against Iraq, which right now isn\u2019t the greatest fighting force in the world. That happened twice. The Kurds, actually, are pulling back substantially from Turkey. And Syria is pulling in. Syria probably will have a partner of Russia \u2014 whoever they may have. I wish them all a lot of luck. You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan. Used to be called the Soviet Union. Now it\u2019s called Russia for a reason, because they lost so much money in Afghanistan, that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing.\n\nSo, if Russia wants to get involved with the \u2014 with Syria, that\u2019s really up to them. They have a problem with Turkey, they have a problem at a border. It\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\n\nBut again, we only had 28 soldiers. It was 26, 28. I got all different numbers. It ends up being 28 \u2014 between the 26, 28. Two people, and they\u2019re fully accounted for.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the story. It\u2019s very simple. And we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re negotiating, and we\u2019re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, because we\u2019d like to stop wars regardless. Whether Americans are in or whether they\u2019re not in, we want to see wars stopped. That\u2019s a very important thing. On a humanitarian basis, we want to see that happen.\n\nSteve?\n\nQ How confident are you that Mike Pence will be able to arrange a ceasefire?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you go and dictate?\n\nINTERPRETER: Yes.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, please.\n\nINTERPRETER: The answer was \u2014\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019ll let you go.\n\nINTERPRETER: \u2014 \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Excuse me. (Laughs.)\n\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA: (Speaks Italian.)\n\nINTERPRETER: (Continues translation in Italian.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: So I view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe. They\u2019ve got to work it out. Maybe they can do it without fighting. Syria is protecting the Kurds. That\u2019s good.\n\nWe are \u2014 and, by the way, every player hates ISIS. Everybody we\u2019re talking about. Syria more than us. Russia more than us. They\u2019ve done a big number on Russia. And we\u2019re over there fighting ISIS, but they\u2019re over there fighting ISIS, too. They can handle it, and they should handle it. We can fight our own battles on our own territories.\n\nBut you have a lot of countries over there that hate ISIS as much as we do; in some cases, probably more. So they can take care of ISIS. We have them captured. The United States captured them. Some were released just for effect \u2014 to make us look a little bit like, \u201cOh, gee, we\u2019ve got to get right back in there.\u201d But you have a lot of countries over there that have power and that hate ISIS very much, as much as we do.\n\nSo I think we\u2019re in a very strategically good position. I know the fake news doesn\u2019t make it look that way, but we have \u2014 we\u2019ve removed all of our, as we said, 50 soldiers, but much less than 50 soldiers. They\u2019re now in a very \u2014 very safe location, heading into an even safer location.\n\nAnd we will help negotiate. We have tremendously powerful sanctions. Our country has become economically much more powerful than, frankly, it ever was. We\u2019ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in worth. The market was up big yesterday. It\u2019s going to be up big today, it looks like. The trade deal with China, just having to do with what we\u2019ve done with the financial services, with banks, with the farmers, has been incredible \u2014 far greater than anyone ever thought.\n\nI agree, it hasn\u2019t been papered yet, but it\u2019s being papered. But, in the meantime, as you know and as we\u2019ve said many times, China has already started buying. They want to buy. They want to make a deal. They really have to make a deal. Their economy has been hurt very badly by what we\u2019ve done and by the tariffs that we\u2019ve charged.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve taken in tremendous amounts of tariffs. A small portion of them we\u2019ve given to the farmer, which \u2014 the farmers \u2014 which has more than made up for what they\u2019ve lost.\n\nGo ahead.\n\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\n\nAnd because of the newfound economic power of the United States, because of the fact that we\u2019ve made so many trillions \u2014 many, many trillions of dollars in worth of the United States \u2014 I call it the \u201cnewfound economic power\u201d \u2014 if my opponent would\u2019ve won, China would right now be the most powerful nation, economically, in the world. And, right now, they\u2019re not even close. And if we\u2019re smart, they never will get close. But it depends on who sits in this chair.\n\nBut the United States has tremendous economic power. Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border. I mean, you have a few soldiers back and forth, killing each other at the border. The power we have with sanctions and tariffs is far greater than what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nWith that being said, our military has been completely rebuilt. Much of the equipment has already been delivered. We spent two and a half trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years. And our military power is at the highest level, and our economic power is at the highest level. But I\u2019d always rather use economic power before I use military power, because people aren\u2019t getting killed with economic power. Okay?\n\nQ Mr. President, you\u2019re scheduled to see House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today. How do you expect that meeting to go?\n\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA: (As interpreted.) Before the members of the press introduce topics that have already been discussed this morning, President Trump was talking about the possible implementation of tariffs on European products following the whole Airbus affair. Of course, that\u2019s a topic that we will certainly be discussing this morning, and I do hope that we can come up with a cooperative-based approach and a frank discussion, so we can avoid retaliation between the two parties.\n\nItaly and I \u2014 myself, personally \u2014 have always felt that it\u2019s better to talk things through to find a common solution, to find some sort of understanding for one another\u2019s stances. Because the alternative to that would be tariffs followed by retaliation, followed by further tariffs. And we also have to understand that we are waiting for a solution of the Boeing affair, as well.\n\nSo, of course, within the spirit of the Atlantic Alliance, within the spirit of the friendship we\u2019ve always had, I do feel it would be best to discuss these things and understand one another.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, in theory, there can\u2019t be retaliation because this was an award that we got because of the fact that the European Union took advantage of past Presidents, and this was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union. So there should be no retaliation.\n\nThis was getting us even because $7.5 billion worth of things happened \u2014 bad things happened, unfair things happened \u2014 to the United States by the European Union. So this was just getting us back to even. And nobody else but me would\u2019ve gotten that $7.5 billion back for the taxpayers of the United States.\n\nQ Mr. President, I\u2019m sure you saw reports that John Bolton said that Rudy Giuliani was like a \u201chand grenade\u201d the way he was acting. And are you concerned that Bolton could be called to testify in your impeachment inquiry?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Look, John Bolton \u2014 I got along well with him. Some people didn\u2019t; some people didn\u2019t like John Bolton. I actually got along with him pretty well. It just didn\u2019t work out. I don\u2019t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani.\n\nRudy Giuliani was seeking out corruption, and what happens mostly in the 2016 election, because there was tremendous corruption in the 2016 election. I think even you would admit that. The election was \u2014 it was disgraceful what happened, and what happened to me, and what happened to the Republicans. And that continues with Nancy Pelosi and with Schiff. Adam Schiff got caught making up statements that he said I said, that I didn\u2019t say \u2014 which is fraud. I mean, it\u2019s purely fraudulent. So it continues.\n\nSo, Rudy was a great prosecutor. He was the best mayor in the history of the city of New York, as far as I can see. I think he\u2019s pretty much acknowledged \u2014 what he did for crime and everything else. And when he saw what was going on with our election of 2016 \u2014 the election I won, but the election that was absolutely corrupted by things that took place in government. Now, we\u2019ll see what happens. The IG report is going to come out soon, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nI think people \u2014 I know nothing about it, in terms of the report. I\u2019m waiting for the report like everybody else. But I predict you will see things that you don\u2019t even believe, the level of corruption \u2014 whether it\u2019s Comey; whether it\u2019s Strzok and his lover, Page; whether it\u2019s so many other people \u2014 McCabe; whether it\u2019s President Obama himself. Let\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s President Obama. Let\u2019s see whether or not they put that in.\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Wait a minute. Let\u2019s see whether or not.\n\nSo, Rudy saw that. And I can tell you, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 because was very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw, as are many people, okay? And many Republicans. And the Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats. I\u2019ll say this: Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena. I don\u2019t say right or wrong. He wouldn\u2019t do it. He had too much respect for our country. Nancy Pelosi hands them out like cookies. Everybody \u2014 I don\u2019t even know these people. And for the most part, people like that are test- \u2014 I don\u2019t even know who they are. I never even heard of some of them, most of them.\n\nBut I have all these people testifying. And then they leak out. They don\u2019t say the goods parts; they only say the bad parts. We\u2019re not allowed to representation. We\u2019re not allowed to lawyers. We\u2019re not allowed to have anything. The Democrats are treating the Republicans very, very badly. Fortunately, we have a lot of good, strong, smart Republicans. But they never dealt, Jon, with the Democrats the way the Democrats deal. And the Republicans won\u2019t forget it because what they\u2019re doing, what the Democrats are doing to this nation is a disgrace.\n\nWhat they have done \u2014 the disrespect that they\u2019ve shown to the presidency \u2014 and it\u2019ll happen to them. Because if the Republicans have the House, which I think they will \u2014 because of impeachment, I think \u2014 because of this nonsense impeachment. It\u2019s based on a perfect phone conversation \u2014 an absolutely perfect phone conversation with the President of Ukraine.\n\nA friend of mine, who\u2019s a top lawyer, read it. He said, \u201cThis is perfect. You didn\u2019t say\u2026\u201d Did you know this was going to happen? I actually thought it was going to happen. There were many people listening to that conversation, because when I speak to a leader \u2014 like, if I speak to the President of Italy, if I speak to anybody \u2014 I know that there are many intelligence people on the line. I know that, I mean, with my understanding and knowledge. I don\u2019t know exactly who, but I assume there are many people.\n\nFortunately, they had transcribers, stenographers \u2014 people that do this for a living \u2014 on the line because we have an exact copy of the report, of the call.\n\nSo the call was put out immediately when I started hearing about the whistleblower. Well, the whistleblower\u2019s report was totally wrong. The whistleblower didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or it was even worse than that. Now, all of a sudden, Schiff doesn\u2019t want to talk to the whistleblower. Now, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn\u2019t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo.\n\nSo, with Rudy, Rudy was seeking out corruption. And I think there\u2019s nothing wrong seeking out corruption.\n\nDid you have \u2014 Steve?\n\nQ But should Rudy have registered as a foreign lobbyist, though? That\u2019s the question here.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don\u2019t know what he did. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s up to him.\n\nQ He had clients and he was talking to you.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: That, you have to ask \u2014 excuse me, no. You have to ask Rudy those questions. Don\u2019t ask me. But Rudy was one of many people that was incensed at the corruption that took place during that election. Pure corruption.\n\nFor instance, I still ask the FBI: Where is the server? How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC? Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on the server. So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I\u2019d like to see the server. I think it\u2019s very important for this country to see the server. Nobody wants to see it. The media never wants to see it. But I\u2019ll tell you, Republicans want to see it.\n\nSo, Republicans aren\u2019t treated well. And here\u2019s the problem: I think we\u2019re going to take the House, based on what\u2019s happening with the impeachment stuff. And the Republicans can do the same thing in reverse if they ever have \u2014 and I hope it\u2019s going to be a long time, because nobody has done a better job with the economy, with our military, with \u2014 I\u2019ve rebuilt the military. Our economy is the best it\u2019s ever been. We have numbers that just came out where, not including taxes, the median household income for the average American has increased $5,000 in a very short time since I\u2019ve been President. Nobody has ever heard of numbers like that.\n\nSo, people want to find out: Why was it so corrupt during that election? And I want to find out more than anybody else.\n\nSteve, go ahead.\n\nQ One of the things that has been exposed by this Turkey situation is that as many as 50 nuclear weapons are at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. How confident are you of those weapons\u2019 safety?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: We\u2019re confident, and we have a great \u2014 a great air base there, a very powerful air base. That air base alone can take any place. It\u2019s a large, powerful air base.\n\nAnd, you know, Turkey \u2014 just so people remember \u2014 Turkey is a NATO member. We\u2019re supposed to get along with our NATO members, and Turkey is a NATO member. Do people want us to start shooting at a NATO member? That would be a first. And that\u2019s all involved having to do with NATO.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Mr. President, you\u2019re going to be seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today. How do you anticipate that conversation?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I\u2019d say this: I think that she\u2019s done this country a tremendous disservice. She\u2019s created a phony witch hunt \u2014 another one. The first one failed. They\u2019re all failing. This one is just absolutely crazy. All you have to do is read the transcript of the call. Read the transcript. This is a open and shut, simple case. They\u2019re desperate because they know they\u2019re going to lose the election. They\u2019re desperate to do something because they know they\u2019re going to lose the election.\n\nThis administration has created the strongest economy in the history of our country. We have the greatest stock market. We had \u2014 over 100 times, we broke the record for stock market. People\u2019s \u2014 if you look at people\u2019s stocks, their 401(k)s; if you look at anything you want to look at, they\u2019re far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don\u2019t forget, stock market is not just rich people; it\u2019s all people. Because all people own in the stock markets. The New York Stock Exchange, all of them \u2014 they\u2019re at record highs. Nobody has ever done what we\u2019ve done.\n\nSo, they\u2019re playing games. They figure they can\u2019t win the election, so maybe we can find some ground. \u201cWe\u2019ll get somebody that Trump never met, and maybe they\u2019ll say something bad about Trump. And if they do really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. They\u2019ve treated the Republican Party with great disrespect.\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nQ Mr. President, how was your meeting with the Dunn family yesterday?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: My meeting with the family was really \u2014 it was beautiful, in a certain way. They did not want to meet with the person in question. But we had a very good meeting. They\u2019re very nice people. And we met with the full group. It was four people, actually, as you \u2014 you know how it\u2019s all broken up. And the meeting took place right here at about 6 o\u2019clock last night, and it was very sad, to be honest. She lost, and they lost, their son. I believe it was going down the wrong way, because that happens in Europe. You go to Europe and the roads are opposite. And it\u2019s very tough.\n\nIf you\u2019re from the United States, you do make that decision to make a right turn where you\u2019re supposed to make a left turn. The roads are opposite. And she said that\u2019s what happened. That happens to a lot of people, by the way. But she said that\u2019s what happened. She was in the room right out there. We met right here, in these \u2014 this area. And I offered to bring the person in question in, and they weren\u2019t ready for it. But I did offer.\n\nI spoke with Boris. He asked me if I\u2019d do that, and I did it. Unfortunately, they wanted to meet with her, and unfortunately when we had everybody together, they decided not to meet. Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time. I don\u2019t know exactly. I know the people were lovely. They were very nice. And they were, you know, desperately sad.\n\nQ And, sir, did you suggest that the family had indicated at one point that they were interested in meeting with her?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I thought they were. Based on what I saw, they wanted to meet. But now they say they only want to meet if they\u2019re in the UK. And that\u2019ll be up to them. But I did meet the family, and I expressed condolences on behalf of our country.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nQ Mr. President, because you\u2019re winning so much with the WTO, because you\u2019re growing the biggest economy \u2014\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Wait, there\u2019s a great question I\u2019m being asked. This is maybe the greatest question I\u2019ve been asked in a long time. Please put those mics over here. Go ahead.\n\nQ Because you\u2019re winning with the WTO, because you\u2019re growing the biggest economy the world, are you willing to give Italy a break on tariffs?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: We are looking at Italy very strongly. And, as you know, the seven and a half is to be divided the way we say. We\u2019ve divided it up. Italy has got a problem with the way we\u2019ve divided it up because they said they had much less to do with it, and Germany had more to do with it, and France had more to do with it, as an example. So we are going to look at that very strongly. Ambassador Lighthizer is here. We\u2019re going to look at it very strongly.\n\nOkay? Thank you. Good question. I love that question.\n\nThank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nQ Are you going to open up the meeting with Pelosi? Are you going to open up the meeting with Pelosi and bring us in?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, I\u2019ll bring you in, right? I\u2019ll bring you in. They\u2019re doing a bad thing. I\u2019ll talk to you. I\u2019ll talk to you.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nSteve, please treat them nicely. Treat Italy nicely, please.\n\nQ The translator did an amazing job.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Huh?\n\nQ The translator did an amazing job.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. That doesn\u2019t always happen. Thank you.\n\nEND\n\n11:06 A.M.
