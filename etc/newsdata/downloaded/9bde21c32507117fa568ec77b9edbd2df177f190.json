Seventeen-three, you lose that man and the game is done.\"\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus also highlighted the red card as the turning point.\n\nDescribing the fixture as a \"slippery\" potential banana-skin, Erasmus said he felt Italy were getting back into the game when Lovotti was sent off.\n\n\"When they got that red card, it was quite easy for us after that,\" said Erasmus, whose team plays Canada on Tuesday.", "description": "A furious Italy coach Conor O'Shea lambasted prop Andrea Lovotti for \"crass stupidity\" after his dangerous dump tackle on Duane Vermeulen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/36b0fe3f41bf4effa65a9309a8760f21.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
