Jos\u00e9 Altuve, Astros star and emblem, had a pair of doubles and scored twice, and the Astros\u2019 bullpen stifled the Nats over the last four-plus innings.\n\nJust the Astros doing typically efficient and suffocating Astros things. And little fun at all for D.C., which waited 86 years to find out that, while its Nats are leading in this World Series, it\u2019s also in a battle now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, for those who anticipated a long, complex, strategy-filled World Series between two roughly equal teams \u2014 the Astros supremely dominant all season but the Nats quite comparable for the past five months \u2014 this night gave promise of a dramatic World Series, complete with dicey decision-making, that is starting to unfold. In other words, purists who love good baseball and lots of it are suddenly happy, fie on them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a game before. It\u2019s one game. There\u2019s going to be another one tomorrow,\u201d said a straight-faced but perhaps slightly bemused Ryan Zimmerman to questions about how a team that had won 18 of its previous 20 games might actually lose one.\n\n\u201cWe have to play good baseball. That\u2019s a really good team over there. They have superstars all over the place. If we don\u2019t play good baseball, we\u2019ll lose,\u201d said Zimmerman, who singled and scored the Nats\u2019 only run on a fourth-inning Victor Robles triple. \u201cBut if we get as many people on base as we did [Friday], I\u2019ll take our chances.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, this World Series will move into its tactical stage, playing out earlier themes. \u201cThere is a lot of chess going on [between] these teams,\u201d said Adam Eaton, who had two hits.\n\nIn Game 1, the Nats made a strategic gamble \u2014 but perhaps an unavoidable one given their lack of bullpen depth \u2014 by using $140 million left-hander Patrick Corbin to pitch an important inning of relief when Max Scherzer left after five innings and 112 pitches. Calling on the willing Corbin helped patch together the last 12 vital outs of a one-run victory.\n\nBut it also pushed Corbin, an elite starting pitcher in his prime, back from a Game 3 start and possibly one in a Game 7 if necessary. Now he is certain of just one certain start in Game 4. The Astros are loaded with right-handed hitters and like facing most lefties. But does that mean they would enjoy facing a southpaw such as Corbin, who was fourth in the National League in strikeouts (238) and eighth in ERA (3.25)?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the Nats, the decision to have Corbin \u201cspikes on\u201d for use in relief for Games 1 or 2 or even both was a double-edged issue.\n\nThe first part of the trade-off was to trust S\u00e1nchez with a much larger role. Sometimes, when S\u00e1nchez\u2019s command is sharp, he can produce marvels, such as having a no-hitter for 7\u2154 innings in his win over St. Louis in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series. But the Cardinals are a mediocre hitting team. The Astros are elite. If there is a Game 7 in Houston, it will be a nervous night for the Nationals with all pitching arms on deck. S\u00e1nchez might start but with a much shorter leash.\n\nLuckily for the Nats, there is another side to the S\u00e1nchez-Corbin double-edged blade. The Astros\u2019 glaring weakness, since the implosion of lefty Wade Miley in September (16.67 ERA in five starts), is the absence of a fourth starter. Ironically, both Miley and S\u00e1nchez were under consideration by the Nats in free agency last winter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday night, the Astros, who have a strong, deep bullpen, will be forced to patch together a \u201cbullpen game\u201d while facing Corbin, who is one of the Nats\u2019 Big Three.\n\nThat should be advantage Nats, with rookie Jose Urquidy as Houston\u2019s opener. Also important, the Nats drove Houston starter Zack Greinke out of the game after just 4\u2154 shaky innings Friday. The Astros, desperate to win, then used their five best relievers.\n\n\u201cWe made some of those guys come in and throw. We got to see them,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a positive.\u201d\n\nIf Corbin does well and the Nats win to take control of this World Series, one of the hidden plotlines will be that Washington built a rotation deep enough that it could flip Corbin and S\u00e1nchez around in this series and remain functional while also getting a useful start from S\u00e1nchez in the NL Division Series and an outstanding one in the NLCS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis time worked out pretty well for us being able to throw Game 1 and then having three full days off,\u201d Corbin said before Game 3. \u201cBeing available for Game 2 worked out great \u2014 not getting in . . . I didn\u2019t throw at all. So I was able to do my same routine.\n\n\u201cEverything feels great, ready to go.\u201d\n\nGame 4 will be crucial for the Astros. A 3-1 deficit is tough to escape even if your next two matchups would be Gerritt Cole and Justin Verlander against three-time Cy Young winner Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.\n\nBut it will be deadly serious business for the Nats, too. Postseason history shows that if you are able to gain the huge advantage of a 2-0 lead on the other team\u2019s field, then don\u2019t let them get even at 2-2 and know that they\u2019ll get to go back home.\n\nAD\n\nAfter their six-day layoff following the NLCS, the Nats appear to have regained their hitting timing \u2014 if they ever lost it. They\u2019re getting their hits. But, like many teams in their first World Series, they seem to be feeling their nerves more at home, where there is an intense desire to please the fans who adore them, rather than the dashing desperado attitude of a hot team, winners of 18 of 20 going into Friday night, that wants to go into a hostile ballpark and demoralize both its foes and the struck-silent rival crowds.\n\nAD\n\nJuan Soto, on his 21st birthday, seemed especially struck. Maybe having the left field stands sing \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d to which he doffed his cap, just increased his desire to please. In addition to an impatient 0-for-4 night, Soto made an error on a ball bouncing in the left field corner and also threw a ball to the plate so high that it cleared the catcher and the pitcher who was backing him up, hitting the box seat railing and advancing a runner. Anthony Rendon flew out weakly three times with men on base by swinging at the first pitch.\n\nNone of the Nats in the postgame locker room seemed concerned that, after their 13th playoff game this month, and their third in the World Series, they had suddenly become aware of the stage they were on. Most seemed elated by the atmosphere and craved more.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe place was electric,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy for the fans. They deserve this as much as we do,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cHopefully, the next couple of games, we can give them a little more to cheer about.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, the World Series has come to Washington, and celebrations, jammed streets, chanting fans and general red-clad Nationals joy now rule the happy city. But the Astros have arrived, too.\n\nJust as the Nats\u2019 modest motto for this year became #StayInTheFight, the Astros\u2019 for the whole year has been #TakeItBack. You see (everyone in baseball knows this), the Astros aspire to the kind of We\u2019re-Just-Better hauteur familiar to Yankees followers. Houston won the World Series in 2017 \u2014 the first in franchise history \u2014 and wants to give the impression that 2018 was just a one-year mistake.\n\nAD\n\nSaturday\u2019s Corbin vs. Bullpen matchup in Game 4 may not seem like some high-dudgeon battle. But it should be viewed as that. It\u2019s Finish the Fight vs. Take It Back. Yes, in the World Series, each game just counts as one. But this is a big one.\n\nRead more:", "description": "By holding on to Patrick Corbin for Game 4, Dave Martinez took a calculated risk.
