He talked about my hair,\u2019 Eddie revealed. \u2018He was like, \u201cWhat kind of rinse are you using?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d and then he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have any grey hairs.\u201d\u2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho\u2019d have thought it, eh?\n\nUnluckily for Obama, Eddie explained that he doesn\u2019t actually colour his hair. He\u2019s just blessed with a beautifully grey-free bonce.\n\nApparently, Obama also inspired 58-year-old actor Eddie to get back into stand-up comedy.\n\nThe Nutty Professor star revealed that the first thing Obama had asked him when they met was why he no longer did stand-up and, well, it got Eddie thinking it might be time for him to pick up the mic again.\n\nHe\u2019s planning on doing just that after bringing back Beverly Hills Cop for a fourth movie.\n\nThe original was released in 1984, with the second film following three years later in 1987 and a third hitting the big screen in 1994.\n\nNow, Eddie wants another Beverly Hills Cop movie and hopes it\u2019ll be his next project after wrapping up the sequel of Coming to America.\n\nSpeaking to Collider, he said: \u2018We\u2019re doing Beverly Hills Cop and then the plan is to get back on stage and do stand-up. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing mostly is stand-up.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
