Trey Gowdy (R-SC) has reportedly signed on to serve as outside counsel to President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to fight the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nAn unnamed administration official confirmed the move to the Associated Press on Tuesday evening.\n\nGowdy, who retired from Congress last year, represented South Carolina\u2019s 4th Congressional District for eight years.\n\nThe former lawmaker served as House Oversight Committee chairman and oversaw the investigation into former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and the events surrounding the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya. Since leaving Washington, D.C., Gowdy joined the law firm Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough and signed on as a Fox News Channel contributor.\n\nThe development came after the White House sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) confirming it will not cooperate with the impeachment probe, branding it \u201cillegitimate\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe letter, written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, accused the speaker of attempting to \u201coverturn the results\u201d of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d the letter read. \u201cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have the President no choice.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d it added.\n\nPelosi responded later Tuesday to President Trump with a letter of her own, vowing to hold him \u201caccountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections,\u201d the California Democrat wrote. \u201cDespite the White House\u2019s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,\u201d she concluded.\n\nPelosi kicked off the probe against President Trump late September after a partisan CIA officer accused the president in a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint of asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both have denied any pressure was applied to probe into the Biden family, and in a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the presidents\u2019 call to show no wrongdoing occurred.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Washington Examiner reported that the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d \u2014 who had been previously outed as a registered Democrat \u2014 in fact, had a previously \u201cprofessional relationship\u2019 with a 2020 Democrat White House hopeful.", "description": "Trey Gowdy has reportedly signed on to serve as outside counsel to President Trump as part of his efforts to fight impeachment.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-886951080-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
