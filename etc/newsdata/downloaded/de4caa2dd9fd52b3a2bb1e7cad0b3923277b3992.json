Photo: Rio Viera-Newton\n\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: a hyaluronic acid serum is something every person should have in their medicine cabinet. Why? Because using a good hyaluronic acid serum is simply the most effective way to ensure that your skin is sufficiently quenched and nourished. Unlike moisturizers, which hydrate the surface of your skin, HA serums penetrate deep down into the skin and increase the skin\u2019s overall water content.\n\nAnd don\u2019t think that just because summer is just around the corner you can call it quits on effectively moisturizing your skin. Sure, you can feel free to swap your ultrathick moisturizer for a lighter option. But trust me when I say this: a good hyaluronic acid serum is the soldier you\u2019ll need to fight against the onset of dull summer skin.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem with most hyaluronic acid serums: they tend to either be very expensive or to come in teeny-tiny bottles that run out in four seconds. I tried, and loved, a sample of Dr. Barbara Sturm\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid Serum recently \u2014 but the price genuinely offended me. And I adore my affordable $7 serum from the Ordinary, but it\u2019s so petite that I find I need a new bottle practically every other week. In other words: I\u2019ve been longing for a reasonably priced, generously sized HA serum that I could integrate into my daily routine for quite some time.\n\nAdmittedly, when Amazon announced it was launching its own skin-care line called Belei, I wasn\u2019t too fussed. I mean, what could they come up with that I didn\u2019t already own? But when I saw the enormous, two-fluid-ounce bottle on my editor\u2019s desk, I couldn\u2019t help but be intrigued.\n\nTo my complete surprise, I fell in love with this product basically right away, and it has since became an everyday staple in my routine. The serum, a mixture of five different hyaluronic acids, is a thick gel. It\u2019s very similar in texture to Drunk Elephant\u2019s B-Hydra Intensive Serum \u2014 one of my first-love hyaluronic acid serums that totally changed the brightness and moisture levels of my skin for the better. I actually liked the way the Belei serum made my face feel better than the B-Hydra, which tends to make my skin feel a little bit tacky, even when I apply moisturizer right after. The Belei is just as quenching as the B-Hydra, but doesn\u2019t leave any stickiness. And it\u2019s so hydrating that I can imagine throwing it on, applying an SPF on top, and leaving for the day \u2014 without moisturizing. This is big, coming from me. I\u2019m the kind of person who tends to moisturize even when it\u2019s 100 degrees out and I\u2019ve already slathered on half a container of serum. With most of my Hyaluronic Acid serums (like my beloved Ordinary and even fancy Dr. Barbara Sturm), I can see a difference in my skin\u2019s texture and glow after a few days of using it. But as soon as I applied this serum, my skin looked and felt plumper and more moisturized instantly.\n\nI now apply this serum everyday in the mornings and evenings, before my moisturizer and SPF. I\u2019ve never seen a hylauronic acid serum show it\u2019s powers quite as fast as this lovely, two-ounce, $35 serum does. Now it sits in a power position, right at the front of my medicine cabinet.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
