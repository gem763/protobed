Bee populations are suffering everywhere, largely due to the use of pesticides, with major consequences for our ecosystems and food supplies.\n\n\u201cBees come into contact with small quantities of a pesticide over a long period of time and this is where the real problem lies; that\u2019s why chronic toxicity needs to be fully included in the assessment of pesticides.\u201d\n\nEickhout claimed pesticide producers had gone to great lengths to maintain their \u201ctoxic business model\u201d and that the commission had been complicit in weakening protections.\n\n\u201cThis change of legislation has received relatively little attention so far because it has been discussed behind closed doors at the technical level. It\u2019s time for the European commission to present a proper proposal at the political level so that member states can be held accountable for this issue and then many EU countries might change their tune,\u201d he said.\n\nBees pollinate more than 80% of crops and wild plants in Europe. Last year, the EU banned the world\u2019s most widely used insecticides, neonicotinoids, from all fields.\n\nThe chemicals were found to cause a wide range of harms including memory damage and a reduction in queen numbers. But the ban included an exemption for greenhouses, raising fears the chemical could still wash out into watercourses.", "description": "Sixteen states and European commission had lobbied against planned guidance", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Carey Gillam"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcefac59de4894cc93fa4cb4de3667415b5f2c76/586_510_2219_1332/master/2219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eede172d8c0a2d0eb00c9df8db9397e4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
