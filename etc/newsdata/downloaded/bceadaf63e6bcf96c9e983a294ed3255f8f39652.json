It is now believed the bras are being produced by highly skilled operatives.\n\nA security source said: \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of the inventiveness and determination these people possess to kill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a close proximity weapon. They are a small, lightweight device but can be lined with enough plastic explosive to kill everything standing within a 10-metre radius.\n\n(Image: ATOM Training)\n\n(Image: ATOM Training)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ideal weapon for a checkpoint approach.\u201d\n\nDonkeys strapped with explosives are also used.\n\nThe source said: \u201cUnfortunately there is no choice but to shoot these animals on sight.\u201d\n\nThe UK has never made public the number of special forces it has operating in Syria but it is thought to be dozens.\n\nIn 2007 a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber used a bra bomb to blow herself up outside the offices of a minister and ended up killing a secretary.\n\nIt is also suspected that a similar device was used in the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1991.", "description": "The fanatics are wiring the garments with plastic explosives in a bid to kill coalition troops", "authors": ["Paul Hooper", "Image", "Atom Training"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657527.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_IMG_2922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
