Lawmakers confronted IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig about the emphasis, citing our stories, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked Rettig for a plan to fix the imbalance. Rettig readily agreed\u2026\n\nOn the one hand, the IRS said, auditing poor taxpayers is a lot easier: The agency uses relatively low-level employees to audit returns for low-income taxpayers who claim the earned income tax credit. The audits \u2014 of which there were about 380,000 last year, accounting for 39% of the total the IRS conducted \u2014 are done by mail and don\u2019t take too much staff time, either. They are \u201cthe most efficient use of available IRS examination resources,\u201d Rettig\u2019s report says.\n\nOn the other hand, auditing the rich is hard. It takes senior auditors hours upon hours to complete an exam. What\u2019s more, the letter says, \u201cthe rate of attrition is significantly higher among these more experienced examiners.\u201d As a result, the budget cuts have hit this part of the IRS particularly hard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Pro Publica", "Propublica.Org Article Irs-Sorry-But-Its-Just-Easier-And-Cheaper-To-Audit-The-Poor"], "top_image": ""}
