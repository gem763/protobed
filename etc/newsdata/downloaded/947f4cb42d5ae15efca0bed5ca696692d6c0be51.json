Other family members, including 2-year-old twins and the couple's 3-month-old baby boy, were also in the car.\n\nMichael Connors says he was driving close to the U.S.-Canada border when an animal suddenly appeared, and he swerved onto an unmarked road to avoid hitting it, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Almost immediately, the family was surrounded by police cars and Border Patrol agents.\n\nJOE GIUDICE'S SHOCKING TRANSFORMATION REVEALED AFTER HE'S RELEASED FROM ICE CUSTODY\n\n\u201cThey had no idea they had crossed any boundary,\u201d the family's lawyer, Bridget Cambria, told the news outlet. \u201cThey had no idea they were even in the United States. They were just trying to get back to their hotel.\u201d\n\nCambria said an officer told the family, \"You crossed an international border\" and the family claims they were not allowed to contact their embassy.\n\n\u201cWe asked if we couldn\u2019t simply turn around and the officer said no,\u201d Eileen wrote in a sworn statement, obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cWe kept repeating we did not want to be here. We were detained anyway and treated in a way that no human deserves to be treated.\u201d\n\nThe family members were taken into custody and transported to a facility near the Canadian border. While there, Eileen said she and the 3-month-old were forced to sleep on a cold \"dirty floor\" with thin metallic-looking blankets.\n\nWOMAN STOLE MONEY FROM IMMIGRANTS SEEKING VISAS, CITIZENSHIP: PROSECUTORS\n\n\u201cThe memory of our little baby having to sleep on a dirty floor of a cell will haunt us forever,\u201d Eileen reportedly wrote.\n\nThe following day, the couple says they were initially told they could be released into the custody of a family member in the U.S., but then they were informed they were not being released, and instead had to remain in detention. Eileen said they were forced from cells into a van in a scene she described as being similar to that of \"an abduction or kidnapping.\u201d\n\nDavid was taken to another detention center, and Eileen and her child were brought to a Red Roof Inn in Seattle, Wash. On Oct. 5, the family was taken to an airport in Seattle and flown to Pennsylvania, where they were processed at the Berks Detention Center in Leesport, Pa.\n\nThe family detention center, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, is one of three in the country. It's often described as dirty, and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf during the summer called the facility \"wrong,\" \"immoral\" and \"inhumane.\"\n\nEileen said that since being held at Berks, her baby has developed blotchy skin and an apparent eye infection.\n\n\u201cWe will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us,\u201d the mother wrote in her statement. \u201cWe have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to...This would never happen in the United Kingdom to U.S. citizens, or anyone else, because people there are treated with dignity.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nCambria, the family's lawyer, said the family will most likely be deported back to the U.K. She said, however, no such paperwork has been shared with the family and it's unclear what charges have been filed against the Connors.\n\nICE did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "A\u00a0British\u00a0family\u00a0visiting Canada was taken into custody earlier this month after they accidentally took a wrong turn and crossed the northern border into the U.S., their lawyer said in a report published Monday.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
