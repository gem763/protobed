Elizabeth Warren on Monday unveiled more policy priorities designed to root out public corruption, ahead of a planned speech in New York City on the subject on Monday evening.\n\n\u201cThe goal of these measures is straightforward: to take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected in Washington and put it back where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of the people,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate said in a Medium post.\n\nMs. Warren, who has already pushed anti-corruption proposals in the U.S. Senate, wants to impose a blanket ban on members of Congress and senior government officials from owning or trading stocks, suggesting instead that they invest in \u201cconflict-free\u201d mutual funds or funds managed by the federal Thrift Savings Program.\n\nShe would also ban members of Congress and senior congressional staff from serving on corporate boards, whether the positions are paid or not, and would require members of Congress to disclose any financial conflicts before they take office.\n\nMs. Warren also wants to step up disclosure requirements for \u201cpolitical intelligence\u201d firms and impose criminal penalties on former public officials who use \u201cinsider\u201d political information to make investments or advice other people who do.\n\nShe would also impose new restrictions on lobbying, including a ban on presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, federal judges and Cabinet secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists.\n\nLobbyists would also be banned from making political contributions, \u201cbundling\u201d donations or hosting fundraisers for political candidates under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
