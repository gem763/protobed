My support in the district has been great as an independent.\n\n\u201cBut we do need new voices on the national stage running for national office, including the presidency.\u201d\n\nAmash criticised the Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination in a sprawling field.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the current Democratic field is sufficient,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the top three candidates on the Democratic side\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re all over 70 years old.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s over 70 years old. I think that there is a large segment of the population that is not represented in the top candidates on either side of the aisle, and that\u2019s something I think about.\u201d\n\nAmash is running for re-election as an independent but he told NBC he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say 100% of anything\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for Congress,\u201d he added, when asked about the possibility of being the Libertarian candidate for the White House, \u201cbut I keep things open and I wouldn\u2019t rule anything out\u201d.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson won 4,489,221 votes, 3.28% of ballots cast. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the popular vote by nearly 3m but Trump won the presidency in the electoral college.\n\nAmash is a libertarian-tinged founder member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus who drifted away from its support for Trump.\n\nHe first called for impeachment \u2013 and was attacked by Trump in return \u2013 earlier this year, over the president\u2019s behaviour in relation to Russian election interference and the investigation into links between Trump and Moscow led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe current impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals.\n\nRelated: Republican congressman announces retirement after saying he is open to Trump impeachment\n\nEarlier this month, Amash told the Hill: \u201cAssuming the articles are drafted properly, yeah, I think there\u2019s impeachable conduct that could be included in articles that I would support.\u201d\n\nAmash\u2019s former Republican colleagues are under increasing pressure. On Friday, Francis Rooney of Florida indicated that he could support impeachment if it comes to a vote on whether to send Trump to the Senate for trial.\n\nOn Saturday, Rooney told Fox News he had decided to retire. He is the 14th Republican to decide to leave the House in 2020.", "description": "Michigan congressman left party over his criticism of Trump and called for impeachment earlier this yearMichigan congressman Justin Amash: \u2018We need new voices on the national stage running for national office, including the presidency.\u2019  Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APJustin Amash, the Michigan congressman", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jA42l7Hm3crjCUpMtBkh6g--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/70d4746e8715ba81ba391c8e2d8ed684", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
