Peter is now 82 years old and suffering from dementia. Here, Mark explains his story... In the early stages of my dad showing symptoms of dementia in 2017, I phoned the PFA and was put through to John Bramhall, the deputy chief executive. We had a couple of conversations, which were civilised. John told me there was no link between football and dementia, and I could only agree with him at the time. There was no research to suggest otherwise. But I explained my situation. My brother died in 2012. My sister died in 2013. Me and my mum, who is now 80 years old, were the only ones left to look after my dad. I asked John if the union could help, and later spoke to a claims adviser at the PFA called Brian, who asked me what benefits I collect. Peter Phoenix suffers from dementia I had two small businesses at the time but would have to give up work to care for my dad full-time. I would be on the dole, while also receiving \u00a366 a week carer's allowance. After looking at my benefits, Brian explained that we could claim an extra \u00a330 a week off the government \u2013 and that was the extent of the help I received from the PFA. My dad's house is a few miles from their offices in Manchester, but no one has ever visited. Back then, there was no official link between football and dementia. In all honesty, I understood little about it. But when your dad develops brain damage, you tend to want to find out why. Then the news broke last Monday \u2013 there is a link. So I phoned the PFA back to speak to John Bramhall. I asked him about these results. John told me: 'It's a lot to take in. We've only just got the results.' He then explained how he played as a centre half in over 500 games and that he was worried himself. I told him he should be and reminded him of the help I received \u2013 \u00a330 a week off the government. John said he was sorry I felt this way and sent me an information pack, which included a number to call \u2013 the PFA Dementia Helpline. I phoned that Monday morning and got through to a young lady called Harriet in London. I told her my story. A lovely girl, she was very understanding and sympathetic. She also worked for the Alzheimer's Society, not the PFA. She advised me to re-contact the union. Then she asked for my email address, to send me information and see what the Alzheimer's Society can do for me. So here I am, in the exact same desperate position. No better than before last week's news broke.\n\nSutton, whose father Mike \u2014 a former footballer \u2014 is suffering from a degenerative disease caused by repetitive brain trauma, hit out at the PFA's claims on Monday night.\n\nThe letter also includes a 'PFA Dementia Helpline', though the son of one former footballer suffering from dementia told Sportsmail of his frustration after calling it.\n\nSutton said: 'What a joke this letter is. It claims the PFA have been \"committed to research since 2001\". Do me a favour. I said last week that this study was rolled out 15 years too late. It was in November 2002 when a coroner ruled Jeff Astle, the ex-England player famed for his aerial ability, died from dementia brought on by repeatedly heading the ball.\n\n'Some research started in 2002 but it lay dormant for years. Nothing was done. We had to wait until 2019 to be told what we already knew \u2014 that football and dementia are linked.\n\n'I don't see how we can rely on Gordon Taylor to lead the fight against this awful disease.\n\n'Dawn Astle will tell you he once told her, \"My mother has dementia and she's never headed a ball\". He admitted on Alan Shearer's BBC documentary that he didn't know how many of the PFA's 50,000 members have dementia. Isn't it his job to know?\n\n'This letter even says the study wasn't able to tell them the exact cause of this increased risk and further research is needed. What else could it be other than heading?\n\n'That to me is dismissive of the research already completed.\n\n'We're a week on from this study being revealed and we've gone nowhere. All has gone quiet.\n\n'Why is there not a concerted campaign from current and past players to address what is clearly a very serious situation?\n\n'I for one do not want to sit back and find ourselves in the same situation in 20 years time, with too many former footballers dying from dementia.'\n\nThe PFA say the letter was sent out to all members last week. They add they have partnered with the Alzheimer's Society and pay for an expert to speak to members.\n\nLast year, PFA chairman Ben Purkiss told Sportsmail: 'We have \u00a350million but donate just \u00a3100,000 to research into dementia \u2014 which should be one of the most important causes the PFA can take on.'\n\nIt was also reported this year that Taylor still received a \u00a32.2m pay package in 2018, despite the furore his salary caused when the 2017 accounts were revealed.\n\nTaylor, who has led the PFA since 1981, is stepping down after a review into the union's finances is complete.\n\nSutton continued: 'I fully believe he should go now.\n\n'Maybe people aren't talking about dementia in football because they do not know what it is like. Well I do. So does Dawn Astle and plenty of others.\n\n'If you asked my dad to dress himself, he wouldn't know how to. It can be like looking after a baby.\n\n'It's not about forgetting your car keys. This really is a despicable way to die.\n\n'I've got sons who play football, and I don't want them heading balls.\n\n'I'm not saying ban heading from the professional game, but maybe something should change at youth level. It is not just about the pro game. It is about football as a whole.'\n\nSutton (left) with his father Mike 9right) who is suffering from dementia after his playing career", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY KIERAN GILL: A PFA letter sent to members highlighting the union's dedication to researching dementia in football has been slammed by Sportsmail columnist Chris Sutton.", "authors": ["Kieran Gill For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/21/20298662-0-image-a-41_1572298158538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
