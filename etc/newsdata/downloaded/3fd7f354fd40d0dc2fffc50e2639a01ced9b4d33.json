But once Richard sees the first freshwater mussel, which look quite different to their marine cousins of moules frite fame, he scans the river and finds another every five to 10 seconds.\n\n\u201cThe smell will knock you off your feet,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou see what was a healthy looking river, but now there\u2019s just dead bodies scattered everywhere.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rose Agbalog shows a very recently dead wavy-rayed lampmussel.

And they are facing a mysterious affliction in hotspots in the US and abroad.\n\nRichard, who works for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is part of a team investigating the bizarre declines in Tennessee and Virginia, as well as Oregon and Washington. The group includes biologists, pathologists and epidemiologists from the University of Wisconsin and the US Geological Survey. They say others are researching similar episodes in Spain.\n\nOf the roughly 300 freshwater mussel species in North America, 71% are considered endangered, threatened or of concern, largely because of human degradation of rivers. They are also vulnerable to the climate crisis, because of heat and changes to precipitation.\n\nIn the southeast US alone, nearly two dozen species of mussels are thought to have gone extinct.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about these massive global extinctions, these are the species that are really blinking out, and there\u2019s so many of them nobody even notices,\u201d Richard said.\n\nBut researchers looking at the Clinch River suspect this particular die-off could be happening, at least in part, because of a disease \u2013 largely because it is not affecting other types of animals. Mass die-offs in rivers have typically been from the construction of dams or chemical spills that killed many kinds of animals.\n\nIn Tennessee, the pheasantshell mussel has been hardest hit. It is the most abundant, representing about a quarter to a third of the biomass of mussels in the river, Richard said. He has found other types of mussels dead, including some at risk of extinction. And the deaths have already spread upriver to Virginia.\n\nRichard said observers have seen this phenomenon before, in the 1980s and 1990s in the nearby Holston and Powell rivers. Scientists have yet to explain why it\u2019s happening though.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rose Agbalog points out healthy freshwater mussels that are buried in the river bottom.

Western pearlshell mussels have been a key target. Blevins works for the Xerces Society, a conservation group established in the 1970s to call attention to risks to invertebrate species, including bees, dragonflies and snails \u2013 the species \u201cthe world is running on\u201d but doesn\u2019t think of as often, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning because we are seeing it in various locations and large numbers of mussels are dying and sometimes quite rapidly,\u201d Blevins said.\n\nTony Goldberg, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, said the die-offs are peculiar because of how they narrowly affect mussels.\n\n\u201cIt seemed very strange that there was one species out of a biodiverse assemblage that was being affected,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cFrom an epidemiologist perspective that is a red flag for infectious disease.\u201d\n\nDiseases decimating species aren\u2019t new. Ebola caused mass mortality in gorillas in Central Africa in the early 2000s, a transmissible cancer killed a huge percentage of Tasmanian devils in the 1990s and a fungal disease killed the now-extinct golden toads in Costa Rica in the late 1980s, Goldberg noted in a recent article in Bonefish and Tarpon Journal.\n\nGoldberg explained that even if a die-off doesn\u2019t cause outright extinction, it can whittle down a species\u2019 numbers enough to cause ecosystem shifts or even collapses.\n\nIf the problem with the mussels is a disease, Goldberg worries that it could evolve and learn how to kill other kinds of freshwater species. He said technologies are rapidly developing to prevent viruses and other pathogens in wildlife, including with vaccines administered to eggs and probiotics.\n\nIn the meantime, mussel disappearances could permanently change rivers communities rely on.\n\n\u201cIf we have one of these die-offs, the river will never look the same, even to a casual observer,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThe bottom will be different. The fish and other wildlife will be different. It\u2019ll smell and look different. It\u2019ll be cloudier. It\u2019s just not going to be the same river.\u201d", "description": "As the backbone of the river ecosystem because they control silt levels and filter water, mussels are facing a mysterious affliction", "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/677cee921363ec98c3dd2e28a35bf3fbb44c2c5a/0_147_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f379b1178c8cd3edd59600fb285e7bcc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
