It does not make grammatical sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t in proper English, it\u2019s in Greek English. I'm a very well-educated person, I got into university with an unconditional offer so there\u2019s no way I would write something like this. Marios (the investigating police officer) wanted me to write that I had made it all up.\"\n\nThe teenager repeatedly offered to read out to the court the bad spelling and poor grammar that she said was in the retraction statement, but the judge presiding over the case refused to let her.\n\nThe young woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed in July that she was raped by up to a dozen Israeli men in a hotel room in the party resort of Ayia Napa, which draws tens of thousands of holidaymakers each summer.\n\nTen days later she signed a retraction, which her legal team insist was made under duress after she was questioned by Cypriot police for eight hours without a lawyer.\n\nBut she is on trial for \u201ccausing public mischief\u201d by allegedly fabricating the gang rape claim, with the Israeli men threatening to sue her if she is convicted.\n\nThe British teenager being led into the court in Paralimni, Cyprus Credit: AFP More\n\nShe told the court in Paralimni, a town a few miles from Ayia Napa, that police had promised her that she would be released and allowed to return to the UK if she signed the retraction.\n\n\u201cThe officer said he had spoken to the Israelis and he had agreed that they would go home and I would go home and that would be the end of it.\u201d\n\nBut instead of being set free she found herself being arrested and taken to a prison in Nicosia, the island\u2019s capital, where she spent more than a month in a cell with other women before being bailed.\n\nShortly after signing the statement on July 27, she had a panic attack in the police station, brought on by the PTSD that psychologists say she is suffering from as a result of the alleged gang rape.\n\n\u201cI was really, really stressed and I was crying. I was in a state. I was 18 years old and I was suffering from PTSD. I was trapped in there. They made me sign things I didn\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.\n\nShe accused one of the investigating officers, Detective Sergeant Marios Christou, of shouting at her and intimidating her.\n\nAyia Napa and surrounding resorts are hugely popular with young holidaymakers from Britain, Europe and Israel Credit: AFP More", "description": "A British teenager who says she was gang raped by Israeli tourists in a beach resort in Cyprus told a court today that she was forced to sign a retraction by Cypriot police after they wrote it for her.
