CASS pledges to switch over your current account including any direct debits in that time period.\n\nThe \u00a3125 offer was announced on the same day that changes to Club Lloyds accounts come into force, which will leave customers with less than \u00a34,000 in the bank worse off.\n\nPreviously the bank paid a blanket 1.5 per cent interest rate on balances of between \u00a31 and \u00a35,000 to those with a Club Lloyds, or Club Lloyds Platinum account.\n\nHowever, in a shakeup announced in July the bank will pay those with between \u00a31 and \u00a34,000 a 1 per cent rate, while those with between \u00a34,000 and \u00a35,000 will receive 2 per cent on that final \u00a31,000 in the bracket.\n\nThe switching offer may be an attempt to try and replenish the current account customer losses Lloyds has suffered in recent times.\n\nLloyds Banking Group, comprising Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland, remains the UK's largest current account provider, but Lloyds Bank itself saw a net 22,000 current account customers switch away over the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first three months of this year, according to CASS figures.\n\nFor those wanting to open an account to take advantage of the \u00a3125 bonus, Club Lloyds requires \u00a31,500 a month to be paid in, or else customers incur a \u00a33 monthly fee.\n\nIn return, customers get access to Lloyds' 'everyday offers', which can give up to 15 per cent cashback on some debit card purchases, as well as some other benefits like cinema tickets.\n\nMeanwhile, Club Lloyds Platinum is the bank's packaged account offering and costs \u00a319 a month, plus an extra \u00a33 for those who don't pay in \u00a31,500 a month.\n\nIn return, customers get Axa travel insurance, AA breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance and some of the same benefits of Club Lloyds, but not the 15 per cent cashback offers.\n\nAfter a slightly fallow summer, a number of banks now offer appetising switch offers if you are looking to change your current account provider.\n\nHSBC offers \u00a3175 to those who switch to its Advance Bank Account, which requires you to pay in \u00a31,750 a month or \u00a310,500 in six months, and which also gives you access to a 5 per cent regular saver which lets you stash away between \u00a325 and \u00a3250 a month for a year.\n\nMeanwhile, NatWest and RBS both offer \u00a3150 to switchers to any of its current accounts, from their regular Select accounts to its monthly fee Reward accounts.\n\nM&S Bank meanwhile offers \u00a3180 in gift cards if you switch and stay for 12 months. The first \u00a3100 requires you to maintain four active direct debits while the second \u00a380 instalment requires you to pay in at least \u00a31,250 a month and opt for online-only statements.\n\nFor a full list of the switching offers available and the interest-paying accounts, read This is Money's guide to the best current accounts.", "description": "Lloyds Bank has launched a \u00a3125 switching bonus for the first time  to tempt customers  to its Club Lloyds accounts.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
