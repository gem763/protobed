Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(Reuters) - Houston Astros ace Gerrit Cole shut down the Washington Nationals and gave his team control of the World Series in such impressive fashion on Sunday that he even managed to stump himself with the achievement.\n\nAfter dominating the Nationals with devastating speed and elusive movement on his pitches during Houston\u2019s 7-1 win, Cole was told that he has now tied an American League playoff record with 47 total strikeouts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Cole told reporters before a long pause. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty special. Yeah, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nWashington did not have an answer for Cole either as he returned to the form that made him baseball\u2019s most dangerous pitcher this year and gave Houston the 3-2 best-of-seven series advantage.\n\nCole logged seven innings and 110 pitches while allowing just one run and striking out nine. The significance of the performance, though, went well beyond numbers. Cole and the Astros had appeared out of character early in this series when he lost the opener by surrendering five runs, and Houston ultimately dropped the first two games. The ace\u2019s return to the mound, and to form, crystallized Houston\u2019s resurgence as they again look like the favorites and have won three straight to move within a victory of the title. \u201cWhat he did tonight, the feel for the game the importance of this game; he provided the intensity that\u2019s needed in a 2-2 series to get it to 3-2,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to how he pitched the whole season.\u201d Cole, 29, put together a career season that included a 20-5 record, the best earned run average in the AL at 2.50 and the most strikeouts in the Majors with 326.\n\nHe will be a free agent at the end of this season and will undoubtedly have suitors lined up to try to land his high-velocity pitches.\n\nThis post-season has gone a long way to stamp his arrival as a force. Cole was in true command in winning his first three playoff games before the hiccup in Game One against Washington.\n\nCole more than made amends with his Game Five performance.\n\n\u201cI thought I executed really well tonight,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThe stuff was much crisper. I made a lot of good pitches; we counted (only) three mistakes. (I was) living on corners all night and making a lot of quality pitches. That kept a lot of pressure on them, I thought.\u201d The Astros have a renewed confidence as fellow standout pitcher Justin Verlander takes the mound for Game Six on Tuesday in Houston. \u201cThis team is special,\u201d Astros reliever Joe Smith said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really lose when (Verlander) and Gerrit are on the (mound).\u201d", "description": "Houston Astros ace Gerrit Cole shut down the Washington Nationals and gave his team control of the World Series in such impressive fashion on Sunday that he even managed to stump himself with the achievement.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445756522&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0DN-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
