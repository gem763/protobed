This was also seen in patients with anxiety (32% vs. 23%) and stress (18% vs. 10%).\n\nAbout half of the patients with moderate depression or anxiety who actually completed cardiac rehabilitation did not have significant improvements in their mental health conditions.\n\nThe study was published recently in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nUnderestimated abilities\n\n\"Heart patients living with depression are more likely to feel despondent and hopeless, which reduces their ability to manage their symptoms,\" Rao said in a journal news release.\n\n\"They may minimise successes and exaggerate failures, thereby reducing their motivation to exercise and complete a cardiac rehabilitation programme,\" she explained.\n\nHeart attack survivors should receive support to quit smoking, get physically active, improve their eating habits, reduce stress, and control blood pressure and cholesterol, all of which can be accomplished through cardiac rehabilitation, the study authors noted.\n\n\"Depression can dampen positive intentions to exercise even when receiving support from health professionals and being aware of the benefits,\" Rao said. \"People with anxiety may underestimate their abilities \u2013 for example, to walk on a treadmill during a rehabilitation class.\"\n\nDoctors should screen for depression and anxiety at the start and end of cardiac rehabilitation in order to identify patients who extra help, she suggested.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "New research suggests that patients with moderate depression are much more likely to drop out of cardiac rehabilitation than those with no or mild symptoms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/dff676da427c4e5087dee8530a20f54d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
