Goodenough of the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University in Japan.\n\n\n\nGoran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the prize was about \"a rechargeable world.\" In a statement, the committee said lithium-ion batteries \"have revolutionized our lives\" -- and the laureates \"laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.\"\n\n\n\nThe Nobel committee said the lithium-ion battery has its roots in the oil crisis in the 1970s, when Whittingham was working to develop methods aimed at leading to fossil fuel-free energy technologies.\n\n\n\nThe prizes come with a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma that are conferred on Dec. 10 -- the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 -- in Stockholm and in Oslo, Norway.\n\n", "description": "3 Win Nobel in Chemistry for Work on Lithium-Ion Batteries", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/10/2019101000602_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
