In the capital, a mob of far-right anti-independence activists tried to storm a separatist protest of thousands.\n\nHealth authorities in the region say 42 people were injured on Thursday night, most of them in the capital, and regional police arrested 16 protesters, sending eight to jail, according to Spain\u2019s Interior Ministry.\n\nProtesters march into Barcelona (Joan Mateu/AP)\n\nThe caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said authorities are tracking \u201cminority groups that are provoking incidents in very specific places\u201d, vowing to punish the radicals.\n\nMore than 200 people have been arrested since separatist sentiment swelled again this week following the imprisonment of nine separatist politicians and activists who led a push for independence that triggered Spain\u2019s deepest political crisis in decades.\n\nTheir former leader, Carles Puigdemont, on Friday avoided arrest after he voluntarily gave evidence to Belgian judicial authorities over a new warrant Spain issued this week following the sentences.\n\nSpain is seeking Puigdemont on possible charges of sedition and misuse of public funds after previously failing to secure his extradition from Germany and Belgium on suspicion of rebellion.\n\nHe fled to Brussels in late 2017 following the failed attempt to establish a new European republic in the wealthy region, and has since campaigned for Catalan independence from there.\n\nCarles Puigdemont (Olivier Matthys/AP)\n\nIn May, he was elected as a European legislator, but was not sworn in because Spain\u2019s electoral board said he did not qualify for the seat by failing to show up in Madrid to swear Spain\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe Belgian judge did not put bail conditions on him while the case is being examined, making any immediate extradition unlikely.\n\nThe Spanish football federation has postponed next week\u2019s marquee game between Barcelona and Real Madrid due to a fear of more street violence in Catalonia.\n\nBarcelona were due to play at the Camp Nou on October 26 (Joan Monfort/AP)\n\nSeparatist groups have called for supporters to rally in Barcelona on October 26, the planned date of the match.\n\nThe federation, in consultation with government officials, said it is not safe to play on the same day. The clubs have until Monday to decide on another date for the game.", "description": "Flights, trains and roads were all affected on the fifth day of demonstrations.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/wire-19881812-1571398434-741_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
