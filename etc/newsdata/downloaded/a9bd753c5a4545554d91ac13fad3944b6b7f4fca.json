This time round, the novelist \u2013 Mr \u201cOprah\u2019s book club choices are \u2018schmaltzy\u2019\u201d, Mr \u201cI considered adopting an Iraqi war orphan\u201d, Mr \u201cI write in the dark with a blindfold on\u201d, Mr \u201cIt\u2019s doubtful that anyone with an Internet connection at his workplace is writing good fiction\u201d \u2013 is under fire for declaring the fight against the climate crisis to be hopeless.\n\nCiting the \u201cconsensus among scientists and policy-makers\u201d that we will pass the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for the planet \u201cif the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees\u201d, Franzen writes in the New Yorker of how \u201cas a non-scientist, I do my own kind of modelling\u201d. He has, he says, \u201crun various future scenarios through my brain\u201d and \u201ccount[ed] the scenarios in which collective action averts catastrophe\u201d.\n\nSpoiler: the Franzen Brain Model doesn\u2019t point to a joyful future for humanity.\n\n\u201cCall me a pessimist or call me a humanist, but I don\u2019t see human nature fundamentally changing anytime soon. I can run ten thousand scenarios through my model, and in not one of them do I see the two-degree target being met,\u201d he writes.\n\nMany climate scientists, however, feel that despite the number of scenarios it has run \u2013 10,000! \u2013 the Franzen Brain Model could do with a bit of tinkering. \u201cFranzen\u2019s modeling isn\u2019t scientific modeling at all. It\u2019s DAYDREAMING,\u201d wrote volcanologist Jess Phoenix on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDear @NewYorker,\u201d added water conservation specialist and MacArthur fellow Peter Gleick. \u201cThe fact that pretty much every single person who actually understands & writes about #climatechange for a living is dunking hard on the new piece by Franzen is an indication that you shouldn\u2019t just publish a piece because it\u2019s written by Franzen.\u201d\n\nDr Genevieve Guenther, founder and director of EndClimateSilence.org, says that \u201cFranzen doesn\u2019t understand how climate science works\u201d. His essay, she adds, \u201cdistorts the science\u201d, is \u201ccompletely apolitical\u201d, and \u201ccontradicts itself: is the apocalypse coming or should we all start local farmers markets?\u201d. \u201cI get it, I guess, climate science is hard. But if you\u2019re going to write about climate science for the New Yorker, you should really get it right,\u201d she says.\n\nOr as one wag put it: \u201cThat Franzen climate change article could really use some \u2013 *puts on sunglasses* \u2013 Corrections.\u201d", "description": "\u2018As a non-scientist, I do my own kind of modelling,\u2019 claimed the author in the New Yorker, sparking a flurry of mockery online", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f3cd7a0106809df4f3973473243040afd9df40/0_1233_3581_2148/master/3581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cecce47a6268f1b01ab5e58ff85d0da9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
