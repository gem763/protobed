REUTERS/Jim Young\n\nStanford University Graduate School of Education professor Sean Reardon and his team crunched hundreds of millions of standardized test scores from every public school in the United States from 2008 to 2016 to reach their conclusions.\n\nThe findings reinforced previous studies illustrating that poverty, linked to continuing segregation, is a key mechanism accounting for racial disparities in academic achievement.\n\n\u201cIf we want to improve educational opportunities and learning for students, we want to get them out of these schools of high-concentrated poverty,\u201d Reardon said in presenting his findings at Stanford on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why we have a big achievement gap is that minority students are concentrated in high-poverty schools, and those schools are the schools that seem systematically to provide lower educational opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students tend to score lower on standardized tests than white students, and closing that achievement gap has posed a persistent challenge for educators.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in its landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education ruled that racial segregation was a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment.\n\nIn the decades that followed, public education officials wrestled with how to integrate schools in the face of opposition by residents and politicians in many regions.\n\nThis history became a point of contention between Democratic presidential candidates during a televised debate in June, when U.S. Senator Kamala Harris criticized former Vice President Joe Biden for his 1970s opposition to court-ordered busing to reduce segregation.\n\nIn a working paper released on Monday, Reardon and his team compared different levels of racial disparities between schools in New York City and those in Fulton County, Georgia, to explain how segregation affected student performance.\n\nThe school attended by the average black student in New York City over a recent span of eight years had a poverty rate 22 percentage points higher than that of the average white student. There researchers found white students performing 2-1/2 grade levels above black students on average.\n\nBy comparison, the average black student attended a school with a poverty rate 52 percentage points higher than the average white student\u2019s school in Fulton County, where an achievement gap of four grade levels separated black and white students.\n\nGary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles and not affiliated with the Stanford study, endorsed the methodology Reardon\u2019s team used but said its findings reveal only part of the picture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really misleading to talk about whether race or poverty is most important, because a lot of the poverty is caused by race, and that\u2019s something that people need to keep in mind,\u201d Orfield said.\n\nFor instance, discrimination against minority parents is a factor in why those families are more likely to struggle with poverty, Orfield said by telephone.\n\nThe Stanford research data is publicly available at the website edopportunity.org.", "description": "Segregation in U.S. public education has concentrated black and Hispanic children into high-poverty schools with few resources, leading to an achievement gap between minority and white students, a nationwide study showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433610053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O03H", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
