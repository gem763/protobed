People should stay outside for now,\u201d said Renato Solidum, head of the Philippines\u2019 seismology institute.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said the initial quake was followed by a number of smaller shakes, including one of 5.8 magnitude.\n\nThe continuing tremors were causing anxiety on the ground, with people refusing to go back inside buildings for fear of being caught in any resulting collapse.\n\nSchools across the area have been shuttered as a precaution.\n\nThe area is still suffering the effects of a 6.4-magnitude quake that hit less than two weeks ago, killing at least five people and damaging dozens of buildings.\n\nResidents fled homes across the Mindanao region and a mall caught fire in the city of General Santos shortly after the quake struck on October 16.\n\nThe Philippines is part of the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.\n\nOne of the deadliest quakes to hit the Philippines recently was in April, provoking the collapse of a building near the capital Manila.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed when the building pancaked in the worst-hit Pampanga province.\n\nHigh-rise structures in the capital swayed after the April quake, leaving some with large cracks in their walls.\n\nThousands of travellers were stranded after aviation authorities shut down the secondary Clark Airport, which is located on the site of the former US military installation that lies about an hour\u2019s drive north of the capital.", "description": "Manila (AFP) \u2013 A 6.6-magnitude quake struck the southern Philippines Tuesday, geologists said, causing injuries and damaging buildings in a region", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/54b60f_powerful-quake-caused-panic-in-parts-mindanao-shaking-buildings-sending-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
