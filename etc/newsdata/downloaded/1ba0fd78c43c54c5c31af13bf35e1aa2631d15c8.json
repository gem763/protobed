He also warns that some therapists are pushing ineffective 'homeopathic vaccines' which leave patients exposed to deadly diseases such as measles.\n\nBut the Society of Homeopaths \u2013 the UK's largest group of registered practitioners \u2013 insists it does not promote any treatment contrary to NHS guidance, including vaccinations.\n\nMr Stevens' intervention comes two weeks after the Mail launched a major campaign to improve the uptake of childhood immunisations.\n\nOn Saturday, this newspaper revealed that retail giant Amazon was printing and selling a controversial children's book which claims vaccinations are dangerous and useless.\n\nDaily Mail Campaign: Give The Children Their Jabs\n\nHomeopathy is the 220-year-old principle of using highly diluted substances \u2013 such as plants or animal tissue \u2013 which practitioners claim encourage the body to heal itself. Prince Charles has been a vocal supporter of the practice for decades and in June, became patron of the Faculty of Homeopathy, another organisation dedicated to its promotion.\n\nBut there is no firm evidence homeopathy works and two years ago, the NHS told GPs to stop prescribing the remedies, claiming they were a 'misuse of resources'.\n\nNonetheless, there are still hundreds of practitioners across the UK, including 1,200 who are registered with the Society of Homeopaths.\n\nNHS chief executive Mr Stevens has today written to the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), urging it not to re-accredit the society in its annual review.\n\nThe PSA is the official regulator of healthcare and oversees bodies including the General Medical Council, for doctors, and the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\n\nBelief that the body can heal itself Samuel Hahnemann developed homeopathy in the late 18th century Homeopathy was developed in the late 18th century by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann, who was dissatisfied with the medicine of his day. The basic beliefs behind homeopathy are that the body can cure itself and that 'like cures like'. In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can \u2013 in a very small dose \u2013 treat an illness with similar symptoms, by triggering the body's natural defences. For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That's why it is used in homeopathic remedies for allergies. Dr Hahnemann published an overview of his new medical system in his 1810 book, The Organon of the Healing Art, whose sixth edition, published in 1921, is still used today.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Stevens says he has 'serious concerns' about the society's inclusion because the practice of homeopathy remained 'fundamentally flawed.'\n\nHe said its accreditation would give a 'false impression' to patients that homeopathic remedies are as trusted as the treatments used by doctors, nurses and other professionals on the register.\n\n'This is a vital issue at a time when there is a rise of misinformation about vaccines \u2013 some of which is apparently promoted by homeopaths \u2013 and which poses a significant danger to human health,' he adds.\n\nEmphasising his point last night, Mr Stevens said: 'Anything that gives homeopathy a veneer of credibility risks chancers being able to con more people into parting with their hard-earned cash in return for bogus treatments which at best do nothing, and at worst can be potentially dangerous.'\n\nThe Society of Homeopathy's official stance on vaccinations is that homeopaths should not advise patients against the use of jabs, as this would be 'unethical'.\n\nBut Mr Stevens is concerned that many homeopaths are independently peddling anti-vaccine myths to patients.\n\nThe PSA, which reviews the accreditation of all organisations on its register every 12 months, said it would not comment on any 'live cases' involving 'applications under assessments'.\n\nBut Michael Marshall, of pro-science charity Good Thinking, said: 'Any organisation or any practitioner who is spreading anti-vaxx myths is particularly dangerous right now.'\n\nThe Mail is urging the Government to launch a mass publicity drive advocating the safety of vaccines.", "description": "NHS chief Simon Stevens has urged the medical watchdog to de-list the Society of Homeopaths from its official register of professional organisations after he described some of them as 'chancers'.", "authors": ["Sophie Borland Health Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20255744-0-image-a-30_1572211831747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
