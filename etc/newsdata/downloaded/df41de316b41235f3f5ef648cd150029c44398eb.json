Though the passengers are distraught at first, they gradually become encouraged to start their own dance party before taking the revelry, flash-mob-style, to the field outside.\n\nGalantis, meanwhile, join the festivities from atop the bus. The duo and Parton are also joined by Dutch singer-songwriter Mr. Probz, who drops by for a guest appearance.\n\nParton teased the collaboration while discussing her latest projects at an Oct. 12 appearance at the Grand Old Opry, where she was celebrating 50 years as a member.\n\n\u201cI have another song that\u2019s going to drop right away, a few days before the CMAs, and it is called \u2018Faith.\u2019 It\u2019s a great old song,\u201d she said. \u201cI have that one out with a group called Galantis, which I\u2019m singing with a guy named Mr. Probz.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis world is just so dark and ugly and awful ... so I\u2019m going to make it my business to try to do songs that are more uplifting,\u201d she added. \u201cDo better, and have a little more love, a little more light and don\u2019t be so dark and dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cFaith\u201d is the first taste of Galantis\u2019 forthcoming album, \u201cChurch,\u201d due out in 2020. The duo, which comprises Christian Karlsson and Linus Ekl\u00f6w, said the followup to 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Aviary\u201d doesn\u2019t \u201crefer to a building or specific religion, but instead to people banded together in similar belief for a better humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to have meaning behind our music,\u201d the pair added in a press release. \u201cWhether it\u2019s advocating peace, change, or just lifting each other up \u2014 that is our \u2018Faith\u2019 and \u2018Church.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatch the \u201cFaith\u201d video below.", "description": "The country queen and the Swedish duo joined forces for \"Faith,\" a club-friendly reworking of a John Hiatt classic.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db2f7de2000009228506c78.jpeg?cache=i1uc8tjr7b&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
