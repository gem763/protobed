The second set proved even easier, as Osaka bageled Gauff, who failed to win a single game.\n\nRead more: Stefanos Tsitsipas called the umpire a 'weirdo' in humiliating US Open loss, one month after Nick Kyrgios said he was a bad influence on the young player\n\nAfter the match, Osaka and Gauff talked at the net.

I was just thinking, like, it would be nice for her to address the people that came and watched her play.\n\n\"They were cheering for her. Yeah, I mean, for me, it was just something that was, I don't know, instinctive I guess.\"\n\nGauff said: \"I think she really showed sportsmanship tonight. I mean, I wasn't expecting it. I'm glad that I was able to experience that moment. I'm glad the crowd was kind of helping me and her. She was crying, she won. I was crying.
