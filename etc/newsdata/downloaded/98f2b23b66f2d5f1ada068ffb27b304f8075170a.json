Some of the women are described as dangerous extremists in their own right, not merely passive ISIS brides:\n\nRadicalized women, including some who have been accused of killing other prisoners they say are not adhering to Isis\u2019s strict ideology, believe Isis sleeper cells in the area will attack the Kurdish guards and free those inside in the next two days, a woman who has been held alongside them said via WhatsApp message. \u201cThey know the Turkish campaign has begun,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAfter living in this horrible place for months they are ready to take this opportunity to break out.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. removed at least two exceptionally dangerous ISIS operatives from Syria before the Turkish invasion began. El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, the two surviving members of a cell known as the \u201cISIS Beatles,\u201d were evacuated from Syria to Iraq \u201cin case the Kurds or Turkey lose control,\u201d as President Donald Trump put it.\n\nThe U.S. reportedly plans to bring them to Virginia, which allows the death penalty, to stand trial even though they were British nationals before they were stripped of their citizenship.", "description": "Kurdish officials in Syria accuse the invading Turks of shelling the Chirkin prison, which is filled with captive Islamic State jihadis.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/artillery-turkey-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
