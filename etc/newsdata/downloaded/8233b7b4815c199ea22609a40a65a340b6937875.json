The social networking service\u2019s rules against platform manipulation prohibit users from engaging in \u201cbulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity that misleads others and/or disrupts their experience.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi-born dissident and U.S. resident, was killed last year after entering a Saudi Arabian consulate building in Turkey. American and Turkish officials have since concluded that his murder was ordered by Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, and have taken action against several of his associates held responsible, including Mr. al-Qahtani, the leader\u2019s former aide and adviser.\n\nMr. al-Qahtani worked for years under Saudi leadership prior to being fired shortly following Khashoggi\u2019s murder last October. Turkish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest weeks later, and the U.S. State Department sanctioned Mr. al-Qahtani in April, effectively barring him and his family from entering the United States.\n\nThe account belonging to Mr. al-Qahtani had been dormant for a year before being suspended, CNN reported.\n\nTwitter said Friday that it separately identified and suspended a handful of accounts that masqueraded as independent news outlets but that were connected to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cWhile active, the accounts in this set presented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government,\u201d said Twitter.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nHundreds of other Twitter accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Spain, Ecuador, China and Hong Kong have been recently punted for engaging in prohibited information operations, the social networking service said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
