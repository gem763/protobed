(AP) - Sam Darnold was in the middle of a ghastly performance when he took a seat on the sideline and tried to figure out what was happening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing ghosts,\u201d said the New York Jets second-year quarterback who was wearing a microphone for the ESPN broadcast.\n\nWell, he definitely saw plenty of Patriots. New England blitzed Darnold early and often, and Bill Belichick\u2019s defense forced him into five turnovers in an embarrassing 33-0 loss Monday night.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to the coaches, I\u2019ve just got to be straight up,\u201d Darnold said after the game when asked about his comment. \u201cFor me, I\u2019ve just got to see the field a lot better. That\u2019s kind of what that means.\n\n\u201cIt was a rough night out there, and obviously, I\u2019ve got to be better and learn from the mistakes, but we will get better.\u201d\n\nDarnold was coming off an inspiring return when he was selected as the AFC offensive player of the week after leading New York to a 24-22 win - the Jets\u2018 first of the season - over Dallas last Sunday after missing three games with mononucleosis.\n\nBut, he was downright miserable against New England, finishing 11 of 32 for 86 yards with four interceptions and a horrific 3.6 quarterback rating in arguably his worst game of his young NFL career.\n\n\u201cI definitely think I was pressing too hard,\u201d Darnold said, \u201ctrying to get a 24-point score in one play.\u201d\n\nDarnold had little time as the Patriots forced him into bad - and often ugly - throws.\n\n\u201cI mean, they\u2019re the best (defense) in the league right now,\u201d coach Adam Gase said. \u201cWe helped them out a lot.\u201d\n\nDevin McCourty, Duron Harmon, Stephon Gilmore and Terrence Brooks all had interceptions. Darnold also lost a fumble on a sack, and later knocked an errant snap out of the back of the end zone for a safety.\n\n\u201cObviously, that was brutal,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do anything right. All three phases, we were bad. It was just a bad performance.\u201d\n\nGase said Darnold injured a toe during the game, but the doctors wrapped it up and he went back in. The coach also acknowledged he thought about pulling Darnold and putting in backup David Fales, but decided to leave him in to try to get some positive momentum.\n\nIt never came, especially since New England took control from the start.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that at all,\u201d Gase said. \u201cNothing went right early and we couldn\u2019t regroup.\u201d\n\nTom Brady and the Patriots went 78 yards on 16 plays while eating up 8:47 on the opening drive of the game, and converted four third downs along the way. The last came on third-and-2 when Brady pitched it to Sony Michel, who scored the first of his three touchdowns.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t come to play,\u201d safety Jamal Adams said of the Jets\u2018 overall performance. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d\n\nNew England made it 10-0 a few minutes later after McCourty intercepted Darnold\u2019s first pass of the game, coming on the Jets\u2018 second play from scrimmage. New England turned the turnover into a 34-yard field goal by Mike Nugent.\n\nLeading 17-0, New England took advantage of another turnover by Darnold on the Jets\u2018 next drive when John Simon popped the ball out of the quarterback\u2019s hand for a strip-sack and Kyle Van Noy recovered. The Patriots took over and Michel later ran it in from the 1 to make it 24-0 with 9:18 left in the first half.\n\nDarnold\u2019s third turnover came on the Jets\u2018 next possession when his throw to the end zone was intercepted by Harmon. Gilmore picked off Darnold on New York\u2019s opening drive of the second half.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, bro, there\u2019s always games like that where you don\u2019t play well and now you know, you can only play better from here on out. You can\u2019t play worse than you played tonight,\u2019\u201d running back Le\u2019Veon Bell said. \u201cI think he learned a lot from tonight. Sometimes you got to have that from a young player. I had games like that and it made me better.\u201d\n\nDarnold was far from the only one to blame. The play calling by Gase was suspect, as was the suddenly porous defense - which had a tough time stopping the Patriots despite getting linebacker C.J. Mosley back from a groin injury that sidelined him since the opener.\n\n\u201cIt was a collective effort,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI\u2019m sure when we go revisit this we\u2019re going to have to take a deep dive in game planning. \u2026 We have to get some things straightened out. We just didn\u2019t give our guys enough answers.\u201d\n\nThe Jets now have a short week to prepare for a road game at Jacksonville on Sunday.\n\nFirst, they need to put their brutal prime-time showing behind them.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we wanted. But we\u2019ve got to go back to the drawing board and put our head down and grind.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Darnold was in the middle of a ghastly performance when he took a seat on the sideline and tried to figure out what was happening.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/patriots_jets_football_06667_c0-92-2212-1382_s1200x700.jpg?a9b1b277b8aa21f5f152dafba270588548fc7240", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
