These are the companies that will get the biggest boost.", "language": "en", "text": "US manufacturing may have just contracted for the first time in years, but Goldman Sachs says now is time to buy exposure to the sector, which is positioned to trounce the rest of the market.\n\nWhen factory activity falls, investors often fret about the health of the economy and reason that it must be getting worse. But David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist, says it's more likely stocks will rally. Further, he thinks the industrial sector \u2014 which has a high concentration of manufacturers \u2014 will lead the way.\n\nThat's because in recent decades, manufacturing slumps in the US have been short-lived and haven't led to recessions. Kostin said he was especially optimistic about aerospace and defense companies, which stand to benefit from rising defense spending by the government.\n\n\"During the past 10 years, Aerospace & Defense has been least sensitive to US and global economic growth across Industrials subsectors,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Outside of recessions, Aerospace & Defense has outpaced the S&P 500 by a median of 250 bp during the 6-month period when the ISM fell from 50 to its trough.\"\n\nRead more: The president of a $4.7 billion firm told us where he's investing and why he's staying calm in a time of 'escalating panic' in markets\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's purchasing-managers index is the most closely watched indicator of US manufacturing, and when its monthly reading is under 50, it means activity is decreasing.\n\nBut Kostin said it has a mixed track record at predicting recessions, and since 1990, it's usually been \"wrong.\" He backs up that point with this chart.\n\nISM and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\nKostin said that when the ISM gauge contracts, and the economy doesn't go into a recession, the S&P 500 usually climbs 6% over the next six months, and 22% over the following 12 months.\n\nIn other words, while lower readings do hurt industrial stocks for a time, that just sets the stage for future rallies as the economy keeps growing, he said. He expects a similar outcome now and has a 3,100 target for the S&P 500 at the end of 2019, and 3,400 at the end of 2020.\n\nKostin details the industrial sector's historic performance this way:\n\n\"The sector lags when the ISM falls,\" he said. \"However, Industrials has led the S&P 500 by a median of 110 bp and 210 bp six and 12 months after the ISM has fallen below 50 outside of recessions, driven by Aerospace & Defense.\"\n\nKostin's favorites\n\nHe said his top picks among industrials were the aircraft-component maker TransDigm, the shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries, and the defense contractor Northrop Grumman. Kostin described those as the aerospace and defense stocks with the least exposure to the Asia-Pacific region, meaning they're less vulnerable to the US-China trade war.\n\nThe other members of the S&P 500 aerospace and defense index are as follows:", "description": "Goldman says a dip for US manufacturers doesn't signal a recession, and rising aerospace stocks will help the sector beat the broader market.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7679f52e22af714f47bc64-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
