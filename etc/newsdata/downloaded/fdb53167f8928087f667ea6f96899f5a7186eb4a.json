It really kicked off in 2014, when the company started making its own branded smart TVs that would run Roku software and be produced by Chinese manufacturers like Hisense and TCL. The company went public in 2017 after becoming profitable for the first time at the end of 2016.\n\nRead more: Roku has skyrocketed 240% this year. We spoke to 3 experts about why, and what investors should be looking for in the future.\n\nFor years, Roku made money in three main ways: selling streaming hardware, selling content sold through its software, and advertising. But thanks to moves made last year and this past week, Roku is trying to move into a new category that could prove lucrative in the long run.\n\nPutting sound to the picture\n\nThis week, Roku announced two new home-audio products: a Smart Soundbar, and a Wireless Subwoofer.\n\nThese new speakers arrive just one year after the company released its first-ever audio products. Roku unveiled a pair of wireless speakers that work with your TV last July.\n\nIn true Roku fashion, the entire audio lineup is affordable:\n\nThe Smart Soundbar costs $180.\n\nThe Wireless Subwoofer costs $180.\n\nThe pair of wireless speakers cost $200 in total (you can get them for $150 until the end of September).\n\nSonos is one of the perennial leaders in the home-audio space, so let's compare Roku's prices above to Sonos' equivalent products.\n\nSonos' compact soundbar, the Beam, costs $400. Its high-end Playbar costs $700.\n\nSonos' subwoofer, the Sub, costs $700.\n\nSonos' wireless speakers, the One SL and One, cost $180 or $200 for a single speaker. They cost $360 or $400 for the pair.\n\nThe price is right\n\nIf you're in the market for home audio, and you're not an audiophile (and who wants to be that annoying, really), you're probably going to find Roku's products are \"good enough\" for what you need. Sonos speakers might have a bit more panache, but let's face it: Speakers are meant to be an accent to a room, not the main attraction. If you're using these speakers for your TV, you should be looking at the screen anyway.\n\nThis is a really smart move for Roku. There aren't too many affordable options in the home-audio space, but there should be \u2014 and Roku could fill a huge need there for people who want better sound in their homes but don't want to spend $1,000 to get there.\n\nLook at it this way: You can buy all of Roku's audio products\u2014 the Smart Soundbar, Wireless Subwoofer, and the pair of Wireless Speakers \u2014 for less than the price of just one Sonos subwoofer, or that high-end Playbar.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what critics think of Roku's latest offerings, and how they stack up to more expensive competitors like Sonos. But Roku has a great reputation for making quality, affordable TV products, and these prices seem like a slam dunk for both the company and consumers \u2014 especially if other companies start changing their own prices to match Roku's.", "description": "This week, Roku announced two new home-audio products: a Smart Soundbar, and a Wireless Subwoofer.
