I think our guys will be very focused this week.\u201d\n\nDetroit, meanwhile, failed to keep an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter at Arizona and wound up in a tie.\n\nTo make the setback sting even more for the Lions, they made an ill-timed decision with 2:47 left. With the play clock winding down, Matthew Stafford snapped the ball just after a timeout was called and completed a third-and-5 pass that would have picked up a first down and put Detroit in a favorable position to win.\n\nStafford appeared to scream, \u201ctrust me,\u201d on the sideline because the 11-year veteran wanted the coaches to let him manage the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about that,\u201d Stafford insisted days later, surrounded by reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved past it, probably better than you guys.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch when the Lions (0-0-1) host Los Angeles (1-0) on Sunday at Ford Field:\n\nON THE RUN\n\nDespite the absence of holdout Melvin Gordon, the Chargers averaged 6 yards per carry in Week 1. Justin Jackson gained 9-plus yards each time he was handed the ball, and Ekeler had 58 yards rushing. Ekeler finished with career highs in yards receiving (96), yards from scrimmage (154) and touchdowns (three) against the Colts, giving him a relative measure of fame.\n\nChargers running backs coach Alfredo Roberts had a little talk with Ekeler, trying to keep him grounded.\n\n\u201cHe said you have that cologne on,\u201d Ekeler recalled Roberts saying. \u201cIt smells good right away, but it fades. Don\u2019t drink it because it\u2019s poison.\u201d\n\nDOMINATED DT\n\nDetroit\u2019s Damon \u201cSnacks\u201d Harrison, a run-stuffing defensive tackle, took the season-opening tie personally. Harrison tweeted that he was dominated at Arizona after he made only one tackle.\n\n\u201cAnytime we don\u2019t come out with a win and we have the type of defensive performance we had, I feel like it\u2019s on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI got broad shoulders. I can take the blame.\u201d\n\nPOSSIBLY PIVOTAL\n\nLions offensive tackle Taylor Decker is coming off a lackluster game, giving up two sacks and getting called for four penalties, and he\u2019s on the injury report this week with a back injury. The timing isn\u2019t good for the player who protects Stafford\u2019s blind side because defensive ends Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa have combined for more than 70 career sacks.\n\nROAD WARRIORS\n\nLos Angeles won its last six road games in 2018 in the regular season, including second-half comebacks at Pittsburgh and Kansas City, and eight of nine away from home dating to the 2017 season. The Chargers also won at Baltimore in the playoffs before losing on the road to New England.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you try to keep your group together because you hope to carry that over, but you just don\u2019t know until you do it,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said. \u201cWhen we went on the road, at least last year, it was an, \u2018Us against the world,\u2019 mentality. That\u2019s kind of what you want.\u201d\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nDetroit is determined to run the ball more often, and successfully, with new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell. He\u2019s counting on running backs Kerryon Johnson and C.J. Anderson to control the game, taking pressure off Stafford and the passing game. Johnson and Anderson combined to run for 84 yards on 27 carries against the Cardinals, but may find more room to run in Week 2. The Chargers gave up 203 yards rushing, the second-highest total in Week 1, and allowed Marlon Mack to run for a career-high 174 yards for the Colts.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Reedy in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions got off to solid starts in their openers, building double-digit leads in the second half before blowing them and going to overtime.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/lions_cardinals_football_16863_c0-152-3649-2279_s1770x1032.jpg?0bdcd4e7975d7c87b34bee20119e15a265e746e8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
