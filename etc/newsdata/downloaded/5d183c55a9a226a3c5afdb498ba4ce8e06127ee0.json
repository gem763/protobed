The goal was Ellis\u2019 second of the season and first career in overtime.\n\nCalle Jarnkrok and captain Roman Josi each scored a power-play goal, and Juuse Saros finished with 28 saves for Nashville, which has won three in a row overall and improved to 10-0-2 in its last 12 encounters with Tampa Bay.\n\nJets 2, Flames 1 (OT)\n\nBryan Little was the overtime hero as Winnipeg rallied from a third-period deficit to beat Calgary in the Heritage Classic outdoor game in Regina, Sask.\n\nKyle Connor made a perfect pass for Little to convert on a two-on-one rush with 1:56 remaining in overtime, capping a game played amidst falling snow and before a sellout crowd of 33,518 at Mosaic Stadium, home of the Canadian Football League\u2019s Saskatchewan Roughriders.\n\nJets goalie Connor Hellebuyck stopped 29 shots for the win in what became an entertaining goaltending battle despite the poor ice conditions.

Armia also had an assist. Carey Price made 29 saves for the Canadiens, who had lost their two previous games.\n\nJake Muzzin and Andreas Johnsson scored for the Maple Leafs, but it was Muzzin\u2019s turnover that allowed Armia to score just seven seconds into the third for the eventual winner.\n\nHurricanes 4, Blackhawks 0\n\nAndrei Svechnikov scored twice, and Petr Mrazek stopped 32 shots as Carolina halted a three-game losing streak in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nNino Niederreiter and Jordan Staal also scored for the Hurricanes, who tallied twice on the power play.
