Start the day with a bigger breakfast\n\nWhile there's been much made of intermittent fasting of late, this doesn't work for all.\n\nSusie said those who are hungry or who workout earlier in the day should make breakfast a priority - and ensure it's a decent size.\n\nThe benefits of a larger breakfast is that it helps curb mid-morning cravings as well as keeping your metabolism firing till lunchtime.\n\n'Aim for fibre and protein-rich options such as protein bread with nut spread and banana, a banana and yoghurt smoothie or a couple of eggs with fruit salad to keep you full and satisfied throughout the morning,' Susie wrote on her blog.\n\nThe benefits of a larger breakfast are it will help curb mid-morning cravings and keep your metabolism firing till lunchtime (stock image)\n\n2. Ditch milk-laden coffee\n\nSusie said if you're trying to lose weight, ditch milky coffees as these packed with calories (stock image)\n\nA daily cafe-made coffee might be a small indulgence, however, it can be one that comes with a hefty calorie hit.\n\nFor instance, a latte can come with as many calories as a piece of toast, Susie revealed.\n\nShe said coffee-lovers don't need to give up caffeine entirely, rather they should choose varieties that don't contain as much milk.\n\nSusie also advised counting milk-based coffees as a part of a meal to make sure you're taking the extra calories into account.\n\nYour go-to coffee ranked on calories, sugar and fat content: Coffee: Calories/KJ Sugar (grams): Fat (grams): Flavoured shot 220/795 27 9 Chai latte 190/795 20 9 Cappucino 120/490 10 6 Long black 0 0 0 Flat white 120/490 10 6 Skim latte 60/250 8 1 Piccolo 60/116 5 3 *Sizes based on regular cup Source: Geraldine Georgeou via Daily Mail Australia\n\n3. Eat lunch by 1pm at the latest\n\nIt can be tricky making lunch a priority, especially if you're busy and feel you can't leave the office.\n\nHowever, Susie said if you're trying to beat sugar and junk food cravings which can hit later in the day, eating your lunch by 1pm is key.\n\nShe said forego salads and sushi for a meal that's a substantial 350-400 calories.\n\nLeftovers, stir fry, salad and a wrap or soup and crackers are just some of her recommendations.\n\n4. Halve your dinner\n\nEating dinner later and making this meal the largest of the day is a sure-fire way to pack on the pounds.\n\nSusie said those who eat regular meals throughout the day along with small snacks should always aim to keep dinner light.\n\n'A light, small meal at night will ensure you wake hungry for a big breakfast, and will support you in achieving a calorie deficit and weight loss as a result,' she said.\n\nSusie advised a meal consisting of lean meat or fish teamed with fresh salad and vegetables.\n\nSusie said one of the easiest dietary strategies you can adopt when trying to shift weight quickly is to replace a meal with soup or salad (stock image)\n\n5. Make one meal soup or salad\n\nAccording to Susie, one of the easiest dietary strategies you can adopt when trying to shift weight quickly is to replace a meal with soup or salad.\n\nVegetable-based soups or salads are low in calories but nutrient-dense, so it's possible to fill-up on large portions without fear of putting on weight.\n\n'Whether you choose a rich vegetable soup for dinner or a leafy green or roasted vegetable salad for lunch, your total calorie intake will be significantly reduced when you bump up the vegetable content of your diet,' she said.", "description": "Australian dietitian Susie Burrell has revealed the five things you can do if you're trying to get in shape for summer.
