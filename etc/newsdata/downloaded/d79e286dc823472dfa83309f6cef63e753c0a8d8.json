Maths will be compulsory for every student across the state, from Kindergarten to Year 12, happening just as soon as the government figures out how to make it happen. (Talking to key stakeholders, making sure there\u2019s enough maths teachers, that kind of thing.)\n\nThe move, championed by Premier Gladys Berejiklian, is designed to prep kids with the numeracy skills to \u201csucceed in today\u2019s society\u201d, and is part of the state government\u2019s \u201creturn to basics\u201d push on maths, English and science.\n\nREAD MORE All The Weird Things We Did While Studying That Seemed Totally Normal At The Time\n\n\u201cMy vision is for every child in NSW to have the necessary maths skills to succeed in life, whether that\u2019s managing home budgets or preparing them for the jobs of the future in science, technology and engineering,\u201d Berejiklian said in a statement.\n\nNSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell described maths as \u201ca companion for life\u201d, which sounds desperately lonely.\n\n\u201cWhether you are a carpenter or a software engineer, maths is a companion for life, we want to make sure that the new curriculum provides a level of maths concepts that will help every NSW student succeed in life after school,\u201d she said.\n\nHOWEVER \u2013 and here\u2019s the weird bit \u2013 maths might not count towards your ATAR. It\u2019s all a bit confusing, and sounds like the government is still working out the details.\n\n\u201cWhilst we would like to see all HSC students study a form of maths in years 11 and 12 \u2013 this won\u2019t involve forcing them to take maths as a unit of study for their HSC, nor will it necessarily count toward their ATAR,\u201d Mitchell told the SMH.\n\nSo it\u2019s an\u2026. extra subject? Fun.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear answer yet on when maths will become compulsory, but if you\u2019re a young person reading this, there\u2019s probably still time to convince your parents to move interstate.
