He was hired in August 2017. He was issued an administrative complaint and stripped of his badge and firearm before he resigned.\n\nMr Kraus said he sent a preliminary report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a possible civil rights investigation and is recording Mr Dean's departure as a dishonourable discharge.\n\nThe department is co-ordinating two separate but concurrent investigations, one through the department\u2019s major case unit and another through the internal affairs unit.\n\nDavid Cooke, Forth Worth city manager, said he would begin reviewing candidates to operate a city-run office to investigate police misconduct and other issues next month. Civil rights groups had recommended the city hire a third-party monitor, and officials approved the position in its latest city budget. Mr Cooke said a third-party group of national experts will determine that position\u2019s best practices as the monitor enters office.\n\nForth Worth mayor Besty Priece said the \u201centire city is in pain\u201d following the death of Ms Jefferson, who was shot through a window while she was inside her own home on Saturday morning.\n\nMayor Price apologised to Ms Jefferson\u2019s family and neighbours and said there was \u201cnothing to justify what happened\u201d.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 October, a neighbour called a non-emergency line to request a check after he had noticed that lights were on and a front door was open at his neighbour's home, where Ms Jefferson\u2019s elderly mother lived.\n\nMs Jefferson had moved into the home to take care of her mother, who was recently moved to a hospital.\n\nOfficers arrived on the property within minutes after the call. Ms Jefferson was playing a video game with her eight-year-old nephew.\n\nThe killing was captured on Mr Dean\u2019s body-worn camera, which shows his flashlight moving in the dark to the home\u2019s window before he fires.\n\nMr Dean does not identify himself to Ms Jefferson when he screams for her to \"put your hands up\" and \u201cshow me your hands\u201d. While in the middle of saying \"show me\" for the second time, he fires through the window.\n\nIn a press conference on Monday morning, family attorney Lee Merrit said police arrived on the property as if they were performing a \u201cclandestine\u201d operation, despite the neighbour's phone call never indicating that there was a threat to his life or a danger to the community.\n\nMr Merritt said: \"To escalate that situation as they entered the property, that is unacceptable.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, the police department issued a statement that said the officer had \"perceived a threat\". Mr Merritt argues the department's officers had \"violated their training over and over again\".\n\nMr Merritt said Ms Jefferson had opened the doors to let in a cool breeze, the first of the season following a hot summer. While playing a Call of Duty video game, she approached the window when she heard noises outside.\n\nBodycam footage provided by police ends after the shot is fired.\n\nMr Merritt said he \u201cwould love to hear the conversation from other officers\u201d who were present at the scene who likely knew that what had happened was wrong. \u201cThis a problematic police department.\"\n\nReports following the shooting said a gun was recovered inside the home. Mayor Price said \u201cthe gun is irrelevant. She was in her own home.\u201d\n\n\u201cMere words are not enough\u201d, she said. \u201cWe are taking immediate action.\u201d\n\nThe family said the department, as well as the city, can\u2019t be trusted in their ability to investigate Ms Jefferson\u2019s killing.\n\nAt least seven people have been shot by Fort Worth police since June, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\n\u201cThis family is outraged and hurt\u201d, Mr Merritt said. \u201cWe ask people who are outraged to channel their anger and direct it to policymakers and substantive changes.\u201d", "description": "The white police officer who shot and killed a black woman in Fort Worth, Texas while she was playing with her nephew inside her own home has resigned from the department and may face federal civil rights charges.Ed Kraus, interim chief of Fort Worth Police Department, said he had planned to fire the", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fY4tj.hyuaFqfSFoCTgn0g--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/02f638b0c1bba4438e37f553f085925c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
