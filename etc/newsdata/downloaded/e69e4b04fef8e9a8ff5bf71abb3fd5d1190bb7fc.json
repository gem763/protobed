We use a lot of anaesthetic in the springtime, we would be lambing, calving, dehorning calves.\"\n\nDr Sophie Aylett, who owns an independent farm animal vet practice in the Midlands with her husband, believes similar problems could arise in autumn - the time when the UK is due to leave the EU.\n\n\"We are approaching autumn and vaccine booster times,\" she said. \"In late autumn, farms start to bring cattle into sheds to avoid the worst of the winter weather.\n\n\"By necessity this increases stocking density and cow to cow contact, therefore creating a higher risk of infectious disease transmission such as pneumonia. Normally farmers can vaccinate at-risk animals in advance but if there is a delay, it could affect their ability to do so, and consequently adversely affect animal welfare.\"\n\nAdvice for pet owners\n\nAnd it is not just farmers who should be concerned about no deal, according to Mr Doherty, who said it could affect animals \"across the board\" - including zoo animals and pets.\n\n\"It's not as if there will be sudden parvovirus outbreaks in dogs. But where there could be potential problems, is if there isn't a supply of vaccines for an animal to get its booster at a particular time.\"\n\nHe does not anticipate there will be a shortage of cat and dog medicines, but the advice to pet owners would be to speak to their vet if they are concerned.\n\nMeanwhile, for pets undergoing longer-term treatment, he added: \"Don't leave the next prescription until you have got one tablet left.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nNOAH said its industry has been working on detailed planning for all Brexit scenarios.\n\nBut if there was a no-deal Brexit, there are broader issues which could affect the availability of vet medicines, it said. It also raised concerns about vaccines.\n\n\"This disruption does represent a potential risk to controlling disease and an animal welfare issue.\n\n\"If preventative medicines such as vaccines are not available, there is a greater risk of disease in the population. This could increase the risk of its spread, including the spread of zoonotic infections.\"\n\nThe president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, Dr Niall Connell, said: \"As the released Operation Yellowhammer documents demonstrate, any interruption in the supply of veterinary medicines would be a threat to animal health and welfare and public health.\"\n\nThe RCVS also said it was concerned that a no-deal could be a risk to the veterinary workforce, with half of new vets recruited from elsewhere in the EU each year.", "description": "It comes after the government's Brexit assessments warn supplies could be disrupted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3238/production/_108765821_gettyimages-930116184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
