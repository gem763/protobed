Now He Needs to Earn It.", "language": "en", "text": "Federalism and multiparty elections were introduced to Ethiopia in 1995, but it is only now that genuine democracy appears imaginable in Africa\u2019s second most populous country. The long-dominant Ethiopian Peoples\u2019 Revolutionary Democratic Front (E.P.R.D.F.), born as a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist coalition, never fully bought into the liberal democratic principles it introduced in the 1995 Constitution; it essentially ruled the country by semi-authoritarian means. For many years, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (T.P.L.F.), which claims to represent the interests of the people from Tigray, a northern state bordering Eritrea \u2014 about 6 percent of the population \u2014 essentially monopolized decision-making within the governing coalition. Over time, this form of minority rule alienated the Oromo people (more than 34 percent of the population) and the Amhara people (about 27 percent).\n\nOpposition parties rode on popular discontent with the E.P.R.D.F. in the 2005 elections. But then, after the ruling party claimed victory anyway and the opposition challenged that announcement, protests broke out and the government repressed them. Eventually, frustration led to countrywide protests between 2016 and 2018, during which Oromo youth in particular blamed the government for a lack of genuine representativeness, land grabbing and repression.\n\nThe massive demonstrations \u2014 during which more than 1,000 people were killed and 20,000 people were imprisoned \u2014 forced then Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn to resign in February 2018. When Mr. Abiy, an Oromo, took over in April, he was able to claim the helm with the backing of the Oromo and Amhara parties within the E.P.R.D.F. coalition. He has preached a political philosophy of \u201cmedemer\u201d \u2014 \u201cadding up\u201d or \u201ccoming together\u201d in Amharic \u2014 and promoted a more inclusive political culture. The idea is, in part, to transcend Ethiopia\u2019s federal system, which was drawn along ethnic lines and which over the years has infused politics with a kind of sectarian fervor.\n\nBut Mr. Abiy\u2019s Abyssinian spring has now entered a critical phase. With the sudden slackening of political controls and the dismantling of some of the state\u2019s authoritarian features under his administration, repressed ethnic, political and religious conflicts have resurfaced across the country. As a result, about 2.9 million people currently are internally displaced, according to the Global Report on Internal Displacement \u2014 the largest such figure for any country.\n\nThe E.P.R.D.F. coalition itself is still divided along ethnic lines. In some parts of Ethiopia, such as the southeastern Somali region, changes in the central government have translated into changes in regional governments, and longtime T.P.L.F. loyalists have been replaced with Abiy supporters. Yet in other areas, regional ethnic parties that are part of the E.P.R.D.F. have dug in their heels \u2014 in particular in the regions of Oromia and Amhara. Such instances of resistance have weakened the federal government and complicated its efforts to ease various conflicts or push forward with reforms.", "description": "The Abyssinian spring in Ethiopia has entered a critical phase.", "authors": ["Tobias Hagmann", "Kjetil Tronvoll"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16Hagmann/16Hagmann-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
