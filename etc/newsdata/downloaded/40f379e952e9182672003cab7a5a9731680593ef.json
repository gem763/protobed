The judges\u2019 scores at TD Garden were 29-28 across the board for \u201cEl Pantera.\u201d\n\nThe opening round was well-contested, as the two figured out their pacing and range. Stephens looked to land his trademark big bombs, while Rodriguez led his offense with kicks in order to avoid his opponents\u2019 heavy hands.\n\nThe second round, meanwhile, was a wild affair, as Rodriguez swarmed Stephens, dropped him, and then spent roughly half the round raining down strikes on Stephens. Referee Kevin MacDonald smartly let the fight continue, as Stephens never stopped trying to improve his position. By round\u2019s end, Stephens was the one dishing out the offense.\n\nThe third round was nearly all Stephens, as he kept looking for the finish. But he never got it, and Rodriguez\u2019s work in the first half of the fight held the day.\n\n\u201cI was kind of compromised because I was down most of the round, but I never felt in danger,\u201d Rodriguez said of the final round. \u201cI just stayed as safe as possible and win the fight.\u201d\n\nThe original matchup, at UFC Mexico on Sept. 21, ended in a no contest in just 15 seconds following a vicious eye poke by Rodriguez, which led to an ugly post-fight scene.\n\nRodriguez had his sixth career decision win, while Stephens has now dropped three straight fights.\n\nGallery Yair Rodriguez def.
