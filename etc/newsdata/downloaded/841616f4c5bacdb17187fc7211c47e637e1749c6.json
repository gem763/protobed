(Patricia Sullivan/TWP)\n\nLittle distinguishes Seminary Road east of Interstate 395 in Alexandria. It\u2019s a busy, four-lane street gliding through a mostly residential neighborhood, past Inova Alexandria Hospital, Beth El Hebrew Congregation, Virginia Theological Seminary and several schools.\n\nBut a proposal that would remove two driving lanes on one stretch of the road in favor of bike lanes and add a turn lane and pedestrian crossing signals has triggered a classic clash between people who say the city is ignoring motorists\u2019 needs and those who say streets must better accommodate non-drivers.\n\nThe City Council is scheduled to decide Saturday whether to move forward with its staff\u2019s original recommendation or accept the city manager\u2019s more recent advice to leave the four lanes alone, instead installing on-demand pedestrian crossing lights at two intersections.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen is two very well-organized and very passionate groups with very different ideas about how we use the roads,\u201d said Yon Lambert, Alexandria\u2019s director of transportation and environmental services.\n\nIt\u2019s a battle that has played out before in Alexandria, a 144,000-person Northern Virginia city where many value the juxtaposition of a suburban lifestyle with urban amenities, and politicians are trying to alleviate congestion with policies that encourage people to walk or use bikes when possible. There were fights over plans to narrow a portion of King Street to accommodate bike lanes, and to reduce speed limits on Quaker Lane and Seminary Road.\n\nThe city claims victory in both instances; traffic has slowed down on both streets, and more bicyclists are using King Street than had in the past, Lambert said.\n\nThe latest Seminary Road decision involves nine-tenths of a mile that is scheduled for repaving this fall. The transportation department sought public input before proposing a \u201croad diet,\u201d a term that means narrowing or removing traffic lanes to provide safer and better bicycle lanes, pedestrian paths and crossing points.\n\nThe plan to reduce the four lanes to three (one lane each way and a turn lane in the middle) and place a six-foot-wide bike lane on each side of the road enraged some residents, who persuaded 13 homeowners\u2019 associations to oppose the plan.\n\nSupporters argue that fewer lanes will slow traffic and share the road more equitably with bicyclists and walkers.\n\nBoth sides have petitions with more than 1,000 signatures in support of their respective positions. Nearly 100 people have signed up to speak Saturday on the topic, after lobbying council members all summer.\n\n\u201cI bike to work every day along here,\u201d said Lauren Jenkins, communications director for the League of American Bicyclists. She lives in a townhouse in the Seminary Hill neighborhood but is not eligible to join its civic association, which restricts membership to owners of single-family homes.\n\n\u201cCars are going very fast, over the speed limit,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWhen I come up that hill, I see [on the speed metering sign] that I\u2019m going 11 mph and cars are going by me at 42 mph.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Kay Stimpson, president of the North Ridge Civic Association, contend that trying to turn just a portion of a commuter route into a calmer street simply won\u2019t work.\n\nA better solution, Stimpson said, is a \u201croad toning,\u201d by adding more buses to existing routes and monitoring their use, as well as better traffic studies. She and others reject modeling studies that show narrowing the road would result in delays of six or seven seconds, at most.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not hearing the citizens saying, \u2018Hey, I can\u2019t get out of my driveway at rush hour in the morning,\u2019 \u201d Stimpson said.\n\nThe Seminary Road reduced-lane proposal supports Alexandria\u2019s 2008 transportation master plan, the 2014 \u201ccomplete streets\u201d policy, the 2016 pedestrian and bicyclist master plan and the 2017 Vision Zero master plan, aimed at reducing pedestrian traffic deaths. But Stimpson said resident opposition must be considered as well.\n\n\u201cWe love our bike lanes and we\u2019re all for pedestrian safety,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this decision may be a tipping point for citizens ... it\u2019s as though [the city] has a predetermined conclusion no matter what the citizens say, that they\u2019re going to put us on a road diet.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nKing Street bike lanes bother those who will lose street parking\n\nAfter years of acrimony, Cameron Run Park to add winter attractions\n\nJustin Wilson: Alexandria mayor in a hurry\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Drivers may be asked to give up traffic lanes to make more room for bicyclists, pedestrians.", "authors": ["Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_nKgB4iOnUyrn-m1xIkjg_Ex7d8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3S2RJKGWGAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
