Rival Microsoft had 15%, up from 12%. Salesforce had 11%, followed by SAP, Oracle, Alibaba, Google and IBM with single digit shares.\n\nAmazon remains the biggest player in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which covers the basic components of a cloud platform, including access to servers and storage. Amazon's share of the $32 billion market actually slipped last year to 47.8% from 49.4%. Microsoft rose to 15.5% from 12.7%. Other players in the top 5 were Alibaba, Google and IBM.\n\nAnderson said he didn't consider the change an indication that Amazon had started to lose market share.\n\n\"They have such a huge percentage of share as it stands that it's hard position to sustain,\" he said. \"So we're seeing a little bit of what I would consider normalization the market, and not really a failure by Amazon to hold market share.\"\n\nThe IaaS space, considered the core segment of the cloud market, \"is consolidating,\" Anderson said. As the market matures, says Anderson, companies are moving beyond just using IaaS to set up servers in the cloud, and have an increased appetite for higher-end services that can help them build better software.\n\n\"We're seeing some leveling between the top vendors, which is why Amazon is coming down. But Amazon's growth engine is shifting toward more of the value-added platform services.\"\n\nThat's significant for Amazon since platform-as-a-service is expected to drive more cloud growth as more businesses require more tools in setting up their infrastructure in the cloud.\n\n\"Amazon, because of its dominant position in infrastructure, is sort of a natural inheritor of the growth,\" Anderson said.\n\nGot a tip about Amazon or another tech company?
