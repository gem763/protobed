It\u2019s a storehouse of knowledge, from how venture funds really work to term sheet terms, from negotiation tactics to how to choose (and pay for) the right investment banker.\n\nFeld was generous with his time and his advice to founders, many dozens of whom had dialed in, conference call style. In fact, you can find a full transcript of our conversation right here if you\u2019re a member of Extra Crunch.\n\nIn the meantime, we thought we\u2019d highlight some of our favorite parts of the conversation. One of these touches on SoftBank, an organization that Feld knows a little better than many other investors. We also discussed what happened at WeWork and specifically the difference between a cult-like leader and a visionary \u2014 and why it\u2019s not always clear right away whether a founder is one or the other. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTC: We were just talking about startups raising too much money, and speaking of which, you were involved with SoftBank long ago. Your software company had raised capital from SoftBank, then you later worked for the company as an investor. This way predates the Vision Fund, but you did know Masayoshi Son, which makes me wonder: what do you think of how they\u2019ve been investing their capital?\n\nBF: Just for factual reference, I was initially affiliated with SoftBank with a couple of other VCs; Fred Wilson, Rich Levandov and at the time Jerry Colonna, who now runs a company called Reboot. During that period of time, a subset of us ended up starting a fund that eventually became called Mobius Venture Capital, but it was originally called SoftBank Venture Capital or SoftBank Technology Ventures. We were essentially a fund sponsored by SoftBank, so we had SoftBank money. The partners ran the fund, but we were a central part of the SoftBank ecosystem at the time. I\u2019d say that was probably \u201995, \u201996 to \u201999, 2000. We changed the name of the firm to Mobius in 2001 because it was endlessly getting confused with the other [SoftBank] fund activity.\n\nI do know a handful of the senior principals at SoftBank today very well, and I have enormous respect for them. Ron Fisher [the vice chairman of SoftBank Group] is the person I\u2019m closest to. I have enormous respect for Ron. He\u2019s one of my mentors and somebody I have enormous affection for.\n\nThere are endless piles of ink spilled on SoftBank, and there are loads of perspectives on Masa and about the Vision Fund. I would make the observation that the biggest dissonance in everything that\u2019s talked about is timeframe, because even in the 1990s, Masa was talking about a 300-year vision. Whether you take it literally or figuratively, one of Masa\u2019s powers is this incredible long arc that he operates on. Yet the analysis that we have on a continual basis externally is very short term \u2014 it\u2019s days, weeks, months.\n\nWhat Masa and the Vision Fund conceptually are playing is a very, very long-term game. Is the strategy an effective strategy? I have no idea . . . but when you start being a VC, it takes a long time to know whether you\u2019re any good at it out or not. It takes maybe a decade really before you actually know. You get a signal in five or six years. The Vision Fund is very young . . . It\u2019s [also] a different strategy than any strategy that\u2019s ever been executed before at that magnitude, so it will take a while to know whether it\u2019s a success or not. One of the things that could cause that success to be inhibited would be having too short a view on it.\n\nIf a brand-new VC or a brand new fund is measured two years in in terms of its performance, and investors look at that and that\u2019s how they decide what to do with the VC going forward, there would be no VCs. They\u2019d all be out of business because the first two years of a brand-new VC, with very few exceptions, is usually a time period that it\u2019s completely indeterminate as to whether or not they\u2019re going to be successful.\n\nTC: So many funds \u2014 not just the Vision Fund \u2014 are deploying their funds in two years, where it used to be four or five years, that it\u2019s a bit harder. When you deploy all your capital, you then need to raise funding and it\u2019s [too soon] to know how your bets are going to play out.\n\nBF: One comment on that, Connie, because I think it\u2019s a really good one: When I started, in the \u201990s, it used to be a five-year fund cycle, which is why most LP docs have a five-year commitment period for VC funds. You literally have five years to commit the capital. In the internet bubble, it\u2019s shortened to about three years, and in some cases it shortened to 12 months. At Mobius, we raised a fund in 1999 and a fund in 2000, so we had the experience of that compression.\n\nWhen we set out the raise Foundry, we decided that our fund cycle would be three years and we would be really disciplined about that. We had a model for how we were going to deploy capital from each of our funds over that period of time. It turned out that when we look back in hindsight, we raised a new fund every three years and eventually we lost a year in that cycle. We have a 2016 vintage and a 2018 vintage and it\u2019s because we really deployed the capital over 2.75 to three years . . .It eventually caught up with us.\n\nI think the discipline of trying to have time diversity against the capital that you have is super important. If you talk to LPs today, there is a lot of anxiety about the increased pace at which funds have been deployed, and there has been a two year cycle in the last kind of two iterations of this. I think you\u2019re going to start seeing that stretch back out to three years. From a time diversity perspective three years is plenty [of time] against portfolio construction. When it gets shorter, you actually don\u2019t get enough time diversity in the portfolio and it starts to inhibit you.\n\nTC: Very separately, you wrote a post about WeWork where you used the term cult of personality. For those who didn\u2019t read that post \u2014 even for those who did \u2014 could you explain what you were saying?\n\nBF: What I tried to abstract was the separation between cults of personality and thought leadership. Thought leadership is incredibly important. I think it\u2019s important for entrepreneurs. I think it\u2019s important for CEOs. I think it\u2019s important for leaders, and I think it\u2019s important for people around the system.\n\nI\u2019m a participant in the system, right? I\u2019m a VC. There are lots of different ways for me to contribute, and I think personally, rather than creating a cult of personality around myself, as a contribution factor, I think it\u2019s much better to try to provide thought leadership, including running lots of experiments, trying lots of things, being wrong a lot, and learning from it. One of the things about thought leadership that\u2019s so powerful from my frame of reference is that people who exhibit thought leadership are truly curious, are trying to learn, are looking for data, and are building feedback loops from what they\u2019re learning that then allows them to be more effective leaders in whatever role they have.\n\nCult of personality a lot of times masquerades as thought leadership . . . [but it tends] to be self-reinforcing around the awesomeness that is that person or the importance that is that person, or the correctness of the vision that person has. And what happens with cult of personality is that you very often, not always, but very often, lose the signal that allows you to iterate and change and evolve and modify so that you build something that\u2019s stronger over time.\n\nIn some cases, it goes totally off the rails. I mean, just call it what it is: what business does a private company have, regardless of how much revenue it has, to buy a Gulfstream V or whatever [WeWork] bought? It\u2019s crazy. ..\n\nFrom an entrepreneurial perspective, I think being a leader with thought leadership and introspection around what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working is much, much more powerful over a long period of time than the entrepreneur or the leader who gets wrapped in the cult of personality [and is] inhaling [his or her] own exhaust\n\nTC: Have you been in that situation yourself as a VC? Could VCs have done something sooner in this case or is that not possible when dealing with a strong personality?\n\nBF: One of the difficult things to do, not just as an investor, but as a board member \u2014 and it\u2019s frankly also difficult for entrepreneurs \u2014 is to deal with the spectrum that you\u2019re on, where one end of the spectrum as an investor or board member is dictating to the charismatic, incredibly hard-driving founder who is the CEO what they should do, and, at the other end, letting them be unconstrained so that they do whatever they want to do.\n\nOne of the challenges of a lot of VCs is that, when things are going great, it\u2019s hard to be internally critical about it. And so a lot of times, you don\u2019t focus as much on the character. Every company, as it\u2019s growing the leadership, the founders, the CEO, the other executives, have to evolve. [Yet] a lot of times for various reasons, and it\u2019s a wide spectrum, there are moments in time where it\u2019s easier to not pay attention to that as an investor or board member. There\u2019s a lot of investors and board members who are afraid to confront it. And there\u2019s a lot of situations where, because you don\u2019t set up the governance structure of the company in a certain way, because as an investor you wanted to get into the deal or the entrepreneurs insist on [on a certain structure], or you don\u2019t have enough influence because of when you invested, it\u2019s very, very hard. If the entrepreneur is not willing to engage collaboratively, it\u2019s very hard to do something about it.\n\nAgain, if you\u2019re an Extra Crunch subscriber, you can read our unedited and wide-ranging conversation here.", "description": "Yesterday, we had a chance to talk with longtime venture investor Brad Feld of Foundry Group, whose book \u201cVenture Deals\u201d was recently republished for the fourth time, for good reason.
