(Photo: Frank Augstein, AP)\n\nLONDON \u2013 Britain appeared headed for a rare December election after the leader of the opposition Labour Party told fellow lawmakers Tuesday that he'll back Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for the snap vote now that the prospect of crashing out of the European Union without a Brexit deal has been taken off the table.\n\nJeremy Corbyn said his conditions for a vote had \"now been met\" after the EU extended Britain's Brexit deadline to Jan. 31 next year. Johnson formally accepted the terms of the delay late Monday. The nation had been due to exit the bloc Thursday.\n\nLawmakers will vote on the terms of any election later Tuesday. Johnson does not command a majority in the House of the Common, but the bill's passage through Parliament is now all but ensured by the backing of the Labour Party.\n\nJohnson is pushing for the vote to take place on Dec. 12.\n\nBritain's leader has previously been thwarted three times in his attempt to force a new election, widely viewed as a proxy vote on Britain's ties with the EU. If the vote goes ahead, it will be the first British election in December in around 100 years.\n\nMost polls show Johnson would win any new national vote comfortably. If he does, it will be easier for him to secure his Brexit priorities. However, opposition parties are trying to open up the vote to EU nationals who live in Britain and voters as young as 16. It's not clear whether such a tactic, if successful, would alter the vote's dynamic.\n\n\"We\u2019re now going to be out on the streets for about six weeks and I've just had a weather forecast, and it\u2019s going to be good weather,\" Corbyn told cheering supporters in London after dropping his party's opposition to a pre-Christmas election.\n\nJohnson proposed the election after he was legally forced against his will to ask the EU for a Brexit extension. He took office in July vowing to \"get Brexit done\" by Oct. 31.\n\nHe even said he'd rather be \"death in a ditch\" than see Britain in the EU on Halloween.\n\nLike his predecessor, Theresa May, who resigned over Brexit, Johnson was able to negotiate a Brexit withdrawal deal with EU leaders, but British lawmakers blocked the deal's implementation over concerns it wasn't adequately scrutinized.\n\nBritish and EU legislators were also worried that it could inadvertently lead to a \"no-deal\" Brexit, which would damage the economies of both Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU on Monday agreed to extend the Brexit deadline for the third time in the three-and-half years since Britain narrowly opted to leave the bloc after a referendum.\n\nTo win support from opposition parties for the vote, Johnson agreed to temporarily shelve his EU withdrawal agreement until after the election.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/29/brexit-uk-december-election-boris-johnson/2494047001/", "description": "Britain appeared headed for a rare Dec. election after\u00a0the leader of the\u00a0opposition Labour Party said he'll back Boris Johnson's call\u00a0for the  vote.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Published A.M.
