We\u2019ve 100,000 people a year who can\u2019t access a hospice bed or even get the right care at home from specialist nurses.\u201d\n\nThe crisis was highlighted when musician Angus Maclean, 58, died alone at home in May after an NHS hospice suspended its service.\n\nHis lonely death angered relatives who claim he was not given a dedicated nurse to check on him daily in the weeks before he died.\n\nAngus, who played at Glastonbury, initially resisted hospice care after pancreatic cancer spread to his liver in March. Given just six months to live, he wanted to live out his final days at home in Hammersmith, West London.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut his brother Donald, 57, said the family struggled to cope and Angus only received two visits from a district nurse.\n\nDonald said: \u201cThere was no nursing team to help support him and his family so he didn\u2019t die alone. We had no one to help us and him deal with dying.\u201d\n\nAngus did agree to move to a hospice five days before he died. But the 13-bed Pembridge ward at the nearby St Charles Centre had stopped \u00adtaking patients last October.\n\nAngus died at home the night before he was due to go to an alternative facility.\n\n(Image: COLLECT UNKNOWN)\n\nHis friend Lorraine Ainscow-Searle, who is a \u00adformer NHS \u00adpsycho- therapist, said: \u201cAngus was a lovely man. If we could have got him into a hospice bed even for a few days he wouldn\u2019t have died the way he did. It is tragic to have someone die alone.\u201d\n\nA proposal to close Pembridge ward permanently is now under consideration. Anne Drinkall, an ex-NHS Community nurse and matron, is leading the fight to save it.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is the poorest who suffer from NHS cuts and we are fighting hard to save Pembridge.\u201d\n\nMost hospices are funded by charities but some NHS units remain. An extra \u00a325million funding was announced by the Government in August \u2013 a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d, said Dr Proffitt.\n\nThe average adults hospice receives 30 per cent of funds from health budgets and the rest through charities, donation and \u00adfundraisers, according to Hospice UK.\n\nFor children\u2019s hospices the State provides 22 per cent of funds. Last month St Mary\u2019s Hospice in Ulverston, Cumbria, had to turn people away \u00adbecause it could not find a doctor to oversee its service.\n\nLast week it was \u00adannounced the 12-bed St Margaret\u2019s Hospice in Yeovil will also close. And in January St Clare\u2019s Hospice in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was forced into liquidation after 30 years.\n\nDr Proffitt says it costs \u00a321million a year to help the dying at her unit alone.\n\nShe said: \u201cHundreds of millions are needed for a sector of health care that should be fully funded by the NHS.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cWe are not training enough junior doctors to become consultants \u2013 because the NHS won\u2019t provide the funding. Not only will we not have the consultants we need in the future but we won\u2019t have enough junior doctors to support existing consultants. Some hospices may close.\u201d\n\nAn NHS spokesman for North West London expressed regret that Pembridge remains suspended, saying: \u201cWe are \u00addoing everything possible to mitigate the impact on patients, carers, families.\n\n\u201cWe are working to improve services and reach a greater number of people. Hospices play a vital role which is why the NHS will more than double funding for children\u2019s hospice and palliative care services over five years.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Misery as more hospices across Britain are closed due to staff shortages", "authors": ["Martyn Halle", "Amy Sharpe", "Image", "Getty Images", "Lorraine Ainsccow-Searle", "Collect Unknown", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565809.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hospice-Nurse-visiting-an-elderly-male-patient.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
