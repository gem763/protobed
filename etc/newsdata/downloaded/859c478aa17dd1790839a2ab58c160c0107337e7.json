Motherboard filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the U.S. Army for documents related to this contract, and one showed the purchase was specifically for the 902nd Military Intelligence Group.\n\n\"The 902nd Military Intelligence Group conducts proactive counterintelligence activities to detect, identify, assess, and counter, neutralize or exploit foreign intelligence entities and insider threats in order to protect Army and designated Department of Defense forces, information and technologies worldwide,\" the U.S. Army website reads.
