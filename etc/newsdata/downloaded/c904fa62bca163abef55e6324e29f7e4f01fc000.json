They\u2019re abiding by the law,\u201d Jenkins explained Thursday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nAt one stop, ICE agents could see the suspect inside, but could not forcibly enter, having to wait for the owner of the property to allow them inside.\n\n\u201c[It] speaks to the difficulty that ICE has in trying to make these apprehensions,\" Jenkins said.\n\nAMERICAN ARRESTED IN TEXAS AFTER 53 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOUND INSIDE SWELTERING TRACTOR-TRAILER, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nICE: TEXAS DETENTION CENTER TO HOUSE MIGRANT FAMILIES AGAIN\n\nAn ICE agent told Jenkins that the criminal alien had been convicted of multiple crimes and had a detainer placed on him on August 9, though it was not honored by local law enforcement and he was released.\n\n\"It's been extremely disappointing to us in federal law enforcement,\" the ICE agent said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a danger to the community.
