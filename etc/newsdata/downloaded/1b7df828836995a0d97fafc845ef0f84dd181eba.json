According to Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale, the president now has $156 million in cash on hand with nearly $310 million raised so far this year. In contrast, former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had only pulled in $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nDespite this record, several campaigns for Democratic candidates have voluntarily announced their Q3 fundraising totals, and the numbers show that donors are not slowing in their support. Campaigns closed the books on the third quarter Monday evening.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) was yet again the most successful Democratic candidate in terms of fundraising, bringing in $25.3 million from 1.4 million donations, senior advisor Tim Tagaris announced Tuesday. Sanders\u2019 campaign says all his donations were grassroots funded \u2014 the average donation size was $18. In comparison, Sanders raked in $24 million in Q2. According to the Federal Election Commission, Sanders has raised more than $46 million, a number that will leap substantially when the third-quarter numbers are added to that total. In all, Sanders has raised more than $60 million for his 2020 election campaign.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was next, pulling in $19.1 million, his campaign announced on Twitter. Roughly 580,000 donors contributed to his campaign for an average donation size of $33. So far, his campaign says, Buttigieg has raised over $51 million for the year.\n\nBut Mayor Pete\u2019s fundraising totals are a decline from his second-quarter haul, when he pulled in just under $25 million. Still, he is miles away from his Q1 fundraising totals, which were under $10 million.\n\nThe Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC on the campus of Texas Southern University Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, in Houston. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) More\n\nSenators Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) also reported their fundraising totals. While both did well, they are by and large not faring as well as some of their fellow candidates.\n\nHarris announced Tuesday that her campaign raised over $11.6 million in this most recent quarter, giving her war chest a much needed boost. She heads into the fourth quarter with $10 million cash on hand. Booker raised roughly half that, posting the best quarter of his campaign with $6 million in Q3. According to Booker\u2019s deputy campaign manager Jenna Lowenstein, $2.16 million of that was raised in the last 10 days.\n\nBut the biggest growth of the Democratic candidates came from businessman Andrew Yang. His \u201cYang Gang\u201d pulled in $10 million last quarter, a 257% increase on the $2.8 million he raked in during Q2.\n\nFrontrunners former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had not yet reported their fundraising totals by publication time.\n\nOnline Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue has also been doing well. While it hasn\u2019t released its third quarter totals as yet, it posted its best day yet. And according to the online counter on ActBlue\u2019s website, since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, ActBlue donors have contributed more than $45 million to Democratic candidates.\n\nNot to be outdone, WinRed, the Republican fundraising platform was off to a fast start. According to WinRed, the online platform raised $30 million in Q3 from $639,000 with an average contribution of roughly $46.\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
