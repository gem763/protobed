But as Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research, argues in a September research note, midcaps split the difference.\n\n\u201cLarge-cap stocks offer the stability that comes with mature multinational businesses with diverse revenue sources,\u201d Bartolini said. \u201cSmall-cap stocks are unproven, but they offer potential for further expansion and market penetration. And midcaps offer a unique combination of the managerial maturity associated with large caps and the operational dexterity of small caps.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not just a hypothesis. Bartolini notes that midcap companies have historically had lower leverage than large caps, while enjoying margins that are in between large- and small-cap companies. Over the past two decades, they\u2019ve had a 7% higher growth rate than large caps, and 32% less earnings volatility than small ones.\n\nMeanwhile, ETFs that track indexes are increasingly being used as investing strategies in and of themselves, and many investors are looking at size as a factor in allocating funds, points out Todd Rosenbluth, head of fund research at CFRA.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s how to get \u2018smart\u2019 about factors\n\nMore money is allocated to large-cap strategies \u2014 $6.7 trillion \u2014 and small caps \u2014 $825 billion \u2014 than midcaps, which has only captured $872 billion, Bartolini noted. And Rosenbluth has a tally of mutual funds: only 289 focused on midcaps, compared with 525 focused on small caps and 784 on large.\n\nThat may be because the investment thesis for large- and small-cap strategies is more obvious, but it may also be because active midcap managers have underperformed.\n\nSee: Welcome to the adult table: SEC sets new ETF rules\n\nLess than one-third of active midcap managers have beaten their benchmark over multiple time horizons, Bartolini wrote. While he doesn\u2019t explain why, he does note that there are twice as many Wall Street analysts covering large-cap stocks as covering midcaps, and a survey of academic literature reveals six times as many research papers written about \u201csmall cap\u201d or \u201csmall stocks\u201d compared to \u201cmid cap\u201d or \u201cmid cap stocks.\u201d\n\nWhatever the reason, the track record of active managers, and their higher fees \u2014 about 98 basis points compared to less than half that for index-fund fees \u2014 make a passive approach more appealing, Bartolini wrote.\n\nOne such index fund, SPDR\u2019s S&P Midcap 400 ETF MDY, +0.59% , has returned 14.23% in the year to date, according to FactSet, beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% return of 13.91%, but lagging that of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.80% .\n\nRelated: In investing, it\u2019s better to think big picture", "description": "There\u2019s a lot less attention paid to stocks that fall in between larger-capitalizations and smaller ones, but there\u2019s plenty of reason for investors to pay...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC809_goldil_ZG_20190128122804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
