Previous Boundless investors including Revolution\u2019s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund and Esther Dyson will join Thrive Global\u2019s cap table.\n\n\u201cWe were very impressed by their neuroscience-based artificial intelligence that they used to power changes in behavior,\u201d says Huffington. \u201cWe can use technology to hook people to unhook them from unhealthy behaviors.\u201d\n\nBoundless \u201cepitomized the use of technology to encourage healthy habits,\u201d Huffington says.\n\nFrom Huffington\u2019s perspective, most health problems in the U.S. are actually rooted in behavioral problems rather than biological ones. \u201cUntil 100 years ago, people died from infectious diseases\u2026 Now most people are dying from behaviors,\u201d says Huffington, quoting Boundless Mind co-founder Dalton Combs.\n\nRoughly 70% of healthcare spending in the U.S. goes to behavioral change and lifestyle-related conditions, says Huffington. Thrive Global tackles the issue through a combination of pop psychology and celebrity advice, while Boundless uses artificial intelligence and machine learning nudges.\n\nThe Boundless technology works by monitoring what activity is happening on the phone\u2019s tap screen (similar to Apple\u2019s screen time monitoring). What Boundless does on the back end is analyze that data and create prompts to encourage behavior \u2014 in much the same way that other companies\u2019 apps have notifications to prompt re-engagement.\n\nGoing forward, the Boundless team is hoping to use more of the information coming from a phone\u2019s increasing array of sensors to better refine its notifications. Results from the adoption of the company\u2019s software vary, but Boundless points to data from apps spanning health, fitness, productivity, finance and e-commerce \u2013 including a 60% increase in walking, 30% increase in productivity and 21% increase in engagement around diet and exercise.\n\nThrive Global has three pillars to its business: live workshops, a digital health program called Thriving Academy, and a newer mental health focused package called Thriving Mind.\n\nThe company has already signed corporate partners like Accenture, JPMorgan, Hilton, Bank of America and Procter & Gamble, and Huffington says customers have already seen results in lower rates of employee attrition and better employee satisfaction results on surveys.\n\nThese kinds of correlations don\u2019t mean causation and the company is still working to better quantify the benefits of adopting its workplace wellness protocols. One of the places where Thrive Global is putting its brain training regime to the test is in call centers in Central America,\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how the Boundless intervention will allow us to hyper-personalize,\u201d says Danny Shea, Thrive Global\u2019s head of global expansion. In call centers that could mean prompting an employee to take a break after a long or stressful call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to see the continued growth and market expansion at Thrive Global\u201d said Somesh Dash, General Partner at IVP and member of Thrive Global\u2019s Board of Directors. \u201cThe combination of Thrive\u2019s mission and Boundless Mind\u2019s technology is truly remarkable and the integration will help Thrive scale a game-changing and differentiated behavior change technology platform to enterprises around the world.\u201d\n\nTo date Thrive Global has raised over $65 million from investors including JAZZ Venture Partners, IVP, Marc Benioff, Ray Dalio, and Kevin Durant.", "description": "When Arianna Huffington stepped down from her role at the Huffington Post to start Thrive Global, she said the goal of her new business was to help a generation \u201cavoid the burnout that all too often comes with success today.\u201d In practice, that has meant creating a business that sells mindfulness and general health and [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-463184406.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
