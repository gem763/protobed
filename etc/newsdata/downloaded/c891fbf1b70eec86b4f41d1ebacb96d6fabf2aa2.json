Lots of cute little puppies.\n\nLately, the page is serving up more Trump than usual, which makes the fact that, according to Popular Information, it is managed by 10 people based in Ukraine all that more timely, in light of the recent headlines.\n\n\u201cI Love America\u201d regularly recycles the same memes used by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, the entity that set up fake Facebook FB, -2.02% pages to boost Trump in the 2016 election, reports Popular Information\u2019s Judd Legum, who founded the left-leaning ThinkProgress website back in 2005.\n\nLately, he says, there\u2019s been a big push, with memes like these:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018I Love America\u2019 page is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a complex network of Facebook pages, all managed by people in Ukraine,\u201d Legum reports. \u201cThese pages are now being used to funnel large audiences to pro-Trump propaganda.\u201d Some of those pages include \u201cClick Like, if you love Donald Trump as much as we do. TRUMP 2020,\u201d \u201cGod bless Donald Trump and God bless America,\u201d and \u201cGod bless Donald and Melania Trump and God bless America.\u201d\n\nAnd, through these sites, Americans get exposed to adorable animal images along with a steady stream of manipulated content and misinformation relating to the 2020 election. This isn\u2019t just a bit of exposure, either.\n\nPopular Information found that \u201cI Love America\u201d reaches more people than nearly all U.S. media companies. For example, according to Crowdtangle, the page has more engagement over the last 90 days than USA Today and easily tops the likes of the L.A. Times and BuzzFeed News. In fact, the newsletter estimates that the entire Ukrainian network has as much reach as the New York Times NYT, +1.45% and Washington Post combined.\n\nHere\u2019s Legum\u2019s Twitter thread on the story:\n\n1. A massive Facebook Page called \"I Love America\" \u2014 which has 1.1 million followers \u2014 is actually run by Ukrainians\n\n\n\nRecently, the page has started pushing caustic pro-Trump propaganda\n\n\n\nIt's the tip of the iceberghttps://t.co/0MRNxVJbUJ \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 23, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to grapple with the latest controversy swirling around the White House. The president suggested on Sunday that he talked about Joe and Hunter Biden with Ukraine\u2019s new leader, as Democrats pushed for investigations into whether Trump improperly tried to use his position to dig up damaging information about a political rival.", "description": "Facebook said it wouldn\u2019t happen again, but according to the Popular Information newsletter, the propaganda that spread across the internet in 2016 is again...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR871_americ_MG_20190923113118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
