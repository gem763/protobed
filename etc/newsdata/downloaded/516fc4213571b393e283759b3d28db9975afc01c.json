It marked a first for any Brexit agreement, and happened without the DUP\u2019s support.\n\n\u2013 Conflicting loyalties \u2013\n\nSome feel the party\u2019s pro-Brexit stance puts it at odds with its unionist traditions \u2014 and could ultimately be its undoing.\n\nUnless the sides come up with a different solution, Brexit will require some form of checks at British borders when the country leaves the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\n\nAll sides agree these cannot be done along the Irish border, which was rendered \u201cinvisible\u201d under a 1998 peace accord that end three decades of bombings and bloodshed known as \u201cThe Troubles\u201d.\n\nThe long-running conflict pitted the Catholic IRA, supporting a united Ireland, against Protestant \u2018loyalist\u2019 groups who favoured remaining in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Brexit deal championed by Johnson would require administrative checks along the Irish Sea, a solution the DUP says would split the UK.\n\n\u201cThe party is right to claim that the new deal will, over time, loosen Northern Ireland\u2019s place within the union,\u201d commentator Fintan O\u2019Toole wrote in the Irish Times last week.", "description": "Belfast (AFP) \u2013 Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party has been at the heart of Britain\u2019s Brexit saga, and its annual conference", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/0c5c8a_dup-leader-arlene-foster-is-expected-stage-her-party-conference-attack-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
