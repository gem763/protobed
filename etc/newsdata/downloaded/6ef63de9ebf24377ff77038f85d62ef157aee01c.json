NATIONALS: 2019 NATIONAL LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES PREVIEW, SCHEDULE, HOW TO WATCH AND MORE\n\nWashington\u2019s Patrick Corbin stumbled through a rocky first inning. He issued four walks, joining Art Reinhart of the St. Louis Cardinals as the only pitchers to walk that many in the first inning they ever pitched in the postseason.\n\nReinhart walked four _ including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig _ in the fifth inning of Game 4 of the 1926 World Series against the Yankees.\n\n\u201cThat first inning was the game,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThat really set the tone.\u201d\n\nCorbin walked three in a row with two outs in the 31-pitch inning. Yan Gomes was charged with a passed ball, too, and Muncy drew a free pass with the bases loaded to put the Dodgers in front.\n\n\u201cWalked a lot of guys, chased a lot of bad pitches,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re walking guys and not hitting, it\u2019s tough to win ballgames.\u201d\n\nCorbin gave up two runs _ one earned _ and three hits in six innings. The left-hander struck out nine and finished with five walks.\n\nCody Bellinger walked with two outs and scored on an error by Kendrick in the fifth that made it 2-0. Third baseman Anthony Rendon made a diving stop on Chris Taylor\u2019s single down the line, but his throw to first wasn\u2019t in time and Bellinger went to third.\n\nMuncy\u2019s grounder rolled through Kendrick\u2019s legs for an error, scoring Bellinger, and Taylor got thrown out at the plate to end the inning.\n\nIn the fourth, Muncy singled leading off. Corey Seager followed with a hit that got past a diving Kendrick at first and rolled into right, sending Muncy to third. But then Corbin settled down and retired the next three batters to end the inning.\n\nThe Nationals loaded the bases in the fourth on three walks by Buehler. He escaped when Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera tapped the ball back to the mound and Buehler flipped to first to end the inning.\n\n\u201cFrom that first throw, he was on point,\u201d Roberts said of Buehler. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good lineup over there and for him to go six, we needed that.\u201d\n\nJuan Soto, who had the key hit in the wild-card win over Milwaukee, singled in the second and Trea Turner singled in the ninth off Joe Kelly for the Nationals\u2019 only hits.\n\nIt was a quiet offensive night for each team\u2019s MVP contender. Rendon, who hit .319 in the regular season, went 0 for 2 with two strikeouts and a walk. Bellinger, a .305 hitter, struck out twice and walked twice.\n\nIt was the fourth shutout in eight games between the teams this season, third by the Dodgers.\n\nLos Angeles won its eighth in a row dating to the regular season. Washington\u2019s nine-game winning streak, including the wild-card victory, ended.\n\nIN THE CROWD\n\nMagic Johnson and Billie Jean King, part of the Dodgers\u2019 ownership group, shared a box with principal owner Mark Walter, Sandy Koufax and Tom Lasorda. ... Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, former Dodger Matt Kemp, former Dodgers manager Joe Torre and actor Jason Bateman attended.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nUP NEXT\n\nComing off the first relief appearance of his career, Washington RHP Stephen Strasburg will start Game 2 against Dodgers LHP Clayton Kershaw on Friday. Strasburg tossed three shutout innings Tuesday night in a dramatic wild-card victory over Milwaukee. He\u2019s under no limitations returning two days later. \u201cMy arm\u2019s felt great all year,\u201d Strasburg said. He would be available to return on normal rest for a potential Game 5 next Wednesday in Los Angeles. By starting Kershaw in Game 2, the Dodgers could possibly use him out of the bullpen if Game 5 is necessary.", "description": "Walker Buehler allowed one hit over six innings, Max Muncy drove in three runs and the Los Angeles Dodgers capitalized on mistakes to beat the Washington Nationals 6-0 in Game 1 of their NL Division Series on Thursday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/dodgers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
