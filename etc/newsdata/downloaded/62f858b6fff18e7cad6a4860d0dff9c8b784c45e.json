And the total amount SCF invested in Bevin, about $986,000, is almost half the $2 million it invested overall in all of its five endorsed candidates last year.\n\nSCF members can choose which candidates receive their donations, and Bevin received more than three times as many donations as the next closest candidate, Louisiana GOP hopeful Rob Maness. A retired Air Force office, Maness is running to the right of GOP establishment candidate Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to unseat Sen. Mary Landrieu (D). Maness received about $132,000 in donations.\n\n\n\nHoskins told The Hill the support for Bevin is an indication that the conservative grassroots are excited about Bevin, peeved at McConnell and \u201cbeginning to pool their money financially to level the playing field\u201d for conservative candidates in Senate races nationwide.\n\n\n\nThe SCF also spent nearly $536,000 in independent expenditures backing Bevin, largely on ads attacking McConnell.\n\n\n\nMcConnell has been an outspoken critic of the SCF, at one point calling the group \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and accusing it of \u201cruining the [GOP] brand.\u201d Hoskins said the sum raised for Bevin reflected as much a distaste for McConnell himself as it did anger from members over McConnell\u2019s criticism of the group.\n\nJosh Holmes, a top adviser to McConnell, repeated a common refrain among the senator's allies in a tweet slamming SCF for the expenditures.\n\n\"Balance of the Senate hangs in balance and SCF spends $1M attacking our own instead of vulnerable Dems,\" he tweeted.\n\nEstablishment groups like the Chamber of Commerce and a super-PAC affiliated with GOP strategist Karl Rove have pledged to play heavily in primary fights to defend incumbents and prevent conservative challengers from jeopardizing the party\u2019s chance at taking back the Senate in 2014.\n\n\n\nRepublicans need to pick up six seats to win the majority, and many in the GOP fear a repeat of the 2010 and 2012 cycles, when weak candidates emerged from primary fights and sabotaged the GOP's best shot at taking back the upper chamber in a decade.\n\n\n\nThe total SCF invested in the candidate is a significant sum, but it's still dwarfed by the $10 million McConnell has already banked for his reelection fight.\n\n\n\nConservatives see a prime opportunity to replace McConnell because of his deep unpopularity in his home state. A recent Democratic automated poll showed a slight plurality of GOP primary voters, 42 percent, would like to nominate someone more conservative than him. He still, however, led Bevin by 27 points in that same poll.\n\n\n\nSome conservatives argue that Bevin is Republicans' best hope for winning the general election, where the GOP nominee will face a top-tier Democratic challenger in Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nHoskins wouldn\u2019t put a cap on the amount the group plans to spend for Bevin in the future, pledging to support him unconditionally.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will do everything that we can to help Matt Bevin win this race and Kentucky remain red,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe group also invested more than $500,000 on state Sen. Chris McDaniel, the conservative primary challenger to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) and the group\u2019s first endorsement this cycle.\n\nLundergan Grimes' campaign suggested the news of SCF's investment in Bevin's campaign was evidence McConnell's campaign is already having a rough year.\n\n\u201cLess than 72 hours into the New Year, Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign has already managed to stumble out of the gate,\" said campaign spokeswoman Charly Norton in a statement.\n\n\"In yet another sign of Senator Gridlock\u2019s horrible start to 2014, the Senate Conservatives Fund announced spending $1 million to date to unseat McConnell. Senator Gridlock\u2019s failure to connect with Kentuckians underscores the Commonwealth\u2019s overwhelming desire for a new senator in the New Year.\u201d\n\n--This piece was updated at 5 p.m. to reflect comment from Lundergan Grimes' campaign.", "description": "The conservative group pledges to do everything to help Matt Bevin win.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2014-01-03"}
