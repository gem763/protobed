Tim Morrison first appeared in the press in articles about his predecessor's departure. Fiona Hill recently stepped down from the post after nearly 2.5 years. Hill was a critical Putin biographer who had already made a name for herself before stepping onto the political stage. Morrison however, only joined the administration last August and is still a bit of a dark horse.\n\nBefore joining the White House, Fiona Hill, a former Brookings scholar with many publications about the need to exert greater pressure on Russia.\n\nAmong his colleagues, he is reputed to be a strong, and sometimes unnecessarily harsh, negotiator. He\u2019s also considered a hardliner on nuclear policy, having played a crucial role in shaping the nuclear modernisation program started under Barack Obama. Some critics believe that John Bolton\u2019s fresh appointee shares his hawkish views on the nuclear agenda. So much so that blocking, rather than promoting, arms control agreements, is part of the job description set by his boss.\n\nSome critics believe that John Bolton\u2019s latest appointee shares his hawkish views on the nuclear agenda. So much so that blocking, rather than promoting arms control agreements, is part of the job description. \u00a9 Reuters / Peter Nicholls\n\nWhen news of Morrison\u2019s appointment began to circulate, around June 18th, a National Security Council (NSC) spokesman declined to comment on personnel matters. This led to frenzied media speculation about what the designation meant for future disarmament in particular and the tumultuous US-Russia relations in general. Morrison has since appeared with a US delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State, John J. Sullivan, in Geneva, to negotiate a new arms control treaty.\n\nMorrison joined the National Security Council in July 2018, as a Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Weapons of Mass Destruction and Biodefense, before that he served as Policy Director for the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. His primary responsibility was funding and oversight of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the United States armed forces. At different times, he\u2019d held a variety of other staff positions in the House of Representatives and the Senate. He is well educated with a Doctorate from the George Washington University Law School and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe media has described Tim Morrison as a 'nuclear super-hawk and 'Bolton without a moustache'. He may be younger than Bolton but he shares the same hard-line views on nuclear policy. \u00a9 Youtube/Foundation for Defense of Democracies\n\nA picture on his now locked Twitter account is said to feature a red 'Trump-style' baseball cap with the legend; \u201cMAKE DETERRENCE GREAT AGAIN\u201d. If true, this reveals more about his beliefs than he might care to admit.\n\nThe avatar on Tim Morrison's protected Twitter account featured a baseball cap with the motto, 'Make deterrence great again', a clear reference to the US ideology of nuclear deterrence, a key doctrine of the Cold War era.\n\nIn the aftermath of Trump\u2019s recent decision to abandon the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia, and in view of the approaching 2021 expiration of the New START arms control treaty (which limits the stockpile of strategic nuclear missiles in both countries), Tim Morrison now takes centre stage as someone who might be instrumental in determining the US stance on arms control. President Trump has repeatedly said he\u2019d like to develop a three-way nuclear deal with Russia and China. So far, Bejing has roundly rejected the idea in any shape or form.\n\nBolton and his team of arms-control sceptics, on the other hand, argue that the old bilateral Russo-American model that excludes China is no longer viable. Any negotiations, therefore, end up in an impossible impasse. Some experts believe that this might just be a smokescreen for an attempt to sabotage the treaty altogether. Between them, the United States and Russia still hold more than 90 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons. Any attempt to prevent the two powers from agreeing at least a measure of arms control might easily expose the world to dangers it has never seen before.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has appointed a new top Russia advisor, Tim Morrison who is still a bit of a dark horse.
