Anderson Cooper Has An Answer.", "language": "en", "text": "CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Thursday reminded viewers of the times Donald Trump has shared sensitive information with foreign officials, after the president asked if anybody believed he was \u201cdumb enough\u201d to do such a thing.\n\nTrump earlier railed on Twitter against a report in The Washington Post that alleged an intelligence official had raised concerns after Trump made a promise to an unidentified foreign leader:\n\nAnother Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\n....Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\nCooper said \u201cwhether the president is in his own words, \u2018dumb enough,\u2019 that\u2019s unclear. But his larger denial would certainly be easier to swallow if it weren\u2019t for some of what we know he has done when he\u2019s not surrounded by witnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that he did reveal classified information to Russia\u2019s ambassador and foreign minister in a conversation we only learned about through Russian media,\u201d Cooper noted. \u201cWe know on other occasions the president had spoken to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin without note-takers in the room, something no modern president has done before. We also know, in a story broken by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto, that the U.S. intelligence has extracted a top Kremlin asset, in part reportedly out of concern the president might blow his cover. So there is that.\u201d\n\nThe broader question, Cooper claimed, was whether people were able to take what Trump says at face value, given his extensive history of telling untruths.\n\n\u201cWell, all that said, the Constitution gives any president, truthful or not, transparent or not, broad authority to conduct foreign policy,\u201d Cooper noted. \u201cThe law gives a president almost unlimited authority to declassify intelligence if he or she wants to.\u201d\n\nCheck out the segment here:", "description": "The CNN host reminded Trump why, yes, some people think he may share inappropriate information with foreign officials.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d84aa212100005a00e4af68.png?cache=giivlmdtyo&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
