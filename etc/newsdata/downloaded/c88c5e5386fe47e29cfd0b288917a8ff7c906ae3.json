(Image: Disney)\n\nNot to be confused with Guillermo del Toro\u2019s long-awaited stop-motion version of the classic Pinocchio story for Netflix, the Pinocchio news of today is an update on Disney\u2019s long-awaited live-action take on its 1940 animated version. Famed Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis is now said to be \u201cin talks,\u201d per Variety, to helm the film.\n\nThe last nugget we got on Pinocchio came almost a year ago, when Tom Hanks was considering playing Geppetto, the wood carver who creates the puppet that becomes Pinocchio. Though today\u2019s Variety report on Zemeckis (who is not the first director to circle the project) notes that the actor has since passed on the role.\n\nThere are currently no hints as to who might be in the running to play Geppetto, Pinocchio, the Blue Fairy, or any of the other characters including Jiminy Cricket, who\u2019s long since become a Disney icon in his own right. But if you have any suggestions feel free to leave them in the comments!\n\nInterestingly enough, del Toro and Zemeckis just worked together on an unrelated project: the Zemeckis-directed, del Toro-produced adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s The Witches, which was first adapted back in 1990 in a version that\u2019s since become a skin-peeling cult classic.\n\nDel Toro\u2019s Pinocchio is due in 2021; there\u2019s no timeline yet for Disney\u2019s new take. The Witches will be in theatres next October.", "description": "Not to be confused with Guillermo del Toro\u2019s long-awaited stop-motion version of the classic Pinocchio story for Netflix, the Pinocchio news of today is an update on Disney\u2019s long-awaited live-action take on its 1940 animated version.
