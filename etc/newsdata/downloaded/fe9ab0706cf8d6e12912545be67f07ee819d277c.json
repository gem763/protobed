However, to date, these elevated risks have not become reality, at least for the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said.\n\nThe Boston Fed leader was one of two central bankers who voted against the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s decision to lower short-term rates by a quarter percentage point at the end of July. Mr. Rosengren has for some time argued against lowering short-term borrowing costs in an economy that is generally doing pretty well.\n\nThe Fed is set to meet in the middle of this month and is very likely to lower rates again. In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Rosengren opened the door to supporting rate cuts if needed, while showing no sign he is ready to walk through it.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Rosengren said most economic risks lie outside the U.S. Growth levels remain good and unemployment is low, he said, while weak inflation is still likely to trend back up to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, he said.\n\nMr. Rosengren observed that some of the strongest pessimism over the outlook stems from financial markets, but even there, he said it wasn\u2019t a monolithic outlook. \u201cIf one thought that the economy was going into an economic downturn, one would expect such concerns to be reflected in equity prices, as corporate earnings tend to decline significantly in a recession,\u201d Mr. Rosengren noted.\n\nThe central banker brushed off the bond market\u2019s so-called yield curve inversion. That is where the normally positive relationship between short- and long-dated bonds turns negative. Inversions have a very strong track record of preceding downturns, and some on the Fed, like St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard, are quite worried about where the market is.\n\nMr. Rosengren, while arguing for caution in making sense of the market, said the inversion was driven largely by what appears to be foreign buying and not central-bank policy actions.\n\n\u201cThe depressed long-term yield, in part, reflects the challenging economic conditions in much of the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Video Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is facing fears of an economic downturn, volatile markets and criticism from President Trump.
