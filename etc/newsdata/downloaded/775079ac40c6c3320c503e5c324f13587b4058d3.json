Only four months earlier, President Duterte had accused Loot, a former police general, of protecting the local drug trade, ABS-CBN News reported, something Loot has fervently denied.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday before newly appointed officials in Malaca\u00f1ang, Duterte seemed to have no love lost for the former army man.\n\n\u201cGeneral Loot, f*ck you. You still won mayor. I ambushed you, you animal, but you\u2019re still alive,\u201dABS-CBN News reported the president saying.\n\nPanelo yesterday told reporters at a Malaca\u00f1ang press conference that the real spirit of Duterte\u2019s statements was lost because he was speaking in Filipino when his native language is, in fact, Visayan.\n\nIs anyone buying this?\n\nHere\u2019s what the president said: \u201cI ambushed you, you animal, but you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Duterte meant (according to Panelo): \u201cYou were ambushed, you animal, but you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\n\nPanelo further explained: \u201cLet us be clear and categorical: The president did not order the ambush of General Loot. It is silly and absurd to conclude that [the president] is behind the ambush just because he misspeaks the Filipino language, which is not his native tongue or first language.\u201d\n\nRead: Duterte vows to uphold press freedom, accuses Rappler journalists of having stanky pits\n\nAccording to Inquirer, Duterte has previously denied having a hand in the ambush of Loot. Back in December, the president claimed that his 2016 presidential elections rival, Mar Roxas, was the one who ordered the assault.\n\nIn what feels like deja vu, Panelo covered for the president back then as well, saying it was \u201cobviously a joke.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the president\u2019s \u201cmisspoken words\u201d?
