Durbin urges improved regulation of vaping industry", "language": "en", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration needs to better regulate the electronic cigarette industry in the wake of several vaping-related deaths, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois urged Monday.\n\nDurbin criticized the FDA for its lack of oversight of the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes and nicotine vaping products to minors during a news conference at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago.\n\n\u201cWhy are these highly addictive, dangerous products allowed to remain on the market? Because the Food and Drug Administration remains, basically, undirected and misdirected when it comes to dealing with this threat,\u201d the Illinois Democrat said.\n\nDurbin said he sent a letter last week to acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless demanding \u201cimmediate, decisive action\u201d in relation to the enforcement of existing regulations on the sale of vaping products.\n\n\u201cFDA must immediately ban all e-cigarette flavors and devices that have not been approved for sale by the agency,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung, healthy people in Illinois and across the nation are getting sick and dying. The acting Food and Drug Administration commissioner has the power to do something. It\u2019s time that he either does something or resigns.\u201d\n\nAn Illinois man died last month after contracting a lung disease related to the use of a vaping device. Illinois has seen 42 confirmed cases of \u201cvaping-related\u201d lung illnesses, Durbin noted.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported hundreds of primarily young people sickened by a mysterious vaping-related respiratory illness around the country. At least five of them have died.\n\nOn Monday, the FDA blasted vaping products company Juul for illegally pitching its e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to smoking. The FDA has been investigating Juul for months, and a company spokesman has said Juul \u201cwill full cooperate\u201d with the agency.\n\nFDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum released a statement saying the agency remains dedicated to \u201cgetting to the bottom of\u201d products behind the vaping illnesses, and will continue working to ensure the devices aren\u2019t sold to minors. The FDA statement also highlighted the agency\u2019s investment in a marketing campaign aimed at discouraging young people from vaping, and its commitment to enforcing e-cigarette rules.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put the industry on notice: If the disturbing rise in youth e-cigarette use continues, especially through the use of flavors that appeal to kids, we\u2019ll take even more aggressive action. We will do what\u2019s necessary to end the youth e-cigarette epidemic,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration needs to better regulate the electronic cigarette industry in the wake of several vaping-related deaths, Sen.
