'Parents' dishonesty may eventually erode trust and promote dishonesty in children.'\n\nRepresentative Image: Rawpixel\n\nShe stated that one of the limitations of the study was getting teens to talk about their childhood memories -- many of which had faded with time. She further added that future investigations could help them decipher the reason why parents choose to lie in the first place.\n\nThe researcher also shares that instead of lying like this, parents could acknowledge the child's feelings and give him information by either offering choices and options or help in solving the problem.\n\nFor example, if the child is being stubborn on eating candy at home, a parent could just say that we are all out of it, instead of threatening them and instill fear.", "description": "If you try to instill fear in your child by lying to him (saying things like if you don't behave I'll call the police), you might want to stop that, as according to a research, it could be damaging for your child, cultivating selfish, scheming and rather harmful personality traits.", "authors": ["Monit Khanna"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/parenting_1570430410_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
