The indictment was sealed last week and is to be unsealed Tuesday.\n\nBut Heller claimed the second accuser approached Gooding through his lawyers after he was arrested in June, and sought money from him in connection with an encounter that happened in 2018.\n\n\"There is one individual, over and above the initial complainant, that pressed a claim against Cuba after he was arrested,\" Heller said. \"He declined to be shaken down because the conduct (she alleges) did not constitute inappropriate action on his part.\n\nHe said Gooding intends to plead not guilty and to seek two separate trials on the two accusations. Heller, who has accused prosecutors of delaying tactics, said he also will demand the trial on the original charge start immediately.\n\n\"I'm confident this second misdemeanor added to the original case will be dismissed (eventually),\" Heller said.\n\nIn the original case, Gooding has been charged with groping the breast of a woman who sat down next to him and his girlfriend in the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar and Lounge in midtown Manhattan on June 9.\n\nBesides the testimony of the accuser, prosecutors have access to surveillance video inside the bar on the night in question, although the defense argues the video is too blurry to show clearly what, if anything, happened.\n\nAlso, witnesses, including Gooding's girlfriend, Claudine De Niro, who was sitting between Gooding and the accuser, deny that Gooding groped her.", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. will be arraigned on Oct. 15, 2019, on the original misdemeanor groping charge plus a new misdemeanor sex crime still undisclosed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/10/USAT/8ed70350-adc7-42ca-aa62-b933ce500053-AFP_AFP_1LA8KG.JPG?crop=3339,2504,x0,y30&width=3200&height=2466&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
