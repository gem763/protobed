This year, though, Kylie Jenner and her daughter Stormi just took it to another level. Stormi dressed up as her mother at the 2019 Met Gala, and it was straight-up adorable.\n\nWe all know that Jenner takes Halloween seriously. Just think back to her pitch-perfect \u201cDirrty\u201d-era Christina Aguilera costume or even this year\u2019s Madonna and Britney costume with BFF Stassie. And now it seems clear that Stormi Webster is following in her mom\u2019s footsteps, in more ways than one.\n\nHere\u2019s Kylie Jenner with Kendall at the 2019 Met Gala, just for reference:\n\nAnd here\u2019s little Stormi channeling Kylie in her feather-filled, monochromatic purple look, right down to the lavender wig:\n\n\u201cMy baby!!!!!!!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c i cant handle this!!!!\u201d Jenner captioned the photo. Kylie, we feel you. We can\u2019t handle the cuteness, either. And from the looks of Stomi\u2019s face in the video, she\u2019s loving it, too. It seems we have another Kardashian-Jenner who loves spooky season.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kylie and daughter Stormi have gone for twinning looks for Halloween. (And, actually, not even close to the first time they\u2019ve worn matchy-matchy outfits in everyday life, either.)\n\nLast year, Kylie and Stormi had two twinning Halloween costumes.\n\nThe mom-and-daughter duo dressed as pink butterflies for look one.\n\nAnd they found inspiration in Stormi\u2019s name for costume number two.\n\nKnowing the Kardashian-Jenner clan, this probably isn\u2019t the last Halloween costume of the year for Kylie and Stormi, either. We have our eyes out for more cuteness as Hallo-week continues.", "description": "Stormi Webster loves twinning as much as her mom, it seems, because she dressed in a Kylie Jenner costume for Halloween.
