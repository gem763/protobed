In the film, we meet him at a show in Parsippany, New Jersey, which his wife, Susan, is managing.\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes say to me, \u2018Oh, cats don\u2019t have many expressions,\u2019\u201d Johnson says in the film. \u201cBut they do. They have as many expressions as dogs, but cats are much more subtle.\u201d If you\u2019re attuned to the nuances of feline body language, Johnson explains, cats\u2019 dynamic emotions become apparent.\n\nOf course, cats have a reputation for being independent, so manipulating their behavior for a portrait is almost out of the question. Rather than fight the feline nature, Johnson embraces it. \u201cCats do their own thing, so you have to get them to do their own thing with you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to take their mind off of what else is going on, and then they\u2019ll relax.\u201d\n\nZemel, who initially met Johnson at a cat show, told me he loved Johnson\u2019s portraits so much that he signed his own cat, Noodle, up for a photo shoot. \u201cThe images he creates are really elegant and glamorous,\u201d Zemel said. \u201cWhat's most striking about them, though, is that they capture the warmth and personality of the cats.\u201d", "description": "A professional cat portraitist reveals the secrets to his delicate craft.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/09/11271_136/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
