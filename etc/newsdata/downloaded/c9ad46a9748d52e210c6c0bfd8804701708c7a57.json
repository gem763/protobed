Bernard Sanders of Vermont sought to erase any doubt about his plans to stick in the 2020 presidential race following a heart attack, telling his supporters he looks forward to returning to the campaign trail as soon as possible and that his experience has reinforced his belief that it is time for big structural change in the United States.\n\nMr. Sanders said he\u2019s \u201cfeeling great\u201d and said his health scare reminded him of how lucky he is to have the sort of health care insurance that Americans across the country lack.\n\n\u201cSo what happens if somebody had no health insurance, who felt a pain in his or her chest, or felt really sick, and said to themselves, \u2018Do I really want to go to the doctor or the hospital because I don\u2019t have tens of thousands of dollars?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sanders says in a video released Thursday. \u201cIt made me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system, which leaves so many people uninsured, underinsured, causes bankruptcy, lowers credit scores for people who owe medical debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an insane, wasteful, bureaucratic system based on the greed of the health care system,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\n\nMr. Sanders admitted that he\u2019s had a \u201crough week\u201d but said that he is \u201cnot the only person in American dealing with adversity.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that half a million people are sleeping on the streets, that working-class individuals are struggling to put food on the table and that young people are taking on too much student debt.\n\nThe senator said his insurgent bid is facing challenges from Wall Street, the \u201ccorporate media\u201d that doesn\u2019t want to talk about real issues and the \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d as well as President Trump and the Democratic establishment.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, if you\u2019re gonna look yourself in the mirror, and you\u2019re gonna say, look, I go around once, I have one life to live, what role do I wanna play?\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
