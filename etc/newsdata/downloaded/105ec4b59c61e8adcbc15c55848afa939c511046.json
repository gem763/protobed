Tulsi Gabbard is with the Russians and the Russians are with Tulsi Gabbard. She confirms it every time she opens her mouth,\" former CIA operations officer and GOP policy director Evan McMullin tweeted.\n\nWhy it matters: A feud with Clinton could push Gabbard's campaign into the spotlight and increase her name recognition, as more than a dozen Democratic candidates remain in the 2020 race.\n\nThe big picture, per Axios' Marisa Fernandez: Gabbard's foreign policy stances significantly differ from other top Democratic candidates, especially on Syria. She has controversially defended Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and met with him on a secret trip to Syria in 2017.\n\nThe New York Times reported that alt-right internet stars, white nationalists and Russians have praised Gabbard's campaign.\n\nAt this week's Democratic debate, Gabbard condemned the news media, saying it was \"completely despicable\" to call her an asset to Russia.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Alt-right internet stars, white nationalists and Russians have praised Gabbard's campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/rQMPcZtQuEHE_JvfVvP1_WCx-50=/0x0:2989x1681/1920x1080/2019/10/19/1571491770274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
