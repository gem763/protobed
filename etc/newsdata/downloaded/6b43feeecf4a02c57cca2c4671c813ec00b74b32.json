Unable to process this news, the solicitor acted out by drinking far too much, and bringing men back to his place to party all night \u2014 much to mum Marnie\u2019s (Lysette Anthony) dismay. Things escalated further when he almost jumped off the archway \u2014 but Romeo (Owen Warner) managed to stop him from doing so.\n\nYes, it\u2019s clear that James isn\u2019t in the best place at the moment, something which Romeo learned the hard way when \u2014 after an argument between father and son \u2014 James punched him. Subsequent episodes have seen James wracked with guilt over his actions, but \u2014 in spite of him trying to make amends \u2014 Romeo\u2019s having none of it, and resolves to move into the Maaliks\u2019 empty house.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nIn the coming episodes, Peri (Ruby O\u2019Donnell) stumbles upon the young lad while he\u2019s hiding out at the Maaliks\u2019 and, as a result, she decides to take him some breakfast \u2014 during which she encourages him to make amends with James before it\u2019s too late. However, Peri later sees James getting rather aggressive with Marnie as he grabs her by the arm, and, as a result, she understands why Romeo is refusing to make it up with his dad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, Marnie discovers the truth about why Romeo left and she\u2019s disgusted at her son over his violent actions. As a result, she heads around to the Maaliks\u2019 and begs Romeo to give James another chance \u2014 what will the young lad have to say?\n\nMeanwhile, Juliet (Niamh Blackshaw) also finds out about the attack and she\u2019s furious with James. In fact, she accuses him of pushing Harry away too \u2014 something which hits a nerve for the solicitor.\n\nMarnie arrives just in the nick of time to see James lose his temper with Juliet, so \u2014 fed up with his abuse \u2014 she tells James to leave.\n\nIs this the end of James\u2019 relationship with his family?\n\nOr will he be able to see the error of his ways before it\u2019s too late?\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 15th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "James takes his frustrations out on those closest to him.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trailer-3-2445_1570486527.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
