It\u2019s one of several reasons why McConnell\u2019s political opponents have tried to stick him with the nickname \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d But what\u2019s gone largely unnoticed as the sobriquet has become a social media trending topic is how McConnell worked to keep money out of coal miners\u2019 hands\u2014even as he maneuvered to steer federal funds to the Russian-linked plant.\n\nThe scrutiny started in January, when McConnell voted to lift sanctions on Rusal, a Russian aluminum company formerly headed by Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, despite several of his Republican colleagues defecting and voting no. Rusal\u2019s de-listing caused an uproar among Democrats on Capitol Hill who viewed the deal the Treasury Department put together with Rusal as too lenient.\n\nThen, in April, the focus turned to McConnell. Just weeks after the Treasury Department announced the official de-listing of Rusal, the company announced a $200 million investment in the Braidy Industries aluminum plant in the northeastern part of Kentucky. Democrats raised questions about how much McConnell knew about Rusal\u2019s investment plan before he voted for sanctions relief. Rusal is the only outside investor in the plant.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast, a Braidy Industries spokesperson said the company has never lobbied members of Congress on sanctions issues and began working with law firm Akin Gump in May 2019 for \u201cgeneral government relations representation.\u201d The spokesperson also said no employee or director of the company has ever spoken to McConnell about Rusal.\n\nBut McConnell\u2019s connection to the Rusal-Braidy aluminum plant is deeper than previously understood. At the same time Rusal was lobbying the Trump administration to get off the U.S. sanctions list, McConnell was advocating for federal funds to be diverted to help with construction of the Braidy plant in Kentucky.\n\nSince 2016 the federal government has given states in Appalachia millions of dollars from the Treasury Department to help clean up and reform abandoned coal mining land, and to assist in economic and community development in those areas. McConnell and other Kentucky lawmakers, including Rep. Harold Rogers (R-KY), have advocated that the state continue to receive that federal funding given the impact of coal companies\u2019 bankruptcies. Two companies, EastPark Industrial and Ashland Alliance, applied for $7 million from the pot of federal money from the Kentucky state government in November 2017 for general sewer and road repair on 204 acres of land. The application also included infrastructure improvements.\n\nIn October 2018, McConnell, Rogers, and Kentucky officials announced that EastPark and Ashland would get $4 million. Then, in March 2019, the applicants confirmed that the $4 million would not go to funding general repairs but would instead go prepping for construction on the aluminum plant.\n\n\u201cAshland Alliance and EastPark will only be applying the $4 million to the Braidy Site preparation,\u201d wrote Ashland Alliance president Tim Gibbs in an email from March 2019 reviewed by The Daily Beast. \u201cThe $4 million in AML funds will enable Braidy to complete the $14 million total investment to stabilize the site for high precision manufacturing.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear when talks between Braidy Industries and Rusal began, but two sources with direct knowledge of the $4 million payout said McConnell went to bat for the applicants during the internal review process and was instrumental in helping them secure the federal funding.\n\n\u201c As site cleanup for the aluminum plant began, McConnell blocked a bill sponsored by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) that would have doled out federal money to help fund miners\u2019 pensions. \u201d\n\nAs site cleanup for the aluminum plant began, McConnell blocked a bill sponsored by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) that would have doled out federal money to help fund miners\u2019 pensions.\n\nEvery year the Treasury Department collects fees from coal companies based on how much coal they produce in their plants. Those fees are then doled out to the Department of the Interior in part for the purpose of cleaning up land that houses abandoned mines and for economic development and restoration of coal communities suffering from energy company bankruptcies. Manchin wanted to take the excess money from that fund and use it to secure coal miner pensions and health care plans. McConnell blocked the measure, claiming he wanted a more permanent fix to multiemployer pensions.\n\n\u201cThere are amendments that benefit Americans and West Virginians that are being blocked by one person: Mitch McConnell,\u201d Manchin said in a statement at the time. \u201cHe is the sole person that is blocking a vote on my amendment to\u2026 secure coal miners\u2019 health care and pensions, even though it has bipartisan support and would better the lives of every West Virginian, Kentuckian and American.\u201d\n\nMaking matters even more contentious was the fact that the majority leader helped steer $4 million in very similar federal funding for the Braidy aluminum plant construction. The $4 million came out of a $90 million allocation from the Treasury Department to the Department of the Interior to help three Appalachian states cope with the impact of a declining coal industry. The Department of the Interior did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, McConnell\u2019s office defended his decisions.\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell has long been and will continue to be a strong supporter of Kentucky coal miners and their families. He has met with numerous Kentucky miners about important issues including the challenges facing their pension plan,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cSen. McConnell is concerned about the challenges facing a number of multiemployer pension plans, including UMWA\u2019s pension, and he believes it is best addressed through a broader bipartisan and bicameral pension reform effort.\u201d\n\nBut some coal miners in Kentucky are threatening to throw their support behind McConnell\u2019s main 2020 opponent, Amy McGrath, if the majority leader fails to pass legislation that would help secure their pensions. Thousands of miners in Kentucky rely on the monthly $600 check to pay the bills and to buy groceries for their families.\n\n\u201c We\u2019re not ever going to quit until they give us what we\u2019ve earned. We\u2019re not going to quit until we get it. I hope Senator McConnell gets that. If he supports us, we will support him. \u201d \u2014 Dwayne Thompson, former Peabody Energy coal miner\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ever going to quit until they give us what we\u2019ve earned. We\u2019re not going to quit until we get it,\u201d said Dwayne Thompson, a 72-year-old former Peabody Energy coal miner from Kentucky. \u201cI hope Senator McConnell gets that. If he supports us, we will support him.\u201d\n\nThe United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), the national mining union, has for years called on McConnell and other lawmakers to pass legislation that would help mitigate the fallout of the increasing number of energy company bankruptcies and the closure of hundreds of mines. In 1974, Congress passed a law that established minimum standards for pension plans in private industry. That same year UMWA negotiated its pension plan with coal mining companies. But with the demise of the coal industry, the fund is running out of money. It\u2019s expected to be insolvent by 2022.\n\nBehind closed doors, two sources with direct knowledge say, McConnell has privately promised miners a more permanent fix to the pension issue, but even national coal mining leaders are skeptical that the Senate majority leader and his colleagues in Congress will help in the short term.\n\n\u201cCoal miners understand something\u2014when people tell us \u2018we\u2019re going to pass legislation\u2019\u2026 we don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Cecil Roberts, president of the UWMA, at a recent speech in Washington. \u201cAnyone who understands how Congress works knows that that\u2019s a fight.\u201d\n\nSeveral miners who spoke to The Daily Beast said they felt McConnell had blocked the funding for pensions because some of the union members had decided to support his 2014 election opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Others, though, were wary of going too far in their condemnation of the majority leader, saying that at the end of the day, McConnell was their best shot at ensuring they could continue providing for their families. (In 2017 McConnell helped push forward a bipartisan spending bill that included a permanent extension of health care benefits to thousands of coal miners.) On Friday two miners featured in an attack add by McGrath said they were not told their images would be used for a political campaign and demanded that McGrath stop airing them.\n\n\u201cWe thank Mr. McConnell for what he did to help on our health care, but now he needs to finish the job and do something about our pensions,\u201d said Bob Cox, a 73-year-old former miner who serves as the president of a local UMWA chapter. \u201cIt\u2019s a day to day concern for a lot of the older people I live with. They\u2019re not well and they don\u2019t need the extra worry that it brings on. If anything goes wrong, we won\u2019t last as long as we thought we would.\u201d", "description": "The Senate majority leader worked to keep money out of Kentucky coal miners\u2019 hands\u2014even as he maneuvered to steer federal cash to an aluminum plant connected to a Putin ally.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568095723/190910-banco-mitch-russia-hero_kkstry", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
