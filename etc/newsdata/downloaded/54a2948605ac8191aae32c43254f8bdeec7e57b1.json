I wrote extensively about that in my new book, \u201cCulture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation.\u201d\n\nThe latest example of this detestable scourge on history can be found in the pages of The New York Times.\n\nJournalist James Barron blamed the Muslim terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on airplanes.\n\n\"Eighteen years have passed since airplanes took aim at the World Trade Center and brought them down,\" he wrote.\n\nMr. Barron failed to mention those airplanes were piloted by Muslims. Not once in his story titled, \"Remembering Those Lost 18 Years Ago on 9/11,\" did he mention Islamic radicals.\n\nThe Times later changed the story to note that \u201cterrorists commandeered\u201d the airplanes and they deleted a tweet referencing the original story.\n\nIt was almost as if the writer invoked the dismissive spirit of Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Democrat congresswoman from Minnesota.\n\n\"Some people did something,\" she told the Council on American Islamic Relations earlier this year.\n\n\"CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\" Omar said.\n\nOmar, the first Muslim American woman elected to Congress, was rebuked by many conservative lawmakers.\n\n\"First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something,' tweeted Rep. Dan Crenshaw, (R-TX) \"Unbelievable.\"\n\nAs one of my readers so aptly noted, The New York Times summed up the events of that September morning as some planes just did something.\n\nLet's be clear about what really happened on September 11, 2001.\n\nThat was the day when Islamic radicals waged bloody jihad on American soil and slaughtered thousands of our fellow countrymen in the name of their religion.\n\nNever forget.", "description": "One of the greatest evils being perpetrated on the American .09/12/2019 3:11:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/254/af901e62-3e2d-4175-9e5b-b03cad5ae615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
