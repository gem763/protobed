The tariffs were imposed after investigations by the U.S. Department of Commerce revealed China was injecting those industries with state subsidies, distorting the pricing of the goods.\n\nHowever, the WTO had ruled at the time that such tariffs were illegitimate. The WTO decided in mid-August that the U.S. had not complied with the earlier ruling, paving the way for China to seek sanctions against the U.S.\n\nChina and the U.S. are locked in a continuing trade war. China has yet to sign off on an agreement that would see a relaxing of tensions between the two countries, and analysts are skeptical China will resume buying U.S. agricultural products, a key component of the deal.\n\nA Chinese boycott of U.S. agricultural goods has led the U.S. government to distribute over $28 billion in aid to farmers, more than twice the amount of the auto-industry bailout in 2008.", "description": "China is seeking $2.4 billion in sanctions against the U.S. for non-compliance with a WTO ruling dating to the Obama administration.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
