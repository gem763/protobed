From income generation to having an asset class that helps fight inflation, every investor should have some allocation to real estate. For most of us that aren\u2019t high net worth investors that means either owning one or two rental properties or buying real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nREITs make it real estate ownership easy and without many of the hassles that come with owning a rental property. With the security type, investors can gain access to a variety of property types and locations with one ticker. And thanks to their tax structure, REITs hand back much of their cash flows as dividends. However, there is one way that being a direct property owner does win big over REITs. And that\u2019s those sweet monthly rent checks from tenants.\n\nBut REIT investors may not need to fret.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere are a handful of top-notch and high yielding REITs that do reward their shareholders every month. And with these firms, investors big and small can finally gain all the benefits of a landlord without all the hassles.\n\nWith that, here are three monthly paying REITs to buy today.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAG Industrial (STAG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDividend Yield: 4.81%\n\nTalk about being in the right place at the right time. Thanks to rising e-commerce/omnichannel growth and a strengthening economy, STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG) has been a winner since its IPO back 2011- offering plenty of dividend growth and capital appreciation. The key is that the firm focuses on warehouse and light industrial properties. These property types have been big winners in the shift towards reshoring and online consumerism. Rising demand and rents have simply translated into gains for STAG.\n\nBut it\u2019s the kind of warehouses that STAG owns that sets it apart from rivals like Prologis (NYSE:PLD).\n\nSTAG focuses on single and smaller warehouse properties. The benefit to the REIT is that often these warehouses can be bought on the cheap and below replacement costs. Secondly, tenant pricing power and quality for many of these small- and mid-size firms allows STAG to charge higher rents than other warehouse REITs. Since 2007, rents for Non-Super Primary markets \u2014 the fancy way of saying STAG\u2019s niche \u2014 have grown by nearly 16%. This contrasts to just 9% growth for Super Primary ones. In the end, the combination of these two factors has helped support STAG\u2019s FFO growth and dividends.\n\nTo reduce risk, STAG has grown large. Today, the REIT owns more than 409 properties and no tenant makes up more than 2.1% of its warehouses. A strong balance sheet doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nThe best part is STAG is willing to share the wealth via a growing monthly dividend. All in all, STAG could be one fo the best ways for investors to become a landlord via REITs.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Hospitality (APLE)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDividend Yield: 7.31%\n\nWhen it comes to REITs, the lodging industry is often overlooked by investors. That\u2019s because, unlike something like an apartment building or medical office, hotel demand is very economically sensitive. So, historically, the lodging REITs have been a more volatile subsector of the market. But there are ways to reduce that risk and score a monthly dividend. Case in point, Apple Hospitality (NYSE:APLE).\n\nAPLE owns 234 hotels across 38 states. Like previously mentioned STAG, the win for Apple comes down to its niche. The hotelier focuses on so-called select-service or room\u2019s focused hotel properties. These fall within middle ground between budget conscience travelers and upper-scale consumers. Moreover, select-service hotels tend to be frequented by business travelers who aren\u2019t very price-sensitive given then tend to use expense accounts or receive reimbursements for travel. Top brands in APLE\u2019s portfolio include Hilton\u2019s (NYSE:HLT) Embassy Suites and Marriott\u2019s (NASDAQ:MAR) Courtyard, Residence Inn, and TownePlace Suites concepts.", "description": "There are plenty of benefits to having an allocation to real estate in your portfolio.
