Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), second from left, listens with President Trump during a law enforcement roundtable event in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington in March 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nMany observers think President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods will slow the economy and harm his reelection chances. But if Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has his way, those observers would be dead wrong.\n\nCotton\u2019s idea, contained in a bill he introduced Thursday, is simple: Give the tariff money back to the taxpayers. The Tariff Rebate Act would segregate the revenue from the tariffs Trump imposed pursuant to his authority under selected sections of federal law. It would then require that money to be divided equally among every adult American who files a tax return and does not earn enough money to be in the top four tax brackets. Every American filing alone who has taxable income of less than $84,200 and every married couple filing jointly making less than $168,400 gets a check.\n\nThat check wouldn\u2019t be small, either, especially if Trump goes through with his threat to impose more tariffs later this year. Using data from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, I estimate that about 193 million people would be eligible to receive a rebate. Cotton\u2019s staff further estimates that through mid-September about $38.9 billion would be available to send back. That\u2019s about $200 a person, or $400 for a married couple.\n\nThose checks could be even larger in the future. The Treasury estimates that tariff revenues will be about $47 billion higher this fiscal year over the last fiscal year before Trump levied any of his tariffs. Assuming that almost all of this increase is due to Trump\u2019s tariffs, that would increase the rebate check amount to about $240, or $485 for a married couple.\n\nThese figures would go up significantly if Trump\u2019s already announced future tariff hikes take effect. A new 15 percent tariff on $112 billion of Chinese imports took effect on Sept. 1. A 5 percent tariff hike on another $250 billion of Chinese goods is scheduled to take effect on Oct. 15, and a final 15 percent tariff on a further $160 billion of imports will be levied starting on Dec. 15. All told, these new tariffs could raise tariff revenue by a further $52.5 billion, more than doubling the amount of each rebate check to more than $1,000 for a married couple.\n\nCotton\u2019s approach addresses both the economic and political challenges arising from Trump\u2019s tariffs. Economically, giving the revenue back to average Americans offsets the expected rise in prices they will face as a result of the tariffs. Consumer spending, which was feared would decline in response to the price hikes, would now likely stay high: Why cut back in spending when you\u2019re not losing any money? That would keep the economy strong.\n\nThe bill would also have a strong political impact. Americans would be told something they have longed to hear for years: We are all in this together. \u201cAmerica First\u201d would become \u201cAmericans first,\u201d and people would know their leadership has their backs and is fighting for their interests. Instead of tax cuts for big business for the rich and bailouts for the well-connected, Trump would be coming to the rescue of ordinary people.\n\nThe rebates would be particularly attractive to Trump\u2019s working-class base. Take Wisconsin, which Trump unexpectedly won in 2016 because he dramatically outperformed Mitt Romney in its smaller, rural counties, grabbing more than 20 counties that Romney had lost. Most of those counties have a median household income below $49,000 a year, well below the Wisconsin and national median. A $1,000 check compensating them for the effects of a patriotic battle they wanted to fight anyway would look pretty good to them.\n\nTrump would also put House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democratic presidential contenders in a bind if he endorsed and pushed it. Democrats already are caught between free-traders and protectionists in their own coalition, so they can\u2019t take a purist free-trade position and simply call for Trump to end his trade war with China. Trump could challenge them to put aside partisan rancor and do something good for everyone. And what would they say in response? That they\u2019d rather use the increased tariff revenue to cut the deficit or put it toward more domestic programs? That\u2019s a political loser, and they would know it.\n\nCotton is known to be close to the president. Trump should listen to his ally and make this idea his own. Doing that would turn the new tariff money into economic and electoral gold.\n\nRead more:\n\nEugene Robinson: Trump\u2019s trade war could get him kicked out of office\n\nPaul Waldman: Who will Trump blame if we have a recession?\n\nThomas J.
