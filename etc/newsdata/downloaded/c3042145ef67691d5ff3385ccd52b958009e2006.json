A female passenger, who has remained unnamed, was apparently stuck inside.\n\nIt's unclear how long the woman was trapped, but footage of the incident shows numerous passengers trying to help pry the door open.\n\n\"We're just working on opening up the door at the moment, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, OK?\" a man can be heard saying in one video, which was posted to Twitter by a user named @taylorkkimber.\n\nOther passengers seemed to have had a more lighthearted response to the incident.\n\n\"I've been on many flights but this is a new one,\" passenger Todd Wagner said on Twitter. \"Bring on the bathroom humor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n@united flight 1554 just diverted to Denver because passenger is stuck in the bathroom. I've been on many flights but this is a new one. Bring on the bathroom humor. \u2014 Todd Wagner (@toddhwagner) September 26, 2019\n\nThe rescue attempts were unsuccessful, and the flight was forced to divert course for Denver. Once the plane landed, the Denver Fire Department came aboard and was eventually able to open the door, NBC News reported.\n\n\"Five burly Denver fire guys just got the woman out. The plane erupted in applause,\" Wagner tweeted. \"The woman looks mortified.\"\n\nUnited said the passengers were transferred to a new plane and that everyone made it to their final destination safely. The flight landed in San Francisco at 11 p.m. Wednesday night, about two-and-a-half hours after its original arrival time.\n\nAndrea Hiller, a spokeswoman for the airline, told USA Today that the company had reached out to each person on board \u2014 including the trapped woman \u2014 to apologize.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, this wasn't the only toilet-related emergency to occur on a plane this week. Thursday, an Alaskan Airlines flight was forced to divert its course after a passenger became angry that he was denied access to the first-class bathroom.\n\nThe man reportedly attempted to \"storm the cockpit,\" and the plane had to unexpectedly land in Kansas City, Mo., in order to remove him.", "description": "A United Airlines flight was forced to make an unexpected landing on Wednesday after a passenger got stuck inside the plane's bathroom.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OItp9RB9HHiDZmOIna5xDw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/4845x3176+556+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/3eeba8f0-e147-11e9-bbc7-31eee563bd51", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
