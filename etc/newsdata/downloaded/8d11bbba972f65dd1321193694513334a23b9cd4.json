The radio station posted the video of the performance online Monday.\n\nLil Nas X released a remix to his \u201cOld Town Road\u201d with Billy Ray Cyrus in April after the original version of the song was controversially removed from Billboard\u2019s \u201cHot Country Songs\u201d chart in March.\n\nIn July, \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d featuring Cyrus, broke the record for having the longest-running streak at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nClearly, Anderson .Paak\u2019s neo-soul twist of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d is also gaining some popularity on Twitter:\n\nI love black people. https://t.co/lfH0FVO1J1 \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) September 17, 2019\n\nYes.
