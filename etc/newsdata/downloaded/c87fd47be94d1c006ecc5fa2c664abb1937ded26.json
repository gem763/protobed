REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - The number of Democratic candidates on stage for the party\u2019s sixth presidential debate in December is set to be winnowed after stricter rules for qualification were announced on Friday.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, which sets the rules for how candidates qualify for the debates, announced tougher fundraising and polling thresholds for the sixth debate, which will be held on December 19 in Los Angeles.\n\nThe criteria will likely mean several lower-tier candidates who have made previous debates and are likely to make the cut for next month\u2019s fifth debate, could struggle to qualify for the December event, which will mark the half-way stage of the Democrats\u2019 debate calendar.\n\nThe DNC has continually tightened the qualifying requirements for debates as the year has progressed. The first debate in June was spread over two nights with 20 candidates. The last debate in Ohio earlier this month featured 12 candidates on one night. So far nine candidates have qualified for November\u2019s debate in Georgia.\n\nThe stricter criteria will mean candidates trailing the top five 2020 hopefuls \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg - will be under increasing pressure to make the cut for the December event.\n\nTo qualify for the Los Angeles debate, a candidate must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls, which may be national surveys of primary voters or single-state polls in the four early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. Alternatively, they can hit 6 percent in two early-state polls.\n\nIn addition, candidates must have received donations from at least 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 unique donors in 20 states, U.S. territories or the District of Columbia. The deadline for qualifying polls and donation targets is December 12. The televised debate on December 19 will be hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico.\n\nFor next month\u2019s fifth debate in Georgia, candidates need 3 percent support in four national or early-state polls and 165,000 unique donors, with at least 600 unique donors in 20 different states, territories or the District of Columbia.", "description": "The number of Democratic candidates on stage for the party\u2019s sixth presidential debate in December is set to be winnowed after stricter rules for qualification were announced on Friday.", "authors": ["Tim Reid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444924334&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1GW", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
