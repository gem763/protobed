Peugeot share rose more than 6 per cent to hit their highest in more than 11 years.\n\nYet if a combination of Peugeot and FCA succeeds in overcoming political, financial and governance hurdles, the new enterprise would still face substantial challenges.\n\nGlobal automakers face the prospect of a slowdown in demand coinciding with the most dramatic technology changes in a century.\n\nMorningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert said in a note that total volumes of FCA and Peugeot, including China joint venture partners, amounted to 8.7 million vehicles last year, ranking the eventual combined group fourth behind Volkswagen, Toyota and the Renault/Nissan Alliance, each at more than 10 million units.\n\n\u201cWe view the combination of these two companies as reasonable given global competition, high capital intensity, and industry disruption from electrified powertrain as well as autonomous technologies,\u201d Hilgert said.\n\nMore Advantages\n\nInvestors have speculated for several years that Fiat Chrysler \u2013 itself the product of an Italian-U.S. merger \u2013 was hunting for a further partner, encouraged by the rhetoric of the company\u2019s late chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\n\nFCA, controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy\u2019s Agnelli family, had discussed a combination with Peugeot earlier this year, before it proposed a US$35 billion merger with Renault.\n\nAt that time, FCA said a deal with Renault offered more advantages than a combination with Peugeot, but Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, broke off talks after French government officials intervened and pushed for Renault first to resolve tensions with its Japanese partner Nissan.\n\nParis has a 12 per cent stake in PSA through state bank BPI, while the Peugeot family and the Chinese government each have a similar holding.\n\nThe Chinese presence might trigger doubts in the United States over a potential merger, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high.\n\nMax Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein, said the combination of FCA and Peugeot had more logic and greater chance of success than the previously attempted FCA-Renault deal, but said PSA offered little synergies in the United States, Latin America and China. \u201cThe focus will be Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nPSA\u2019s supervisory board is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential deal, two sources close to the matter said. FCA said in its statement it had nothing more to add for the time being.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "A merger would create auto giant better placed to tackle a host of costly tech and regulatory challenges", "authors": ["Giulio Piovaccari", "Sudip Kar-Gupta"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/fiat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
