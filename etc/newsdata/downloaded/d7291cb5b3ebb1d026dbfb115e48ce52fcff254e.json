The movement sought out \u201cwomen of color\u201d to be its figureheads\u2014only to discover that these new leaders had a history of supporting anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Louis Farrakhan.\n\nThat\u2019s the tribalist style of today\u2019s \u201csocial justice\u201d movement. They cannot make common cause among all women because they are too focused on the grievances that one particular group of women has against another. So what started out as a \u201cwomen\u2019s march\u201d ended with bitter infighting between white women, \u201cwomen of color,\u201d and Jews.\n\nOr consider the Democratic candidates\u2019 recent LGBTQ Forum, where a question to Pete Buttigieg was interrupted by demonstrators who thought that letting a gay man ask questions was an insult to the transgendered. And then a transgender child was interrupted because letting a transgender child ask questions was an insult to black transwomen. How can you have an LGBTQ movement, when the L, the G, the B, the T, and the Q are so busy venting their resentment at each other?\n\nThese conflicts aren\u2019t mere excesses of the overenthusiastic. They flow from the fundamental logic of these movements.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Tracinski", "Thebulwark.Com Lebron-James-And-The-Narrow-Tribalism-Of-Social-Justice"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
