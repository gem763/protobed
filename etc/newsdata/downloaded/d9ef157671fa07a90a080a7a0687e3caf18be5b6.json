(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump spread shoddy information about Syria, the economy and matters at the heart of the impeachment inquiry against him in a week of caustic rhetoric.\n\nSome examples:\n\nTRUMP, on Hunter Biden, whose father is former Vice President Joe Biden, a Trump political rival: \"Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing, walks out with $1.5 billion. Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. ... So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don't think so.\" \u2014 Minneapolis rally Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There's no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.\n\nIn 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That's far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, told the PolitiFact website that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time and it ended up raising less than one-third of its target.\n\nTrump's attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president's activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.\n\n___\n\nIMPEACHMENT\n\nTRUMP: \"Adam should be Impeached!\" \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: \"Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech ...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors ... I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\" \u2014 tweet Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There's no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That's because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.\n\nThe House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges.\n\nTrump's reference to a \"fraudulent speech\" comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president's pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nSchiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the \"essence\" of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \"shorn of its rambling character.\"\n\nTrump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them.\n\nThe House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.\n\n___\n\nSYRIA and TURKEY\n\nTRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: \"I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don't even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged...down.\" \u2014 tweets Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's a dubious reading of Russia, in particular.\n\nBoth Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.\n\nIran and Russia are both key allies of Assad's government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don't mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.\n\nSome of Turkey's incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \"We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" \u2014 tweet Thursday.\n\nTRUMP: \"When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\" \u2014 tweet Monday.", "description": "President Donald Trump spread shoddy information about Syria, the economy and matters at the heart of the impeachment inquiry against him in a week of caustic rhetoric.
