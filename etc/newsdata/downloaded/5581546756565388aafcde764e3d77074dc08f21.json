But how did we get here in the first place? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nModest cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients are back.\n\nThe 68 million Americans who rely on Social Security will receive a 1.6% bump in their benefits next year, the Social Security Administration announced Thursday. For an average retiree who gets a monthly check of $1,460, that adds up to an additional $23.40 a month, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to be dipping into savings,\u201d says Mary Johnson, a policy consultant for the Senior Citizens League, arguing that the measure of inflation used to calculate benefits doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the spending patterns of seniors. \u201cAnd when they don\u2019t have the savings, they might have to borrow the money.\u201d\n\nAbout half of seniors rely on Social Security for at least half their income, and about a quarter depend on it for at least 90% of their income, AARP says.\n\nThis year, recipients \u2013 which include retirees, the disabled and young survivors of deceased retirees \u2013 received a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), or an average $40.90 extra each month, the most since 2012. But inflation has moderated over the past year, tempering the rise in Social Security benefits.\n\nOver the past decade, COLAs have averaged 1.4%, less than half the 3% average the previous decade, according to the Senior Citizens League. Since low COLAs have a cumulative effect over time, Social Security benefits are about 17.5% lower today than if inflation had averaged a more typical 3% over the same period, Johnson says.\n\n\u201cThe Social Security recipients tell us their standard of living has declined,\u201d Johnson says, noting big-ticket costs for retirees, such as health care and homeowners insurance have risen sharply.\n\nSocial Security checks (Photo: Bradley C. Bower/AP)\n\nIn fact, premiums for Medicare Part B, which are automatically deducted from many Social Security checks, are forecast to rise $8.80 month, erasing a chunk of the $23.40 cost-of-living increase. As a result, recipients with monthly benefits of about $550 will see their entire cost-of-living increase wiped out. However, under a \u201chold harmless\u201d provision, Medicare premium increases generally are adjusted so they don\u2019t reduce Social Security benefits.\n\nSomebody may be watching you: Don't look now, but your boss is probably spying on your work phone or computer\n\nJohnson and other retiree advocates have criticized the index that SSA uses to calculate benefits. That measure, the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, has largely reflected price increases for gasoline, electronics and other products that make up a large portion younger workers\u2019 spending.\n\nInstead, they have called for SSA to base the COLA on a proposed index for the elderly, called CPI-E, that would put more weight on items such as health care costs, which have increased more sharply than inflation overall.\n\nCracking down on gun sales: Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods sawed $5M worth of guns into scrap. It\u2019s not the only company limiting sales\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for upfront disclosure by hospitals of actual prices for common tests and procedures to keep costs down.
