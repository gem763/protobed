They included shipments to Canada, the Netherlands and Hong Kong where the necessary licenses hadn\u2019t been obtained.\u201d\n\nGoogle Play statistics put the number of Obsidian 4 downloads over 10,000; Apple, however, does not provide download numbers.\n\nTor Ekeland, a privacy-focused lawyer, told Forbes the order could be used for a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe danger is the government will go on this fishing expedition and they\u2019ll see information unrelated to what they weren\u2019t looking for and go after someone for something else,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\nJake Williams, a former NSA analyst and now a cybersecurity consultant at Rendition Infosec., told Forbes that Google and Apple should fight the request.\n\n\u201cThis type of bulk data grab is seriously concerning for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the download of an application does not automatically imply the \u2018intended use\u2019 of the application,\u201d Mr. Williams said.\n\nGoogle, Apple, and ATN did not respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment prior to publication.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
