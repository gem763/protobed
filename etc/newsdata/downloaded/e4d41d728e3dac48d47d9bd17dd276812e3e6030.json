The carefully edited footage on state-controlled television of Hong Kong's weekly protests ensures winds of revolution on the streets of the former British colony are unlikely to make their away across the bay into Shenzhen. While as many as two million people marched lawfully in the streets of Hong Kong against a proposed extradition bill, even the smallest of demonstrations are illegal in mainland China.\n\nThe Great Firewall of China, the Chinese government's internet censorship apparatus, bans any information which would motivate its citizens to consider any kind of dissent. The internet controls kick in on the bullet train during the ride from Hong Kong to Shenzhen, which mean travellers can no longer access Facebook, Google or many western news sites.\n\nWhen protests over a bill which would have allowed the Hong Kong government to extradite criminals to China first broke out in June, China's state-media did not cover the story. But as the demonstrations gained momentum, the most extreme footage of clashes between protesters and police were making the news. Fears that Beijing would intervene directly peaked in August when images of military personnel and vehicles in a stadium in Shenzhen were released. When The Australian Financial Review drove past the stadium late last week, there was no sign of any military presence .\n\nBeijing appears to be willing to let the Hong Kong government sort out the mess on its own, at least for now.\n\n\"I don't know why they are protesting. It is scary. It is risky to go there at the moment,\" says 30-year-old Liang who sells package tours and \"Octopus\" cards for Hong Kong's local transport networks to Chinese tourists in Shenzhen who are now avoiding the once popular destination. \"I just want the protests to finish soon so there will be a chance for my business to pick up,\"\n\nShenzhen is a green city with glittering high-rises, huge electronics markets, cinemas and government policies which attract an army of young professionals, technology companies and foreign investment.\n\nInternational schools are being opened in an effort to attract expatriate families and the Australian businesses community in Hong Kong has been a vocal supporter of Beijing's \"Greater Bay\" policy to create a megametropolis linking Shenzhen and other cities in the region. Australia's King & Wood Mallesons was one of the first international law firms to open an office in the city.\n\nLiang's tour business is down 40 per cent as less Chinese tourists head to Hong Kong. Michael Smith\n\nShenzhen is at the centre of Xi Jinping's push to make China a technology powerhouse and accounted for 48 percent of new patents approved in China last year. It feels like a young place, where one Huawei engineer in his early 40s jokes that he is under enormous pressure because there is an army of ambitious Millennials waiting to steal his job.\n\nThe Shenzhen government is also embracing tech companies as well as international research. It is funding a $100 million joint venture between Australia's Monash University and local property group Yungu Investment to commercialise R &D coming out of the university's Melbourne campus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Shenzhen believes in a small government and a big market,\" one property developer with connections to local officials says. \"It is the city most like Hong Kong in terms of business and contracts. But you can get things done quicker here than you can in Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe city is considered the birthplace of Chinese capitalism after former leader Deng Xiaoping designated it a special economic zone in 1979. But while it has embraced all the benefits of western-style capitalism, it does not share Hong Kong's western-style legal or political systems which are supposed to remain in place until 2047 under the One Country Two Systems policy.\n\n\"These protesters are crazy,\" says a Shenzhen taxi driver named Wu who says about a quarter of his passengers are visitors from Hong Kong. \"There is a big wealth gap in Hong Kong. The poor people are under a lot of pressure and the young people cannot pay rent. The protesters will only destroy Hong Kong.\"\n\nMany in Shenzhen see Hong Kong's civil unrest as a huge opportunity for the city of 12.5 million which enjoyed 7.5 per cent economic growth last year. As Hong Kong edges closer to a recession, Shenzen's property prices are booming and futuristic industrial estates are springing up all over the city.\n\nWang, a tout at the Luohu Port border crossing in Shenzhen, doesn't understand why people are protesting in Hong Kong. Michael Smith\n\n\"We see an increasing number of Hong Kong people buying properties in Shenzhen,\" especially in Qianhai area,\" says Li Yujia, senior economist with the Real Estate Assessment and Development Research Centre, a research arm of the Shenzhen government.\n\n\"Many Hong Kong property purchasers believe Shenzhen properties have better outlook and better return. With the prolonged riots, business in Hong Kong is falling and the same with rents.\"\n\nNot everyone in Shenzhen is rejoicing in Hong Kong's troubles.\n\nShopkeepers and tour operators in the grubby underground walkways connecting Hong Kong and mainland China at the Port of Luhou say business is at an all-time low. Many of the shops are still shuttered at 8am in the morning when the volumes of commuters and tourists should be at its peak.\n\n\"These days you can't be ambitious about earning a profit. You just try and tide yourself over in difficult times. I don't know why they are protesting. I've never had enough money to visit Hong Kong,\" says Zhang, who sells toys and headphones to tourists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome shopkeepers says the crowds are down by two-thirds as Chinese tourists steer clear of Hong Kong. Many do not want their photos taken or names used as they are selling fake goods. Yi has worked in a currency exchange booth at the border crossing for four years and she says business is down by two-thirds.\n\nFor the entrepreneurs running the high-tech companies that are the key to Shenzhen's growth, the protests across the border are a chance to attract more investment. However, many agree that Hong Kong's importance as a financial hub and a gateway for foreign investment into China remains important.\n\n\u201cI was a Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution. These Hong Kong rioters reminds me of the Red Guards. They are blind and irrational. Social problems can\u2019t be solved overnight just by chanting slogans,\" says Zhang Zhimin the chairman of fibre-optic company T &S Communications.\n\n\"There are always problems, but we should work together and solve them.\"\n\nQu Jian, vice president, China Development Institute says there is a role for both cities.\n\n\"Shenzhen\u2019s strength lies in scientific innovation. This is also growth engine of the city,\" he says.\n\n\"The Hong Kong riots help Shenzhen to attract more investment, such as investment in logistics. Some logistics companies had planned to make investments in Hong Kong, but they have diverted this investment into Shenzhen after all these disorder brought by riots.\n\n\"More Hong Kong young people will come to Shenzhen to develop their career after these events, because Shenzhen has a stable environment and bright outlook.\"\n\nBut no matter how high Shenzhen's economy soars, the tens of thousands marching in the streets of Hong Kong have no desire to pack up and live under Communist rule.\n\nMany of them had grandparents who fled southern China for Hong Kong during the Cultural Revolution when the view across the border was a lot different than it is today.\n\nThey have no desire to return.", "description": "Many in Shenzhen see the civil unrest in neighbouring Hong Kong as a big opportunity and are positioning the city as an alternative, stable, financial hub.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6659%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_413%2C$y_268/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c62b76747f51a8e9776c4ca40715743ebdac1967", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
