Little doors that opened to illustrations and stories were excitement enough in the countdown to Christmas but, in recent years, advent calendars have become another way of encouraging consumerism, with everything from luxury beauty products, food items and even alcohol hidden behind 24 tiny doors.\n\nNow, there is one to top them all, as Tiffany & Co has released a four foot tall advent calendar costing \u00a3104,000, making it one of the most expensive in the world.\n\nThe luxury jewellery brand has created just four of the calendars, which are filled with expensive gifts including diamond and tanzanite drop earrings, a bottle of perfume, and the jeweller\u2019s signature heart tag bracelet.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJust one of these wildly extravagant calendars will be available for purchase in the UK and will be stocked in Harrods from 9 November.\n\nPrices for the individual gifts range from \u00a3100 to \u00a313,000.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
