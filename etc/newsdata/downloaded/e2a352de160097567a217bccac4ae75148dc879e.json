Exhausted and unable to change, the five players failed to clear the puck on multiple occasions before Braydon Coburn beat Carey Price over the shoulder with seven seconds on the clock.\n\n\"We did a great job of hemming them in their zone,\" said captain Steven Stamkos, who leads Tampa with four goals. \"We were the beneficiaries of getting on the ice against some tired players. We were able to get some fresh legs and we capitalized.\n\n\"Any time you give up a goal at the end of a period is a momentum killer. We were on the right side of that one tonight.\"\n\nThe Lightning rode that momentum into the second period, scoring twice in a 57-second span and forcing Montreal to make its second crucial error.\n\nJulien needs Canadiens to play the full 60\n\nAfter Stamkos made it 2-1 on the power play at 1:04, Ryan McDonagh caught the Canadiens on a slow line change with a stretch pass that led to Tyler Johnson's 3-1 goal at 2:01. The Lightning scored three times on their first 10 shots on Price, who stopped 19-of-22 shots in defeat.\n\n\"Our biggest problem since the beginning of the season is we're not playing 60 minutes,\" said Julien. \"We need to correct that aspect of our game if we want to win more games.\n\n\"We couldn't clear the zone for almost two minutes. That cost us on a goal. On the second one, it was a bad line change that hurt us. It's self-inflicted. Those are things we just can't do.\"\n\nMontreal made no changes to the lineup that downed the defending Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues 6-3 on Saturday night at Bell Centre. The Canadiens came into the matchup with the league's fourth-best offence, scoring four goals per game.\n\nThe home side came out strong in the third period but Vasilevskiy turned away every offensive wave. Last year's Vezina Trophy winner made 14 saves in the third alone and improved to 8-1-2 in his career against Montreal.\n\n\"He made some great saves,\" said defenceman Victor Hedman of the 25-year-old Vasilevskiy. \"His reaction time, he's so quick in the net. Vasi is the best goalie in the world and he proved that again today.\"", "description": "Andrei Vasilevskiy made 33 saves as the visiting Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Montreal Canadiens 3-1 on Tuesday night in the fifth game of a six-game road trip.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322268.1571190656!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hkn-lightning-canadiens-20191015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
