Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne-Moss were previously reported to return while original trilogy co-creator, Lana Wachowski, is co-writing and directing.\n\nAccording to the trade, there\u2019s no word on which role Abdul-Mateen will be playing, though there was some talk of a young Morpheus role potentially being part of the film.
