Others never get resolved.\n\nHBO and Cinemax, for example, haven't been available to Dish or Dish-owned Sling TV customers since late last year.\n\nDish and Disney nearly faced a big blackout this weekend, but the two parties were able to come to a last-minute agreement, preventing several Disney-owned networks, like FX and National Geographic, from going dark.\n\nAT&T almost blacked out Viacom channels earlier this year, before the two companies settled their dispute.\n\nWhat's next: Expect more blackouts as major programmers weigh whether to renew distribution deals.\n\nLocal broadcaster Nexstar stations have been dark on AT&T properties since July 4, when the two companies announced they were unable to reach an agreement.\n\nLast week, 17 local broadcast stations in 12 markets owned by Meredith went dark for Dish customers.\n\nBe smart: Regulators rarely intervene in these fights, even when they're asked to, because they believe such conflicts are best left to the market to handle.\n\nThe bottom line: Distribution fights that limit viewer access are becoming much more frequent as the traditional television industry becomes upended by technology.", "description": "Distribution fights are becoming much more frequent as the traditional television industry is upended by technology.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/0zY0wlaGbkSHIIDzD2YGAiJTojs=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/07/23/1563876202227.png", "published_at": "2019-07-23"}
