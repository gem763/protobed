Wolfe added the team is not \"actively shopping\" Fitzpatrick and would require a \"significant return\" to move him.\n\nIt was just one year ago that Miami took Fitzpatrick with the 11th overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft in hopes he would be an impact player in the secondary for years to come. And it was a solid debut season for the former Alabama Crimson Tide star, as he piled up 80 tackles, nine pass breakups, two interceptions and one touchdown as a rookie.\n\nAs Pro Football Focus noted, Fitzpatrick was among the better defensive backs in football last season:\n\nNot only that, but he proved to be versatile:\n\nAfter his mother, Melissa, used social media last month to question the way the Miami coaching staff was utilizing her son, Minkah acknowledged that he didn't agree with his usage, per Mortensen: \"I'm not 215 pounds, 220 pounds. So playing in the box isn't best suited for me, but that's what Coach is asking me to do.\"\n\nThe 2019 campaign has gotten off to a rocky start for Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins defense.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens came to South Beach last week and put up 643 yards and 59 points en route to a blowout victory. That included allowing second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson to complete 17 of 20 pass attempts for 324 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nThat brutal loss led to \"multiple Dolphins players\" asking their agents to approach the team about possible trades, according to ProFootballTalk's Mike Florio. The Miami Herald's Armando Salguero confirmed that report, revealing \"at least three\" players sought trades.\n\nMiami can allow Fitzpatrick's camp to explore his market, but ultimately, it won't agree to a trade without receiving a return it feels is worthwhile. After all, this is a 22-year-old defensive back who has shown potential and is on a rookie salary through 2021, with the club also holding a fifth-year option for 2022 as well.\n\nFitzpatrick is expected to play in Sunday's game against the New England Patriots if no trade is reached.", "description": "The  Miami Dolphins  have granted second-year safety  Minkah Fitzpatrick  permission to seek a trade, according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen and Cameron Wolfe ...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/904/hi-res-06cbe36d8518172128ba85e1dccf883e_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
