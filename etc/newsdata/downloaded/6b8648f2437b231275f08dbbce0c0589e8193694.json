Lawmakers prayed in silence for the victims before starting the session.\n\nAbe pledged to do the utmost for the safety and rescue of those missing or those who had to evacuate.\n\n\u201cWe put the people\u2019s live first,\u201d he said.\n\nHagibis hit Japan\u2019s main island on Saturday, unleashing strong winds and dumping historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers in central and northern Japan to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power. Rescue crews on Tuesday were still searching for those missing, thought to number about 20.\n\nSome 34,000 homes remained without power and 110,000 others were without running water. More than 30,000 people were still at shelters as of late Monday, according to the Cabinet Office\u2019s latest tally.\n\nBusiness appeared nearly back to normal in central Tokyo, and residents in areas where floodwater subsided started cleaning their houses. Lives, however, remained paralyzed in Nagano, Fukishima and other hard-hit areas that were still inundated.\n\nWest Japan Railway Co. said its Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train services connecting Tokyo and Kanazawa in the central north were reduced because of flooding of six trains at its railyard in Nagano. The trains sat in a pool of muddy water that was up to their windows.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the site of the railyard, which sits in an area noted on a prefectural hazard map as a flood area. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the operator\u2019s preparedness should be investigated later but the priority is to get the trains out of the water. Some water has been pumped out, but more than half of the railyard is still underwater.\n\n___\n\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo.\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "description": "NAGANO, Japan (AP) \u2014 The toll of death and destruction from a massive typhoon that tore through central and northern Japan continued to climb Tuesday, as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/66dd9c_aptopix-japan-typhoon-72261-toshio-yonezawa-73-surveys-his-home-son-yusuke-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
