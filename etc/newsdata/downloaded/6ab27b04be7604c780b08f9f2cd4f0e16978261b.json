Unsurprisingly, commentors didn't hold back when it came to airing their opinions.\n\nThe damning photo shows the 'attention seeking' and 'shameless' stepmother in an white (or at least off-white) slip dress carrying a white leather handbag, perhaps recording the nuptials as she stands in the aisle next to the allocated seating area.\n\nOh no she didn't! An image of the woman wearing white at her stepdaughter's wedding was posted online and was quickly slammed by commentors on social media\n\nCriticized: The unknown woman, believed to be from the U.S., was mocked by internet users after being posted anonymously to the Facebook group That's It, I'm Ring Shaming\n\nWorryingly, this is just one instance of a woman close to the bride wearing white to a wedding.\n\nIn this case, as with the others, social media users were quick to take to the comments and blast the unknown woman as 'attention-seeking' and 'shameless'.\n\nJudging the woman's choice to stand-up throughout the ceremony, one said it wouldn't fly on her big day.\n\n'If anyone thinks I won't stop the ceremony mid vow and tell literally anyone to sit their a** down, test me,' she said.\n\n'Aside from the attention seeking, standing in the aisle during the ceremony is outright rude,' an outraged person wrote. 'I'd be f**king raging if that was my wedding.'\n\nAnother said, 'If they paid for a photographer then she has absolutely no reason to stand there.'\n\n'Did she stand in the middle of the first dance?', a third jokingly asked.\n\nShamed: Social media users were quick to take to the comments and blast the woman's actions as 'attention-seeking' and 'shameless'\n\nOthers were disgusted with the woman for picking a white dress to her stepdaughter's big day.\n\n'Who let her leave the house like that?' one woman asked, as another said, 'You don't wear white to someone else's wedding.'\n\nOne person fired, 'Someone should have poured red wine on her dress. Oops my bad. You don't wear white to someone else's wedding. It's tacky. Do people not understand etiquette?'\n\nHowever, some social media users suggested that the dress only vaguely appeared white, and was actually a lavender gown.\n\n'Is it more or is anyone else seeing a light lavender or grey? Look at her bag and the shoes. Those are white but her dress isn't,' an internet user suggested.\n\nTacky: Others were disgusted with the woman 'tacky' choice to wear a white-hued dress to her stepdaughter's big day\n\nDefense: Some social media users suggested that the dress only vaguely appeared white, and offered that it was perhaps a lavender gown\n\nThe woman in question isn't the only one to come under fire for her ill advised outfit.\n\nIn June, Amy Pennza, 40, from Kirtland, Ohio went viral when she tweeted a throwback of her mother-in-law wearing an actual wedding dress to Amy's ceremony.\n\nAt the time, she tweeted the story, alongside a photo of herself and the groom's mom wearing a rather similar white dress, in response to a call out from Jimmy Fallon for people's 'worst wedding fails'.\n\nHer revelation left people stunned, but Amy said it was water under the bridge and that she now adores her mother-in-law.\n\nIn fact, Reddit and anonymous Facebook groups are filled with similar 'horror' stories of mother-of-the-brides and mother-in-laws showing up kitted out in white.\n\nAwkward: The 40-year-old shared the story in response to a Jimmy Fallon request 'worst wedding fail' stories - before going on to reveal the surprising background to it\n\nShocking: Amy Pennza (right) from Ohio, stunned Twitter when she revealed that her mother-in-law (left) wore a bridal gown to her wedding ceremony\n\nBut then there's the other extreme altogether, as evidenced by an Australian bride who instructed every guest at her wedding in New South Wales to don white for the occasion.\n\nChristine Ghrayche, 30, told DailyMail.com that she had been planning the aesthetic for quite a while.\n\n'Being an interior designer and creative I've never been one to stay inside the box. The whole theme was white with a touch of greenery. I also wanted to make the day all about us, including guests, and not just me.\n\n'Yes, I was the bride, but it's the joining of two families so why not make us equal?'\n\n'Many guests were shocked by the dress code. We included it on the invitation set so everybody knew,' she said.\n\n'Luke had to field questions from a lot of his mates that weren't so fashion savvy. My family had a good whinge about it. But once it had time to sink in for everyone, it was fine.'", "description": "An image of the woman at her stepdaughter's wedding was posted anonymously to the Facebook group That's It, I'm Ring Shaming.
