And it wasn\u2019t a close game either. The lowly Jayhawks gashed Steve Addazio\u2019s defense for 567 yards \u2014 including 329 on the ground \u2014 in a 48-24 win in front of a stunned fanbase in Chestnut Hill. It was Kansas\u2019 first road win over a Power Five opponent since 2008 \u2014 a span of 48 games.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKansas beat Boston College on Friday night for its first win against a Power Five opponent on the road since 2008. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nThings weren\u2019t much better Friday night down in Winston-Salem where Wake Forest hosted North Carolina in a non-conference game (yes, you read that correctly). It wasn\u2019t that the game, a 24-18 Wake Forest win, was particularly bad. But the ACC had to admit publicly that there was an error in officiating in the game\u2019s final seconds.\n\nUNC\u2019s Michael Carter ran out of bounds at the Wake 43-yard line as the clock expired, but it seemed pretty clear that there should have been one second remaining in regulation. However, the replay official didn\u2019t even bother to give it a second look, forcing the ACC to issue an apology on Saturday. If the second was put back on the board, the Tar Heels might have had a chance for one final play. Instead, UNC never got that chance.\n\nSaturday was even worse for the conference. NC State was gashed for 173 rushing yards in a 44-27 loss to West Virginia, a team that entered Saturday\u2019s game with just 56 yards on 43 carries from its running backs. Virginia Tech, a team that lost to Boston College earlier in the year, had to overcome a 14-3 halftime deficit just to beat Furman, an FCS team.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the Hokies managed to avoid an upset, Georgia Tech couldn\u2019t do the same. The Yellow Jackets lost 27-24 at home in overtime to The Citadel, an FCS team with losses to Elon and Towson this season. It was a game that Georgia Tech thought it won, too. With 10 seconds left in regulation, the Yellow Jackets reeled off a 17-yard touchdown run that would have won the game. But the touchdown was wiped off the board because coach Geoff Collins called a timeout before the snap.\n\nGeorgia Tech thought it'd won the game with a last-second touchdown...but the Yellow Jackets called a timeout just before the snap. pic.twitter.com/EP9dX9w7q2 \u2014 CBS Sports HQ (@CBSSportsHQ) September 14, 2019\n\nInstead of a TD, the Yellow Jackets ended up kicking a field goal to force overtime. The Bulldogs hit a field goal to open the extra frame and then pulled out the win when a 46-yard try from Georgia Tech\u2019s Brenton King sailed left.\n\nAlso of note: The Citadel runs the triple option. Former Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson is smiling somewhere.\n\nCollins\u2019 timeout wasn\u2019t even the worst gaffe from an ACC coach either. No, that honor goes to Pittsburgh\u2019s Pat Narduzzi, who inexplicably sent the field goal unit out onto the field on fourth-and-goal from the Penn State 1-yard line. Pitt was trailing 17-10 at the time with under five minutes remaining in regulation and had already boldly gone for it on fourth and short from its own territory earlier in the drive. And yet Narduzzi sent out Alex Kessman for a 19-yard field goal try and he clanked it off the left upright. PSU went on to win 17-10 and Narduzzi tried to explain his decision-making afterward. It didn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nPat Narduzzi on why he opted for a field goal with a fourth and one with five minutes left, down seven\n\n\n\n\u2018Because you need two scores to win the football game.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe added that he doesn\u2019t question that decision \u2018at all\u2019 \u2014 Craig Meyer (@CraigMeyerPG) September 14, 2019\n\nJust wait until Narduzzi learns about two-point conversions!\n\nAnd while Clemson took care of business against Syracuse without much issue, the ACC\u2019s only other ranked team, No. 25 Virginia, had to stage a second-half comeback to beat Florida State, a team that was lucky to beat UL Monroe last week. UVA scored twice in the game\u2019s final six minutes and then stopped FSU at the 1-yard line as time expired.\n\nIt was a disastrous ending for FSU. Instead of spiking the ball and running another play, FSU snapped the ball to running back Cam Akers, who was brought down short of the goal line after it appeared the team couldn\u2019t get lined up correctly.\n\nThis is the disaster that was Florida State\u2019s final play. If you can explain that \u2026 go right ahead. pic.twitter.com/8YySFPdSM8 \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) September 15, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t much better for the officials, either. Two seconds expired from the end of Florida State\u2019s penultimate play and from when the clock was stopped for the ball to be reset. While Florida State\u2019s issues in not spiking the ball were largely self-inflicted, the Seminoles should have had a couple more seconds of cushion.\n\nRegardless, Virginia, allegedly the ACC\u2019s second-best team, barely beating a dysfunctional Florida State team at home sure feels like the conference\u2019s biggest chaos signal yet. It\u2019s Clemson and everyone else in the ACC. And we\u2019re not so sure anyone else is all that good. Even the clock operators.\n\nHere are the rest of Week 3\u2019s winners and losers.\n\nWINNERS\n\nOhio State: The Bucks are looking good. Ohio State has been the most spectacular team in the Big Ten through the first three weeks. The Buckeyes beat Indiana 51-10 early Saturday to go to 3-0 as Justin Fields threw for three touchdowns and ran for another. After a sleepy first quarter that had just 10 total points, Ohio State scored 44 points over the next two quarters to blow out the Hoosiers.\n\nCentral Florida quarterback Dillon Gabriel made his second-career start on Saturday. (AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\nUCF: There\u2019s the signature Power Five win UCF needed for its New Year\u2019s Six bowl hopes. And boy, was it impressive. Yeah, Stanford is bad \u2014 more on them in a bit \u2014 but the Knights were fantastic in a 45-27 win that wasn\u2019t nearly as close as that. UCF was up 38-7 at halftime and freshman QB Dillon Gabriel finished the game 22-of-30 passing for 347 yards and four touchdowns. It was the second straight start for Gabriel after Brandon Wimbush started the first game and, per coach Josh Heupel, wasn\u2019t 100 percent ahead of a Week 2 game against Florida Atlantic.\n\nOklahoma QB Jalen Hurts: The Alabama transfer was fantastic yet again in Oklahoma\u2019s 48-14 win over 0-3 UCLA. This is the one stat you need to know about Hurts\u2019 start to the 2019 season.\n\nJalen Hurts through 3 games...\n\n\n\nTotal touchdowns: 13\n\nIncompletions: 12#Sooners \u2014 Spenser Davis (@Davis_Spenser) September 15, 2019\n\nEastern Michigan: Illinois became the latest Big Ten team to lose to Eastern Michigan on a last-second field goal. The Eagles cut it close though. EMU was up 31-17 before Illinois scored 14 straight points to tie the game at 31-31 with 1:44 left. That was plenty of time for Eastern Michigan, however, who drove 68 yards in eight plays and Chad Ryland hit a 24-yard field goal as time expired for a 34-31 win. Chris Creighton\u2019s team is now 2-1 with an FCS opponent and MAC play on the horizon. A bowl looks pretty likely\n\nTennessee: Yes, we\u2019ve reached the point where Tennessee beating an FCS opponent is worthy of an entry in this post. But dammit, Tennessee looked good doing it. The Vols won 45-0 over Chattanooga and had a nice 38-0 lead at halftime. Jarrett Guarantano had to only throw eight passes and he completed seven of them for 142 yards and three scores. SEC play looks scary for Tennessee, but they\u2019re allowed to enjoy this week. We just won\u2019t mention that Georgia State lost 57-10 to Western Michigan.\n\nKansas State: Is Chris Klieman turning Kansas State into a mini version of North Dakota State? The Wildcats could easily have won by more than a touchdown in their 31-24 win on the road at Mississippi State. KSU fumbled three times, including twice on muffed punts. The Wildcats\u2019 stats from Saturday won\u2019t blow you off the page, but they held Mississippi State QBs to just 11-of-27 passing for 151 yards and a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nOklahoma State RB Chuba Hubbard: Hubbard is blossoming into one of college football\u2019s best backs. In a 40-21 win over Tulsa, Hubbard carried the Cowboys with 256 yards and three touchdowns on 32 attempts. He scored from 75 yards out on the first play from scrimmage and added a 30-yarder a few minutes later. And when Oklahoma State was running out the clock, he sealed the win with a 33-yard scamper to put the game out of reach. Through three games, Hubbard has 521 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nBonus winner\n\nMiami RB Jimmy Murphy: The senior scored his first touchdown Saturday late against Bethune Cookman. And he did a somersault to celebrate.\n\nScore a TD \u2705\n\nDo a Flip \u2705@CanesFootball's Jimmy Murphy out here living his best life \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/qVxdRzZvVz \u2014 ACC Network (@accnetwork) September 14, 2019\n\nMurphy, a former walk-on, was put on scholarship by former coach Mark Richt last year. Now he can say he scored a touchdown as a college football player.\n\nLosers\n\nMichigan State: How are the Spartans going to contend in the Big Ten East? It\u2019s a legitimate question after a 10-7 home loss to Arizona State on Saturday. Michigan State went over 50 minutes before it scored a touchdown and kicker Matt Coghlin missed three field goals.\n\nThe defense is top-tier. But the rest of the Spartans are not. Coach Mark Dantonio chose to make some offensive coaching staff reassignments instead of wholesale changes after a lackluster 2018 on the offensive side of the ball and those changes don\u2019t look like they\u2019re working just yet. And Michigan State doesn\u2019t have much time, either. A road trip to Northwestern happens in Week 4 and Ohio State looms on Oct. 5.\n\nColorado: What\u2019s up, Buffs? A week after coming back to beat Nebraska the Buffaloes lost to Air Force 30-23 in overtime. With Colorado\u2019s Week 1 win over Colorado State, the win by the Falcons means Air Force is the best team in Colorado. That\u2019s simply how it works.\n\nOn a more serious note, Colorado had to outscore the Falcons by 10 points in the fourth quarter just to get to overtime. And then Air Force won the game on a 25-yard run by RB Kadin Remsberg on the first play of extra time and stopped Colorado on its possession.\n\nThe home loss ruins all the positive mojo Mel Tucker had gathered over the first two games of his head coaching tenure. And things get tougher from here. Arizona State, the team that just beat Michigan State on the road, is Colorado\u2019s Week 4 opponent.\n\nStanford: How in the world did Stanford get like this? After a Week 1 win over Northwestern, things have gone very poorly for the Cardinal. Stanford has given up 45 points in back-to-back weeks in losses to USC and UCF. And, more troubling, neither game has been close.\n\nThe Cardinal last gave up 40+ points in back-to-back games in 2016 when it lost to Washington and Washington State in consecutive weeks. Stanford finished that regular season at 9-3 and then beat North Carolina in the Sun Bowl. Now that Stanford is 1-2 through three weeks, a lot of fans would immediately jump at the opportunity to take a 9-3 season and a Sun Bowl bid.\n\nIllinois: The Illini had a fantastic chance to get to 3-0 and halfway to making a bowl game with a home win over EMU. Instead, Illinois paid $1 million for the pleasure of losing to the Eagles.\n\nWell that plan backfired. Illinois handed Eastern Michigan $1 million to play the Fighting Illini in Champaign and lost on a last-second field goal. https://t.co/fH70gud5NL \u2014 USA TODAY Sports (@usatodaysports) September 14, 2019\n\nIllinois may end up seriously regretting that loss too. There isn\u2019t a game on the schedule where the Illini will be favored outside of a Nov. 2 game against Rutgers. Bowl eligibility might have disappeared the moment Ryland\u2019s kick went through the uprights.\n\nMinnesota: The Gophers are 3-0. But it\u2019s not a pretty 3-0. At all. Minnesota had a tough time against FCS South Dakota State in Week 1 and somehow forced overtime against Fresno State and escaped with a win in Week 2.\n\nA week ago in Fresno, it was a touchdown catch by Chris Autman-Bell with 46 seconds left that forced overtime. Saturday, Minnesota needed a great catch from Tyler Johnson with 13 seconds left to get a 35-32 home victory over Georgia Southern.\n\nThe Gophers look like a team capable of making a bowl game. But it\u2019s way too early to consider them serious contenders in the Big Ten West. That\u2019s three wins by a combined 13 points. The margin of error has been way too slim.\n\nColorado State: Things aren\u2019t looking too good for Mike Bobo and the Rams. Hoping to bounce back from a 3-9 season in 2018, Colorado State lost 52-31 in Week 1 to Colorado and fell 55-34 Saturday at Arkansas \u2014 a team Colorado State beat in 2018. That\u2019s 107 points over two games against FBS opponents in 2019. With Toledo and Utah State up next on the schedule, things may not get any better anytime soon for the 1-2 Rams.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The ACC's lone bright spot through the first three weeks of the 2019 season is Clemson.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jWpaDxwF68AXlAomSyOHfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k0PLdoxCRB_SOlyiiM54WA--~B/aD0yMjUxO3c9MzM3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/16aba150-d76b-11e9-abe6-c1c309a3ec11", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
