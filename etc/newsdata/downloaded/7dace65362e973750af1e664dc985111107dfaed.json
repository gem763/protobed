The Patriots traded Bennett for a seventh-round pick that can improve to a sixth-round selection in 2021, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported.\n\nBennett\u2019s versatility will be an asset to the Cowboys\u2019 defensive line. It ends a short stint in New England for Bennett, who was suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMichael Bennett was frustrated\n\nOn Wednesday, Bennett elaborated on his one-game suspension, which came from a disagreement with defensive line coach Bret Bielema.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s America, you can voice your opinion about certain situations,\u201d Bennett said, via Mark Daniels of the Providence Journal. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take away nothing. I got suspended. Lost money. What am I supposed to take away from that? There\u2019s no love lost.\u201d\n\nBennett was asked if he was happy in New England.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nBennett was always an odd fit with the Patriots. He likes to speak his mind and the Patriots don\u2019t like their players to say anything candid.\n\nBack in March the Patriots acquired Bennett and a 2020 seventh-round pick from the Philadelphia Eagles for a 2020 fifth-round pick. The Patriots were willing to take a small loss on the investment to move Bennett to Dallas.\n\nThe New England Patriots traded defensive end Michael Bennett to the Cowboys. (Getty Images)\n\nBennett lands on another team\n\nBennett is now on his fourth team in less than two calendar years. His very successful run with the Seattle Seahawks ended after the 2017 season. He spent a season in Philadelphia, less than a season in New England and moves onto Dallas.\n\nStory continues\n\nBennett is a three-time Pro Bowler but didn\u2019t have much impact with the Patriots. He had 2.5 sacks in six games, starting only one of them. The Patriots have the best defense in the NFL, and will probably be fine without Bennett.\n\nThe pairing just didn\u2019t work out. Most teams wouldn\u2019t admit that so easily and move on, but the Patriots were ready to send Bennett to another team in which he could be happier.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
