Several usual suspects were part of the anti-Trump line up: staffers from rival Democratic campaigns, angered residents and volunteers passing out impeachment merchandise (an impeachment shirt was on sale for $15).\n\nYet one anticipated group was noticeably missing: Benedict College students.\n\nBenedict alumni Shawn Torres told Yahoo News that current students were instructed to \u201cremain in place or leave campus\u201d during Trump\u2019s speech, essentially sequestering themselves in dormitories.\n\n\u201cA lot of them are opposed to this but have been silenced,\u201d said Torres, who added that only a handful of students from the college were invited, and the rest of the attendees were recruited from non-black colleges around the state.\n\nThe resulting scene outside the speech, which included an eclectic mix of student protesters, Tom Steyer volunteers and some Trump supporters, highlighted, if nothing else, the challenge Trump faces in winning substantial support among black voters.\n\nBenedict\u2019s students, though under restrictions during the speech, found creative workarounds. Some stuck their heads out of their dorm room windows and played hip-hop music in what appeared to be an act of unity with the protestors gathered outside of campus gates. Even such a small showing of support gave new life to the hundred or so anti-Trump protestors, most of whom were bused in by entrepreneur and presidential candidate Tom Steyer, according to the volunteers.\n\n\u201cFree the guys! Free the girls!\u201d chanted the protestors outside the dormitory windows. \u201cThey definitely got a voice too,\u201d said 40-year-old Jermaine Evans, an African-American Steyer volunteer.\n\nThe Steyer supporters, mostly black volunteers from South Carolina, weren\u2019t able to confirm exactly how many of them attended, but Evans added: \u201cWe got a busload, and a couple of vans, and another bus. We came out here in numbers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters outside a Trump speech at Benedict College.

Nobody is really listening to us and nobody really cares about the students. We are not supposed to be anywhere near President Trump.\u201d\n\nNews service McClatchyDC reported that more the half the room was reserved for allies of the president. During Trump\u2019s speech, only nine Benedict students were confirmed, but due to conflicts with ROTC training, seven showed up, according to the White House pool report.\n\nRepresentatives from Benedict College did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nA group of freshman from neighboring HBCU Allen College\u2014located across the street\u2014decided to show their collegial support for Benedict students by joining the anti-Trump protesters.\n\n\u201cI feel like that\u2019s wrong\u2014I feel like they do need to voice their opinion even if they do go to Benedict College,\u201d joked Allen freshman Justin Reid.\n\nThough there were tensions between Trump and anti-Trump factions at the protest, the scene appeard relatively muted compared to the president\u2019s rallies, or the Democratic presidential debates.\n\nPierre Wilson, the North Carolina state field director for Blexit, a movement to encourage black voters to leave the Democratic party, saw the relatively tame scene has hopeful for bipartisan dialogue.\n\nBut Wilson deflected when asked about Trump\u2019s recent use of the word \u201clynching\u201d pointing out that fomer Vice President Joe Biden also used the word in an interview over a decade ago. Biden has since apologized.", "description": "What if Donald Trump was set to make a grand speech to black students, but no one was allowed to come?
