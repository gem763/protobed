He greeted everybody as he does, and Speaker Pelosi started out the meeting \u2014 it was actually quite bizarre,\u201d Ms. Grisham said on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cShe had no intentions of sitting there. We had military people, we had people there to brief them and she was not going to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe got up; she stormed out. Her focus was getting to the cameras. It was funny to watch [Senate Minority Leader Charles E.] Schumer chase after her \u2014 I think he was a little worried that if he didn\u2019t leave with her that she would get angry with him,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Grisham said Mr. Trump was \u201cmeasured\u201d in the meeting.\n\n\u201cHe stayed behind and he worked with the Democrats who actually remained behind, too, and we continued the briefing and that was it,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Mr. Trump and Mrs. Pelosi have accused one another of having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d in the meeting, which touched on the administration\u2019s Syria policies.\n\nThe speaker said at her weekly press conference on Thursday that it would be interesting if there could be recording of such meetings, given such wildly different reports of what happens\n\nMs. Grisham, in turn, called for greater transparency in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cMaybe once she agrees to opening up this kangaroo court of hers, we could record the meetings that happen in the White House,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
