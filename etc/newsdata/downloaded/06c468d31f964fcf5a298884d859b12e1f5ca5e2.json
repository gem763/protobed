The Senate voted mostly down party lines in the 25-15 decision.\n\nAll five state senators representing Broward County voted to keep Israel in office.\n\n\u201cThat was very difficult to watch. They cried with us. They might even have seen my child dead, and so it was very difficult, and I know the Broward County voters are watching,\u201d Parkland parent and Broward School Board member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed in the shooting, told the Sun Sentinel.\n\nOn Monday, the Florida Senate Rules Committee recommended the removal of Israel, who was accused of mismanaging the response at the scene of the shooting, as well as failing to properly investigate prior threats against the shooter.\n\nDemocrats have largely backed Israel during the process, which was initiated when DeSantis suspended Israel in January after campaigning against him during the Florida general election.\n\nState Senator Perry Thurston told fellow Democratic lawmakers earlier Wednesday that \u201cif I was [sic] a parent I would want vengeance too\u201d but claimed \u201c95 percent of Broward County feels differently about the attempt to remove the sheriff.\u201d\n\nGary Farmer, another Broward County Democrat, said that emotions played a role in the outcome of the case.\n\n\u201cBecause of the horrendous and ghastly nature of that event, it\u2019s easy to be moved by the emotion and the pleas of the parents who are still grieving and who forever will be grieving for the loss of their children,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cWe are a country founded on rule of law. We cannot base our decision on emotion.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI hope the outcome provides some measure of relief to the Parkland families that have been doggedly pursuing accountability,\u201d Governor Ron DeSantis said.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Ilya Shapiro", "Kevin D.
