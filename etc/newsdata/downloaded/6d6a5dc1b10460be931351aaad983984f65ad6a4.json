Last season they only lost one game, but they drew too much.\n\n\"This season, they've already won a few scrappy games that they would have drawn last season.", "description": "Manchester City have dropped points in three games this season while Liverpool are unbeaten in the Premier League", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469305.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jurgen-Klopp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
