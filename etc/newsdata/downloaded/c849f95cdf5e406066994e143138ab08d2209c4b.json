Influencer? Fed's Bullard catches Trump's eye", "language": "en", "text": "ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - In 11 years as head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, James Bullard has found himself on most sides of the big debates inside the U.S. central bank.\n\nFILE PHOTO: St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard speaks at a public lecture in Singapore October 8, 2018. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\n\nHe has argued for aggressive efforts to lift the economy and at other times against them. He has criticized colleagues for doing too little to lift low inflation and for not acting to keep price growth in check.\n\nIt has earned Bullard, 58, a reputation as something of a gadfly in monetary policy circles, though \u201cThe Economist\u201d magazine once ranked him among the world\u2019s 10 most influential economists.\n\nFor the past three years, though, well before President Donald Trump\u2019s election, he has settled in place - as arguably the most ardent voice in favor of lower interest rates inside the Fed. It\u2019s a position that has caught the eye of Trump and others in the administration as the president pounds on the Fed to lower rates, albeit for different reasons than Bullard.\n\nBullard sees the United States as stuck in a low-growth rut, in contrast to Trump\u2019s best-economy-in-the-world rhetoric. Still, the overlap in their desire for looser monetary policy may be on the verge of boosting Bullard\u2019s influence.\n\nTrump has announced plans to appoint one of Bullard\u2019s top staffers to the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, an economist who shares at least some of his boss\u2019s views. There has been speculation Bullard could be a top candidate for Fed chair if Trump wins a second term.\n\nBullard \u201cis a real thought leader in the Federal Reserve system,\u201d Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last month, a remark the came just days after Trump had called Fed officials \u201cboneheads\u201d and Chair Jerome Powell naive.\n\nIt also came after Bullard dissented against the Fed\u2019s quarter of a percentage point rate cut because he wanted double that, his second dissent in favor of lower rates since June.\n\n\u201cAt times I have been in the middle of the committee. At times I have been on either end of the spectrum depending on the economic situation,\u201d Bullard said last week following a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Illinois. \u201cI think I have demonstrated my credentials as far as calling my own shots.\u201d\n\nWHERE WILL HE LAND?\n\nBullard\u2019s willingness to keep an open mind about how the economy works is valuable to a committee where \u201cgroupthink\u201d can be a risk, said Nathan Sheets, a former Fed staffer and now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. Nonetheless that can be difficult for investors who crave predictability.\n\n\u201cHis views are intellectually based...and those watching the Fed are well served to be thinking about what he is saying,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cThe question is over time, as he continues this journey, might he land at a different place?\u201d\n\nThat is a question Trump would have to ponder as well as he seeks to mold a Fed board more to his liking.\n\nPowell, the president\u2019s own pick as chair, lifted rates four times in his first year on the job, and Trump denigrated him for it. Powell\u2019s term lasts until February 2022, and in the meantime Trump has struggled to fill two open seats on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board.\n\nThe two people currently under consideration, economist Judy Shelton and Bullard\u2019s research director Christopher Waller, have yet to be formally nominated.\n\nIn an interview last month on SiriusXM Business Radio, Bullard said Waller, who taught at the University of Notre Dame before joining the St. Louis staff, would be a \u201cgreat addition\u201d to the Fed board who would have \u201chis own views\u201d about policy.\n\nThe two share some of the same concerns.\n\nBoth have made the case for more than a year that worrying signals in the bond market argued for caution on rates, with yields on long-term debt threatening to slip below shorter-term yields in a potential signal of coming recession. It\u2019s a debate that overtook the Fed earlier this year when yields did invert, and added impetus to the recent decision to cut rates.\n\nMEET ME IN ST. LOUIS?\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time the St. Louis Fed has argued for a different approach.\n\nA half-century ago, St. Louis officials publicly stumped for the monetarist theories of Milton Friedman and were criticized for clashing with the Fed leadership of the day. Their ideas were later embraced in the Fed\u2019s 1970s battle against inflation.\n\nBullard, a Minnesota native with a doctorate in economics from Indiana University at Bloomington, landed at the St. Louis Fed in 1990. He has a heartland background in contrast with the Wall Street and coastal university resumes common at the Fed.\n\nWhile seen as something of a policy outlier, it\u2019s also true the economy of late seems to fit his description of it.\n\nWhen U.S. central bankers started raising rates in 2015, they thought they were on a climb back to levels near those that prevailed before the 2007 to 2009 recession.\n\nWithin months Bullard lost confidence that would happen. He adopted a \u201cregime-based\u201d view which argued that the economy would not necessarily converge on one long-term outcome, the conventional approach to monetary policy, but could switch between different states. The new normal he saw was one of low inflation, low growth and low interest rates - until something happened to make it otherwise.\n\nWaller was among Bullard\u2019s co-authors of the paper introducing that view.\n\n\u201cFor a variety of reasons, that seems the world we are in,\u201d said Yale University economist Bill English, former head of the Fed\u2019s monetary affairs division.\n\nThe discussion seems to have drifted his way.\n\nSince 2015, the median expectation among Fed officials for interest rates in the long run have come down by a full percentage point, much more aligned with Bullard\u2019s world view.\n\n\u201cI do think that broadly speaking both markets and parts of the committee have moved closer to my view,\u201d Bullard said in an early September interview. \u201cThey might not use the same language, but I think they have moved closer.\u201d\n\nGRAPHIC: Bullard and Fed rates - here", "description": "In 11 years as head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, James Bullard has found himself on most sides of the big debates inside the U.S. central bank.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436126349&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910B4"}
