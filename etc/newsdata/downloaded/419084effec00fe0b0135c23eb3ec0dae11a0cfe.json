The results of the study were published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology. The study demonstrated a 76% percent freedom from atrial fibrillation at 12 months after a single treatment with the Globe system.\n\n\u201cI am very excited about the results from this first clinical experience with the Globe system\u201d said Prof. Hans Kottkamp, Head of Electrophysiology, Sana Hospitals, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, the principal investigator. \u201cThe Globe system has demonstrated the ability to provide rapid and effective pulmonary vein isolation. In addition, the ability to perform high resolution mapping and ablation of the atrium will deliver a unique and comprehensive treatment for patients that has the potential to further improve outcomes and advance new strategies for the treatment of AF.\u201d\n\nThe Globe system is a powerful mapping and ablation solution that consists of a sophisticated catheter with 122 electrodes and advanced software, that together enable rapid pulmonary vein isolation, high resolution mapping, and the ability to ablate anywhere in the atrium, all with a single catheter.\n\n\u201cThe Globe system is a tremendous innovation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation\u201d said Kevin Chaplin, CEO of Kardium. \u201cWe are very pleased with the positive outcomes of the GLOBAL-AF study and look forward to expanding the clinical use of the Globe system to provide physicians with a comprehensive system for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\u201d\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder and affects about 33 million people worldwide. It can increase the risk of stroke by up to five times.\n\nThe GLOBAL-AF study is a prospective multicentre study that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the system in 60 patients at two centres in Europe. Patients were assessed for atrial fibrillation with 7-day continuous Holter monitoring at discharge and then 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment. Patients in the efficacy cohort had 100% pulmonary vein isolation and 76% freedom from atrial fibrillation at 12 months, off antiarrhythmic drugs, after a single procedure.\n\nABOUT KARDIUM\n\nKardium has developed an advanced system for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, the Globe\u00ae mapping and ablation system. The Globe system delivers a complete solution for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Kardium was founded in 2007 and is based in Vancouver, Canada.
