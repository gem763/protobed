In all, 42 million Americans currently have student debt. The average household owes almost $47,000.\n\nTaylor Smith graduated from Texas A&M University, owing $53,000 in student loans.\n\n\"It just seems unconquerable. And that anxiety has just sat with me since,\" Smith said.\n\nMonth by month, Smith's paying it down. But 5.4 million student borrowers are in default. Johnson has a plan to wipe away much of it.\n\n\"$50,0000 of your federal student loan debt will be extinguished.\" he said, adding it won't be income-based. \"Everybody will get the $50,000. We are beset with a problem that has been 10 years in the making.\"\n\nTo pay for it, Johnson would hike corporate taxes by 1%. He's about to run in Georgia as a Republican for the U.S. Senate.
