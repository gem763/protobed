But that wasn\u2019t the only narrative that fell apart.\n\nYou seriously need to watch the whole thing:\n\nKavanaugh authors stopped by to talk about their book. I asked them why they appeared to blaming Fox News for their errors, why they didn't include Max Steier's democratic work history in their book, and more on Leland Keyser. You can watch it here: https://t.co/a7gCA2eHoQ \u2014 Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 19, 2019\n\nHow do Pogrebin and Kelly still have careers?\n\nThe best part is when Saagar asks them why she blamed Fox News and she said she didn't she just retweeted an article \"for balance\". The Vox article's main complaint is the use of \"correction\" instead of \"editor's note\". She then went right on to say they \"corrected\" the article. \u2014 John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) September 19, 2019\n\nIn this interview one of the authors of the Kavanaugh book, Robin Pogrebin, describes what the New York Times did as a \"correction\" when they added an editor's note She previously tweeted a Vox story accusing Fox news of twisting the NYT note as a \"correction\" when it wasn't https://t.co/gpTyaGZq8x \u2014 Tim Pool (@Timcast) September 19, 2019\n\nReminder:\n\nHow Fox News twisted the Kavanaugh scandal into a way to attack the New York Times @atrupar https://t.co/hZGKUXR1jZ via @voxdotcom \u2014 Robin Pogrebin (@rpogrebin) September 18, 2019\n\nThese women are a disaster.\n\nJust appalling! \u2014 April (@aprilmay1721) September 19, 2019\n\nDespicable can\u2019t even get started as a word to describe these two. It\u2019s sickening to my gut! \u2014 Chelly Longoria (@ChellyLongoria) September 19, 2019\n\nWomen continue to poop at work. https://t.co/HcdbZRrvdG \u2014 Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) September 19, 2019\n\nHeh.\n\nProof positive that someone out there had a worse day than Justin Trudeau. https://t.co/kg5UCU0Mgu \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) September 19, 2019\n\nAnd something tells us they haven\u2019t bottomed out quite yet.\n\nMeanwhile, kudos to Enjeti for demonstrating how journalism is supposed to be done.\n\nWow, you were fantastic.
