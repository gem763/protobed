According to Vanity Fair, the film will bring back the Knights of Ren \u2014 companions of Kylo Ren who made the briefest of cameos in The Force Awakens, but didn\u2019t show up in The Last Jedi. Vanity Fair says that they\u2019ll bring an \u201celement of chaos to the war between the Resistance and the First Order,\u201d but we don\u2019t know much about their role in the larger story.\n\nIn The Force Awakens, we learned that Kylo Ren was Han and Leia\u2019s son, and that he destroyed Luke Skywalker\u2019s fledgling Jedi Academy after falling to the dark side. We learned a bit more in The Last Jedi \u2014 that Luke, in a moment of weakness, contemplated killing his nephew when he sensed the darkness growing in him, sending him into his new persona. Hopefully, the series will add on to what little we know about Ben Solo\u2019s transformation into Kylo Ren.\n\nThe Lucasfilm publishing panel unveiled some additional titles and provided a look at some previously-announced books as well: Dooku: Jedi Lost, an audio-first title written by Cavan Scott, will get a print edition this fall, while George Mann will pen a Grimms Fairy Tales-style book set in the Star Wars universe.", "description": "When Disney released Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, its 30-year jump from Return of the Jedi introduced plenty of new characters and mysteries to the franchise.
