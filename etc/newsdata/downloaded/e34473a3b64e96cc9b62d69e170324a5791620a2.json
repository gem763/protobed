(They\u2019ve consistently beaten back rumors that former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is in the running to replace Pence on the 2020 ticket.)\n\nBut behind the scenes, tensions have been mounting among Trump, Pence and their top advisers ever since the GOP\u2019s resounding losses in the 2018 midterms. In the weeks afterward, Trump asked aides about replacing Pence on the ticket, and he asked again for their thoughts on Pence during his August vacation at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., according to Trump advisers who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about private discussions with the president.\n\nCurrent and former Trump and Pence advisers interviewed for this story, as well as my forthcoming biography of Pence, \u201cPiety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House,\u201d consistently described a personal relationship between Trump and Pence that is warm but somewhat aloof. Pence has a lane that he sticks to in the White House \u2014 conservative social policy \u2014 but he is not considered to be as influential as people like Jared Kushner or Stephen Miller.\n\nBut the relationship between their political teams has soured greatly in the past year, according to a dozen Trump and Pence aides and Republican advisers familiar with the dynamic. In particular, rumors that Kushner and Ivanka Trump wanted to consider replacements for Pence \u2014 specifically trying to find a woman running mate to help win back the suburbs in 2020 \u2014 have worried the vice president\u2019s camp, according to Trump and Pence campaign advisers who spoke on background for this story.\n\nVice President Pence speaks to the press in Dublin. (Reuters/Lorraine O'Sullivan) More\n\nHowever, none of those advisers claimed to have heard Kushner or Ivanka Trump directly discuss Pence\u2019s replacement, and a senior White House official categorically denied the couple had been involved in discussing changes to the 2020 ticket.\n\n\u201cThis story has been shopped in multiple forms to multiple media outlets but was never run by the others because the sourcing didn\u2019t hold up or withstand scrutiny. It is false,\u201d said the senior White House official when asked about the anecdote.\n\nAnd one Pence adviser noted that Trump has repeatedly told the vice president that he has nothing to worry about, and that stories of him possibly being removed from the ticket are \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the rumor mill, there do appear to be tensions between the Trump and Pence camps.\n\n\u201cThe perception is that Pence\u2019s team is difficult to work with,\u201d one Trump adviser said.\n\nThe adviser noted that, in his talks with Trump, the president has occasionally asked what the adviser thinks of Pence and his aides. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t come up organically. Somebody is saying that to the president,\u201d the adviser said.\n\n\u201cThere are certain pockets out there that want to solve their problems by replacing the running mate,\u201d said the Pence adviser. \u201cBut we\u2019re on the team. We might be JV, but we\u2019re helping reelect him.\u201d\n\nThe Pence adviser noted that Trump would automatically keep the support of \u201ctransactional evangelicals\u201d \u2014 televangelists like John Hagee and Jerry Falwell Jr., heir to the Moral Majority founded by his father. But Pence is essential to keeping quiet, less political evangelical voters in the fold for Trump.", "description": "Tensions mount between President Trump's and Vice President Mike Pence's camps as the 2020 election draws closer, amid discussion of their personal relationship and the recent rumors that Pence may be replaced by Nikki Haley.", "authors": ["Tom Lobianco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GyWCow836Y_SKLlvIUOWXw--~B/aD0zMjE0O3c9NDkxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/21ba99f0-cf3e-11e9-9fee-bd60d41b4a64", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
