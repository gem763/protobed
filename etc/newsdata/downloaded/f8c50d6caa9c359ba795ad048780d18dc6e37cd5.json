We would need a single Irish economic zone, or whatever you would like to call it, to cover more than agriculture and food,\u201d Varadkar said.\n\nVaradkar said he was not expecting a big breakthrough in the talks with Johnson in Dublin, but said he saw the meeting as \u201can opportunity to establish a relationship to see what common ground might exist\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we come to an agreement that will happen most likely in October at the EU summit,\u201d he said.", "description": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar plans to discuss whether regulatory alignment between Ireland and Northern Ireland might form the basis of a Brexit deal when he meets British counterpart Boris Johnson on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427676318&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870WK", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
