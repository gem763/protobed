Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhat should my breasts feel like?\n\nBefore you start thinking about signs and symptoms of breast cancer, it\u2019s important to get to know your own breasts and how they usually look and feel. That way, you can spot any changes and report them to your GP quickly.\n\nEvery woman\u2019s breasts are different in size, shape and consistency, and the NHS states that it\u2019s normal for one breast to be larger than the other.\n\nIt also says you might find your breasts feel different at different times of the month due to your menstrual cycle. Similarly, after the menopause, some women\u2019s breasts can feel softer and less firm.\n\nHow do I examine my breasts?\n\nWhen it comes to checking your breasts for anything unusual, the NHS says it can be helpful to stand in front of a mirror.\n\nFirst, it suggests examining your breasts for any visual changes and to look with your arms by your side and also with them raised.\n\nThen, you should continue by feeling each breast, checking everywhere there\u2019s breast tissue, including underneath your armpit and all the way up to your collarbone.\n\nWhat should I be looking for?\n\nAside from finding a noticeable lump, breast cancer can have a number of different symptoms.\n\nThe NHS suggests seeing your GP is you notice any of the following changes:\n\na change in the size, outline or shape of your breast\n\na change in the look or feel of your skin, such as puckering or dimpling\n\na new lump, thickening or bumpy area in one breast or armpit that is different from the same area on the other side\n\nnipple discharge that's not milky\n\nbleeding from your nipple\n\na moist, red area on your nipple that doesn't heal easily\n\nany change in nipple position, such as your nipple being pulled in or pointing differently\n\na rash on or around your nipple\n\nany discomfort or pain in one breast, particularly if it's a new pain and doesn't go away (although pain is only a symptom of breast cancer in rare cases)\n\nWhen and how often should I check my breasts?\n\nYou can check your breasts any time of the day, and anywhere, whether that\u2019s sitting on the sofa or when you\u2019re getting dressed.\n\nHowever, some people do find it easier to notice changes in the shower or bath, by running a soapy hand over each breast and under each armpit.\n\nWhile there is no specific number of times you should be checking your breasts, breast cancer charity CoppaFeel! suggests doing so at least once a month.\n\nThis way, you will build confidence of knowing what is normal for you and will notice any unusual changes quickly.\n\nIs it normal to have breast lumps?\n\nAccording to the NHS, lots of women have breast lumps and nine out of 10 are not cancerous.\n\nHowever, if you find changes in your breast that aren\u2019t normal for you, such as a limp, it\u2019s best to see your GP as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is a mammogram and when should I have one?\n\nA mammogram is an X-ray of your breasts, which typically takes place in a breast screening unit.\n\nMammograms can help detect small areas of calcium in the breast tissue, called calcification.\n\nCalcification can develop because of non-cancerous changes in the breast, however it can also be an early sign of cancer. Experienced technicians and doctors will be able to determine whether or not the calficication found is benign or requires further tests.\n\nCurrently, mammograms are offered to women who are 50 to 70-years-old every three years. However, the NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47 to 73.\n\nFor more information on breast cancer, you can visit the NHS, Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Now and CoppaFeel!", "description": "Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the UK with around 5,000 women under the age of 55 receiving a diagnosis every year.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/30/14/breast-check.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
