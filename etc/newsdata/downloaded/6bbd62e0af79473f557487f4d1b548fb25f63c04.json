REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra\n\nWhen the mother of six tried to return to work as a seamstress in her hometown of Butembo, her customers were too scared of catching the disease, despite doctors\u2019 assurances that she was no longer contagious.\n\nInstead she found work as a caregiver to children suspected of having Ebola only to be accused by neighbours of faking her illness to get the job.\n\nTo this day, Kavugho has not been able to find the graves of her 19-year-old daughter and two-month-old granddaughter, who died of Ebola while she was receiving treatment and were hastily buried to avoid any further contamination.\n\n\u201cI try to find the dates on the crosses that may coincide with their deaths but I always come back empty-handed,\u201d the 40-year old said softly as she clung to a picture of her daughter with the word \u201cadieu\u201d written alongside.\n\nAs of this month, more than 1,000 people have survived the 14-month Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo, the world\u2019s second deadliest, helped by new medicines that have proven effective against the virus when administered early.\n\nMore than 3,200 people are known to have been infected with the virus, of whom more than 2,100 have died since the outbreak was declared in the eastern region.\n\nThe survivors, who call themselves \u201cles vainqueurs\u201d - French for \u201cthe victorious\u201d - however struggle to return to their former lives as they deal with the fear of relapse, long-term health issues like blurry vision and headaches and stigmatization by their families and neighbors.\n\nVianey Kombi, 31, was a maths teacher when he contracted Ebola last November. Like Kavugho, he found it impossible to return to his former job and now cares for Ebola patients.\n\n\u201cIt hurts when I walk past the school where I was teaching, and the children who recognise me start screaming in my direction: Ebola, Ebola,\u201d Kombi said.\n\n\u201cWe have all been accused of receiving money to say that we had Ebola,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts a lot when your community treats you as corrupt after you\u2019ve been at your sickest.\u201d\n\nGIVING BACK\n\nAccusations like this are common in eastern Congo, where many residents see the outbreak as a money-making scheme made up by the government and outside organizations.\n\n\u201cI was even accused of having received money to bring people from my community to the treatment centre, to kill them with the virus and then sell their organs abroad,\u201d said Moise Vaghemi, 33, who survived Ebola in August.\n\nClick this link for photo essay reut.rs/2nRVrha\n\nMistrust and armed attacks against medical staff have slowed efforts to stamp out the epidemic. Even so, health authorities say survivors play a vital role in their communities by showing that Ebola can be overcome.\n\nSome say they draw strength from returning to treatment centres to work as caregivers for children with Ebola, many of whom have lost parents and siblings to the disease.\n\nThe antibodies developed during their illness mean they can spend entire days with patients wearing only partial protective gear and not the stifling head-to-toe suits donned by doctors and nurses.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nIn Katwa, outside of Butembo, Noella Masika, wearing blue scrubs, a surgical mask and a hair net, bathed a 1-year-old girl suspected of having Ebola in a small plastic bucket.\n\nMasika lost 17 family members to Ebola, including both parents and two grandparents, but she counts herself fortunate to have survived.\n\n\u201cI feel compassionate and grateful for the care I received,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel an obligation to contribute to the fight against Ebola.\u201d", "description": "Arlette Kavugho was discharged from an Ebola ward in eastern Congo in March, but her troubles did not end there.", "authors": ["Zohra Bensemra", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442196433&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0I5", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
