TravelEdge.\n\nA \u2018core crew\u2019 of four eXXpedition members will be on board for the majority of the mission, including co-founder and scientist Emily Penn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmily has been studying plastic pollution for the last 12 years and sailing the world\u2019s oceans with eXXpedition since 2014.\n\nBut she said that as concerns over the climate crisis grew, so too did interest in the project\u2019s missions.\n\nLast year, eXXpedition announced it\u2019s Round the World voyage and 10,000 women from across the world applied to join in.\n\nEmily Penn is leading the eXXpedition Round the World voyage (Picture: Eleanor Church/Larkrise Pictures)\n\nThe core team will be joined by 300 women from around the world (Picture: Eleanor Church/Larkrise Pictures)\n\nThe eXXpedition route (Picture: Exxpedition)\n\nSpeaking ahead of the team\u2019s launch in Plymouth, Emily told Metro.co.uk: \u2018These women are from all different backgrounds and are not just scientists and climate experts, but really concerned people with different talents and expertise who just want to be able to help.\u2019\n\nShe described the 300 as an \u2018army of changemakers\u2019 and said that with groups like Extinction Rebellion, climate concerns are being brought to the forefront.\n\nEmily said: \u2018I think people are realising that it\u2019s not just down to scientists and law makers, it\u2019s down to all of us to play our part.\n\n\u2018All of us are responsible and capable of making a difference.\n\n\u2018I have been studying plastics for 12 years but during a trip we made last summer I collected more plastic than I have ever seen in my life before.\u2019\n\nThe crew being made up of women is important as research into plastics being dumped into the ocean has shown the chemicals being released into the sea have a profound impact on female hormones and fertility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA study in June found the average person eats and drinks at least 50,000 plastic particles each year and breathes in the same amount.\n\nThe full extent of the health impacts of ingesting plastic are still not known but research shows some pieces of microplastic are small enough to penetrate human tissues, where they could trigger immune reactions.\n\nEmily said: \u2018The first time I started looking at the kind of plastic in the ocean it became clear this is something that affects women\u2019s bodies differently.\n\n\u2018The plastics we ingest have an impact on our hormones and fertility and whatever we take in we could be passing on to our children.\n\n\u2018It seemed to me to be quite a woman-centred issue.\u2019\n\nEmily has been studying microplastics in the world\u2019s oceans for 12 years (Picture: Exxpedition)\n\nThe mission is aimed at reducing plastic waste and discovering the true extent of the impact of microplastics (Picture: Eleanor Church/Larkrise Pictures)\n\nThe team will be made up of novice and experienced sailors (Picture: Exxpedition)\n\nThe crew will travel more than 38,000 nautical miles in 30 legs \u2013 with their first stop in the Azores in October.\n\nThey will be studying microplastics and toxics by day, and holding talks and discussions by night \u2013 with the mission aimed at celebrating women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths).\n\nIt is hoped the women who join the eXXpedition crew will then go back to their respective communities to report back on the research and raise awareness of plastic pollution.\n\nParticipants are aged between 18 and 57 and represent over 30 nationalities and include community leaders, academics, artists, filmmakers, business women, psychologists, doctors, actors, activists and sustainability experts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmily said: \u2018This unique opportunity to build a comprehensive picture of the state of our seas, while conducting much needed research that will inform practical and effective solutions to ocean pollution.\n\n\u2018We hope we can take a step forward to getting rid of plastic from our seas and their surrounding land.\u2019\n\nThe all-female crew will celebrate women in science, technology, engineering and maths during their voyage (Picture: Exxpedition)\n\nThe boat sets sail from Plymouth today (Picture: Exxpedition)\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
