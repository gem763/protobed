However, the Nationals have a chance make it up quickly as they travel to Atlanta for the first of four Thursday with the division leaders.\n\nSanchez lost for the first time since May 10, but gave the Mets credit for a hard-fought series.\n\n\u201cThey have a pretty good lineup,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cThey are strong and they can run.\u201d\n\nSanchez (8-7) gave up seven runs in five innings and allowed homers to Juan Lagares, Robinson Cano and Pete Alonso. Cano had three hits in his first game in nearly a month while rookie Alonso hit his 45th homer of the season \u2014 and seventh against Washington.\n\n\u201cThree mistakes,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said of the homers.\n\nThe veteran right-hander Sanchez said his pitches were too elevated as the Mets took two of three in the series.\n\nAnother concern for the Nationals is lefty closer Sean Doolittle, who made his second appearance since coming off the injured list Sunday. He hit 94 miles per hour on the stadium radar, which could have elevated readings, but took a stumble on his delivery and fell to the ground in the top of the ninth.\n\n\u201cIt scared me more than anything else,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what happened. I was OK; it just looked really bad.\u201d\n\nDoolittle watched the mishap on tape after the game. \u201cIt looks kind of funny,\u201d said Doolittle, who allowed no runs in one inning and lowered his ERA to 4.17. \u201cI was pretty happy with how I moved the ball around the zone.\u201d\n\nWashington third baseman Anthony Rendon was 2-for-5 with a double and has reached base 20 games in a row while left fielder Juan Soto had a walk and single as he wore plenty of protection on his arm after getting hit by a pitch earlier in the series.\n\nThe loss Wednesday afternoon came hours after the Nationals scored seven runs in the last of the ninth to beat the Mets for the biggest ninth-inning comeback in team history. Washington scored three in the sixth Wednesday off the hapless Mets bullpen to cut the deficit to 7-4 as Asdrubal Cabrera had an RBI single and Rendon drove in two more with a double. But the Mets\u2018 Jeff McNeil had an RBI single in the eighth off Fernando Rodney to push the lead back to 8-4.\n\nMets starter and winner Zack Wheeler (10-7) struggled most of the day, but allowed just one run on seven hits in five innings.\n\nThe Nationals took a 1-0 lead in the second as Trea Turner had an RBI single to drive in Gerardo Parra, who singled with two outs. Parra, playing right field in place of the injured Adam Eaton (knee), was hitting just .054 in his previous 15 games.\n\n\u201cThey beat us pretty well,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe faced three tough pitchers and the bullpen made it tough on us at times as well.\u201d\n\nThe Mets got a solo homer from Lagares off Sanchez to tie the game at 1-1 in the top of the third.\n\nNew York led 3-1 in the fourth after a two-run homer by Cano, who had dealt with a hamstring injury.\n\nAlonso hit his homer \u2014 a solo shot in the fifth \u2014 for a 4-1 lead against Sanchez.\n\nStephen Strasburg (16-5, 3.47) will pitch for the Nationals Thursday against Braves lefty Max Fried (15-4, 4.05).\n\n\u201cNow we get to play head to head,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
