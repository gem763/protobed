He\u2019s been brilliant for us. There is no use talking about who is not going to be here for a long, long time because he is not going to come on the pitch and help us until he is fit.\n\n\u2018Paul\u2019s been brilliant and he is a creative midfielder that we need, but then it is up to the others to step up.\u2019\n\nUnited beat competition from a host of clubs including Manchester City to sign Fred in a \u00a352m deal from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2018 but he has struggled to live up to expectations throughout his time at Old Trafford.\n\nFred has rarely been a regular for the club but his partnership alongside Scott McTominay has shown signs of promise over the past couple of weeks during the draw with Liverpool and win over Norwich.\n\nDiscussing Pogba\u2019s absence at the weekend, Solskjaer said: \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see him maybe before December. He\u2019ll be out for a while. He needs time to fully, fully recover, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be back.\n\n\u2018Maybe Sheffield United (on November 24) after the international break but probably December before you can see him.\u2019", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has backed Fred to replace the injured Paul Pogba in Manchester United's midfield with the Frenchman set to be out until December.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178629398_1572350710.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
