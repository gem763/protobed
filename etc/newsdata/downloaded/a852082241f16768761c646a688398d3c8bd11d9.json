The district preemptively canceled Thursday's classes earlier Wednesday but plans to keep schools open and staffed with non-union employees.\n\nSchools will remain open as a place for children to spend the day, and three meals will be served, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and other city officials said. But transportation and other activities, including sports practices and tutoring, are off.\n\nThe last major teachers' strike in Chicago was in 2012.\n\nChicago educators say the district has shortchanged schools after years of budget cuts and they want all the promises in writing. The district says its offer of a 16% raise over five years is comprehensive and \"historic.\"", "description": "About 25,000 teachers went on strike on Thursday morning over salaries, class sizes and the number of support staff", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/ada0752a-9cd9-4a3f-a810-370cf8a8e528/thumbnail/1200x630/4c181e4bcfc9e4aebb0cc1ecd0bffe8f/2019-10-16t144524z-978603027-rc1cccea1ab0-rtrmadp-3-chicago-education-parents.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
