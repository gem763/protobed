They\u2019re going to get stabbed.\u201d\n\nChild Rape Victim Claims Bradford, Rotherham, Rochdale Gangs \u2018Linked\u2019 https://t.co/xn81m3W0lC \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 25, 2019\n\nOne of the workers, who was just eighteen years old, interposed himself as a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d, \u201ccompletely defenceless\u201d \u2014 only for the member of Rahman\u2019s mob armed with the axe, Mohammed Awais Sajid, or \u2018Skinny\u2019, to suddenly slam the weapon into the young man\u2019s chest, smashing through his ribs and collapsing a lung.\n\n\u201c[Sajid] followed up with a 360 degree spin of his arm, an act which was doubtless employed to enhance the speed and devastation of the attack,\u201d recalled prosecutor Tim Storrie.\n\n\u201cThe blow itself was aimed at the victim\u2019s head. He was dimly aware at this stage of the weeping of blood down into his waistband. He was turning his body, attempting to leave the scene.\n\n\u201cThrough good fortune, he said he realised the axe was above him aiming for his head. He put his arm up to defend himself and the blade essentially severed his arm at the wrist.\u201d\n\nThe dreadful incident was only brought to a close by one of the tree surgeons revving a chainsaw at the mob to scare them away \u2014 although not before Rahman had shattered another of the worker\u2019s noses with a knuckle-duster.\n\nTheir teenage victim had to be airlifted to hospital for life-saving emergency surgery and reattachment of his hand \u2014 which will never be restored to its full function \u2014 which has been followed by another five operations.\n\nKhan\u2019s London: 16-strong Knife Gang Singles Out White Victims https://t.co/4SXAZDqlcu \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 28, 2019\n\nIncredibly, Sajid, of Moss Cottage, Kings Road, Rochdale, was acquited of attempted murder. MEN reports that he was instead convicted of a \u201csection 18 wounding\u201d and handed an 18-year term \u2014 although there is no indication that this was anything other than a standard determinate sentence, meaning he will almost certainly be automatically released on licence at the halfway point, if not sooner.\n\nRahman himself was given a four-and-a-half-year term, while brother Zillur Rahma and mob member Arsan Ali each received four-year terms for conspiracy to commit violent disorder \u2014 although again, it is standard practice in England that such terms are only served behind bars until their halfway point.\n\nNine other people investigated in relation to the case were released without charge.\n\nUK: Whites Scared, White-Owned Businesses Stoned in a Racially Divided Bradford \u2018Heading for Disaster\u2019 https://t.co/Rd1O6L29HD \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 24, 2017\n\nStrangely, there is no mention in local news or a Greater Manchester Police force statement of the authorities treating the crimes of Rahman and his compatriots as racially aggravated \u2014 which would attract tougher sentences \u2014 despite his statements about the victims being \u201cwhite bastards\u201d.\n\nIndeed, Rahman claimed he had received racist threats from the tree surgeons \u2014 claims the judge dismissed as a \u201cpack of lies\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a mob could be mobilised so quickly and so heavily-armed is clear evidence in my judgement that you are each associated with gang activity,\u201d the judge said, adding that none of them had shown \u201ca shred of remorse\u201d for the attack \u2014 strong words which belie the weak sentences he handed down.\n\nNo Jail Time for \u2018Frustrated\u2019 Asylum Seeker Who Swore to Carry Out Terror Attack Against \u2018White People\u2019 https://t.co/wgCuiPeHLV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2018\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "A gang set upon a four tree surgeons in Rochdale, calling them \"white bastards\" and cutting off a teenage worker's hand with an axe.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/rahman-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
