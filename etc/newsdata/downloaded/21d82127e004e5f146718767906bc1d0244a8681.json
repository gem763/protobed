It saw scientists carefully analyse hundreds of photos taken as part of UK-wide seal monitoring initiative.\n\nExplaining the decision to count using photographs, ZSL said it was \u201cmuch easier, and so more accurate, to count the seals in photos instead of the constantly moving, playful creatures\u201d.\n\nConservation Biologist, Thea Cox said: \u201cWe were thrilled to count 138 pups born in a single season\" Credit: ZSL More\n\nThe figures are good news for the harbour seal population which was decimated by two local disease outbreaks of Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) in 1988 and 2002.\n\nConservation Biologist, Thea Cox said: \u201cWe were thrilled to count 138 pups born in a single season.\n\n\u201cThe seals would not be able to pup here at all without a reliable food source, so this demonstrates that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and shows just how far we have come since the river was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.\u201d\n\nProject Manager, Anna Cucknell, who leads ZSL\u2019s Thames conservation said: \u201cIncredibly, harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries, like the Thames.\n\n\u201cBy the time the tide comes in they can swim away on it. Grey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.\u201d\n\nWhile the Thames is home to both harbour seals and grey seals, only the former breed there.\n\nThames seal population estimates have been conducted annually by ZSL since 2013. The most recent results, from 2017, recorded 1,104 harbour seals and 2,406 grey seals across the estuary.\n\nWhile population surveys indicate that numbers of pups are rising it is not yet known if this is due to resident seals having pups or from adults migrating from other regions where colonies are known to be dwindling.\n\nFound throughout the estuary and river, including in central London, the breeding survey allowed researchers to better understand the seals in the Thames and the reasons behind their changing numbers.\n\nAs top predators, the harbour seals are a strong indicator of a complex estuarine environment.\n\nA researcher undertaking a seal survey Credit: ZSL More", "description": "In 1957 the River Thames was so heavily polluted it was declared \u201cbiologically dead\u201d by the Natural History Museum leaving hope for marine life lost. \u00a0 But now, more than 60 years after the museum's dismal proclamation, experts have counted over 100 seal pups on the river\u2019s shores.\u00a0 Scientists from", "authors": ["Jessica Carpani"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lZeW0mvvwHvGdBDEhVMxZg--~B/aD0yODY7dz00NTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/26d1029c055f732a7306e32645729c6c"}
