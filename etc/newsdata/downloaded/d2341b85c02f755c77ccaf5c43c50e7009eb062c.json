Today, the false breakout was confirmed after Trump said he is making plans to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at a UN meeting later this month. A meeting between the two would be the first step towards easing sanctions on Iran and is generally considered to be negative for the price of crude.\n\nThe doji candle in WTI crude on a daily timeframe yesterday was a candle of indecision.

On a 240-minute USD/CAD chart, we noted the RSI was diverging with price, which is typically a signal of a potential reversal. This is indeed what happened as crude moved lower. USD/CAD traded to a high of 1.3214 and closed up 45 pips today at 1.3197. (The RSI is no longer oversold). Resistance levels remain the same as yesterday, horizontal resistance and Fibonacci retracements between 1.3230 and 1.3260. First support is now horizontal support at 1.3160.
