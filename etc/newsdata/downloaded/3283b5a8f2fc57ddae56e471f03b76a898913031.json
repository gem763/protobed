This may not sound like much, especially considering how much of an icon she has become among fans, so take that number as a testament to the scene-stealing power of Maggie Wheeler, who played Chandler Bing\u2019s on-and-off girlfriend throughout the sitcom\u2019s 10 seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since Friends wrapped up. Since then, Wheeler has scored acting credits in shows such as ER, How I Met Your Mother and Curb Your Enthusiasm \u2013 though none of her subsequent roles have made as much of an impact as Janice.\n\nFriends still has a special place in Wheeler\u2019s heart. She was on hand, along with James Michael Tyler (aka Gunther, the taciturn Central Perk barista with an indelible crush on Rachel) during a recent press preview for the new pop-up marking the show\u2019s 25th anniversary in New York City. Visitors could hear the occasional cackling laugh or Janice\u2019s trademark \u201cOh my God\u201d resonate through the pristine 8,500-square-foot loft space in Soho, whenever a journalist asked Wheeler to step back into her character\u2019s shoes for a few seconds. Does it ever get tiring, I asked, to always be brought back to that one character? Wheeler assured me it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like that to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I have been very blessed in a way to have a certain level of fame where I can enjoy that kind of moment but I\u2019m not being inundated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I think it can shift when people never call you by your real name, but for me it\u2019s really not like that.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Wheeler says, she\u2019s happy to have been a part of a cultural moment that made other people happy and perhaps helped carry them through more difficult times in their lives. Of course, that\u2019s the sort of thing you would expect a Friends star to say at the site of an exhibition powered by fan culture. But Wheeler\u2019s delivery seems genuine. We\u2019re sitting on the couch of a set replica meant to mimic the iconic Central Perk coffee shop, where Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Ross \u2013 sometimes joined by Janice \u2013 spent inordinate amounts of time. The faux set, she says, feels enough like the real thing that she feels \u201cquite at home\u201d in this environment. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve probably got a dressing room in this building somewhere, even though I know I don\u2019t,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo it feels incredibly familiar and comfortable.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWheeler gets animated when I ask her if there\u2019s one story arc she wishes \u2013 in vain \u2013 that the showrunners had explored for Janice. \u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d she says, before launching into the tale of the Friends episode that never was, which could have been titled The One With The Love Child.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the first season, I was pregnant with my first child. So at the first wrap party, I had to tell Marta [Kauffman] and David [Crane] that I was pregnant, and of course, I figured: \u2018Well, this is the end, they\u2019ll never have me back,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cSo I went up to them at the party and I said: \u2018By the way, I\u2019m three months pregnant. So in the second season, if you\u2019d like to bring back Chandler and Janice\u2019s love child, I\u2019m all about it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWheeler didn\u2019t have high hopes for that long-shot storyline, nor for her future on the show. She walked away, certain that she would start her family and that her Friends career would end with season one. That wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 and while Chandler and Janice never had a child, we did get to see a glimpse of a pregnant Janice in season two. In \u201cThe One Where Heckles Dies\u201d, she comes back, married and expecting her firstborn, to taunt her ex.\n\n\u201cWhen I was eight months pregnant, [the showrunners] called me and they had me come on the show eight months pregnant,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cMy husband was sitting in the audience on that day, and the woman sitting next to him said: \u2018Oh, that is so fake\u2019 \u2013 about my belly. And he said: \u2018No, that\u2019s real,\u2019 and she said: \u2018No, that is not real, it\u2019s like a basketball.\u2019 He said: \u2018No, it\u2019s real. It\u2019s my child.\u2019\u201d\n\nJanice, by the way, had a fascinating backstory that we, as viewers, never really got to explore. She married by season two and had a child. By the end of season two, she had an online affair with Chandler, whom she started dating again in season three. By season eight, she came back, married to a new man and about to give birth to their child. It begs the question, then: as an actor, did she ever fill in the gaps between those developments, to make sense of Janice\u2019s story?\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working on a sitcom, especially in my case, where there\u2019s time that passes in between my episodes, there\u2019s no time to do that kind of preparation,\u201d she says. \u201cThe script shows up at your door late on Sunday night, maybe at 1am, and I can hear the thud at the door and I run out in my whatever and go sit at the kitchen table and read through it and figure out what they\u2019ve done with Janice this time. \u2026 So really, a lot of this stuff happens on the fly \u2013 but I felt from the very beginning that I understood Janice. We have a good partnership, Janice and I. And so, whatever it was that they sort of threw at me, we just found ways to make it sing.\u201d\n\nThis is a radically different approach from that of James Michael Tyler, known to fans as Gunther. While less prominent, story-wise, than Janice, the lovestruck barista appears in 185 out of 236 Friends episodes, from season one to season 10. Perhaps his continued presence on the show is why Tyler felt inspired to craft an entire identity for Gunther despite the fact that his characters, as he points out, wasn\u2019t even granted a last name on the show.\n\n\u201cI thought that Gunther more than likely was at least of Dutch heritage because they have the episode where he speaks Dutch and understands it quite well,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe he probably slept or had a room in the back of Central Perk. I couldn\u2019t imagine that on a barista salary he could really afford a nice place \u2013 as nice an apartment as the friends have. I think he was a really nice guy. Deep down, I think he was an artistic, sensible soul. [He] probably wrote poetry and did nature photography. Socially awkward, I would have to say. He probably had some very close friends but they all played Dungeons and Dragons together.\u201d\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t have a chance to delve as deep into Janice\u2019s possible backstory, Wheeler does have a theory as to why Chandler\u2019s girlfriend-turned-ex-turned-possible-soul-mate, who is supposedly absolutely unbearable as a person, has turned into a fan favourite.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s this rare character who finds her way into the living room and into the coffee shop and the relationships that these friends have with each other. Everywhere they go, she\u2019s ubiquitous,\u201d says Wheeler. \u201cSo I just think that for the people who watch Friends and who imagine what it would be like to be there and to be in the room, I represented a way in. ... I just think it was that little magic trick of \u2018how do you get in there?\u2019 \u2013 and look who got in! This crazy, annoying, just persistent and sometimes clueless person.\u201d\n\nGunther, according to Tyler, has proven a somewhat unexpected icon for younger fans of the show. While he\u2019s a bit mystified by that, Tyler has a theory that Gunther\u2019s personality might be particularly appealing to younger viewers. \u201cHe\u2019s very real. He\u2019s not a bad guy, but he\u2019s a little bit disaffected,\u201d says Tyler. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a true reflection of someone to identify with, but he doesn\u2019t really put up with much. He\u2019s a nice guy but you can only go too far before he just says what he means.\u201d\n\nSeeing Friends through the gaze of younger, more socially alert fans has been an interesting experience. Many have pondered the show\u2019s portrayal of gender, race and sexuality, among other things. Wheeler acknowledges that some aspects of Friends feel \u201cincredibly retro\u201d, while reminding me that the show was, in fact, considered \u201cracy in a lot of ways\u201d back when it first aired.\n\n\u201cThey say hindsight is 20/20. You can\u2019t create a show with the consciousness of the future. The future hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s true that whenever you look back at a sitcom or at any television of that moment. You might see things that you might cringe at, or you might think \u2018That is just so politically incorrect\u2019 or \u2018Where is all the diversity?\u2019 Although that was a discussion that was taking place during the time that show was being made. So I\u2019m not sure if it could have been done a different way then, but clearly we know a lot more now, or the discussions are a lot more open now about inclusion, about diversity, about the spectrum of sexuality, about all of humanity. There\u2019s so much more of an open conversation about those things now.\u201d\n\nAs for Tyler, he agrees that parts of the show could be considered problematic nowadays. \u201cIf Friends were being produced today, they would have to steer away from certain subject matter or the way they approach certain subject matter,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, in the Nineties, it was a different time. It doesn\u2019t mean it made it right necessarily, but I think people\u2019s reactions to things have become more attuned and more acute, for the better in many many instances. ... I think it\u2019s a valid point, and I think it\u2019s a valid criticism of sort.\u201d\n\nThe 'Friends' pop-up is open in New York City until 6 October, 2019.
