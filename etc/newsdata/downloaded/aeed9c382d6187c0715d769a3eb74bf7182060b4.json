Distance-wise it\u2019s what he likes, he has done very well over this distance. Hopefully he gets a smooth run and then we are going to be able to find out who really is the best.\u201d\n\nFat Turtle claims the Sha Tin nightcap to give Joao Moreira a fantastic four-timer! 4\u20e3 #HKracing pic.twitter.com/5Q3OHSTvwS \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 1, 2019\n\nAethero was found out in the pressure of Class Two last start, looking uncomfortable in traffic and over-racing.\n\nThat third-placed finish brought this race into play and Moore says that another defeat on Saturday does not spell the end of his plans to run Aethero in the Group One Longines Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) on international day in December.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t in the plans originally but when we found that he was a work in progress in among horses, this race I thought was one to have him in to put a few more points on the board,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not make or break, there are other lead-up races to December. I\u2019ll keep finding other paths if needed.\u201d\n\nAethero has drawn barrier five while Voyage Warrior is in seven under Zac Purton, with Moore expecting his charge to shadow Ricky Yiu Poon-fai\u2019s galloper in the early stages.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll probably kick off behind Voyage Warrior because he gets fidgety in the gates and he might miss it a fraction but he\u2019ll get into his straps very quickly, within two or three strides he starts to motor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting to see how Zac rides Voyage Warrior, whether he goes straight to the front or what, but Aethero will be cruising outside him. Everything\u2019s right. His work leading in has been really good and he\u2019s raring to go.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Aethero meets Moore\u2019s expectations and makes it to Group One level as a sprinter, Moreira expects big things in years to come when the three-year-old steps up in trip.\n\nBack with a bang!
