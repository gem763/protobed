They\u2019re hurting a historically strong relationship by doing this,\u201d said the senior U.S. official who spoke on Tuesday.\n\nThe United States upholds what is known as the \u201cone-China\u201d policy, officially recognising Beijing and not Taipei, while assisting Taiwan.\n\nBut while working to counter China\u2019s expanding global influence, Washington has criticised countries for switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nAccording to State Department fact sheet from last year, USAID supports programs in Solomon Islands for disaster risk reduction and to counter the impact of climate change via assistance covering 12 Pacific Island countries.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard and military also trains security officials in Solomon Islands and the State Department said the United States provided $50,000 (\u00a340,086.6) to assist with a dengue fever outbreak there in 2013 and $250,000 to help with Cyclone Ita flood recovery in 2014.\n\nBeijing said on Tuesday Solomon Islands would have unprecedented development opportunities after cutting ties with Taiwan.\n\nSolomon Islands\u2019 decision followed a months-long review of the pros and cons of a switch to Beijing, which was offering $8.5 million (\u00a36.8 million) in development funds to replace support from Taiwan.", "description": "The United States is reassessing its assistance to Solomon Islands after the South Pacific nation cut ties with Taiwan in favour of China this week, a senior official in the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431357101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1U1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
