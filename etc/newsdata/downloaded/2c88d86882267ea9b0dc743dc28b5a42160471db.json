An arms sales embargo and other measures are on the table over what Turkey touts as a legitimate counterterrorist campaign.\n\nErdogan on Monday criticized a lack of support from nations that are supposed to be allies under NATO. \u201cAccording to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which side should they take? They need to stand by us,\u201d he told reporters, referring to the cornerstone of the agreement that says a military attack on one member is an attack on all of them.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Do people really think we should go to war with NATO member Turkey?' Trump defends Syria withdrawal\n\nErdogan said some people in Turkey thought the mistreatment was due to the fact that their nation is the only Muslim-majority NATO ally. He chose to believe that European leaders were simply misinformed about what Ankara was doing, the president said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that they, unfortunately, do not know many of the facts and are under the pressure of very serious disinformation,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Operation Spring of Peace targets Syrian Kurdish militias, which in Ankara\u2019s eyes are nothing but an extension of its domestic Kurdish guerrillas. Supporters of the Kurds say they played a key part in defeating jihadist forces in the northeastern part of the country, with the US providing air and artillery support.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
