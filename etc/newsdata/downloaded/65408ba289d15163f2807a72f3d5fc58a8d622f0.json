From Gabbard\u2019s interview with Jake Tapper:\n\nMy reason for going to visit Syria was really because of the suffering of the Syrian people that has been weighing heavily on my heart. I wanted to see if there was, in some small way, a way that I could express the love and the aloha and the care that the American people have for the people of Syria and to see firsthand what was happening there, to see that situation there.\n\nTAPPER: What did Assad have to say?\n\nGABBARD: Initially I hadn\u2019t planned on meeting him. When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt it\u2019s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we\u2019ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we could achieve peace, and that\u2019s exactly what we talked about.\n\nTAPPER: Now, Assad has used chemical weapons on his own people. You said it\u2019s going to be up to the Syrian people. But there really aren\u2019t free and fair elections in Syria.\n\nGABBARD: I\u2019ll tell you what I heard from the Syrian people that I met with, Jake, walking down the streets in Aleppo, in Damascus, hearing from them. They expressed happiness and joy at seeing an American walking through their streets. But they expressed a question. They said, why is it that the United States, its allies, and other countries, are providing support, are providing arms to terrorist groups like al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, Ahrar al-Sham, ISIS, who are on the ground there, raping, kidnapping, torturing, and killing the Syrian people? Children, men, women, people of all ages.\n\nThey asked me, why is the United States and its allies supporting these terrorist groups who are destroying Syria when it was al-Qaeda who attacked the United States on 9/11, not Syria? I didn\u2019t have an answer for them.\n\nLook, if you want to say the line between the \u201cgood\u201d Syrian rebels and the vicious Islamists is too murky to have any faith in U.S. efforts to arm the opposition to Assad, that\u2019s a reasonable position to have. Compelling, even. But what worries me is that in the entire interview, Gabbard never makes a criticism of Assad.\n\nYou can read about Assad\u2019s war crimes and horrific widespread human rights abuses here, here, and here as well as plenty of other places. You can read about the regime\u2019s repeated use of chlorine, nerve agents, sarin,. Despite the highly-publicized deal to eliminate the regime\u2019s chemical weapons, evidence indicates the regime continues to produce Sarin and VX. There\u2019s a particular kind of fool in denial who insists that the dozens of attacks on opposition-held neighborhoods are all elaborate \u201cfalse flag\u201d operations designed to frame the Assad regime. Never mind the testimony of Syrian military officials who defected.\n\n(ISIS is producing its own chemical weapons as well, particularly mustard agents.)\n\nNo doubt the intent behind Gabbard\u2019s trip was indeed sympathy for the people. But she came back expressing a perspective that\u2019s all too close to sympathy for the devil.", "description": "From the Thursday edition of the Morning Jolt:\n\n\n\nTulsi Gabbard Disappoints\n\nCongresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii was quickly turning into one of my favorite Democrats.\n\nAn Iraq war veteran, Gabbard was one of the few Democrats who grumbled about ...", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
