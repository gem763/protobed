This will allow the SABC to control its own destiny into the future. Previous funding challenges and an inquorate board for over five months this year has slowed us down but not stopped our OTT plans.\"\n\nOWNING THE PLAYER\n\nWhen the SABC's streaming service eventually launches, it will compete with a growing collection of existing (S)VOD services in South Africa ranging from MultiChoice's Showmax, Netflix South Africa, and Amazon Prime Video, to Vodacom Video Play, DEOD, VIU, Acorn TV and Cell C black.\n\nThe benefits of its own \"SABC iPlayer\" for the SABC will be multiple.\n\nLeveraging the use of a valid SABC TV licence as the login will help with compliance - some more people will likely pay their SABC TV Licence fees and keep it up to date in order to access the digital on-demand streaming service.\n\nREAD MORE: More South Africans than ever don't feel like paying their TV licence as SABC wants to increase fees\n\nWhen the SABC owns the platform as well as the content, it will also get access to extremely valuable consumer data and more precise user analytics. The broadcaster currently has no idea which or how many SABC TV licence payers are viewing which of its content digitally, on what platforms, or when.\n\nThirdly, the SABC will be able to customise the user-experience and interface and directly improve it based on feedback, and fourthly get the entire revenue stream of possible advertising where it now only gets a share from YouTube ads.\n\nLastly, the SABC on its own platform will be able to improve digital rights management (DRM) and protect its content better to prevent illegal copying and downloading which is currently taking place with its content it puts on YouTube.", "description": "The SABC is working on a paywall streaming service with the plan to make content accessed through it available with a valid SABC TV Licence number.", "authors": ["Thinus Ferreira"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9519/7742f85fb1274cb59d495eba61b99d53.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
