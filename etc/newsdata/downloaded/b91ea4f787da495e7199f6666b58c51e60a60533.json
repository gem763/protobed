Had she been reinstated, it would have been nothing short of disastrous for the resurrection of the NPA.\n\n\"The toxic influence that Ms Jiba wielded cannot be overstated and any hope of righting the ship would have been destroyed by her return. The criminal justice system is well rid of Ms Jiba and her total disregard for her constitutional duty and the rule of law,\" Breytenbach said.", "description": "Sacked deputy national director of public prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba's application to be reappointed has been dismissed in the Western Cape High Court with costs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8662/eea3c18be0444c35b4878135b014adde.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
