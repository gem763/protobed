The US Trade Representative's announcement said the GSP eligibility was open to periodic review.\n\nThailand has faced complaints for years over labour issues, particularly in its fisheries industry.\n\n\"Despite six years of engagement, Thailand has yet to take steps to provide internationally recognized worker rights in a number of important areas identified in a 2015 petition from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), such as providing protections for freedom of association and collective bargaining,\" said the US announcement.\n\n\n\nIt said the list of products to be excluded from GSP focused on those \"for which the United States is a relatively important market for Thailand, but where Thailand accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. imports\" and \"due to longstanding worker rights issues in the seafood and shipping industries, GSP eligibility will be revoked for all seafood products from Thailand\".\n\nMonsanto blowback?\n\nThe US move drew special attention because it came shortly after Thailand announced a ban on the herbicide glyphosate, which is sold under the brand name Roundup and manufactured by Monsanto, a US subsidiary of German pharmaceutical giant Bayer.\n\nLeaked letters to the Thai government from the US Department of Agriculture and its representative at the US Embassy urged a delay on the ban, saying the health hazards of the farming chemical had been exaggerated and the ban could affect the export of certain farm products from the US to Thailand.\n\nThe documents, whose provenance was not denied by the US Embassy, were leaked just ahead of the US announcement on GSP, fueling suspicion that the trade representative's action was retaliation. The suspicions were highlighted on Thai nationalist accounts on social media.\n\nHowever, Thai and US officials both denied any connection.\n\nA statement from the US Embassy, addressing concerns that reasons besides labour rights were behind the GSP move, noted that the GSP review of worker rights had been under way for six years.\n\n\"Despite the six years of engagement, Thailand has yet to take steps to afford internationally recognised worker rights in a number of important areas identified in a 2013 petition from the AFL-CIO, such as providing protections for freedom of association and collective bargaining,\" it said.\n\nThe statement expressed hope \"that in announcing this action, we will incentivise Thailand to move forward with legislation and administrative enforcement actions related to worker rights that could lead to a reversal of the GSP action.\"", "description": "The US announced Friday it was suspending $1.3bn in trade preferences for Thailand because of poor worker rights record.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/74342e3d6aae4c9da59fc29f7faea1fd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
