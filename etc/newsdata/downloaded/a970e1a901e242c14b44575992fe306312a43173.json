The fl\u00e2neur ambles with no destination in mind, despite a clear goal: to be at once part of a place and to be on the outside, observing it in a philosophical spirit that Antoine Compagnon, professor of French literature at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris and author of Un \u00e9t\u00e9 avec Baudelaire, said, \u201cis linked to not knowing exactly what you\u2019re looking for\u201d.\n\nFor Compagnon \u2013 and many other French experts \u2013 the fl\u00e2neur is an archetype linked not just to France but specifically to 19th-Century Paris. Following the 1789 French Revolution, which capitalised on the Enlightenment-era philosophy of egalitarianism, suddenly, any man could be an intellectual, a philosopher, an anthropologist of the present. And Paris was his ideal domain. At the time, the French capital was rapidly undergoing not just social but architectural changes at the hands of Emperor Napol\u00e9on III, evolving from a cramped amalgam of medieval streets to the clearly defined avenues, parks and vistas that define today\u2019s city.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why the French love to say no\n\n\u2022 Spain\u2019s untranslatable secret to lunch\n\n\u2022 The perfect French baguette\n\n\u201cFactories stood side-by-side with refined boutiques,\u201d said Andrea Schellino, director of the Groupe Baudelaire at Paris\u2019 Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, of the evolving 19th-Century city. \u201cThe fl\u00e2neurwas privy to this spectacle, turning this changing world into a vast theatre.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the fl\u00e2neur was a sort of revolutionary of his own: in a society that was suddenly marked by an ideology of progress, the fl\u00e2neur desired not to participate, but to observe.\n\n\u201cThe fl\u00e2neuris the anti-bourgeois in the 19th Century,\u201d Compagnon said. \u201cThe bourgeois knows where he\u2019s going: to work; to church; to the bank. He doesn\u2019t fl\u00e2ne. The fl\u00e2neuris in conflict with bourgeoisie, with materialism, with capitalism.\u201d\n\nThe 19th-Century French prose-poet and essayist Charles Baudelaire is often credited with being the first to assign a literary quality to this practice of directionless wandering, elevating the fl\u00e2neur from a mere loiterer to a philosopher-at-large, thanks to his essays set in Paris, including The Painter of Modern Life, first published in Le Figaro in 1863.\n\n\u201cFl\u00e2nerie makes even he who does not have a particular talent into a poet and artist,\u201d agreed Schellino. \u201cIt gives them a bit of the spirit of Paris.\u201d\n\nFl\u00e2nerie makes even he who does not have a particular talent into a poet and artist\n\n\u201cFor the perfect fl\u00e2neur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite,\u201d wrote Baudelaire in The Painter of Modern Life, of the distinct pleasure of disappearing into a crowd beloved by any city-dweller. \u201cTo be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at the centre of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world \u2013 impartial natures which the tongue can but clumsily define.\u201d\n\nFor Compagnon, Baudelaire\u2019s conception of the fl\u00e2neur is not just inextricable from his life in the 19th Century \u2013 a time when \u201ceveryone walked,\u201d he said, from G\u00e9rard de Nerval strolling through Paris with his pet lobster on a leash to Arthur Rimbaud supposedly walking the 200-odd km from Charleville-Mezieres to the capital \u2013 but also from the home of all three writers: Paris itself.\n\n\u201cParis is a shell-shaped city,\u201d Compagnon explained, referencing the arrondissements that swirl in the shape of an escargot (snail) from the 1st in the centre to the 20th in the north-east, creating the ideal path for an aimless wanderer, never retracing his steps, often unsure of where exactly he is or where he is going.\n\nGerman philosopher and literary critic Walter Benjamin associated the fl\u00e2neur specifically with Paris\u2019 street arcades, which were built under Emperor Napol\u00e9on III in the 19th Century as a means of providing safe, weather-protected shopping areas for the new middle-class. Benjamin, who famously analysed Baudelaire\u2019s conception of the fl\u00e2neur in his Arcades Project, written between 1927 and 1940, called attention to \u201cthese elegant ancestors of our malls,\u201d noted Schellino, \u201cwhich made up, in his eyes, the living quarters of the fl\u00e2neur.\u201d\n\nAt the time, these covered passageways that traverse the city, especially the arcades surrounding the Palais Royal gardens, were known as places where all walks of life converged: high-end boutiques and cafes coexisted with gambling salons and whorehouses: perfect for the withdrawn, philosophical observation that so characterised the fl\u00e2neur. In fact, for Benjamin, the passages and arcades were the fl\u00e2neur\u2019s natural habitat. Today, however, these spaces are far more within the purview of Instagrammers drawn to Daniel Buren\u2019s iconic black-and-white striped columns, a controversial art installation built in 1986, or to the antique book shops that line some of the remaining covered passages.\n\n\u201cCan we really wander idly and destination-less in cities saturated with tourists, with the permanent temptation to declare our route with a smartphone, or isolate ourselves with headphones?\u201d Schellino asked. \u201cAt the risk of seeming pessimistic,\u201d he continued, \u201cfl\u00e2nerie today is probably privilege of a few incurable nostalgics who insist on searching in modern Paris for the Paris of yesteryear.\u201d\n\nBut in today\u2019s world, while many people are far removed from walking as a principal method of locomotion, Paris nevertheless remains the ideal city for the sort of withdrawn, philosophical observation that characterises the fl\u00e2neur. The French, after all, are conditioned to take the time to observe their surroundings in a literary, philosophical way.\n\nIn keeping with a national love affair with intellectualism as detailed in The Week, French students still take philosophy classes through high school, and a philosophy degree is a frequent stepping stone to a career as a political speechwriter or government minister. In France, in contrast with many Anglophone cultures, this philosophy largely remains ensconced in an ideal of happiness that isn\u2019t linked to doing, but rather to being: in fact, the French have no word for forward-thinking, anticipatory excitement; and they\u2019ll happily remain at lunch for two hours, even in the middle of the week.\n\nThis rootedness in the present is an essential characteristic of the fl\u00e2neur \u2013 and the indissociability of the fl\u00e2neur from Paris is no coincidence, even today. Paris\u2019 sidewalk cafes almost exclusively feature chairs that face outwards, towards the street, towards the moving, living city. Its tiny streets still crawl across the city in a serpentine, spiral fashion, spitting the walker out, without warning, onto a massive boulevard or artful bridge offering views of monuments from Notre-Dame to the Eiffel Tower, the Pantheon to the Op\u00e9ra.\n\nA few of the city\u2019s 19th-Century covered arcades remain, dotted with bookstores, cafes and curiosity shops. Any corner could display echoes of nostalgia \u2013 an accordionist playing Edith Piaf; an artist sketching a vista \u2013 but also reveal a more modern metropolis that is no less enticing to the practiced observer. Older women walk tiny grocery carts and tinier dogs to their local morning markets for fresh, seasonal tomatoes; office workers dressed in impeccably tailored suits puff on e-cigarettes, emitting clouds of vapour that curl around 19th-Century lampposts; teenagers pop ollies on their skateboards in front of the Marianne statue, a symbol of equality and freedom standing tall and proud on Place de la R\u00e9publique.\n\nEven today, Paris is a city that caters to people-watchers, to observers of the urban. It remains, more than 150 years later, the world capital of the fl\u00e2neur.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
