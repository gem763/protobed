The 32-on-32 skirmish is the marquee player-vs-player mode in the game, and it embodies a specific grimdark fantasy of the high middle ages; two proud knighthoods, each defending a vague dynastic crest, cracking skulls with catapults, javelins, morning stars, and zweihanders. The mode channels the grisly travails of Battlefield\u2019s control-point tug-of-war: a wave of humanity routs a bastion of defenders, leaving the bravest of them dead, and the cowards in a breathless retreat. Players slowly raise a flag, girding their loins for the inevitable counterattack.\n\n\u201cDuring my day to day life, my creativity is stiffened,\u201d says one player. \u201cAnd one of the ways I express my frustration at this is by punching people in Mordhau.\u201d\n\nBut if you dig deeper, you\u2019ll discover that Mordhau is capable of empowering a very different kind of medieval daydream, one where there is no drama, or vainglory, or tyranny, one that resembles the hearty debauchery of a market square underneath Elizabethan ramparts. On \u201cduelyard servers,\u201d the kingdom is at peace, and the battles are a distant memory.\n\nAesthetically these dualyards feel more like Playstation Home, or Habbo Hotel, than a feudal warfare simulation. The only victory condition is to practice your swordplay, and hopefully make a few friends along the way. Pop into one and you\u2019ll witness a loose coterie of knights, milling about in chainmail, taking pot-shots at each other in the global chat. Nobody will kill you, unless you ask for it. Do you wish to challenge someone to a duel? Face them, and use the \u201cflourish\u201d emote. Your character will twirl their weapon of choice around in their hand. If your newfound rival reciprocates with their own flourish, be prepared to parry immediately.\n\nPlaying Mordhau With An Actual Frying Pan Medieval brawler Mordhau is supposed to be played with a controller or mouse + keyboard, but as with most games, a bit of tinkering can expand those options somewhat, up to and including the use of an actual cast iron frying pan. Read more\n\nFunctionally, duelyard servers exist for players who want to finetune their mechanics without getting backstabbed, or catapulted, or fire bombed. While there is no formal duelyard mode in Mordhau, the community has gotten around that by squatting on the game\u2019s deathmatch vertical. (\u201cUS EASTERN DUELYARD NO BOWS NO FIRE BOMBS\u201d reads a typical listing after a deathmatch search.) These knights have conquered the most anarchic mode in gaming, and the genial culture they\u2019ve built has alchemised in some bizarre ways.\n\nA makeshift Mutant Ninja Turtle, Mordhau-style\n\nToday, my favourite thing about Mordhau are the many weirdos, memers, and savants who take residence in duelyard servers, morphing the typical rigidness of a first-person hack \u2018n slasher until it is barely recognisable. Here are just a few of the profound incidents I\u2019ve witnessed in the past few months:\n\nA batsman and a catcher set up on the far edge of a medieval castle. A pitcher was a few dozen yards away, throwing rocks as a makeshift baseball.\n\nThree players who used the character creator to build spittle-dripping, loincloth-wearing cavemen. They were all huddled together in one corner of the map, and challenged the glorious knighthood to 3-on-1 duels. Finally, a chance to test the iron age against the stone age in mortal combat.\n\nA player who seemed content to bring nothing more to battle than a lute. They ran around the battlefield as a bard as everyone else took turns decapitating each other.\n\nAn honest-to-god Shrek, fresh out of the swamp, carrying two gigantic mallets in the same way Geralt of Rivia brandishes two distinct longswords. He was easily one of the most talented players on the server.\n\nTwo players who managed to coerce the character creator into generating a shockingly accurate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle skin. They exclusively dueled each other.\n\nFor me, someone who thought Mordhau was about as bloodsoaked and solemn as fiction could get, this was an unexpected evolution. The first time I walked into a duelyard, I realised that this game could also be an ideal hangout space. The sort of thing you fire up from your Steam library as soon as you get home to absently goof off with your friends throughout the night. Dueling & Chill.\n\nRandy, a 22-year old in Hawaii who runs a duelyard, explains the calculus perfectly. Shreks, cavemen, and baseball players aren\u2019t able to subsist in the calamitous Frontline. They\u2019d be both easy pickings and bad team players. But in servers like his own, where flagrant murder will earn you a boot, players have the time to execute some freakish ideas. \u201cI think [the weirdness] that stems from duel servers is the closed environment,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re almost forced to view others\u2019 odd behaviours because it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid it. Sometimes it can be annoying but most of the time it just makes me laugh.\u201d\n\nThat chaos factor has become a fixture in all of gaming\u2019s central squares. As a World of Warcraft lifer, I remember how gold-sellers used to spell out their URLs with carefully placed corpses in Ironforge \u2014 the macabre inventiveness of a community with too much time on their hands. When a game becomes less competitive-focused, and more of a plaintive social arena for its citizenry, there will be those who use the passive audience for their own entertainment.\n\nRandy saw this coming. He\u2019s a veteran of Chivalry, the cultishly adored medieval sim that predates Mordhau, which also had a ton of duelyard servers that served the same purpose. \u201cBack in Chivalry people used to hang out in the duelyard all the time,\u201d he explains. \u201cI always looked forward to hopping on and dueling with friends and just hanging out where people aren\u2019t always just trying to kill you.\u201d\n\nMarko Grgurovic, lead developer at Triternion and one of the people most centrally responsible for Mordhau, echoes the same sentiment. He tells me the history of community-made duel servers goes back even further than Chivalry. The first time he experienced them was in Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, another intensely-adored PC game that, to this day, provides more satisfying lightsaber combat than anything else on the market.\n\nYears ago, Grgurovic was one of those Jedis, doing a whole lot of nothing on a barren multiplayer map. He expected the same culture to seep into Mordhau, but admits that some of the more ersatz creations have taken him by surprise. \u201cIt was very early on, [people] started making these referee uniforms,\u201d laughs Grgurovic, referring to a subset of players who use dualyards to role-play as off-brand jousting officials. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a battle to make the game look how we want it. And then this happens. All these crazy characters coming out.\u201d\n\nHer frying pan is at the ready...\n\nOne of those eccentrics is \u201cKite,\u201d a 21-year old student from Ohio who asks me to use her Mordhau name. When I met her in a duelyard, she was wielding two frying pans as both her primary and secondary weapon. We both flourished, and she easily neutralised any offence I could muster from my much more imposing battle axe, carving up my healthpool with big, humiliating swings of skillet. This is emblematic of one of the scientific laws of Mordhau; the more under-armed a player is, the more likely that they will kick your arse. In a Discord interview afterward, she told me that she thinks her creativity comes from the game\u2019s \u201climited scope,\u201d the natural inspiration that occurs when there are few basic ingredients. \u201cFrying pans are in fact a fairly decent weapon, and putting yourself under certain challenges, like the zero armour of a peasant, can spice up things when you start being too good at the game,\u201d she says.\n\nMordhau Developers Address Controversy, Saying They Won't Add Gender Or Race Filters After a controversial interview with PC Gamer discussing Mordhau players\u2019 use of slurs and the potential implementation of a race or gender toggle, the game\u2019s developers issued a statement last night to clarify their stances. Read more\n\nBut there\u2019s another wrinkle to Kite\u2019s praxis: She is a woman, and mentions that Mordhau earns its reputation for being a toxic social experience. \u201cThe crusader imagery and the \u2018deus vult\u2019 phrase have been heavily co-opted by white nationalist groups,\u201d she says. \u201cI doubt I need to explain why they\u2019re majorly toxic players.\u201d Kite sticks around Mordhau \u2014 the sensation of the overhand swing feels too good to leave behind \u2014 but she says her frying pan-centric build affords her some quiet feminist revenge; wrecking the regressive right with the singular symbol of repressed womanhood.\n\n... the frying pan hits hard.\n\nOf course, not everyone packs political rebukes in their Mordhau duelyard strategy. Another player, a 26-year old who was born in Tanzania and now lives in America, dressed his character as a yoked cage fighter, complete with fight shorts and boxing gloves. He was unarmed, and bravely jostled with the spears, knives, and mauls with nothing more than his bare hands. \u201cThe fists don\u2019t control like many of the other \u2018weapons\u2019 in the game, giving me an entirely new thing to learn,\u201d he told me. \u201cDuring my day to day life, my creativity is stiffened, and one of the ways I express my frustration at this is by punching people in Mordhau.\u201d\n\nI asked him if he was surprised at all to find a home in the relative zaniness of the duelyard, rather than the more traditional, more serious warfare to be found in Mordhau\u2019s other modes. \u201cGod no,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI played Chivalry, and this is all I did in that game too.\u201d\n\nThe lingering question is if Triternion will attempt to formalise the duelyards under its own wing. For now, these hangout servers are unofficial. There are no rulesets or frameworks in place, and that leads to its own idiosyncratic set of problems. Anyone can storm a duelyard and start dishonorably slaughtering the humble baseball players, (this is called RDMing, or \u201cRandom Death Match-ing,\u201d) which can only be punished with the swiftness of a vote-to-kick poll.\n\nThere is also the frequent interruptions of a victory screen in the middle of a languid session. Whether anyone wants them to or not, these servers are keeping a score, and are barreling toward an end point. Eventually, someone, somewhere in the duelyard will absent-mindedly cross the kill threshold and win this deathmatch-only-in-name. Mordhau does not yet have the ability to think of these servers as a lobby rather than a competition. The computer plays by the rules it was built with, so it\u2019s time to load a new map and reset everyone\u2019s score to zero.\n\nAll of this is on Grgurovic\u2019s mind. The team is currently finalising a \u201cduel\u201d mode, in which players can work their way through a gauntlet of one-on-one matches to claim ultimate superiority. But he admits that this ruleset will be stringent and high-intensity, without any of the wonderfully mellow vibes that draw people to their own duelyards. \u201cThere were some mods in Chivalry that had these things where you could duel without influence [on] other people [around you,] but there\u2019s always some trade-offs,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we\u2019ll definitely do some sort of practice mode in the future. Be it us or the modders. But we don\u2019t have anything concrete at this point.\u201d\n\nUntil then, this community will thrive in the loose pact of free-for-all duelyards. Trading parries, as the Shreks and Ninja Turtles look on.\n\nLuke Winkie is a writer and former pizza maker from San Diego, currently living in Brooklyn.
