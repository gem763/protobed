Human waste and trash-strewn streets are being blamed for a decline in tourism and illness.\n\nCisco Systems, based in Santa Clara County where the numbers show the third-highest rate of chronic homelessness in the country, is now partnering with Destination: Home to help solve the crisis. Cisco just announced a five-year commitment of $50 million to build more housing, improve technology capacity and create more opportunities for homeless people.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody to be housed,\u201d said Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins.\n\nImage 1 of 6\n\nLoving believes the federal government doesn\u2019t take responsibility for homelessness. If there were more subsidized housing there would be fewer people on the streets. She also believes the same of the city and local policies.\n\n\u201cWhen we're building housing we need to be setting policies that are equitable to the people at the lowest end of the bracket,\u201d she said.\n\nLoving, through her company, has been able to help more than 100 homeless families and individuals move into permanent solutions.\n\n\u201cWe've put 19 projects on the ground in the last two years -- seven of those Cisco has helped us do,\u201d she explained.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nRobbins believes that Loving\u2019s strategy is efficient and more business leaders should come to the table.\n\n\u201cI think it's imperative for business to find those people who understand these problems deeply understand what's causing them understand what the real solution is and then just help them achieve their mission,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "'We don't do a good enough job is catching people before they fall into homelessness.'", "authors": ["Julia Limitone"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/LA-homeless-Getty-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
