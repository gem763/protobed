The whistleblower complaint and the resulting investigative sprawl are making the probe harder for Trump and his White House to stamp out, with Democrats gaining new avenues to uncover damaging details that contradict Trump.\n\nAnd a president who loves to be in control is increasingly finding himself out of it, left to lob angry tweets from the White House residence or the Oval Office as he and a handful of emissaries \u2014 such as personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014 function as their own uncoordinated rapid-response operation.\n\n\u201cEvery time Rudy Giuliani says something on TV, he lays out a new path for the Democrats to follow,\u201d said Chris Lu, former deputy chief counsel for the Democratic staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and a former top aide to President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Trump campaign and Republican National Committee call the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry a \u201ccoup\u201d that liberals wanted to launch ever since the last election elected.\n\nFor Trump and his administration, the widening investigation risks freezing up principals in key agencies, slowing down progress on any remaining policy initiatives and triggering caution among political players who might have been in a position to advocate for him throughout 2020.\n\nFor Democrats, the widening avenues of inquiry risk broadening their investigation so much that it leaves voters too confused and exhausted to follow along.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats need to make sure they have a clear message regarding the overall theme of the impeachment proceedings,\u201d said Paul Light, a New York University professor of public service who is an expert on congressional investigations.\n\n\u201cThe White House has figured out that chaos is the president\u2019s friend along with misinformation, confusion, and allegations about this and that. As long as they keep the public uncertain about what happened and why it matters, they are advantaged,\u201d Light said.\n\nThe speed at which the Democratic lawmakers are now moving \u2014 and public opinion is shifting \u2014 has left the White House on the defensive and struggling to catch up. It\u2019s unclear if the administration\u2019s playbook from the past nine months of stonewalling Democratic congressional investigations will work in this particular instance.\n\nThe White House is expected to send a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday, saying it will decline to hand over any documents until after the House holds a formal impeachment vote.\n\nSome Trump allies believe a war room could serve as a nerve center to coordinate messaging across its administration while protecting Trump from what might be released from an agency, or a seemingly obscure official.\n\nWhite House staffers remain divided on the necessity of such a centralized operation inside the West Wing to coordinate the political and press response to the impeachment inquiry. No one can decide who should run it, or how it should be structured, and the president continues to prefer to fight by leaning on his own public comments and Twitter feed.\n\nOne faction in the White House and at the Justice Department believes assembling a separate operation at this point is an overreaction, given the contents of the Ukrainian call summary transcript and the legal staff\u2019s existing expertise in oversight inquiries, said one close White House adviser.\n\nInstead, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee have picked up the slack, putting forth a new advertisement this week that calls the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry a \u201ccoup\u201d that liberals wanted to launch ever since Trump was elected.\n\nTrump has tried to discredit the whistleblower, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and the media.\n\nThe Republican National Committee recently formed a 12-person impeachment task force to tackle the issue. Altogether, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee plan to spend $10 million on various ad buys to bolster the president and bash the Democrats.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings are far different from the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, according to some Democrats, because the information and revelations are coming out so quickly, so publicly, and in revelatory pieces, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic narrator. Mueller released his findings in one shot in a roughly 400-page report and spoke publicly only twice about his findings and without much bravado.\n\nBy contrast, the impeachment inquiry is happening in real time with new leads and information emerging daily from across the administration \u2014 including a possible second whistleblower, another official over whom Trump has no control.\n\nLu, the former deputy chief counsel to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the investigations could quickly move into new areas such as uncovering any instructions the Trump administration gave American embassies, diplomatic cables that would have gone back-and-forth on U.S.-Ukraine relations, or any military sales out of the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cThey have also essentially opened up the transcripts of every possible call with a foreign leader,\u201d Lu added, remarking on the precedent the White House set by releasing the summary of the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. During that call, Trump asked the president to investigate the son of his political rival, Joe Biden, ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nWith everything moving so quickly, the White House is having a much harder time locking down information or stopping mid-level officials from testifying.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s team has veered from one talking point to the next by trying to cast the Democrats\u2019 inquiry as overtly partisan, or suggesting the White House is primarily focused on policy \u2014 even as the president\u2019s Twitter feed and public comments suggest a growing obsession with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump has tried to discredit the whistleblower, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and the media by trying to paint the proceedings as a long-standing conspiracy \u2014 dating back to the 2016 election \u2014 to upend his presidency.\n\nWhite House officials stress the president did nothing wrong, and that his call with the Ukrainian leader on July 25 was \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the whistleblower's complaint, it's totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect. And most people that have read it say the same thing,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe whistleblower never saw the \u2014 saw the conversation. He got his information, I guess, second- or third-hand. He wrote something that was total fiction. And now, when people see that, they're not happy.\u201d", "description": "A president who loves to be in control is finding it difficult to control an investigation that\u2019s extending far beyond his direct orbit.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook", "Michael Kruse", "Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178996651-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
