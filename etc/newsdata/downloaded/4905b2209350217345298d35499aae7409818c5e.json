This acerbic, California-based series from Netflix sees a group of hideously wealthy high schoolers navigating the complexities of teenage life while vying for the coveted role of student council president.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWritten by Glee's Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, the plot ricochets between high-octane drama and playful parody, but it\u2019s how all this translates visually that makes the show such compelling viewing.\n\nThe sets \u2013 sprawling Santa Barbara homes and scholarly classrooms \u2013 look like something out of a Wes Anderson film, while the privileged characters who fill them don idiosyncratic ensembles that totally satirise their personalities.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, who plays protagonist Payton\u2019s bohemian but deeply naive mother, swans around her umpteen-room mansion in couture and is almost always inappropriately dressed. She drips in lavish costume jewels while painting a portrait of a Syrian refugee and does the gardening in a scarlet Carolina Hererra gown.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Her canny and conniving nature is realised through a series of Chanel tunics and Miu Miu pussybow blouses. With smatterings of knee-high socks and girlish hair accessories, Astrid often looks as if she has raided the wardrobes of Gossip Girl\u2019s Blair Waldorf and Clueless\u2019s Cher Horowitz \u2013 which is no bad thing.\n\n\u201cRyan really wanted this to be a world of extravagance,\u201d says Claire Parkinson, who styled the show alongside fellow costume designer Lou Eyrich.\n\n\u201cEach character\u2019s financial background story helped us decipher what their style would be and where their priorities were.\u201d\n\nAstrid, for example, shows power through how she dresses, says Parkinson, because she wears almost exclusively designer labels and has the confidence to wear a wide range of trends, channelling Mod style with mini skirts and Mary Jane pumps one day and the and pairing a pink frock with combat boots the next.\n\nParkinson says that despite the similarities, Wes Anderson wasn\u2019t used as a reference for the film\u2019s aesthetic.\n\n\u201cMostly we talked about the heightened reality of the world we were creating,\u201d she says of her conversations about styling the show with Ryan Murphy.\n\nA key influence was American photographer Slim Aarons (1916-2006), who was renowned for his intimate images of those operating within society\u2019s elite. \u201cThe colour tone of the show was very inspired by his use of vibrant pinks, blues, yellows, and green,\u201d Parkinson explains.\n\nBut many of the show\u2019s characters have specific historical influences. Take Payton, whose patriotism and presidential ambitions are emphasised through three-piece suits that come in striking Americana colours.\n\n\u201cWe used a young JFK for inspiration,\u201d says Parkinson, \u201cas well as Robert Redford\u2019s character in the film, The Candidate.\u201d\n\nTo capture the Ivy League preppy style sported by Payton\u2019s narcissistic Ken doll-like twin brothers, Parkinson looked at Ralph Lauren campaigns from the 1980s. The intention was for their outfits to evoke wealth and power, but also to add to their overly groomed appearance, she explains. So the Hobart twins hurl abuse at their younger brother and plot patricide in tight-fitting polo shirts with collegiate sweatshirts hanging round their shoulders. The juxtaposition of their American dream look with their vile dispositions is intoxicating.\n\nThen, in what might be Netflix\u2019s most fashion-forward trio, there\u2019s McAfee, James and Alice, whose role it is to help get Payton elected to the role of student president. Their style is perhaps the most parodic for a group of teenage high schoolers. Inspired by Gloria Steinham and David Bowie, McAfee wears double-breasted Rachel Comey suits, sky high platforms by Martin Margiela and tinted Gucci aviators. She favours luxury brands like Commes des Gar\u00e7ons, Dries Van Noten and Celine, says Parkinson. James, meanwhile, mostly wears smart penny loafers and polos while Alice, who is also Payton\u2019s girlfriend, models herself on Jackie O.\n\n\u201cAlice\u2019s look is more classic but with a specific sherbet colour palette, so we ended up having to make many pieces for her like tweedy pastel skirts, matching colored pussy bows and headbands to make her outfits a full head to toe look.\n\n\u201cWe also sourced quite a lot of vintage pieces to really specify her look since her style isn\u2019t as trend driven, but still very iconic.\u201d\n\nIn order to recreate some of the key looks from The Politician at a more accessible price tag, celebrity stylist Alex Longmore says it\u2019s all about investing in brightly coloured suits, affordable costume jewellery, and retro footwear.\n\n\u201cAnything from J Crew is an absolute must, it's this look all over,\u201d she says to those who want to channel some of the preppy ensembles in the show.\n\nLongmore also suggests taking cues from British designer Molly Goddard \u2013 whose fuchsia tulle dress is seen in the first episode \u2013 by wearing outlandish evening wear during the day, like Paltrow's character often does.\n\nAs for the flamboyant costume jewellery that features heavily throughout the show, Longmore advises looking to Jessie Western where you can find turquoise rings that are almost identical to the ones she wears.\n\n\u201cPearls are a key accessory too,\u201d she continues, advising wearing these with pale blue jumpers and leather mini skirts for a very Alice-inspired look. For more Politician-approved pieces, pay a visit to high street shops like Zara and & Other Stories, which Longmore says \u201care in total synergy with the show\u201d.", "description": "Our fashion roundups are unbiased.
