The color of this sweatshirt is the same color as my nails which is fiery-orangey \u2026 red. I feel like this is the same color as love.\n\n\n\nName: Sailor (middle)\n\nWhere are you from?

I am from Long Island, New York.\n\nWhat color are you? I think the color I\u2019d describe myself as is kind of like this lava red.

The color of my sweatshirt is almost like vanilla. It almost has these different light colors in it. It reminds me of chocolate-chip-cookie ice cream.

I\u2019m originally from Illinois although I'm a real New Yorker now.\n\nWhat color are you? I've always felt like that sort of sunshiney-yellow aura around me. I love to be in the water and I love to be outside in nature.\n\nWhat color is your sweatshirt? Well, I kind of couldn't decide. I love this golden yellow because it feels like sunshine, and the feeling of sunshine on my skin is my favorite. And then the green makes me feel like nature and grass and trees, and how I feel so lucky when I can be outside. Photo: Courtesy of Noah\n\nExpand Photo Name: Minya Oh (top).

I\u2019m better known as Miss Info.\n\nOccupation: I'm a hip-hop journalist and rap mom.\n\nWhere are you from? I was born in Chicago, but lived in New York for so long I don\u2019t think they\u2019d have me anywhere else.\n\nWhat color are you? I am the color yellow. I think it took me a really long time to get to that point of acceptance, but I am yellow through and through. Every day no matter what color I\u2019m wearing, no matter where I am, I am defiantly, proudly yellow.\n\nWhat color is your sweatshirt? My sweatshirt is the most glorious color of mashed up blueberry stain on your teeth. That\u2019s what it is.

Lately a Dioxazine violet, but I grew up a blue.\n\nWhat color is your sweatshirt? This autumn-yellow color. I chose it because it fits our arriving season and it feels optimistic.
