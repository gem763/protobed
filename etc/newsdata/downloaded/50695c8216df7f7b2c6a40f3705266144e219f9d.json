Interestingly enough the lack of binoculars wasn't a major concern on the bridge.\n\n'They still believed they would see a berg in plenty of time to avoid it. There were no binoculars available in the crow's nest that night.'\n\nTitanic historian Tim Maltin, a world-leading expert on the ship, spoke in the new documentary\n\nA newsboy stands in 1912 outside the White Star Line headquarters in Central London\n\nThe show, 10 Mistakes That Sunk the Titanic, also tells how passengers opened their portholes to look out and see if they could see what was going on after the collision.\n\nTitanic came to a stop and people became curious - but the error happened when the portholes remained open when they were told to go on deck for an evacuation.\n\nTitanic historian Tim Maltin, a world-leading expert on the ship, said: 'After the collision, the Titanic came to a stop and people wondered what had happened.\n\n'So their natural reaction was to open the portholes and have a look. Then, when they went up to the lifeboats, they left the portholes open.\n\nSimon Mills, owner of the HMS Britannic wreck, features in 10 Mistakes That Sank the Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic, which was 882ft long, is pictured next to her sister ship RMS Olympic\n\n'As Titanic's passenger accommodation began to dip under the Atlantic, the open portholes meant that water flooded in at a much greater rate.\n\nHow Titanic was going much faster than she needed to arrive on time in New York The programme reveals how Titanic was going much faster than the average she needed of 18 knots to arrive on April 17 at Pier 59 in New York as planned - and a slower speed may have saved it from disaster. Simon Mills, owner of the HMS Britannic wreck, said: 'The simple fact is that she was going too fast - 22 knots in an ice field. Had she been going slower, she may have missed the berg, everything else would have been academic.' Titanic's captain Edward Smith was known for a reputation for speed, with historian Mr Maltin saying: 'Captain Smith was the White Star Line's best captain. 'He was known as the millionaire's captain - and that's because people loved travelling with him. He was sophisticated, he looked the part.' 'He really liked going fast as well. He liked to get his passengers there as fast as possible, and let's face it, these passengers wanted to get there on time. They knew, come hell or high water, Smith would get them there.'\n\n'In fact, 12 open portholes would have doubled the iceberg damage to Titanic \u2013 of course, there were hundreds of portholes in Titanic's bow.'\n\nThe programme, due to air at 9pm tomorrow, also looks at how the procedure for fixing rivets into the ship's bows could only be done by hand.\n\nThis is because the bow was too big to fit into the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast where it was being built - which is now home to the Titanic Belfast museum.\n\nThe hull was fixed together with three million mostly steel rivets, which became brittle under the water thanks to it being below freezing at the time of the crash.\n\nHigh quality rivets could only be inserted using a large hydraulic machine, but this was not possible in the bow where manual riveting crews were needed.\n\nThe plates therefore had to have rivets made of iron, which is not as versatile as steel and produces the by-product of slag - making them more prone to fracture on impact in low temperatures.\n\nAs the iceberg hit the Titanic, the impact hit the weakest sections, along the seams - so the ship effectively became 'unzipped' and water flooded in.\n\nThe 882ft Titanic, the biggest passenger ship in the world at the time, was a symbol of decadence and also the largest moving object made by man.\n\nBut her sinking off the coast of Newfoundland is generally seen today as being down to a combination of circumstances without there being one single major factor.\n\n10 Mistakes That Sunk the Titanic is on Channel 5 at 9pm tomorrow night", "description": "British passenger liner the RMS Titanic sank in the Atlantic Ocean in April 1912 on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, leaving more than 1,500 people dead.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/17/20188078-0-image-a-157_1572019567233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
