Several people had to go to the clinic, and pretty much everyone aboard Aquarius is feeling the weather. There are some good news though: we are heading towards Sardinia where we will follow the coast and it should provide some shelter and better weather conditions. And of course the Aquarius will then cross the passage between Sardinia and Corsica, and head to Spain.
