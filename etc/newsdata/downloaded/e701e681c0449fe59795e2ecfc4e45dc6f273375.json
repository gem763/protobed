She\u2019s my wife, so I can just about get away with it.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief turn at batting by the duchess, the couple knelt on the ground as a group of children tied friendship bracelets on each of their wrists.\n\nWhile Kate sported a pink bracelet William, who opted for blue, said: \u201cI won\u2019t take it off. My children will wonder why I\u2019m wearing it.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had returned to the village on the last day of their tour after they were forced to stay overnight in the Punjab capital.\n\nThe RAF Voyager plane carrying the couple had to abort two landings in the Pakistani capital Islamabad on Thursday and turn back to Lahore following a thunderstorm.\n\nAccording to royal sources, the duchess was particularly keen to return to the organisation, which provides support to more than 150 orphans in boarding houses.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThey met some young Pakistanis during the visit on Friday morning who have been supported by the village and now mentor some of its younger residents.\n\nAmong them was Saba Shahzadi, 28, who first came when she was eight following the death of her grandmother.\n\nMs Shahzadi, now a manager for Nestle in Pakistan, who still acts as a mentor to the children, told the couple she couldn\u2019t \u201cimagine what would happened if I hadn\u2019t found SOS\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cThat nurturing of this place really comes through. It\u2019s like an arm wrapped around you,\u201d the duke said.\n\n\u201cYou have a network of friends here who are your family to support you. That\u2019s even better than normal life.\u201d\n\nKate, who has focused her recent work on children\u2019s early years, told them: \u201cSome of the things I\u2019ve been looking at back home are how best do you support children and what do they need to have a successful life.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cOne, it\u2019s about quality relationships and two, the environment. What\u2019s great is that you have both here.\u201d\n\nWilliam also spoke of mental health during the visit, a topic he had raised with teachers at a government-run school in Islamabad on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people talk about it and it\u2019s not too taboo. In the west, we don\u2019t really focus on the emotional support,\u201d he said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re all doing is amazing and you\u2019ve got two ambassadors in us.\u201d\n\nReferring to it being their second visit, Kate said she was \u201cso glad we came back to get the full picture\u201d, while William replied: \u201cI could feel that there was more to talk about.\u201d\n\nThe royal couple also joined the children for an art group and knelt on the floor to join in with the painting, where the duke admitted: \u201cI\u2019m not very good at art.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhile William helped to paint an octopus, Kate began drawing a palm tree, and said: \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying this, I do lots of drawing at home with my children.\n\n\u201cI have three: George, Charlotte and Louis - he\u2019s a baby, he\u2019s one and a half.\u201d\n\nAfter the children mentioned England, the duchess said: \u201cYou will have to come and see us.\u201d\n\nThe royal couple returned to the UK on Friday after a five-day visit to the country.", "description": "Their impromptu game at the SOS Children\u2019s Village in Lahore saw the duke hit a softball which landed on his wife\u2019s neck", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EMB-Royal-Tour-of-Pakistan-Friday-visit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
