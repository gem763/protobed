So, your smart home lighting can be switched on from your mobile phone, even if you only remember the porch light needs to be on when you arrive at the airport.\n\nThere are times when it's easier to use the conventional methods: the time taken to connect the bedroom light to the smart system may be more than the time saved in, you know, actually pressing a switch.\n\nBut it's satisfying to say, \u201cHey, Siri, it's movie night\u201d and watch as the lights dim, the blinds slide closed and the TV switches on.\n\nVoice control mostly comes from three sources: Apple's HomeKit, which includes Siri, Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nOf the three, Alexa, found in Amazon's Echo devices and elsewhere, can control the most smart home gizmos, but all have their own benefits and there's more to the smart home than voice commands.\n\nThere's also a system called IFTTT, short for IF This Then That, which connects different smart home devices and is controlled by a smartphone app.\n\nIn every case, there is a dedicated smartphone app available. We've considered ease of set-up, effectiveness of the devices and sheer basic practicality of whether they're worth doing in the first place.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

When someone rings it, it rings normally but also alerts your smartphone that someone\u2019s at the door. You can answer from the app, because there\u2019s a speaker and microphone on the Hello. There are even pre-recorded messages to tell your caller to leave the parcel, for instance. Video quality is good and it streams what it can see continuously, so you can go to the Nest website to replay footage \u2013 whether they rang the bell or not. It can save recordings online, though there\u2019s a subscription for that, which costs from \u00a34 a month.\n\nBuy now\n\nAmazon Echo Show 5: \u00a379.99, Amazon\n\nWorks with: Amazon Alexa\n\nAmazon makes a big range of Echo devices, all with the company\u2019s own virtual personal assistant, Alexa, built in. You can catch her attention by saying her name and then ask questions about the weather, the news, choose a recipe, get her to play music or ask her to tell you a joke. The Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch display so you can see the weather forecast as well as hearing it, and the small size of the device makes it perfect as a bedside table gadget. It works as an alarm clock, too. There\u2019s a camera on board for video calls to other Echo users, for instance, but a physical shutter ensures privacy. Audio playback is not hi-fi quality but it\u2019s pretty good, enough to make this a fun music player.\n\nBuy now\n\nGoogle Nest learning thermostat: \u00a3219, Google\n\nWorks with: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant\n\nThe learning thermostat was the first product from Nest, though it\u2019s had a lot of refinements over the years. This model looks chic and is highly capable. It learns your preferences in terms of temperature and is smart enough to turn the heating off automatically after 48 hours when you go away, even if you forget. And you can turn it on again from your smartphone \u2013 perfect for when you\u2019re on your way home after a week away. It\u2019s superbly easy to use and works like a dream. By learning your habits, it claims to save energy and therefore money. A professional installer is suggested, though there\u2019s also a slightly more affordable model, the thermostat E, designed to be installed by you.\n\nBuy now\n\nEve Aqua smart water controller: \u00a385.95, Amazon\n\nWorks with: Apple HomeKit\n\nWatering the garden when you're away usually means asking a friend or neighbour to help \u2013 and a panicked call from overseas when you learn there's a sudden heatwave at home. Eve, a skilful smart gadget company with a wide variety of great problem-solving devices, has this clever tap attachment. With it in place, you can set the tap to turn on according to an easily configurable schedule, or boost with extra watering for a few minutes whenever you want, all from the iPhone or iPad app or from online. It looks good, is discreet and works brilliantly.\n\nBuy now\n\nArlo Ultra smart home security camera: From \u00a3449.99, Amazon\n\nWorks with: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant\n\nThis home security camera system comes with one camera, but you can add more or choose a multi-camera version from the start. It has an extremely high-resolution camera which even offers colour night vision, two-way audio with noise-cancelling for extra quality and a wide-angle view. Unlike some rivals, this one has a spotlight built in to surprise loiterers and there is a siren which you can activate, for instance, from your smartphone. It is smart enough to track movement within its field of vision.\n\nBuy now\n\nEve Room indoor air quality monitor: \u00a389.95, Amazon\n\nWorks with: Apple HomeKit\n\nAir quality is important, and the beautifully designed Eve Room is tiny and entirely portable. It tracks air quality in terms of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air which can be emitted from everything from cleaning products to toys. It also monitors the temperature in the room, which can be important in a child's bedroom, for instance, along with humidity which in extreme cases can cause health issues. Details are shown on the e-ink display or you can ask Siri to tell you the latest air quality.\n\nBuy now\n\nWithings Sleep automation pad: \u00a399.95, Withings\n\nWorks with: Apple and Android phones, using IFTTT\n\nGood sleep is important and understanding how you're sleeping can be a good start. The Withings Sleep is a pad which stretches across the area where one person sleeps. Every time you move, it notices this and can deduce whether you're in deep sleep, light sleep or awake. It has a microphone which can tell if you're snoring or not. This doesn't store any audio recordings but you can turn it off if you prefer. Especially if you fear your insistence that you never snore, thank you very much, might be exposed. It also tracks your heart rate. You can use it in conjunction with smart home gadgets to create shortcuts. For instance, when the pad senses you're getting up it can turn on the lights, or compatible heating.\n\nBuy now\n\nNuki smart lock 2.0: \u00a3199, Amazon\n\nWorks with: Apple and Android phones\n\nThis is a smart lock that attaches to the back of an external door. It's very quick to attach by mounting over the existing cylinder lock and key. As you walk towards the front door, the lock senses the smartphone in your pocket and unlocks automatically. It\u2019s true, you\u2019d have to be careful if you go back to the door to pick up a last bag to load in the car, for instance. You can also unlock it from the app \u2013 handy if you want to let the dog walker in, or someone trusted. The Nuki app also confirms whether the door is open or closed, too. The connection is via Bluetooth but you can extend this with a Nuki Bridge to control it via app or online.\n\nBuy now\n\nAmazon Echo wall clock: \u00a329.99, Amazon\n\nWorks with: Amazon Alexa\n\nAt first glance, it's just a battery-powered analogue wall clock. But, if you talk to an Amazon Echo device nearby, the clock responds. So, you can set a timer on the Echo and it will count down on the clock. You can even set multiple timers which count down together. As soon as you've connected it to the Echo (all Echo gadgets are compatible), it will set the time automatically. It also updates when daylight saving starts or ends.\n\nBuy now\n\nGoogle Nest Cam IQ indoor camera: \u00a3299, Google\n\nWorks with: Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa\n\nThe cute Nest Cam IQ is very powerful and effective, with two-way audio so you can surprise an intruder or tell the dog to get off the sofa. Like the Arlo, there's very high quality video which can zoom in on areas of movement when someone is spotted. It alerts you when it spots movement and facial recognition means it can see if it's a familiar face or not \u2013 there's a subscription charge for this. That's called Nest Aware and it also means all footage is automatically transmitted to a remote server, so a burglar nicking the camera won't save them. You can set it so that when you walk through the door, the camera switches off when it recognises your smartphone.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Smart home gadgets\n\nGoogle Nest has a series of products that offer real peace of mind when it comes to home security and Amazon's huge range of Echo devices, including the Echo Show 5, can genuinely make home life easier, quicker and more fun.
