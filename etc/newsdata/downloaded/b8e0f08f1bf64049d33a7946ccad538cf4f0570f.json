And he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.\"\n\nThe President was also quick to emphasis his involvement in the military action, while heaping curious praise on ISIS's media department.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"I've been looking for him for three years. I've been looking for him,\" he added.\n\n\"You know, they use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump .\"", "description": "The President of the USA watched the raid of Islamic militant Abu Bakr al-Baghdad compound via a live feed", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Reuters", "Instagram", "Al-Furqan Media Afp Via Getty Im", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735670.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_President-Donald-Trump-makes-a-statement-following-reports-that-US-forces-attacked-Islamic-State-l.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
