'We looked up every name in the Bible that had a Ye at the beginning and the only name was Yechiel.'\n\nAt the last second, her sister Kylie Jenner, 22, talked them out of using that name, and they settled on a Biblical-sounding appellation that was still unusual and appealing.\n\n'Psalm and Saint sound good together,' Kim summarized. 'The kids now call him 'PsalmYe.'\n\nCute smile: Kris Jenner held her grandchild Psalm who smiled for the momager\n\nFamily brunch: The Kardashian family gathered to meet Psalm and learned the story behind his name\n\nName change: Kim revealed that her sister Kylie Jenner, 22, talked them out of using the name Ye and they settled on a Biblical-sounding appellation that was still unusual and appealing\n\nAs the season 17 episode titled Psalm West began, he was about to be born, and Kim rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where her surrogate was being induced.\n\nAfter an hour of trying, she got hold of Kanye, and they spoke to her mom, Kris Jenner, 63, via phone.\n\nKris had just filmed a spot on the Ellen DeGeneres show for Mother's Day, and learned the news from daughter Kourtney Kardashian, 40, who showed up with the momager's six grandchildren.\n\nSurrogate delivery: Kim rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where her surrogate was being induced\n\nTalk show: Kris Jenner during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show was surprised by her grandchildren\n\nWhen Kourtney told her Kim's surrogate had gone into labor, Kris blurted out: 'What are we doing sitting here?'\n\nKris was sick, and so could not visit the hospital, but Kourtney headed over there immediately, Kim recounted afterward, remembering: 'We were just staring at him and holding him.'\n\nPsalm West was born at 7:02 p.m. on May 9, 2019, weighing a healthy 6.5 lbs, she added.\n\nNew addition: Psalm West was born at 7:02 p.m. on May 9, 2019, weighing a healthy 6.5 lbs, she added\n\n'Our surrogate is so amazing,' Kim declared, as photos of baby Psalm were shown, alone and with his three-year-old brother, Saint. 'She had the easiest delivery. She pushed literally maybe one time.'\n\n'I feel so complete,' the reality star continued. 'I really do feel like four is the perfect number for me. I feel so full in the best way. But I'm done.'\n\nSeemingly unable to rest, Kim then decided to throw a vow renewal for herself and Kanye, to celebrate their upcoming five-year wedding anniversary.\n\nCute baby: The episode featured several photos of the cute baby\n\nShe'd already done a bridal collection for KKW Beauty to mark the occasion, and glammed up in various outfits to do a photo shoot on the show.\n\nBut she wanted the renewal to be special, especially since she and Kanye had just had their fourth child in five years.\n\n'I thought: Let's just do something fun and sweet in our backyard and just make more of a memory,' Kim noted in a confessional. 'Five years, and infinity to go.'\n\nMajor milestone: Kim then decided to throw a vow renewal for herself and Kanye, to celebrate their upcoming five-year wedding anniversary\n\nBridal collection: The reality star also released a bridal collection for KKW Beauty to mark her wedding anniversary\n\nShe mentioned her idea to Kourtney's ex, Scott Disick, 36, in her kids' massive, colorful playroom, which boasted dozens of stuffed animals, trucks, and other toys.\n\nKim told Scott that with so many young children running around the house, she'd made a real point of arranging time alone with Kanye.\n\n'It's hard when everybody's all over you, and everyone's got slobber all over them,' Scott, a father of three, sympathized.\n\nBig playroom: Kim while playing with her children in a large playroom talked to Scott Disick\n\nNot easy: The father of three listened as Kim said she made sure to have alone time with Kanye\n\nKim proudly shared that Kanye had woken up one recent night when one-year-old Chicago was crying, put her back to sleep, then carried her to bed.\n\n'Kanye knows that I've had so much anxiety just with the new baby and everything happening in my life,' Kim told cameras. 'He's stepped up so much, and has been the most amazing dad.'\n\nShe found out that Kanye had been planning an anniversary dinner and decided to tell him about her surprise renewal, so they could merge events.\n\nProud wife: Kim proudly shared that Kanye had woken up one recent night when one-year-old Chicago was crying, put her back to sleep, then carried her to bed.\n\nOn the day in question, Kim flew Rich Wilkerson, the pastor that married them, into town, and penned personal vows that were a world away from her previous ones.\n\n'At that time, in front of all those people, I didn't even think I could get it together to say original vows,' Kim admitted, explaining why she previously recited traditional 'I do's.'\n\nThis time around, her ceremony involved her four kids, most of her wedding party, and a white-rose arrangement spelling out 'Kimye,' echoing the rose wall at her May 2014 wedding.\n\nGood reminder: North West reminded Kim that the vow renewal was for both her and Kanye\n\nFamily celebration: Kim was thrilled that her four children could participate\n\nTender moment: Saint kissed his baby brother Psalm on the forehead\n\nHer daughter, North West, six, served as a sassy flower girl.\n\n'Can I tell you something cool?' Kim asked Saint as she helped her son into his sneakers.\n\nShe showed him the engagement ring that Kanye had given her in October 2013.\n\nEngagement ring: Kim showed Saint her engagement ring\n\n'We were actually on a baseball field in San Francisco, and daddy got on his knee, and he was playing all this music, and he said, 'Will you marry me?' she recounted.\n\nShe showed Saint how to propose to someone, handing him the ring and having him practice on her by asking 'Will you marry me?' before she mock-shouted, 'Yes!'\n\nKim opted not to show the vows on camera, saying: 'We wanted to keep them really personal, and it's really private for us.'\n\nThe proposal: Kanye was shown in a flashback proposing to Kim on a baseball field in San Francisco\n\nShe however read part of them to Saint as she practiced, reciting: 'You are my husband, you are my best friend. My biggest believer, and my one true love.'\n\n'The ceremony was really sweet,' she said afterward. 'It was overall such a good night, with a good vibe. It was just perfect.'\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the vow renewal, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, 35, set off on a girls' trip to Turks and Caicos with her sister, Kourtney, hoping for some R&R.\n\nFlower girl: North served as flower girl during the ceremony\n\nGirls trip: Khloe Kardashian while working out with Kourtney was invited on her girls trip\n\nTrip anxiety: The stories about Kourtney's past girls' trips were causing Khloe anxiety\n\n'I do have a level of anxiety, because I've heard outrageous stories about the girls' trips,' Khlo\u00e9 admitted. 'Fighting, jealous, cries for attention, feuding, talking s***.'\n\nShe and her one-year-old daughter True joined Kourtney and a large group of her friends at Pearls of Long Bay, in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos.\n\nFrom the moment they arrived, however, Kourtney was on edge, because pal Larsa Pippen, 45, had invited men from Miami to fly in and meet them.\n\nGood friend: Larsa Pippen joined Kourtney and her friends on the girls trip to Turks and Caicos\n\n'Maybe in the past I felt like I needed a guy to validate me, but I just feel like right now, in my life, I feel really good and really secure,' Kourtney observed, adding: 'This is a girls' trip. I just want to hang out with my friends.'\n\nOver drinks that night, as Kourtney made travel posts for her website, Poosh, Khlo\u00e9 pointed out that her sister owned the copyright to any trip photos taken with her disposable cameras.\n\nShe also revealed her 'favorite thing about Kourt: Kourtney can queef the ABCs. She learned how to do it at sleepaway camp, everybody.'\n\nTrip photos: Khlo\u00e9 pointed out that her sister owned the copyright to any trip photos taken with her disposable cameras\n\nThe next day, they went on an ocean charter, saw dolphins and reenacted their famous 'Khlo\u00e9 & Kourtney take Miami' photo on the boat.\n\nBut an issue started to emerge between two members of the group: 'analytical' Sarah Howard, Kourtney's bestie, and her old pal, 'minute-by-minute' Larsa.\n\nLarsa, who kept telling Sarah how skinny she was, seemed upset that Sarah remained single, and called her 'picky' when Sarah said she sought a man who made her feel safe.\n\nPoosh friend: Sarah Howard was on the trip and clashed with Larsa\n\nDifferent worlds: Larsa and Sarah had trouble relating to each other while talking about relationships\n\nAmusing talk: Khloe listened in as Sarah and Larsa practically talked different languages\n\nSeeking safety: Sarah talked about seeking safety in a relationship and Larsa admitted that she didn't know what she wsa talking about\n\nThey argued again at a bar when Sarah wanted to help a crying woman in the bathroom, and Larsa couldn't understand why.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 thought they might secretly be vying for Kourtney's attention, and she urged Kourtney to tell Larsa that the arguments, and the invitation she made to the men, bothered her.\n\n'I just wanted you to have a good time,' Larsa told Kourtney later, on a kayaking trip. 'I didn't want to have to have you worry about a random person we didn't even know.'\n\nMajor differences: Khloe noted the ontological differences between analytical Sarah and live in the moment Larsa\n\nBar argument: Sarah heard a woman crying in the bathroom and got into an argument with Larsa who didn't care\n\n'I know where you were coming from, but I feel like you were kind of mean about it,' Kourtney offered, noting that Larsa had called Sarah 'super-sensitive' when she was not.\n\nShe urged Larsa not to 'bully' others and be so 'judgmental,' but her friend wouldn't hear it, calling the whole situation 'stupid.'\n\n'I'm so not in the mood for confrontation, but I don't want Larsa to think it's okay to talk to my friends that way,' Kourtney said in a confessional.\n\nKayak talk: Kourtney confronted Larsa about bullying Sarah while on a kayak together\n\nTook offense: Larsa took offense at being called a bully\n\nOn the beach, she spoke to Larsa further, emphasizing that she didn't need to meet any new men and insisting that she was 'content with just myself.'\n\n'I don't feel like I need anybody,' Kourtney reiterated. 'I'd rather hang out at the house and be silly and dance.'\n\n'Trust me, you'll go through like 10 more phases in the next three months,' noted Larsa, who filed for divorce from former Chicago Bulls star Scottie Pippen, 54, in November 2018.\n\nBeach talk: Kourtney and Larsa walked away and talked more on the beach\n\nDifferent space: The reality star emphasized that she didn't need to meet any new men and insisted that she was 'content with just myself.\n\nSticking up: Kourtney wanted to make sure that Larsa knew it was unacceptable to speak to her friends harshly\n\nAs the trip wrapped up, the girls rode out into the water together to jump off an old, wrecked boat, drink tequila and have 'good, harmless fun,' as Khlo\u00e9 described it.\n\n'Sarah, you're the s***,' Larsa said, making peace with her. 'I love you a lot.'\n\nBefore they left the islands, the women stopped at a club to 'see how the people of Turks and Caicos party.'\n\nMaking up: Larsa later made a point to make peace with Sarah\n\nSpin-off stars: Khloe and Kourtney recreated a photo from their Miami spin-off\n\n'Welcome, Kardashians!' the DJ crooned as they entered an empty room filled with balloons.\n\nThe women made the best of it and partied alone with each other all night.\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians will return next week on the E! network.", "description": "The 38-year-old reality star revealed how her baby son Psalm got his unusual name on Sunday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/06/19976958-0-image-a-74_1571634479892.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
