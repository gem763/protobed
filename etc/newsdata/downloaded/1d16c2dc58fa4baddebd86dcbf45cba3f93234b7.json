That is something you need to ask yourself and your fellow athletes,\u201d said James to Kelehe.\n\n\u201cWe put a prize of R4.47 million, which is a lot of money in my opinion. CMA always strives to keep Comrades top of the list in terms of prize money, there\u2019s not even a race (in the country) that\u2019s close to us in terms of offering that prize money.\n\n\u201cRegarding the R1 million, I hope that you train towards that and watch the space,\u201d he said.\n\nKelehe also found it unfair that they are expected to beat the best times achieved over 89.2km distance at the old finish line while running the new 90.2km distance that ends at the Moses Mabhida Stadium.\n\nJames said, \u201cBest times are meant to be broken. When David (Gatebe) ran the best 'down' time in 2016 (5:18:19) nobody really gave him a chance, but he proved everybody wrong.\u201d\n\nThe women's 'down' record remains the 5:54:43 set 30 years ago in 1989 by Frith van der Merwe.", "description": "The CMA might be pleased with the increase in the Comrades Marathon winners\u2019 prize money for 2020, but former champion Gift Kelehe says they've done nothing special.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8837/fecb37d169ce4d9e8c7b9c983a294ff6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
