But he faces a stiff challenge from retired military chief Benny Gantz, whose centrist Blue and White Party is running even with Netanyahu's Likud.\n\nBoth parties could struggle to form a majority coalition with smaller allies, though, forcing them into a potential unity government.\n\nNetanyahu has tried to portray himself as a statesman who is uniquely qualified to lead the country through challenging times. Gantz has tried to paint Netanyahu as divisive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and an honest alternative.\n\nTuesday's vote marks their second showdown of the year after drawing even in the previous election in April.\n\nNetanyahu appeared poised to remain in office at the time, with his traditional allies of nationalist and ultra-religious Jewish parties controlling a parliamentary majority.\n\nBut Avigdor Lieberman, his mercurial ally-turned-rival, refused to join the new coalition, citing excessive influence it granted the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties. Without a parliamentary majority, Netanyahu dissolved parliament and called a new election.\n\nOpinion polls have forecast similar results this time around, potentially putting Lieberman in the role of kingmaker.\n\nThe performance by the Soviet-born politician's Yisrael Beitenu Party is just one of the factors that could determine Netanyahu's future. Several small parties are fighting to squeak past the minimum 3.25 per cent threshold for entering parliament. The performances of these parties could make or break Netanyahu's ability to form a coalition. Heavier turnout by Arab voters, many of whom stayed home in April, could hurt Netanyahu.\n\nThe longtime Israeli leader is desperate to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies who are expected to approve legislation that would grant Netanyahu immunity from prosecution.\n\nIsrael's attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, pending a long delayed pre-trial hearing scheduled next month.\n\nA woman places electoral banners for the Likud party showing Netanyahu in the southern Israeli city of Beersheva ahead of the election.

He also has accused his opponents of conspiring with Arab-Israeli politicians to \"steal\" the election, a message that has drawn accusations of racism and incitement.\n\nAron Shaviv, who managed Netanyahu's 2015 re-election campaign, said Netanyahu believed \"there's no such thing as bad coverage.\" But he thought his former boss may be making a mistake by appealing so heavily to hard-liners and giving up on moderate voters.\n\n\"He's turned people off, playing the right-left polarization as far as he possibly can,\" he said.\n\nA centrepiece of his eleventh-hour agenda has been the pledge to extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and to annex all the Jewish settlements there, something Netanyahu has refrained from doing during his decade-plus in power because of the far-reaching diplomatic repercussions.\n\nHis proposal sparked a cascade of international condemnation, including from Europe and Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab country that has quiet, unofficial ties with Israel. The U.S., however, had a muted reaction, suggesting Netanyahu coordinated his plan with the Americans ahead of time.\n\nNetanyahu has also been flaunting his close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, and the prospect of a defence pact between their countries shortly after the election, as part of his frantic push to get out the vote and dictate the election's agenda on his terms.\n\nIn his attacks, Netanyahu has made unfounded claims of fraud in Arab-Israeli voting areas and unsuccessfully pushed for legislation to place cameras in polling stations on election day.\n\nGantz, seen here at a campaign event ahead of the election, has tried to portray himself to voters as a calming influence.

In some of his TV interviews, the typically reserved Netanyahu has raised his voice and gestured wildly as he warned of his imminent demise.\n\nYohanan Plesner, president of the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute think tank and a former lawmaker, said he didn't think it reflected genuine panic.\n\n\"I think you're observing Israel's most seasoned and competent politician who knows exactly how to fire up his base and is now using all his tools at his disposal in order to ensure victory,\" he said.\n\nPolling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time Tuesday with exit polls expected at the end of the voting day at 10 p.m. Official results are projected to come in overnight.\n\nThat's when the real jockeying may get under way, with attention shifting to President Reuven Rivlin who is responsible for choosing a candidate for prime minister. He is supposed to select the leader who he believes has the best chance of putting together a stable coalition. The honour usually goes to the head of the largest party, but not necessarily. Just as important is the number of lawmakers outside his own party who recommend him to the president.\n\nRivlin's selection will then have up to six weeks to form a coalition.", "description": "Israelis began voting Tuesday in an unprecedented repeat election that will decide whether longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power despite a looming indictment on corruption charges.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5286292.1568699939!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/israel-election.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
