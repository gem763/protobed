Fans who thought the release was too good to be true were correct \u2013 just about an hour later, West tweeted again.\n\n\"To my fans Thank you for being loyal & patient We are specifically fixing mixes on 'Everything We Need' 'Follow God' & 'Water' We not going to sleep until this album is out!\" the rapper and producer tweeted, naming three songs on the album he and his team were still working on, further delaying the highly anticipated release.\n\nTo my fans Thank you for being loyal & patient We are specifically fixing mixes on \u201cEverything We Need\u201d \u201cFollow God\u201d & \u201cWater\u201d\n\n\n\nWe not going to sleep until this album is out! \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) October 25, 2019\n\nBy Friday morning, it appeared West had still not slept \u2013 the album wasn't out yet, and he promised not to go to bed until it was finished. He was, however, full of energy \u2014 enough energy to show up at the Oculus in lower Manhattan, near One World Trade Center.\n\nThe unannounced appearance was not unanticipated. One commuter noticed a production crew in the train terminal the night before. \"Walking through Oculus to get the Path train home and 98% sure Kanye is doing something for his new album here?\" the Twitter user wrote, sharing photos of the scene. \"Whole production crew, subways blocked off, playing Kanye music, 'no one knows' what's going on?\"\n\nSure enough, a choir walked through the stark white terminal \u2013 it was West's \"Sunday Service\" choir. Then, the superstar himself showed up.\n\nCrowds cheered but security prevented anyone from getting too close to West. The domed building seems to be the prefect location for a West project \u2013 clean, sterile and barren \u2013 much like the house he shares with wife Kim Kardashian and their four kids.\n\nThe vaulted ceilings of the Oculus also make for seemingly perfect acoustics \u2013 which the choir took advantage of, belting out for the crowd, according to witness videos.\n\nThen, around noon on Friday, the moment fans had been waiting for finally happened \u2013 West dropped \"Jesus is King\" on streaming platforms.\n\nIt was last month that West, via his wife's social media pages, announced \"Jesus is King\" would debut. When it didn't drop on the expected date \u2013 September 27 \u2013 West continued to string fans along. Finally, it was announced the album would debut on the same day as West's IMAX documentary of the same name.\n\nWest famously produced his music in Wyoming, which is where he sat down with radio DJ Zane Lowe for an interview that dropped on Apple's Beats 1 radio station on Thursday.\n\nIn the interview, West opened up about his affinity for the barren landscape of Wyoming. He also revealed a pornography addiction, which he said he has recovered from.\n\nAnd of course, West talked about his new journey through faith and what shaped the upcoming gospel album.\n\n\"There were times where I was asking people to not have premarital sex while they were working,\" West said, acknowledging that may be off-putting to some. \"But seriously there's times where I went to people that were working on other projects and said 'could you just work and focus on this?'\"\n\n\"Families that pray together stay together,\" West says \u2013 then taking it a step further to say, \"When people pray together, and fast together, the power is increased.\" He also toyed with the idea of having coworkers fast with him.\n\nAs for his political journey, West barely delved into his controversial friendship with President Trump. He did, however, call himself \"the most liberal human being\" and said wearing the \"MAGA\" hat was just \"God's practical joke.\"\n\nWest's previous proclamation that he is a Trump supporter and that slavery was a \"choice,\" caused an uproar among fans, who felt a disconnect from the rapper. Despite this, it appears many fans held on to hope, that West \u2013 aka Yeezus \u2013 would return.\n\nIf West has taught fans anything through this process is that patience is a virtue \u2013 and \"Yeezus\" is king.", "description": "The album comes one day after an interview with Beats 1 revealed West asked people working on the album not to have premarital sex", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/347aa5d9-778a-4d03-9d87-fec5d6574aa5/thumbnail/1200x630/012693bcfe880a5463b8b1af3ad3c789/untitled-collage-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
