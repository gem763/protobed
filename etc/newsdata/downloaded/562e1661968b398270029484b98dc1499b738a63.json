A government spokesman lamented the death on Twitter but offered no further comment.\n\nThe country\u2019s online media association said Joseph was the third journalist to have been killed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d since Moise became president 2-1/2 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe surge in attacks on the media is very worrying,\u201d said international rights group Reporters Without Borders, calling on authorities to step up protection for journalists.\n\nOpposition-led protests over fuel shortages, galloping inflation and allegations of corruption by public officials have rocked Haiti for the past four weeks.\n\nAt least 17 people have been killed and 189 injured during the anti-government demonstrations, according to Haiti\u2019s National Network for the Defence of Human Rights, and schools and businesses have had to close.

Details were not immediately available.\n\nIn the capital, police firing teargas, rubber bullets and live shots in the air dispersed thousands of protesters who had gathered in one of Port-au-Prince\u2019s main squares. Some protesters fought back by throwing bottles and debris.\n\nThe protesters had unsuccessfully attempted to march on the home of President Jovenel Moise, who has been implicated in allegations of corruption and embezzlement of public funds.\n\nThe embattled leader has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSome of the protesters burned tires in the streets while others chanted \u201cOut with Jovenel\u201d in creole. Sound trucks blasted music with anti-government lyrics.\n\nA man helps a woman affected by tear gas during a protest to demand the resignation of Haitian president Jovenel Moise, in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti October 11, 2019.
