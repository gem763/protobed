General Assembly meeting in New York on Tuesday. (Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg)\n\nA judge has stayed an order for President Trump to testify in a legal dispute brought by protesters who say Trump\u2019s security guards assaulted them during his campaign.\n\nNew York Judge Doris M. Gonzalez previously called Trump\u2019s testimony \u201cindispensable\u201d and said the president would have to sit for a video before Thursday, when the now-delayed trial was set to begin. Men who protested at a September 2015 rally outside Trump Tower claim guards shoved them and ripped their signs and that Trump\u2019s head of security, Keith Schiller, punched one of them in the head while another staffer tried to choke a protester.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Dianne Renwick of the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division granted an \u201cinterim stay\u201d of Gonzalez\u2019s Sept. 20 order, \u201cpending a determination of the matter by the full bench.\u201d\n\nRenwick instructed that the case should be expedited.\n\nBenjamin Dictor, attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he is \u201cconfident\u201d the court will uphold Gonzalez\u2019s ruling that Trump is \u201csubject to the same rules and procedures that govern all defendants in our civil justice system.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case, filed in August 2015, shortly after Trump announced he would run for president, contend that Trump as well as his campaign and business bear responsibility for the security guards\u2019 behavior \u2014 because Trump employs the guards and because his language suggested he would condone such violent actions.\n\nSchiller has said the plaintiffs\u2019 banners were blocking a sidewalk and that he hit Efrain Galicia, the man who alleges he was punched, after Galicia grabbed him. Schiller said he thought Galicia was reaching for his gun.\n\nLawyers for Trump have argued the president has no relevant information to provide in the case, saying he was not at the protest. They accuse the plaintiffs of trying to \u201csubject the president to politically fueled cross-examination on issues that have no real bearing on the claims or defenses in this proceeding.\u201d\n\nRenwick has weighed in on other litigation against Trump: This year, she was part of the 3-to-2 majority of justices that allowed a defamation lawsuit against the president to move forward while rejecting the claim that Trump is immune from state lawsuits under the Constitution.\n\nThe ruling reinforced a lower court\u2019s finding that Trump could face a state court suit for actions outside his presidential duties.\n\n\u201cThe current sitting president attempts to shield himself from consequences for his alleged unofficial misconduct by relying upon the constitutional protection of the presidency,\u201d Renwick wrote for the majority.", "description": "Judge Doris M.
