I\u2019ve always been an early riser so I\u2019ll be up at 8.15am, I\u2019ll grab a hot lemon and water and maybe a cup of tea, then I\u2019ll get back into bed and watch Andrew Marr on TV.\n\nHome or away for breakfast? I\u2019d rather stay home and start the day with an apple, maybe a fried egg, bacon, spring onion, tomatoes. I like my plate to look colourful. I might present my wife with breakfast on a tray \u2013 and she might reciprocate, depending on the state of our relationship on any given Sunday.\n\nFriends or family on Sunday? My work life is very social, so Sundays tend be spent with family. I\u2019ll almost always call my dad in Australia and afternoons are often spent watching football on TV with my wife. I\u2019m also very into flowers, so I\u2019ll go to the florist and pick some nice ones.\n\nAre Sundays alcohol free? Not often. If I\u2019m not drinking on Sunday \u2013 which if I\u2019m doing theatre is my only full day off \u2013 the day can become boring so I might pour myself a glass of champagne around 12.30pm, before lunch. Why not?\n\nThe perfect lunch? If we\u2019re in, my wife will cook a roast; if we\u2019re out we often eat Chinese. I like dim sum.\n\nDoes exercise feature? It\u2019s very difficult to coax my youngest daughter out, but I try to take her to the park to bridge the gap between about 4pm when you\u2019ve had a few glasses of wine and you need to stop drinking, because otherwise it turns into a messy afternoon.\n\nThe sound and smell of Sunday? I\u2019m partial to a Jo Malone grapefruit candle. I\u2019ve always loved chart music. If I hear one of my songs being played it reminds me people still love what I do and it\u2019s given me a fantastic life. I\u2019m eternally grateful.\n\nTickets for Jason Donovan\u2019s 2020 tour are at nvite.com/community/jasondonovan", "description": "The actor and singer tells Nick McGrath about breakfast in bed, going out for dim sum and a glass of champagne before lunch", "authors": ["Nick Mcgrath"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf2cd3ca5f8c6859a76c759bd9fb65bbe754104/0_93_6892_4135/master/6892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b71e10976e0ea7a29f9303515efb52b1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
