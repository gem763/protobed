It\u2019s another thing entirely to try and collapse a limited government republic, from the bottom up, and implement, in its place, a judicial branch filled with people who twist the Bill of Rights into something it\u2019s not, the Constitution into something it was never intended to be, and the rule of law into a mocking tool for far-left gain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a change at work,\u201d said Robert Weisberg, co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, in The Mercury News.\n\nHe was referring to the big money that Soros, via his funding of progressive-minded California Justice & Publicly Safety PAC, is tossing into several local D.A. races. In Contra Costa, a Soros-tied PAC has kicked in $100,000-plus to support the leftist candidate; in Alameda County, more than $550,000 of Soros-tied money has gone to a hard-core civil rights attorney fighting for the comparatively conservative District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley\u2019s seat. Another $400,000 or so of Soros money\u2019s gone toward the Sacramento County district attorney race.\n\nSo what? What\u2019s the big deal about these local seats?\n\nIt\u2019s on the local level that much of the left\u2019s political wills are worked and won.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about the U.S. Supreme Court appointees, in other words.\n\nAs The Mercury News reported: \u201cOne recent police mailer paid for by the Soros-backed political action committee attacked O\u2019Malley for not investigating Oakland police involved in the Hernan Jaramillo case\u201d \u2014 which feeds right into the Black Lives Matter narrative of widespread racism among police and the entire law enforcement community, of course.\n\nWith Soros-type candidates at the district attorney helm, it won\u2019t be long before the crime of being conservative becomes a prosecutorial offense.\n\n\u201cSoros is definitely trying to push a political view,\u201d said one conservative, speaking to The Mercury News.\n\nIndeed, he is. And it\u2019s one that holds potential to change the shape of local politics, local law and order, local regulatory atmospheres \u2014 from how police conduct business to how homeowners obey and abide environmental rules and policies \u2014 for years to come.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
