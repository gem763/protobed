Gov. Fairfax files $400 million defamation suit against CBS in reporting on sexual assault claims", "language": "en", "text": "Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax filed a $400 million defamation lawsuit Thursday against CBS, saying the network recklessly disregarded the truth and hyped what the Democrat says are false sexual assault allegations against him.\n\nTwo women alleged in early February that Fairfax had sexually assaulted them in separate incidents in the early 2000s. One was a classmate at Duke University and the other a woman who met Fairfax at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax insisted that both encounters were consensual.\n\n[Lawyer for Virginia Lt. Gov. Fairfax says witness will corroborate that sexual encounter was consensual]\n\nBoth women gave interviews to Gayle King that aired on CBS This Morning in early April. The suit, filed in federal court in Alexandria, claims that CBS failed to \u201cfollow up on leads that would demonstrate the allegations to be false.\u201d\n\nOne of those concerns Fairfax\u2019s claim that a witness was present at Fairfax\u2019s sexual encounter with Meredith Watson at Duke University in 2000 and could corroborate that it was consensual.\n\nFairfax\u2019s lawyer went public with that claim only in July, and a spokesman for Watson\u2019s attorney declined to respond to it at that time.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that CBS could or should have known about the possibility of a witness before it aired Watson\u2019s interview.\n\nThe suit says that a top CBS attorney was a Duke classmate who had dated Watson a year before the alleged assault and remains a friend of both Fairfax and the witness. It claims that the lawyer, though not present, had been told about the sexual encounter by Fairfax and the witness, and believed it to have been consensual.\n\n[Va. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax departs law firm; was on leave amid sexual assault allegations]\n\nThe suit says that Fairfax and the lawyer \u201cexchanged numerous text messages and had several conversations since Watson went public with her false accusation against Fairfax in February 2019. Most of these communications occurred before the April 2019 interviews were aired by the [lawyer\u2019s] employer and client, CBS.\u201d\n\nIt continues, \u201cIn all their conversations, Fairfax and the [lawyer] knew from both Fairfax and the eyewitness that the eyewitness was in the room throughout the encounter and that the encounter between Fairfax and Watson was completely consensual.\u201d\n\nThe complaint did not identify the CBS lawyer.\n\nThe suit says the lawyer did not take steps to try to prevent airing Watson\u2019s interview or was unable to do so, \u201cdespite this knowledge from the eyewitness and from Fairfax that Watson\u2019s story was false and that there was an eyewitness corroborating that Watson\u2019s story was false.\u201d\n\nThe document includes a copy of text messages between a Fairfax spokeswoman and King, with the spokeswoman urging the broadcaster to ask Watson if she saw \u201canyone else on your way in or out\u201d of the dorm room. King did not ask the question, at least in the portions of the interview aired.\n\nCBS News released a statement: \u201cWe stand by our reporting and we will vigorously defend this lawsuit.\u201d\n\nIn response to the suit, Watson attorney Nancy Erika Smith said, \u201cWe look forward to everyone testifying under oath, now that this matter is in court.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also takes issue with how CBS handled allegations raised by the other accuser, Vanessa Tyson, who said Fairfax assaulted her after they met at the Democratic convention.\n\nTyson has said the alleged assault occurred after she accompanied Fairfax to his hotel room on the premise that he needed to pick up some papers. She said that they consensually kissed but that eventually he forced her perform oral sex.\n\nThe suit says that King failed to challenge Tyson on what Fairfax says are discrepancies between her written account of the alleged assault and how she described it to the journalist on TV.\n\nTyson\u2019s attorneys, Debra S. Katz and Lisa J. Banks, called Fairfax\u2019s suit \u201cyet another desperate stunt by Mr. Fairfax to preserve his political career at the expense of survivors of sexual assault.\u201d And they say Tyson\u2019s written account was consistent with her televised interview.\n\nA former federal prosecutor, Fairfax had been widely viewed as a rising Democratic star and likely contender for governor in 2021 before the allegations arose in February.\n\nIn the suit, Fairfax concedes that the scandal has taken a tremendous toll on him personally, professionally and politically. In July, Fairfax resigned as a partner at the law firm Morrison & Foerster, where he was placed on leave this year after the allegations were made public.\n\n\u201cCBS\u2019 actions have exposed millions of people to lies that have done extraordinary damage to his reputation and his ability to earn a living,\u201d the suit says. \u201cHis once-promising career \u2014 a lawyer at top firms, former federal prosecutor, Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, candidate for Governor of Virginia for 2021 \u2014 has been severely damaged.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local", "description": "The suit claims a top network lawyer knew of the claim that there was a witness to a sexual encounter.", "authors": ["Laura Vozzella", "Local Reporter Covering Virginia Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iuIsT4ayr0FV6RgVBcvl0YIqRtY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QJLVCPGVOMI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg"}
