Mark Amodei supports the House\u2019s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put it through the process and see what happens,\u201d Amodei, the only Republican in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, said on a call Friday with reporters, adding that he believes Congress is justified to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of oversight, so let\u2019s let the committees get to work and see where it goes,\u201d he added. (An audio recording of the call has been posted below.)\n\n\u201cUsing government agencies to, if it\u2019s proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it turns out that it\u2019s something along those lines, then there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAmodei issued a statement after the call underscoring his support for the process moving forward and dispelling any impression that he currently backs voting to impeach the president.\n\n\u201cIn no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,\u201d Amodei said of the call.\n\nHe added that his position mirrors that of Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who told KTVN Channel 2 on Thursday that the investigation should progress before making any conclusion.\n\n\u201cI think from all of that information, we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the call, Amodei said he read the summary and whistleblower complaint concerning a phone call in July in which Trump seemed to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate potential political rival former Vice President Joe Biden. The call came days before Trump had held back military funding for Ukraine, which has raised concerns over whether he was using the funding as leverage. Trump has said that he acted properly.\n\nAmodei declined to say whether he believes Trump committed an impeachable offense, though he noted that his comments in the call were regrettable.\n\n\u201cIf it was my statement and I had the ability to do it over, I would probably phrase it differently,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a smoking gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why we have the committee process,\u201d he added. \u201cI won\u2019t attribute what was in the president\u2019s mind. That wasn\u2019t a great way to express concern about it. Part of what the committees will do is try to find some context for that and then based on what a fair reading of the context is, they\u2019ll go forward from there.\u201d\n\nThe Nevada Republican dismissed the notion, raised by Trump, that the issue was raised by political enemies in the government looking for any reason to depose him. He noted that Trump has a reputation for coming out hard when he feels like he\u2019s being attacked, but said the issue is one of law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it was a partisan spy or not,\u201d Amodei said. \u201cThe only thing I get a vote on is, if it comes to the House floor\u2026 do I think that there is evidence there that is credible, that says he broke a specific law?\u201d\n\nAsked about how the situation may affect the 2020 presidential election, Amodei, who expects to be the Trump campaign\u2019s chairman in Nevada, said it depends on how impeachment affects voter sentiment in places where the margin of victory for Trump was close, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s challenge in the campaign will be\u2026to get some messaging through on what they\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d Amodei said, \u2026amid an environment of fervent, \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d political \u201ctrench warfare between the parties and much of the media and the president.\u201d\n\nUpdated Sept. 27, 2019, at 4:20 p.m. to include a quote from a statement Amodei released after the call.\n\nListen to the audio from the call recorded on Sept. 27 below.", "description": "Rep.
