In 1979, the year he graduated from Julliard, David landed his first onscreen role. One year later, he began touring with John Houseman\u2019s The Acting Company, which put on productions of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and Waiting for Godot. He hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nIn the past 40 years, David has logged more than 300 credits in everything from television series to movies and Broadway productions to video-game voice-overs. He was a series regular on Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, voiced the eponymous superhero in Todd McFarlane\u2019s Spawn, threw punches in the famously long fight scene in John Carpenter\u2019s They Live, and attempted to help Ben Stiller extricate his manhood from a sticky zipper situation in There\u2019s Something About Mary. This week, he returns to cable TV as Bishop James Greenleaf, the charismatic and often manipulative leader of a Memphis megachurch, for the fourth season of OWN\u2019s Greenleaf. Vulture caught up with the 63-year-old New York City native about his chronic prolificacy, getting cut out of Road House, and the uniquely tight bonds of his Greenleaf family.\n\nYou\u2019ve been acting for 40 years. When you think back to the very beginning of your career, was there one goal that you most hoped to achieve?\n\nOne thing, which I still hold today: I wanted to work. My goal was to be a working actor.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nWhen I first came to Los Angeles, there was a restaurant that was owned by an actor and it was called Residuals. If you received a residual check for $1 or less, you got a free drink. They had a bulletin board of residuals with sayings on them, and one of the sayings was: \u201cFame is what they give you. Success is what you give yourself.\u201d I read that and I immediately went home and put that in my journal.\n\nYou\u2019re in a business where you\u2019re often defined by other people. I imagine that\u2019s more difficult to deal with if you haven\u2019t had the chance to define yourself first.\n\nThe cemetery is filled with people who let other people define who they are, both in the entertainment business and beyond. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s especially true in the entertainment business, but the deeper truth is that if you do not develop a strong sense of who you are, then you become a leaf to every wind that blows. It\u2019s easy to get lost. It happens to the best of us, even when you do have a sense of yourself.\n\nIs working in so many mediums something you did consciously, as a way to challenge yourself and people\u2019s perceptions of what you could do?\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard of that thing called typecasting. And that comes from what I would call \u201cpersonality actors\u201d \u2014 actors who just play themselves under the circumstances of the character. In this town, that has been rewarded for a long time.\n\nIf that\u2019s what you want to do, fine. Who am I to dog that? I don\u2019t have to agree with it, I don\u2019t have to like it, but people do that. People get called on to do it, and people get paid very well to do it. It\u2019s not what I have ever been interested in, because even if I\u2019m playing the lead character, it\u2019s a character. I want to find within myself what is unique about the man that I\u2019m playing that I can exploit and explore more than just what I would do.\n\nYou jump a lot between film, television, and theater. Do you have a preferred medium?\n\nYes. Work. In whatever form it comes.\n\nThough you began your work in the theater, your breakthrough role on the screen came in The Thing. What was it that attracted you to that project?\n\nIt was a job.\n\nI was almost going to answer that for you.\n\nIt was a job. And it was my first movie job.\n\nBut it was a pretty amazing first movie job.\n\nIt was the coolest first movie that I could have ever thought I\u2019d get to be in. With the exception of Kurt Russell, who grew up in the movies and TV, I was surrounded by theater actors: Richard Masur, Richard Dysart, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Peter Maloney, whom I knew from New York. Tommy Waites and I spent some time at Julliard together. It was a phenomenal first experience.\n\nThe ending of the movie is famously ambiguous, though cinematographer Dean Cundey has said he and John Carpenter lit the final scene between you and Kurt Russell in a way to indicate who was infected and who was not. Can you end the decades of debate and share what they told you?\n\nAs I remember it, we shot it both ways. With it being me, and then with it being Kurt. And then, you know, who knew?\n\nThat\u2019s not the answer I wanted.\n\nAll I can tell you is, it wasn\u2019t me.\n\nYou worked with Carpenter again on They Live in one of the greatest fight scenes in film history. Did you know what you were signing up for?\n\nAre you kidding? That was one of the selling points for me!\n\nYou were fighting Roddy Piper, who was huge at the time. Did he teach you any pro wrestling tricks of the trade?\n\nHe certainly taught me how to sell a punch and sell a hit. He was wonderful. He was very hungry to learn as much about acting as he possibly could.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most unique skill you\u2019ve had to learn for a role?\n\nAbout four years ago, I did August Wilson\u2019s Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom at the Taper in Los Angeles with Phylicia Rashad directing, and I had to learn how to play the bass guitar. I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s a great idea, but she\u2019s ambitious and this is never going to happen.\u201d Little did I know, for the four songs that I had to play, I learned how to play.\n\nYou logged a few seasons on Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood in the mid-\u201980s, which seems like such a unique experience for an actor.\n\nMr. Rogers was a phenomenal guy. I was privileged. It was my first real TV spot, and I felt really honored to be on Mr. Rogers because I loved the work that he did, and I loved the fact that he is an ordained Presbyterian minister and his ministry was to children. He was one of a kind.\n\nBefore we talk about Greenleaf, but I have to ask you about Road House. You\u2019re one of the first credited actors on the film and originally had a much bigger role. What happened?\n\nRoad House was great. Road House got me into my new car and it moved me into a new apartment. It was a four-week job that turned into 11 weeks. I had a great role. I got to fight with Terry Funk and a couple of other guys. I had a really good time. The day after the wrap party, [the director] Rowdy Herrington called me. He said, \u201cKeith, I\u2019ve got three and a half hours of movie that I\u2019ve got to cut down to 2:15, so I\u2019m sorry, buddy, but you\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\n\nWhat was your reaction?\n\nWhat do you say? I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, shit, okay.\u201d\n\nAt least you got your car and your apartment.\n\nNot only that, but I got fifth billing on a single card. And I still get residuals. I also got to meet Sam Elliott, who I admired greatly. We got to do another movie [2001\u2019s Pretty When You Cry] years later.\n\nYou\u2019re kicking off the fourth season of Greenleaf. How do you keep challenging yourself when you\u2019re playing the same role for so long?\n\nWell, it\u2019s certainly easier when I get to work with actresses like Lynn Whitfield and Merle Dandridge. I\u2019m blessed because of all the actors on the show. It\u2019s an exception, not a rule, because we all got along wonderfully. It\u2019s almost clich\u00e9 to say that we became a family, but we really did.\n\nWhich is important with a TV series, as you\u2019re sometimes spending more time with your co-stars than your own actual family.\n\nNot just sometimes. For these four seasons, I did spend more time with them than I did with my own family. That\u2019s some sacrificial time, but it was time well spent. My wife and my children got to visit.\n\nWhen you start a series, you have no idea how far it\u2019s going to go or what road your character might take. Is it important to you to create backstories for your character beyond what\u2019s on the page?\n\nI do create backstories, but the writers\u2019 room is the writers\u2019 room and sometimes you have to change your backstory because they\u2019ve written something that totally goes against it. From the very beginning, we\u2019ve had wonderful communication with the writers on Greenleaf. But sometimes, I had to give up something I made up in order to support what was on the page.\n\nBeyond Greenleaf, if IMDb is to be believed, you\u2019ve got more than 15 other projects happening between this year and next. Do you just not like to sit still?\n\nYou sound like you\u2019ve been talking to my wife.\n\nHow do you view your career and body of work?\n\nI\u2019m a working actor. I think that I\u2019m certainly thought of as great support; I\u2019m a great team player and I love to be. But I\u2019m also a team player when I\u2019m playing the lead. I was taught that in the theater. In fact, Lloyd Bridges taught me that. Would I welcome more opportunities to lead in the film? Of course I would, but it would all depend on the story and the circumstances.\n\nI have nothing but gratitude for the opportunities that God has given me in my life. I have played some great parts. I\u2019ve played with some great people. I\u2019ve done some wonderful projects, and the best thing is that I\u2019ve gotten to meet, and in some cases gotten to know, some really wonderful people.
