Beginning Oct. 10, visitors will be able to reserve tickets online months in advance.\n\nMr. Litterst said he expects a big crowd at the reopening, noting that people lined up at 4 a.m. when the monument reopened in 2014 following repairs due to a 2011 earthquake.\n\nThe monument has been closed for most of the past eight years. An August 2011 earthquake left cracks in the stones near the top of the obelisk. It reopened in 2014, but Park Service officials were forced to close it again two years later after a string of elevator malfunctions \u201ctwo or three times a week,\u201d according to Mr. Litterst.\n\n\u201cWe could not guarantee with any effectiveness that when you get on here we are going to get you to the top without problem,\u201d he said, noting that visitors had to be evacuated from the elevator several times during that period.\n\nThe refurbished elevator now provides a smooth, 70-second ride to the top. What\u2019s more, it no longer will feature a ranger providing information during the trip, relying instead on an automated system. It also can stop mid-ride, if necessary.\n\nAlong with the upgraded elevator, a permanent security structure has been constructed in front of the monument.\n\nThe structure, which cost $12 million in National Park Service appropriations, has air conditioning and heating, is roomier and requires fewer police staff, said Brian Hall, a public affairs officer for the park service.\n\nSecurity procedures to get into the monument have not changed. Visitors must go through metal detectors and are prohibited from bringing items like food or drink, strollers, large bags, weapons or animals.\n\nConstruction on the monument began in 1848 and took nearly 40 years to complete. The private organization that was running the project ran out of funding, and construction was halted in 1854 at around 150 feet; that delay was exacerbated by the Civil War.\n\nConstruction resumed in 1879, but builders were forced to use stone from a different quarry \u2014 giving the obelisk its distinctive two-tone color.\n\nThe Washington Monument is one of the tallest free-standing masonry structures in the world. At the time of its construction in 1884, it was the tallest building in the world and is still the tallest building in Washington, receiving about 500,000 visitors a year.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
