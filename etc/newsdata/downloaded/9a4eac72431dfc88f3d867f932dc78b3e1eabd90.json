Walter Scott wrote in his epic poem \u201cMarmion.\u201d\n\nThis legendary admonition applies to the sticky troubles President Trump has gotten himself into as a result of his revised retelling of the disturbing conversation he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAccording to the U.S. intelligence whistleblower\u2019s report, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to do him \u201ca favor\u201d by digging up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden to use in the 2020 presidential election if Mr. Biden is his opponent.\n\nMr. Trump flatly denied that he ever suggested that in any way, shape or manner.\n\nIn remarks to reporters on Oct. 2, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWell, the whistleblower was very inaccurate. The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine. And the conversation was perfect; it couldn\u2019t have been nicer.\u201d\n\nThen, a week later on Oct. 9, Mr. Trump tweeted this: \u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u2018no pressure\u2019 conversation with the Ukrainian President.\u201d\n\nWell, not exactly. Here\u2019s what The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker Glenn Kessler found out:\n\n\u201cDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the whistleblower was \u2018very inaccurate\u2019 or \u2018so incorrect,\u2019 many of the details of the whistleblower complaint have already been confirmed by additional information, documents and reporting.\u201d\n\nIn his July 25 phone call to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into Joe Biden,\u201d Mr. Kessler confirmed this week.\n\nFurthermore, he writes, \u201cThe rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump telling Zelensky: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William P. Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Kessler notes that the ellipsis in the above \u201cappears in the White House document, suggesting something may have been removed before release.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we have documented, Trump\u2019s claim that Biden stopped the prosecution of his son Hunter is false,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhat\u2019s not gotten much attention is the White House\u2019s efforts \u201cto restrict access to records related to the call,\u201d Mr. Kessler adds.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower said that \u2018the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kessler reports.\n\nNotably, the White House \u201chas confirmed this is true,\u201d the whistleblower wrote, adding it \u201cunderscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d\n\nMeantime, CNN has reported that \u201cat least one National Security Council official alerted the White House\u2019s national security lawyers about the concerns,\u201d according to the whistleblower\u2019s account.\n\nThis resulted in the White House\u2019s national security lawyers ordering the transcript to be moved \u201cto prevent more people from seeing it,\u201d Mr. Kessler reported.\n\nAt the same time, he cautions that the \u201crough transcript released by the White House has a warning note that it is not verbatim.\u201d The fact there are a number of ellipses in the document, not common in official White House summaries, it\u2019s unclear whether there is a more complete version available.\u201d\n\nWell, it is very likely that there is in the whistleblower\u2019s possession, and of course in his testimony, if and when he appears before the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe case against the president, as Mr. Kessler has detailed in his fact-checking column, is that he has used \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign power in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of \u201csome minor details, virtually all of the specific points of the complaint have held up and been confirmed,\u201d he writes. \u201cTrump has no basis to claim the whistleblower complaint is \u201cvery inaccurate,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Kessler awards Pinocchios for not telling the truth. In this case, he says, the president earns four of them.\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
