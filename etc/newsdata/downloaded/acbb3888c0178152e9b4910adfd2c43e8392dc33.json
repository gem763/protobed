to hand full Mueller grand jury evidence to Congress", "language": "en", "text": "Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller listens as he testifies before the House Select Committee on Intelligence hearing: AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe US Justice Department (DOJ) must give secret grand jury evidence from the Mueller investigation to Congress as part of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, according to a federal judge.\n\nIn a victory for Democrats looking to gather evidence on alleged misconduct by the president, a US District judge has ordered the DOJ to turn over the materials by 30 October.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision, which would allow House investigators to see redacted portions of Robert Mueller\u2019s report into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe ruling by Beryl Howell, the chief judge for the Washington DC district court, comes as Democrats gather closed-door testimony from current and former government officials about the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Mr Trump\u2019s 2020 political rival Joe Biden.\n\nPreviously unseen details from the Mueller investigation could shed new light on key episodes from the 2016 election, such as Donald Trump Jr\u2019s Trump Tower meeting with Russians who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a 75-page ruling accompanying the order, Mr Howell dismissed many of the Trump administration's arguments for withholding materials from Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice claims that existing law bars disclosure to the Congress of grand jury information,\u201d Ms Howell wrote.\n\n\u201cDOJ is wrong.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe reality is that DOJ and the White House have been openly stonewalling the House's efforts to get information by subpoena and by agreement, and the White House has flatly stated that the administration will not cooperate with congressional requests for information.\u201d\n\nIn another blow for the Trump administration, Ms Howell also rejected the White House\u2019s argument that the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry is illegitimate without a formal vote on an investigation.\n\n\u201cA House resolution has never, in fact, been required,\u201d the judge said.\n\nThe material covered by the order consists of redacted grand jury testimony mentioned in Mueller's report, which, Ms Howell said, could help lawmakers decide which witnesses to call and what additional lines of investigation to pursue in their inquiry.\n\nThe court also rejected the DOJ\u2019s argument that impeachment does not qualify as a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d \u2013 a distinction that is important because grand jury testimony can be legally disclosed in connection with a judicial proceeding.\n\n\u201cTo the extent the House's role in the impeachment context is to investigate misconduct by the president and ascertain whether that conduct amounts to an impeachable offence warranting removal from office, the House performs a function somewhat akin to a grand jury,\" Ms Howell wrote.\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he was \u201cgratified\u201d by the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe court's thoughtful ruling recognises that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary,\u201d he said, adding that the grand jury information would be \u201ccritical\u201d to the committee\u2019s investigation.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the House speaker, described the ruling as \u201canother blow to President Trump\u2019s attempt to put himself above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis critical court ruling affirms Congress\u2019 authority to expose the truth for the American people,\u201d Ms Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cThe decision is also a resounding rebuke to attorney general [William] Barr\u2019s brazen effort to hold the president above the law and to prevent evidence of presidential wrongdoing from being uncovered.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson said it was reviewing the court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Mueller report found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nHowever, it pointedly determined that Mr Trump could not be exonerated on obstruction of justice allegations over his attempts to thwart the investigation.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP\n\nRead more\n\nTrump impeachment sees highest support ever in new
