(Matt Bell/AP)\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, there are no games featuring two top-25 teams on Saturday\u2019s schedule, which on the face of it isn\u2019t great. But as ESPN\u2019s Chris Fallica pointed out, Week 7 of the 2017 season \u2014 the last such bereft weekend \u2014 ended up being full of surprises, starting Friday night when a Syracuse team that would finish 4-8 stunned No. 2 Clemson at the Carrier Dome. Three other top-10 teams would lose that weekend, including No. 5 Washington (to an Arizona State team that would fire its coach at the end of the season), No. 8 Washington State (by 34 points to a California team that would end up 5-7) and No. 10 Auburn.\n\nIn all, seven ranked teams lost that weekend, three of them as favorites of at least 16 points.\n\nFallica continues by noting that at least two ranked teams have lost to unranked teams in each of the past five weekends without a top-25 matchup. The last time that didn\u2019t happen was in 2004.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, we can get some of that sweet upset action when we least expect it Saturday.\n\nTime Game TV Noon No. 6 Ohio State at Indiana Fox Noon Pittsburgh at No. 13 Penn State ABC Noon Kansas State at Mississippi State ESPN Noon Arkansas State at No. 3 Georgia ESPN2 Noon Miami (Ohio) at Cincinnati ESPNU Noon Chattanooga at Tennessee SEC Network Noon Furman at Virginia Tech ACC Network Noon Eastern Michigan at Illinois Big Ten Network Noon No. 21 Maryland at Temple CBS Sports Network Noon N.C.

That\u2019s tied for the longest active Football Bowl Subdivision winning streak over one opponent, and it\u2019s the longest streak in terms of teams that still share a conference. (Texas A&M has beaten TCU 24 straight times as well.) Over that span, the Hoosiers have kept the final score within single digits only four times, though recent meetings have been perhaps closer than the final score suggests. Since losing by just three in 2012, the Hoosiers have led late into the third quarter (2014, when they lost by 15), come up five yards short of forcing overtime (2015), gotten within seven points midway through the third quarter (2016, when they lost by 21), again led late in the third quarter (2017, when they lost by 28) and were within single digits entering the fourth quarter (2018, when they lost by 23). ...\n\nPitt and Penn State used to be a classic Eastern independent football rivalry until the Panthers joined the Big East, the Nittany Lions jumped to the Big Ten and petty politics doomed it to more of an occasional affair. Saturday\u2019s game, the 100th in the series, probably will be their last meeting until \u201csome point after 2030,\u201d Penn State Athletic Director Sandy Barbour said earlier this year.\n\nMidafternoon\n\nSouthern Cal Coach Clay Helton was on the shakiest of ground after last season\u2019s 5-7 debacle, and this week\u2019s firing of Lynn Swann as athletic director probably didn\u2019t give him reassurance: Swann was one of Helton\u2019s biggest supporters and gave him a contract extension last year. But his team might give him a whole lot more confidence in his job status. The Trojans are a somewhat surprising 2-0 even though starting quarterback J.T. Daniels is out for the year with a knee injury suffered in the first half of the team\u2019s season opener against Fresno State. Enter 18-year-old Kedon Slovis, who completed 28 of 33 passes for 377 yards and three touchdowns in last weekend\u2019s win over then-No. 23 Stanford. On Saturday, USC visits BYU, which is coming off a double-overtime win at Tennessee, something that doesn\u2019t have the same cache as it once did.\n\nThe late show\n\nIt was all lining up perfectly for Syracuse: Beat Maryland last Saturday and ESPN almost certainly would bring the football version of \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d to central New York for the first time ahead of Saturday\u2019s meeting with Clemson. And then the Terps scored in less than three minutes and didn\u2019t stop scoring in a 63-20 embarrassment. (In fact, I think Maryland just scored again on the Orange.) After the biggest loss by a ranked team to an unranked team in 20 years, \u201cGameDay\u201c jilted the Salt City in favor of Ames, Iowa, which has to be a horrifying civic embarrassment. Oh, and Syracuse still has to play Clemson, which might result in even more embarrassment if the Orange\u2019s defense doesn\u2019t improve against perhaps the nation\u2019s most talent-stocked offense. Still, recent history suggests the game could be closer than the 27.5-point spread. Under Coach Dino Babers, Syracuse scored an upset of No. 2 Clemson two years ago at the Carrier Dome and then had the No. 1 Tigers on the ropes in Death Valley last year before surrendering 14 fourth-quarter points in a four-point loss.\n\nRead more:\n\n2-0 Maryland was throttled by Temple last year, but the Terps say everything\u2019s changed\n\nJohn Feinstein: Mack Brown\u2019s return to coaching was laid out by his wife: Hawaii, the Bahamas or UNC\n\nVirginia football is surging while Florida State is reeling\n\nCalifornia lawmakers voted to let NCAA athletes get paid.
