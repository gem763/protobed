It read that she will \u201cperish when civil war comes\u201d, suggesting that people who voted for Brexit would be \u201cgunning for blood if we don\u2019t leave\u201d.\n\nJones apologised and confirmed his belief that the tweet was posted by a serving soldier.\n\nLt Gen Ivan Jones - Commander Field Army (@field_army) I would like to apologise personally to @AngelaRayner MP and anyone affected by appalling tweets from @GoshawkDaniel, a British soldier. He does not represent the remarkable men and women in @BritishArmy who serve this nation. Rest assured this is being dealt with. @BWallaceMP pic.twitter.com/R4UHz6kU1T\n\nWallace called the tweet unacceptable and confirmed that police had been called in.\n\nRt. Hon Ben Wallace MP (@BWallaceMP) This is an unacceptable tweet from a member of the @BritishArmy to @AngelaRayner. This foul language goes against the values of the Armed Forces and is now being investigated by the Army and civilian police https://t.co/LYe4d2PkoF\n\nOn Friday, an army spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are aware of a post made on Twitter in reply to an MP. This incident has been referred to the civilian authorities to investigate. The Army is a politically neutral organisation and holds its people to the highest standards.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has come under pressure to tone down his language when debating Brexit, having recently made routine use of rhetoric more commonly associated with war; referring to \u201cbetrayal\u201d and terming the Benn Act, which requires him to seek an extension in the absence of a deal, the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.\n\nHis senior aide, Dominic Cummings, has also said that only way the issue of threats and abuse will be solved is if MPs \u201crespect\u201d the result of the EU referendum.\n\nOn Friday, the former home secretary Amber Rudd said Johnson\u2019s language, which some have suggested is part of a calculated electoral strategy, \u201cdoes incite violence\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.\u201d", "description": "Labour MP received tweet as MPs urged Boris Johnson to tone down his language", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson", "Rachel Shabi", "Faiza Shaheen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224bbf53c9810faa8c76ca13dd6c2d6714b55c2f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90740fcd304528d4882df4960b476842", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
