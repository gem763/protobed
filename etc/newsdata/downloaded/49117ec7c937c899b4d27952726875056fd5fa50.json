REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission should use all the leeway permitted under EU fiscal rules to spur growth in the bloc, the economic commissioner-designate Paolo Gentiloni said.\n\nIn draft written answers to lawmakers circulated on Friday, Gentiloni said he would seek to make \u201cfull use of the flexibility allowed in the rules\u201d and pursue a more growth-friendly fiscal stance in the euro area.\n\nAhead of his confirmation hearing in the EU parliament on Oct. 3, Gentiloni also said he would try to introduce sanctions against tax havens, and would move ahead with an EU digital tax if no deal on the matter is reached at global level by the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cIf no effective agreement is reached internationally by the end of 2020, the EU should act alone\u201d on digital taxation, Gentiloni said.\n\nHe added that the fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance will remain a priority for the next commission.\n\nJurisdictions listed in the EU tax haven list should be subjected to common sanctions, he said. Listed countries at the moment face no coordinated financial penalty from the EU, but only reputational risks.\n\nGentiloni and the whole commission are due to take office in November after they receive the final green light from EU lawmakers.", "description": "The European Commission should use all the leeway permitted under EU fiscal rules to spur growth in the bloc, the economic commissioner-designate Paolo Gentiloni said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434501617&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0PU", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
