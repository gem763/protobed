Yet, in a perverse reversal of circumstance, the 20,000 fans who turned up at Hampden Park saw a game that should have been abandoned because of a pitch that became unplayable early in the second half, yet sustained a contest which established a clutch of distinctions by the time it had run its sodden course.\n\nSan Marino have been semi-permanent residents at the foot of Fifa\u2019s world rankings for many years and were thrashed 9-0 in Belgium on Thursday, but over seven previous meetings since 1991 the Scots had averaged only 3.5 goals per game. In this instance, John McGinn was almost at that mark with three by the interval \u2013 his first professional hat-trick - and he was joined in the reasons to be cheerful by Lawrence Shankland, with a goal on his first international start.\n\nStuart Findlay also found the net on his debut, to became the first Kilmarnock player to score for Scotland since Tommy McLean against Wales in May 1979.\n\nWith tickets priced at \u00a330, the Scottish Football Association might consider devoting some of the proceeds to striking medals for each of the devoted supporters who trudged through the torrential rain which began on cue an hour prior to kick-off and which fell unremittingly until beyond the break.
