I range from randy as all hell to craving certain foods, and it\u2019s impossible to predict.\n\nIt\u2019s the type of hellish mood swinging that makes you relieved to see that first lil\u2019 spot of blood just to exhale with thoughts of, \u201cAh yes, I\u2019m not psycho\u201d. But really, when it comes down to it, are hormones really responsible for all my drama, or is it just me being a shit and blaming it all on an unseeable force of emotional ridiculousness?\n\nWith the help of Libra and Ask Gemmah, we\u2019re figuring out once and for all what we can blame on hormones, what we can cop to ourselves, and most importantly, why the hell we\u2019re still dealing with blackheads in our twenties (what gives, world?).\n\nseriously though, what the hell\n\n1. Why does hormonal acne affect women in their 20s? I thought skin was meant to settle down after you finished being a teenager.\n\nThis is a real fucking mood, and to whoever asked this: I\u2019m so sorry. Hormonal acne can be one of the most frustrating things to deal with on a daily basis, and when you KNOW it\u2019s inflamed by your own body\u2019s cycle, then it can feel like a betrayal of your own molecules banding together to give you hell.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: while your hormones are at their most active when you\u2019re a teenager, you can still experience fluctuations all through adulthood. So although you\u2019re more LIKELY to experience hormonal acne as a teenager, you can still cop it well into your 20s and 30s \u2014 and your chances get higher around menopause too.\n\nthis is the only gif I could stomach, how the HELL do people watch pimple popper vids\n\n2. How can I tell the difference between fully-blown PMS and just having a bad day?\n\nA bad mood on its own doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re PMSing (though there\u2019s a bunch of misinformed dudes out there who LOOOVE to blame any hint of a bad mood on periods). Telling the difference really does depend on timing and whether or not you have any other symptoms going on at the same time.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling generally shitty, but you\u2019re not dealing with any other PMS symptoms (like bloating, sore breasts, acne, diarrhoea, liner-mandating discharge or fatigue) it may be a case of a bad day. If you are and it\u2019s in the lead-up to your period, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019re one of the 90% of period-having people who cop PMS.\n\nthe true dichotomy of humanity\n\n3. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve always had very vivid and full-on dreams the week before I get my period. Why is this? I don\u2019t dream any other time of the month.\n\nFirst of all: you\u2019re absolutely not alone on this one. I have some weird-ass dreams come ovulation time, and that\u2019s saying something because when I was a kid I dreamt that Angela Anaconda chased me around the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch while throwing assorted fruits at me. Sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree?\n\nThe reasoning behind this phenomenon isn\u2019t entirely hormonal, but it does have an effect. In the luteal phase of your period (the few days just before it actually starts) you have far less REM sleep due to a drop in progesterone, which means you\u2019re more likely to wake up. Sleep disturbances make it easier for you to remember your dreams and that, in turn, means your batshit crazy dreams stick in your mind.\n\noh, my dreams, it\u2019s never quite as it seems\n\n4. Can you still get symptoms of PMS while you have a hormonal IUD? I hardly get any period but still feel moody once a month. Can I still blame my period?\n\nBelieve it or not, the actual bloody goop expulsion that is your period isn\u2019t responsible for PMS. The symptoms are caused by your hormones and neurotransmitters not aligning in the luteal phase, which means that even if you\u2019ve got an IUD, you can still experience pre-menstrual syndrome symptoms (and blame your moodiness on it). This is because the PMS is caused by hormones, not by the actual release of blood.\n\nHormonal IUDs sound like they might affect PMS, but in actuality one of their many functions (incl. thinning the endometrium and inhibiting fertilisation) is to change up the mucous in your cervix so that sperm can\u2019t wiggle their way in. They also work to thin your lining, which is why some people don\u2019t get any period after about a year or so. , so you can definitely still cop PMS without having a bleed.\n\nthat\u2019s \u2018coz it isn\u2019t\n\n5. About a week before my period, I get sporadic (usually at night) and insanely full-on lower abdominal bloating. In the morning the bloating is usually resolved. Why is this happening?\n\nAh, bloating. The bane of the high-waisted pant. The precursor to the most satisfying of period poos. The ballooning expansion that makes us feel like inflatable cushions filled with rage and cramps. This, my swollen stomach pals, is something you can definitely blame on your hormones.\n\nBloating can occur before and after your period because of the changes in your oestrogen and progesterone levels. The very same hormones that make you horny, sleepy and crampy. Here\u2019s the sitch: as a result of the drop in progesterone that people most often experience in the lead-up to their period, the body may retain more water and salt than usual \u2014 causing the bloated bellies we yearn to pop.\n\nSo ultimately, hormones are responsible for a lot of things, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entirely devoid of responsibility yourself. The biggest takeaway? Just don\u2019t be a dick. Hormones can make you feel awful and tired and grumpy, but you can\u2019t blame away dodgy human interaction \u2014 accountability is still important.\n\nSo too is taking care of yourself. People often pass off PMS symptoms as \u2018period issues\u2019 and lump it all in together, but these can be serious things that affect your day-to-day, and shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If you\u2019re experiencing particularly serious mood swings or pain, for example, you should get that seen to ASAP.\n\nWhile I wait for my own hormones to calm down, we\u2019re now taking on questions for the next DM Doctor article \u2014 and yep, it\u2019s all about my favourite thing: food. We\u2019re talking all things eating on your period.
