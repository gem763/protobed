A local court ruling allowed him to run anyway.\n\nAs he did in the 2014 election, Morales has promised to retire after the five-year term is over.\n\nChi Hyun Chung, the candidate of the right-wing Christian Democratic party, was running in third place with close to 9% of the vote, indicating his support base will be a key target for Morales and Mesa in the second round.\n\nMorales, a former union leader for coca growers, has managed to hang onto power as most other leftist presidents in South America elected in the previous decade have since been succeeded by right-leaning leaders.\n\nREAD: Bolivia elections: What's at stake and can incumbent Morales lose?\n\nHe has overseen a long stretch of political and economic stability for Bolivia, the continent's poorest country. But support for him has slipped amid slowing economic growth and concerns about government corruption and anti-democratic practices.\n\nWhoever wins will likely have to govern without a majority in Congress and with a gloomier economic outlook, as the commodities-fueled boom that drove rapid economic growth in Bolivia in recent years has ended and the country's important natural gas reserves have dwindled.", "description": "Bolivian President Evo Morales said he was confident he would win Sunday's election outright, despite an official preliminary count of 84% of ballots that showed he would probably be forced to a run-off vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/71/74/1000x563_cmsv2_7d79cc53-a4bf-5271-8198-258626f9ac67-4247174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
