But there can be a middle ground for balancing these requests.\n\nIf you need that money, definitely say no. And if you think the loan will continue a pattern of bad behavior from that person, and it doesn't come with clear parameters, you should probably turn it down.\n\nBut if the person has shown enough growth that you believe they'll pay back the loan, consider saying yes.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA few years ago, Maggie Baker's adult son asked to borrow money to invest in a new business he was particularly hot on. It wasn't the first time. Her son, a trained actor, had been, as she put it, \"a Peter Pan for longer than most.\" She knew that he wouldn't have the follow-through to make money from the stakes she supplied and eventually pay her back. So Baker did what so many family members and friends find impossible when asked for money: She said no. It helped that as a psychologist and financial therapist in the Philadelphia area, Baker was practiced in how to say no. It's something she teaches her clients on a regular basis.\n\n\"He was very angry and resentful for a long time. I had to withstand that,\" she says.\n\nIt's a very common phenomenon. A study by AgeWave and Merrill Lynch found that two-thirds of Americans age 50+ provide a consistent stream of support for their grown kids. But it's not just an issue with parents and children. Jeanne Fleming and Leonard Schwarz, longtime financial ethics columnists for King Features Syndicate, conducted a survey of 800 people in the United States and found that more than one-third had a family member that was consistently asking for money. Friends add another level of complexity.\n\nSo, what's the answer? If you're one of those people who has a personal policy of saying \"no\" when friends or family members ask for a loan (or an outright gift), you're fortunate. You can honestly say that your beliefs prevent you from helping in this way. Ever. In almost every other situation, Baker and other experts note, the lines are wavier. There are times to say no. There are times to say yes. \"There are some professionals \u2014 I know some \u2014 whose response is always to say no, in every case,\" says Megan Ford, a financial therapist in Athens, Georgia, and author of the blog Finding Harmoney. \"In my mind, there is some sort of happy medium \u2014 a process of analysis that helps you figure out whether it's a good idea to say yes or to say no.\"\n\nWith that in mind: Here are four nos, and a yes to get you on the right track when friends or family ask to borrow money:", "description": "It's generally not the right call most of the time, but there are occasions when it's okay to help someone out.", "authors": ["Jean Chatzky"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5f6ffcc4a0a72072fd874?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
