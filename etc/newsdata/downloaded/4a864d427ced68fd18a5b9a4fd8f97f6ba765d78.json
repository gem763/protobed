Huge, I know.\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the official Hunger Games prequel is out on May 19, 202 via Scholastic, according to Good Morning America. The book will cover all of the madness in Panem that lead up to the first novel in the dystopian young adult book series.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: We just revealed the cover and title of the brand new @Scholastic \"Hunger Games\" book \u2013 \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\"! https://t.co/LUKfafEEKb pic.twitter.com/Gr3ZrRoFMu \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cWith this book, I wanted to explore the state of nature, who we are, and what we perceive is required for our survival,\u201d Collins previously said. \u201cThe reconstruction period 10 years after the war, commonly referred to as the Dark Days \u2014 as the country of Panem struggles back to its feet \u2014 provides fertile ground for characters to grapple with these questions and thereby define their views of humanity.\u201d\n\nBut we didn\u2019t just get a title, we also got a cover design to freak out over before the book hits shelves next May.\n\nThe story takes place 64 years prior to the events of the first novel (and subsequent film series) that saw children fighting to the death. The prequel will take us back to the 10th annual Hunger Games, and will follow the story before young Katniss Everdeen ever volunteered as tribute. The story will focus on the time directly after the failed \u201cDark Days\u201d rebellion.\n\nIf the success of the previous books are anything to go off, we might even see The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes portrayed on the big screen in a feature-length film. Considering the previous films grossed a whopping $3 billion at the box office, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Lionsgate wanted to capitalise on the hype one more time.\n\n\u201cAs the proud home of the Hunger Games movies, we can hardly wait for Suzanne\u2019s next book to be published,\u201d Lionsgate chairman Joe Drake said \u201cWe\u2019ve been communicating with her during the writing process and we look forward to continuing to work closely with her on the movie.\u201d\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know about you, but that sounds to me like we should expect another instalment in the film series too.\n\nFans on Twitter were quick to react to the news, reminding us all that everyone is still very obsessed with Suzanne Collins\u2019 hit series.\n\nme explaining how much my boyfriend\n\ni love the hunger games: who has never read them: pic.twitter.com/Uc92OLxfwn \u2014 cristina arreola (@C_Arreola) October 4, 2019\n\nWHY AM I CRYING ????????\n\nmy love for the hunger games has come flooding back, I can\u2019t wait for this pic.twitter.com/aP3CQClLPo \u2014 lydia \u2665\ufe0e (@claflinlaw) October 4, 2019\n\nIf you need me, I\u2019ll be re-reading all of the books in preparation to lose my fucking mind in May 2020.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/the-hungergmaes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
