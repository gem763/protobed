They've disclosed the exploit to the affected manufacturers, and confirmed that they didn't discover it in just testing, but also in the wild.\n\nThe exploit largely affects Samsung Galaxy and Pixel devices, though Xiaomi and Moto also make the list. An Android spokesperson confirmed that an attacker would either need to get you to install a malicious app to get the exploit working, or try and trick you with another exploit through a program like your web browser.\n\nGoogle's Threat Analysis Group discovered the exploit being used in the real world, which suggests suggests it may have been developed and sold for money. They initially suspected Israel-based spyware vendor NSO Group, which is notorious for making and selling spyware that allows governments to track journalists and dissidents. However, the group has since responded to The Verge, denying its involvement\n\nDon't Miss 277 SHARES\n\nNow, companies are normally given a few months to fix bugs in their code before security researchers make them public. That gives them a chance to make and distribute updates to counteract such attacks. However, since this one was already in use in the wild, the Google security team only game the Android development team a week to make a fix starting September 27.\n\nWhat's weird though is that this bug was disclosed and patched back in December 2017. In subsequent versions of Android however, it seems to have made a reappearance. If you have any of these devices, you might be at risk.\n\nPixel 1, Pixel 1 XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S9\n\nHuawei P20\n\nXiaomi Redmi 5A, Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, Xiaomi A1\n\nOppo A3\n\nMoto Z3\n\nLG phones running Android Oreo\n\nSo if you own any of these devices, do look for an and update their firmware immediately.", "description": "Android owners watch out, there\u2019s a new exploit recently discovered that can give hackers remote access to some devices.
