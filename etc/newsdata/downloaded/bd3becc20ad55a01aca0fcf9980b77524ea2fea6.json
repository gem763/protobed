And the news that Smith is leaving the network seemed to make the president\u2019s day. Speaking outside the White House en route to a rally in Louisiana, the president mocked the departing Fox News anchor,\u201d noted Mediaite.com.\n\nHere\u2019s how the conversation went on the South Lawn of the White House:\n\n\u201cMr. President, did you or your administration pressure Fox News to get rid of Shepard Smith?\u201d asked one reporter, according to the White House transcript of the exchange.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. Is he leaving?\u201d Mr. Trump replied.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d Mr. Trump commented.\n\n\u201cThen why did Bill Barr meet with Rupert Murdock the other night?\u201d the reporter asked.\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t know. Wait. Did I hear Shepard Smith is leaving?\u201d Mr. Trump repeated.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he leaving because of bad ratings?\u201d the president asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him,\u201d the reporter replied.\n\n\u201cTell me. I don\u2019t know. He has terrible ratings. Is he leaving because of his ratings? I mean, if he\u2019s leaving, I assume he is leaving because he had bad ratings,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t put any pressure on anybody?\u201d the reporter asked.\n\n\u201cHe had the worst ratings on Fox, so there\u2019s a reason. Why is Shepard Smith leaving? Well, I wish him well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General \u2014 the Attorney General meeting with Rupert?\u201d the reporter pressed again.\n\n\u201cI wish Shepard Smith well,\u201d Mr. Trump said, ending the exchange.\n\nAt the Louisiana campaign rally on Friday, Mr. Trump had positive things to say about Fox News.\n\n\u201cThank God we have them on our side,\u201d the president told his audience.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
