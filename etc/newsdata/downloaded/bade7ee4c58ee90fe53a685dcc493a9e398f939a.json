Even before the funerals were over, grieving families became targets, with people accusing them of being actors paid to play a role. Over time, many assumed they would eventually be left alone, but theories flourished in anonymous online forums and on social media, and Pozner received death threats.\n\nAD\n\nHe founded the nonprofit HONR Network to combat harassment, and he and other families sued people who have questioned the attack \u2014 including Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy-theory-driven Infowars website.\n\nAD\n\nPozner and his attorney went to great lengths at the defamation trial to prove that Noah Pozner was a real little boy who had lived and died: They gave the judge the death certificate, with raised seal, to counter the allegation in the book that it had been faked; turned over scores of pages of pediatric medical records; and submitted DNA samples from Noah and Lenny Pozner.\n\nIn September, Pozner reached a settlement with Palecek, according to court documents. Zimmerman said Palecek had agreed to a statement: \u201cThe Court has ruled that the death certificate of Noah Pozner is not a fabrication as stated in the book \u2018Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.\u2019 I accept the Court\u2019s ruling without appeal and I apologize for any resulting distress that I may have caused.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn an earlier settlement, the publisher of the book, David R. Gahary, agreed to stop selling it.\n\nAD\n\nZimmerman said he and Pozner did not suggest a damages amount to the jury for the reputational and emotional harm Pozner suffered. A forensic psychiatrist testified that Pozner had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after his son\u2019s death, and that the defamatory statements \u201cessentially caused a secondary injury that means his PTSD is chronic and likely will not go away,\u201d Zimmerman said. The jury\u2019s large monetary award \u201creflects the agony of being harassed in this way,\u201d he said.\n\nPozner said: \u201cThe damages awarded me for Mr. Fetzer\u2019s prolific defamation and harassment are significant, not so much for the dollar amount, which I will likely never see due to Mr. Fetzer\u2019s economic reality, but for the precedent that it sets. This sends a message to hoaxers and conspiracy theorists and others, who seek to use Internet to revictimize and terrorize vulnerable people, that their actions have consequences. When you defame people online, that has consequences.\u201d\n\nThe verdict is also important for other victims of online harassment and hoaxes, Pozner said in a written statement, including \u201cvictims of other mass casualty incidents, school and church shootings, and high profile murders. Every victory empowers victims of online hate and harassment to stand up and take action, this win gives them . . . tools to do so.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Lenny Pozner has battled conspiracy theorists\u2019 claims that the 2012 shooting death of his son at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f0jmlwr3alGEFBusLxHoQHmcAh0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LALLHOHQJEI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
