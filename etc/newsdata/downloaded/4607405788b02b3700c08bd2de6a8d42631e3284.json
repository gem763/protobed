Created by Twitter user eiouna, the thread is all about their mum and what she thinks of all the men featured in the most recent Fire Emblem game, Three Houses. The thread is a wonderful journey.\n\nEditor's Note: eiouna's Twitter is now on private, but you can see highlights from the thread below.\n\nAs with many of the best Twitter threads, it starts out with a simple but interesting setup. Eiouna is going to ask their mother to rate the men in the game based solely on their looks.\n\nThe mother\u2019s opinions on the various characters are hilarious and possibly accurate? I have no idea, I don\u2019t know these characters. But they just feel right, you know?\n\nBut the best part of the thread is when the mother starts to include more personal elements from eiouna\u2019s life.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. Your parent is supposed to be talking about something else but somehow finds a way to include some embarrassing moment or conversation from YOUR life into the story.\n\nBut like most mums, she cares greatly about her child. This reminds me of when I talk to my mum and she hears me cough and asks if I\u2019m sick. Every time.\n\nLet me and other non-FE players know in the comments below if this mother\u2019s ratings are accurate. I\u2019m very curious to know!", "description": "I don\u2019t know much about the Fire Emblem series, but that hasn\u2019t stopped me from enjoying a Twitter thread that has recently gone viral.
