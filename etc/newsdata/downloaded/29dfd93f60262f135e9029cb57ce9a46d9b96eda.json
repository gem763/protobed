It was a gift to Russia, a gift to Iran, a gift to ISIS and a gift to Assad,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot L. Engel said on the House floor. \u201cHow can America be trusted to keep its word when we make impulsive decisions that have an immediate and catastrophic impact on millions of people?\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike McCaul, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said he shared the administration\u2019s concerns about staying in a long-term war, but Mr. Trump was looking at the wrong solution.\n\n\u201cLeaving Northwest Syria does not resolve the problem that brought us there in the first place. It only creates more,\u201d Mr. McCaul of Texas said.\n\nThe resolution ultimately had a strong show of bipartisan support, passing on a 354-60 vote.\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s decision was not without its defenders.\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said he was concerned about the situation unfolding with Turkey, which has mounted an incursion into Kurdish areas, but the solution was to remove Turkey from NATO, not stay in the fight.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is equally logical we should not stay in Syria without a strategy, because in Syria we have tens of thousands of Americans stuck between armies of men of tens of thousands who have been fighting each other for hundreds of years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not the world\u2019s police force.\u201d\n\nIn addition to opposing the decision, the resolution also calls on the administration to come up with a \u201cclear and specific plan\u201d to ensure the defeat of the Islamic State terror group, which has seen a resurgence in light of the troop withdrawal.\n\nThe vote came not long before members of both parties are set to meet with Mr. Trump regarding the Syria issue.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
