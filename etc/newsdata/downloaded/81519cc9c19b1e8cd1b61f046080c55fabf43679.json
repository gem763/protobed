To determine this, Realtor.com compared the amount of money it would cost to make a 10% down payment on a median-priced home with the average student-loan balance per borrower in each state.\n\n(Realtor.com is operated by News Corp NWSA, +1.79% subsidiary Move Inc., and MarketWatch is a unit of Dow Jones, which is also a subsidiary of News Corp.)\n\nRead more: There are precious few places in America where the average worker can afford a median-priced home\n\nOhio had the most affordable down payment based on this analysis \u2014 the average down payment in the Buckeye State is roughly half the size of the average borrower\u2019s outstanding student-loan debt. At the other end of the spectrum: Hawaii\u2019s average down payment was nearly twice as large as the average student-loan balance.\n\nMillennials are particularly hamstrung with student debt, making up a third of all student-loan borrowers. The average loan balance among millennials is $33,000. That\u2019s nearly three times higher than the median down payment among this generation of $11,400, Realtor.com found.\n\n\u201cStudent debt has ballooned to an all-time high as the price of education continues to outpace wage growth, and this is holding back many potential buyers from being able to purchase a home,\u201d Realtor.com senior economist George Ratiu said in the report. \u201cThe important implication of rising debt is that young generations are delaying major life decisions.\u201d\n\nHere is how the comparison between student debt and down payments broke down for each state:\n\nState Average student debt per borrower Median home sale price Value of 10% down payment Down payment vs. debt Ohio $31,217 $164,900 $16,500 52.9% Alabama $33,218 $182,000 $17,818 53.6% Arkansas $29,607 $181,000 $16,700 56.4% Michigan $32,636 $170,000 $18,500 56.7% Oklahoma $28,889 $169,500 $16,500 57.1% Iowa $27,458 $174,000 $15,750 57.4% Missouri $32,064 $163,000 $18,738 58.4% West Virginia $28,922 $195,154 $17,180 59.4% Kentucky $29,423 $231,000 $17,650 60.0% Georgia $37,206 $205,000 $22,980 61.8% Indiana $29,311 $185,972 $18,347 62.6% Tennessee $32,973 $187,500 $21,000 63.7% Pennsylvania $32,491 $215,000 $21,000 64.6% South Carolina $33,933 $226,000 $22,200 65.4% Illinois $34,589 $222,000 $22,700 65.6% Nebraska $28,725 $190,000 $19,000 66.1% Louisiana $30,729 $205,000 $20,450 66.5% North Carolina $33,679 $222,450 $23,100 68.6% Mississippi $32,207 $235,000 $22,501 69.9% Wisconsin $28,614 $200,000 $20,000 69.9% New Mexico $30,349 $218,250 $21,908 72.2% Florida $34,544 $205,000 $25,000 72.4% South Dakota $28,431 $250,000 $20,650 72.6% Vermont $33,333 $243,750 $24,375 73.1% Kansas $29,174 $230,000 $22,115 75.8% Maine $30,102 $238,000 $24,250 80.6% Minnesota $30,253 $243,100 $24,500 81.0% Delaware $32,907 $245,025 $26,990 82.0% Connecticut $31,969 $319,900 $26,500 82.9% Texas $29,911 $272,000 $24,807 82.9% Arizona $32,193 $215,000 $26,800 83.2% North Dakota $25,940 $265,000 $21,860 84.3% Maryland $39,028 $268,998 $33,053 84.7% Virginia $35,565 $305,000 $31,800 89.4% New Hampshire $30,940 $317,250 $28,000 90.5% Idaho $29,919 $270,000 $27,313 91.3% Wyoming $27,484 $285,000 $25,866 94.1% Montana $29,837 $255,000 $28,755 96.4% Alaska $31,148 $280,125 $30,049 96.5% Rhode Island $29,459 $279,900 $28,500 96.7% New York $34,895 $303,125 $34,500 98.9% Nevada $30,812 $308,360 $31,000 100.6% Oregon $33,646 $334,375 $35,000 104.0% New Jersey $32,432 $352,200 $34,500 106.4% Utah $29,412 $336,250 $33,000 112.2% District of Columbia $52,581 $385,000 $60,000 114.1% Colorado $33,401 $625,783 $38,250 114.5% Washington $32,016 $387,700 $38,500 120.3% Massachusetts $31,584 $430,000 $42,200 133.6% California $33,832 $515,000 $51,000 150.7% Hawaii $33,395 $537,050 $57,500 172.2%\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Rent control may not be a lifeline for California\u2019s renters", "description": "Americans\u2019 student debt adds up to twice the value of all homes on the market.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT375_cincy1_ZG_20191015185956.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
