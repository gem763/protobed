The proposed settlement prohibits the company from selling or distributing or marketing an app that requires the user to circumvent security protections to install it.\n\nApps of this nature raise moral and legal questions. The most invasive can be downloaded onto a phone and will quietly forward emails, calls and texts. It\u2019s a criminal offense under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1965 to access a computer \u2014 including modern computers like tablets and smartphones \u2014 without authorization. In this latest case, the FTC enlisted the assistance of representatives from the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n\nIf ownership of the smartphone in question is under someone else\u2019s name \u2014 say, a spouse, a parent or an employer, as appeared to be the case in the FTC\u2019s case against Retina-X \u2014 it\u2019s a legal gray area. Of course, many tracking apps are designed to serve an innocent purpose: to keep tabs on an ailing parent, to keep children safe from a potential predator, or help find a lost or stolen phone.\n\nOther tracking apps that aim to help\n\nAnother app in the tracking category, Phone Tracker ($3.99) is marketed for legitimate purposes, including families with busy schedules and employers who want to track employees during work hours. It combines mapping and GPS technology to let you track your phone plus one other iPhone. \u201cNow you can know where others are located and see where they have been in the last 72 hours,\u201d it says.\n\nFind My Friends for Apple\u2019s iPhone and Android allows you to keep up to speed on when your spouse leaves work, your child leaves school or even when a visiting friend arrives at the airport.\n\n\u201cTo follow another person, they must use the \u2018Phone Tracker\u2019 to grant you permission,\u201d the company says. \u201cIf a person you are following doesn\u2019t have a recent pin drop, they have likely rebooted their phone and the app is no longer able to follow them. Simply have them open the app for a few seconds and it will begin following them again.\u201d\n\nPitched for GPS vehicle tracking for companies and a way for parents to keep a tag on their children to help ensure their safety, AccuTracking has been around for over a decade even before the advent of Google Maps. \u201cAccuTracking is powerful, configurable, and easy to use \u2014 at home, in office, or on the road,\u201d the company says.\n\nKnowing where your vehicles, employees and \u201cphysical assets\u201d are in real-time with information sent to your desktop is a valuable management and cost-control tool, AccuTracking adds. The app offers a 30-day history of GPS tracking data in the app\u2019s trail view, a digital display of the phone\u2019s whereabouts. The app has four premium plans to choose from: $12.99, $15.99, $20.99 and $25.99 per month.\n\nFTC alleges marketing problems with Retina-X\n\nIn the recent FTC case, the commission alleges that Retina-X and Johns developed and marketed three mobile device apps that allowed people to monitor third parties without the knowledge or permission of those user. One app, MobileSpy, was designed to monitor employees and children, and promoted two other apps, PhoneSheriff and TeenShield, to monitor mobile devices used by children, the FTC said.\n\nThe FTC alleges that Retina-X violated the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires operators to secure the information they collect from children under 13.\n\nThe FTC alleges that Retina-X and Johns violated the FTC\u2019s prohibition against unfair and deceptive practices and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires operators to secure the information they collect from children under 13. Retina-X did not secure the information it collected \u2014 despite collecting locations, text messages and other details, the FTC alleged.\n\nRetina-X and Johns did not admit or deny any allegations in the FTC\u2019s complaint, except for the language in the proposed settlement. The agreement between the FTC and Retina-X and Johns will be subject to public comment for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, the daily journal of the U.S. government, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed consent order final.\n\nUnder that proposed settlement, Retina-X and Johns must require purchasers to state that they will only use the service to monitor a child or an employee, or another adult who has provided written consent. The app must also maintain the identifiable icon on the person\u2019s device (rather than disguising the icon) and, in the case of children, it must only be able to be deleted by a parent or guardian.", "description": "\u2018We will seek to hold app developers accountable for designing and marketing a dangerous product.\u2019", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE799_cyber__ZG_20190228110952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
