Those with relatively high initial asking prices to similar properties are the best target for a discount, while those that sellers have already priced keenly have less room for money off.\n\nPatrick Alvarado, director of Knightsbridge estate agency Nicolas Van Patrick, said that many London sellers have already lowered asking price expectations to get prospective buyers through the door.\n\nHe said: 'Vendors realise that if you overprice your property you won't even get a sniff from a buyer who will completely disregard your property on the basis that you are not a serious seller.'\n\nThose selling homes must decide whether it is better to price low now and get under offer before Brexit, or hold out on the basis that a deal could boost the market.\n\nLaura Howard, of Zoopla, said: 'The ongoing uncertainty around what kind of Brexit is in store for the nation, could also be a catalyst for realistic pricing \u2013 in other words, a less certain future for the property market calls for prices that will be more certain to sell now.\n\n'Sellers are perhaps more motivated to set a price for their property that will result in a more likely sale this side of Brexit, rather than wait to see what effect it could have on the housing market in the next six months or so.'", "description": "Property website Zoopla has revealed where buyers in England and Wales are getting the biggest discounts on initial asking prices - and the locations where sellers achieve 100%.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/02/12/17967940-0-image-a-13_1567423300661.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
