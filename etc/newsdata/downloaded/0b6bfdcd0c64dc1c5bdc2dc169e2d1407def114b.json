From this beast was birthed the world's worst idea, giving anyone that ring.'\n\nThe woman in question posted a snap of her ring alongside the captions: \"I SAID YAASSS\" and \"Mrs Fianc\u00e9e.\"\n\nBut the ring's unusual snake design features a diamond-studded head and a thin tail which wraps around her her engagement finger - leading many to draw the unfortunate comparisons.\n\n'You beat me to the sperm comparison,' wrote one, while another agreed: 'It looks like a weird sperm.'\n\nMany compared the snake design of the ring to looking like ''sperm wrapped around her finger' (pictured)\n\nOpening up the opportunity to further criticise the engagement ring, one woman replied: 'You should've said NO.'\n\nAnd within minutes, the post was flooded with comments slamming the design of the rather unusual-looking sparkler.\n\n'I'd say run sister. What satanic serpent cult is this ring from?' penned one, while another wrote: 'You should have said \"you a**\" bring me something decent!'\n\nA further rather simply questioned: ''The hell is that?'", "description": "An anonymous bride-to-be, from the US, has been mocked online after sharing a picture of her snake design engagement ring.
