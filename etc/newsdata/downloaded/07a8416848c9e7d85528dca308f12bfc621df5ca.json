The truck owner gave the R15 000 he had on him to the officers.\n\n\"He promised the policemen that he would give them the rest of the money on Tuesday,\" said Sekgotodi.\n\nThe man reported the matter to the Swazi police, who in turn told the SAPS at the SA border post about the incident.\n\nA trap was set by the Hawks and the two constables, who were on leave at the time, were arrested on Tuesday when the businessman approached them.\n\nMaseko and Nkosi were released on R2 000 bail each on Wednesday and the case was postponed to March 20 for further investigation.", "description": "Two police officers from crime intelligence in Nelspruit have appeared in the Mpumalanga Regional Court after they allegedly tried to swindle R200 000 from a Swaziland businessman who owns a trucking company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1258/301b0be8b86e490c85dc4293e714e957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-23"}
