I guess you could \u2014 I think spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.\"\n\nWhen pressed by Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) whether he has any evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI or Mueller in the Russia investigation, Barr said: \"I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now. I do have questions about it.\" Barr said he plans on reviewing \"both the genesis and conduct\" of the Russia investigation.\n\nWhy it matters: Defenders of President Trump have long accused Obama-era intelligence officials of spying on the Trump campaign for political reasons, alleging that intelligence tools, like the FISA process, were abused. These claims have not been corroborated.\n\nA redacted FISA warrant for Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, was released by the Department of Justice last year.\n\nThe documents appeared to show that the FBI properly disclosed its sources of information and that it relied on more than just the controversial Steele dossier, contradicting claims of abuse by Republicans.\n\nGo deeper: How FISA works", "description": "\"But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/6iCgIDb698CollXZIWANsDGYpJU=/0x0:1429x804/1920x1080/2019/04/10/1554908276902.png", "published_at": "2019-04-10"}
