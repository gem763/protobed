As things stand my children do not have a future, and that goes for all children alive today. Around the world people are already losing their lives and homes because of climate breakdown - floods, droughts, food shortages, more frequent extreme weather events, and so on.\n\n\u201cLast September the secretary general of the UN said we have two years to take serious action in order to avert complete catastrophe and possible extinction. Decisions being made here in the Treasury right now \u2013 including huge subsidies for fossil fuels, financing massive fossil fuels projects overseas, airport expansion \u2013 have devastating consequences and are incompatible with a liveable future for my children and all children everywhere.\n\nThe group said the action was part of a build up towards mass demonstrations which begin in four days time in more than 60 cities around the world.\n\n\u201cIt is time to imagine a future where humans no longer cause irreparable harm to themselves and their surroundings, but recognise and support the interconnectedness of life in its broadest sense. A future where our society is a network of communities that joyfully work together to adapt to change, in whatever form it may come.\u201d\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "At least four Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested after using an old fire engine to hose 1,800 litres of fake blood over the front of the Treasury building in Westminster.
