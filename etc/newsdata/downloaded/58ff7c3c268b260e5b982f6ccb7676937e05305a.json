She also earned a $500 bonus for breaking the course record. Heather Kampf, who won the female elite race last year, finished in fourth at 4:43.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was really good to have all that competition today,\u201d Lipari said. \u201cI race against Shannon and Heather all the time, and they\u2019re really raising the bar\u201d in the United States.\n\nLipari, who was an all-American runner at Villanova, didn\u2019t realize the uphill climb she had to make as she moved around the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\u201cIt was challenging because it was deceivingly uphill on the way back and it was really windy on the way out,\u201d Lipari said. \u201cI wanted to hit the time bonus, but when I realized we were 2:19 through [800 meters], I was like, \u2018Whoa, we had to go uphill pretty hard right now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDaniel Herrera, 26, the men\u2019s elite race winner, said running on the roads of Washington made him feel like a kid racing with his friends.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI love road racing,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s really pure and it\u2019s more like kids playing. The track is more structured.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHerrera, a former runner at UCLA, finished his first Navy Mile in 4:05. He had his hands on his knees, gasping for air after he barely beat out second-place finisher Willy Fink and Josef Tessema, who won last year\u2019s elite race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my speed, so I was hoping [I\u2019d] get to use it at the end,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI think bringing that out made it a really exciting race, and that\u2019s what I was hoping for.\u201d\n\nDavid Westenberg, 61, almost beat his own American record for the 60-69 age group. Westenberg placed first with a time of 5:20, a few seconds short of the 5:13 he recorded at the national 1 Mile Road Championships in August.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI knew my record, and I hoped to beat it today,\u201d Westenberg said. \u201cMy goal was to run under 5:10, but I was a little short of my goal.\u201d\n\nWestenberg ran the 800 and the mile when he was in college at MIT. He stopped running for 35 years to take care of his family but picked it back up three years ago.\n\nWestenberg\u2019s daughter encouraged him to travel from Wellesley, Mass., to compete in his first Navy Mile.\n\n\u201cMy daughter lives in Washington, and she said, \u2018Dad, you should come run the Navy Mile with me,\u2019 \u201d Westenberg said. \u201cPlus, my father-in-law was a naval officer, and I thought it would be nice to run in his honor.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Lipari said she would use her prize money to buy a wedding dress.", "authors": ["Ryan Mcfadden"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SN9YV1yaQqP4abIZX2wzl8i6Ff4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M6IFG5HIPMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
