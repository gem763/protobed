I know I only have a limited time before things start to change.\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\n\u201cAs soon as the stores begin stocking Halloween items such as masks, costumes and decorations I can no longer go into town.\n\n\u201cI imagine the spooky stuff coming to life and following me around the aisles and I\u2019ve wound myself up about it before to the extent that I was physically sick.\u201d\n\nWhen her two daughters were young they had to hide their Halloween costumes from her before changing at a friend\u2019s house so husband Steven could take them out trick-or-treating.\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\nHer phobias were diagnosed in 2009 but were triggered when she caught a glimpse of the 1978 Jamie Lee Curtis film, Halloween.\n\nShe said: \u201cI must have been about four or five and the guy in the mask absolutely terrified me.\u201d\n\nCatherine has tried counselling but claims her fears are \u201ctoo deep, too locked in\u201d to be cured.\n\nShe added: \u201cI still have to be careful what I watch today.\n\n\"I was working in an office and walked in one day to find the whole place covered in Halloween decorations and all the staff wearing masks. I ended up hiding in the bathroom.\u201d", "description": "Catherine Blackmore, 43, from Cardiff, also has a crippling fear of people in masks and costumes and is too scared to go out in October", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706943.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RBP_MAI221019blackmore1685JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
