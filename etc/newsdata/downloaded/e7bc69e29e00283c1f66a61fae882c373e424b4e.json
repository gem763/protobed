In addition, all the EMAs are now moving in an upwards direction, which means we should expect BTC to hold above $8,500 where the 200-day EMA is sitting.\n\nLast week, I stated how I expected Bitcoin to bounce to around $10,000. After last week\u2019s massive pump, it\u2019s clear new investors and traders are taking over price action.\n\nBTC is now trading near the key $9,500 level, and I argue it will keep trading above this level over the next few days as the coin is above key volume profile levels. I personally believe BTC will hit $10,000 and above by the end of October.\n\nThe current Bitcoin trend\n\nHistory shows us that BTC is prone to huge drops between 30% and 40% during bull seasons. Therefore, I don\u2019t advise that you fight the trend, but surf it for as long as possible.\n\nLast week, I underlined that within the next three to five weeks, we could see a major reversal after a period of serious accumulation by \u2018hodlers\u2019.\n\nHowever, for the time being, not only has Bitcoin reversed its downwards trend, I argue BTC will reach $12,000 by the end of 2019 if we continue to see strong gains.\n\nVolume, which had dropped from a peak of $27 billion earlier in the year to more than $15 billion last week, is now moving back towards $30 billion.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market dominance has also slightly increased about 1% since early October, from 66.5% to 67.7%.\n\nAs veteran traders and investors usually say, smart money \u201cbuys when there\u2019s blood on the streets\u201d. Currently, I\u2019m waiting for another minor drop in price to make new entries. These drops won\u2019t last forever, and if you think traditional markets are currently on a massive bull run, I wouldn\u2019t be so sure the trend won\u2019t reverse.\n\nHow can the markets not push higher throughout the year after the ECB\u2019s recent rate cuts, the continuous share buybacks from huge corporations, or the inverted bond yield shoving investors away towards riskier assets?\n\nIn addition, repo market activity \u2013 as in loans from central banks to commercial and investment banks \u2013 has spiked to new monthly records. That adds up to another signal of weakness among most banks.\n\nSafe trades!\n\nCurrent live Bitcoin pricing information and interactive charts are available on our site 24 hours a day.

On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are.\n\nThe paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without \u201crelying on trust\u201d. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number \u201c0\u201d (or the \u201cgenesis block\u201d), which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins.\n\nMore Bitcoin news and information\n\nIf you want to find out more information about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general, then use the search box at the top of this page.
