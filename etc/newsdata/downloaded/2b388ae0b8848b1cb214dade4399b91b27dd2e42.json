Wade decision legalized abortion.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the new report showing the decline in both the abortion rate and the overall number of abortions from 2011 to 2017,\u201d said Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List. \u201cThere are several reasons for this positive news, including factors that Guttmacher does their best to ignore.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, released a video on social media addressing the report.\n\n\u201cWhile some have greeted the news that there was a decline in abortions last year as good news, the fact of the matter remains that close to 900,000 unborn human beings were killed last year before they even had a chance to do anything, before they even had a chance to have a name,\u201d said Mr. Rubio.\n\nGuttmacher researchers Elizabeth Nash and Joerg Dreweke noted that the decline comes amid a \u201cwave\u201d of abortion restrictions across the country, but their report cautions against assigning causality to those restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to pinpoint exactly which factors drove recent declines, and to what degree,\u201d Ms. Nash and Mr. Dreweke wrote. \u201cThe decline in abortions appears to be part of a broader decline in pregnancies, as evidenced by fewer births over the same period.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s report notes that one potential driver of the decline could be the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most private health insurance plans cover contraception \u2014 which can include so-called \u201cabortion pills.\u201d The report states that another contribution could be declining sexual activity.\n\n\u201cFindings from one national survey suggest a long-term increase in the number of people in the United States \u2014 mostly younger men \u2014 reporting not having sex in the past year,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nGuttmacher also reported that the number of births dropped by 98,000 between 2011 and 2017, with precipitous declines in red and blue states. The Guttmacher Institute is the only entity that strives to count all abortions in the U.S., making inquiries of individual providers.\n\nDr. Gillian Dean, senior director of medical standards at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, issued in a statement: \u201cThis report confirms what we\u2019ve long known to be true, that increasing people\u2019s access to affordable and effective methods of birth control leads to fewer abortions. The report also shows that restrictive state laws are not responsible for a reduction in abortion. This shouldn\u2019t be up for debate.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Donovan of the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute said that Guttmacher overlooked trends, such as the closing of abortion facilities, limits on public funding and informed consent laws as drivers of the decline.\n\nThe Guttmacher report in part concedes Mr. Donovan\u2019s point, noting that states with laws targeting abortion providers with burdensome regulations, such as Texas, Virginia, Ohio and Arizona, which experienced higher rates of clinic closures, did see declines above the national average of 20%.\n\nHowever, Kentucky \u2014 which lost one of its two abortion clinics \u2014 experienced a decline (18%) below the national average, it notes. Moreover, abortion rates also declined in 13 of the 15 states that added clinics.\n\n\u201cNotably, 57% of the 2011\u20132017 decline in the number of abortions nationwide happened in the 18 states and the District Columbia that did not adopt any new abortion restrictions,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nThis year pro-life states have increased restrictions on abortion while pro-choice states have moved to enshrine it in state law in anticipation that a legal case would prompt the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade.\n\nAccording to the latest Pew Research Poll, taken in late August, 61% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, with 38% of Americans saying it should be legal in all or most cases.\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
