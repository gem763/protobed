REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nThe Chinese tech giant bills the Kirin 990 chipset as the first all-in-one 5G system on a chip, describing it as superior to alternatives from Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) that, it says, graft 5G modems on to 4G chips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s most powerful 5G system on a chip. It\u2019s the world\u2019s most powerful 5G modem,\u201d Richard Yu, the head of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, said in a speech in Berlin.\n\nHuawei\u2019s launch at the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin of the Kirin 990, made using the latest 7 nanometer production process, is part of a carefully sequenced buildup to the Sept. 19 international launch of the Mate 30 in Munich.\n\nYet, say Huawei sources, it is still not known whether the Mate 30 will be able to run services from Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) following the blacklisting of the Chinese company by the U.S. administration in May.\n\nThat ban sliced 5 percentage points off Huawei\u2019s market share in Europe.\n\nThe world\u2019s No.2 smartphone maker is looking to reclaim ground as the spread of ultra-fast 5G networks prompts an upgrade cycle among consumers who have been holding on to phones for longer. Consumers will need new handsets to take advantage of the ultrafast download speeds promised by 5G.\n\nNO GOOGLE, NO JOY\n\nThe services in doubt include pre-installing the Google Play store and a suite of popular apps such as Google Maps that buyers would expect to be available from the moment they turn on their new phone and synch it with their profile.\n\nHuawei\u2019s fallback option would be to run the devices on its home-grown Harmony operating system, although company officials and analysts say it is not yet ready for prime time.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is Google,\u201d said Peter Richardson of Counterpoint Research, after attending a technical briefing on the Kirin 990 by Huawei managers that skirted the issue and focused only on the chipset\u2019s specifications.\n\nThe Kirin 990 packs more than 10 billion transistors and can support downlink speeds of up to 2.3 gigabits per second.\n\nIt has an adaptive receiver that enables it to switch between 4G and 5G where coverage of the faster technology is weak.\n\nAnd, to save energy, it has a \u2018big core\u2019 to handle powerful computing tasks with the support of artificial intelligence, and a \u2018tiny core\u2019 for less demanding operation.\n\nHuawei plans only to use the Kirin 990 in its own devices, meaning it lacks the marketing opportunities enjoyed by Qualcomm, whose chips already power the Samsung 5G phones, such as the Galaxy 10, already on the market.\n\nApple\u2019s recent settlement of a patent dispute with Qualcomm, and Intel\u2019s (INTC.O) exit from the smartphone modem business also reflect the U.S. chipmaker\u2019s muscle in a global market that is increasingly fragmenting due to the U.S.-China trade tension.\n\n\u201cQualcomm has a scale advantage,\u201d said Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight. \u201cHuawei\u2019s commitment to continue innovating on silicon is really impressive, especially given the geopolitical headwinds they are facing.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s a single-vendor solution. And, even if they had aspirations to sell the chipset, that is getting more difficult all the time.\u201d", "description": "Huawei Technologies showcased its chipset for a new high-end smartphone on Friday, pressing ahead with plans to launch its Mate 30 range, despite uncertainty about whether the new phones will be able to run Google's Android operating system and apps.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426859014&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850TY-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
