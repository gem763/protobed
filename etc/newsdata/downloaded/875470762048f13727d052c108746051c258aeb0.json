Drezen\u2019s performance has a little bit of everything: references to photos of dead women who look like her, a bit of self-deprecating humor (\u201cI look like if Brendan Fraser were a teen mom\u201d), talk of gaslighting men on dating apps, and a thorough explanation on why she decided to get sober after years of ruining birthday parties. \u201cI can\u2019t drink wine because my DNA is garbage! My ancestors were criminals. One half of my family were murderers; the other half were horse thieves,\u201d she says, miming her words to an imaginary friend at a party. \u201cAnd they swam to America, and they made it with their first cousins, until one day I was born. And now, when I drink wine, I fuck DJs.\u201d Such a powerful story.\n\nRelated", "description": "On CBS\u2019s \u2018The Late Late Show With James Corden,\u2019 \u2018SNL\u2019 supervising writer Anna Drezen performed a stand-up set about photos of murdered women, dating apps, and getting sober.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-anna-drezen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
