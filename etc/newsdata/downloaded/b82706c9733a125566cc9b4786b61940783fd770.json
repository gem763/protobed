REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah/File Photo\n\nAramco has started informing banks about the bookrunners\u2019 roles, one of the sources said.\n\nAramco finalised nine banks for top roles as global coordinators in recent weeks, Reuters has reported. More banks are expected to be named in junior roles, the sources said.\n\nAramco has also added Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA) as bookrunners, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nDoubts had emerged about the timeline of the potentially $20 billion domestic leg of the IPO among investors after last Saturday\u2019s attacks on two sites that usually process and clean up about 5.7 million barrels per day.\n\nAramco has that by the end of September it will resume full crude output at Abqaiq and Khurais, the two oil facilities damaged by attacks last weekend that U.S. officials have blamed on Iran.\n\nAramco\u2019s planned meeting with analysts, ahead of the expected IPO in late November, is also scheduled for early next week, two other sources said. Aramco was not immediately available to comment.\n\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment and UBS did not respond to a Reuters request for comment over the weekend. Aramco\u2019s Riyadh listing is the first step toward an eventual sale of up to 5%, sources have told Reuters, with another 1% expected to be sold domestically next year, followed by an international listing.\n\nInitial hopes for a blockbuster international listing were dashed when the share sale was halted last year amid a debate over an overseas venue and valuation.\n\nAramco had said the delay was due to its deal to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (2010.SE).Although Crown Prince Mohammed put a $2 trillion valuation on the company in early 2016, bankers and company insiders say Aramco\u2019s value is closer to $1.5 trillion.", "description": "Saudi state oil company Aramco has hired UBS Group and Deutsche as bookrunners for its initial public offering, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that the deal is moving ahead despite a recent attack on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Clara Denina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432306964&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K09U", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
