After keeping the crew safe, including America's first woman moon walker, it's all about mobility.\n\nTo that end, the suited models demonstrated bending, squatting and walking around in the bulky garments.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Wolf/AP Kevin Wolf/AP\n\n\"This is the first suit we've designed in about 40 years,\" Chris Hansen, a manager at NASA's spacesuit design office, said. \"We want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the moon.\"\n\nAmy Ross, NASA's lead spacesuit engineer, said: \"Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment and give them the mobility to do their job.\"\n\nAnother spacesuit engineer, Kristine Davis, sported the new red, white and blue xEMU, which includes a ring at the midsection to make it easier for future moon walkers to get around than their Apollo-era counterparts, the last of whom left boot prints on the moon in 1972.\n\n\"The mobility is one of the biggest things,\" astronaut Kate Rubins said at the event. For picking up a rock or setting up a scientific instrument, \"you need that upper torso mobility,\" she said.\n\nThe Apollo moon suit, known as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or EMU, was famously so restricted that some astronauts preferred to \"bunny hop,\" taking advantage of the moon's low gravity to lope over the surface.\n\nYouTube\n\nSince well before the Space Shuttle program wrapped up in 2011, NASA has been an agency in search of a mission. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush first proposed a return to the moon \"to stay\" and ultimately, missions to Mars.\n\nIn March, the Trump administration directed NASA to land humans on the moon \u2013 preferably at the unexplored southern lunar pole, by 2024, with the eventual goal of landing on Mars.\n\n\"Ultimately the goal is this: we're going to Mars,\" NASA chief Jim Bridenstine said. \"And in order to go to Mars, we need to use the moon as a proving ground.\"\n\nThe new xEMU is a one-size-fits-all garment designed for men and women \u2014 something that would have come in handy in March when the first planned all-female spacewalk had to be scrapped because one of two medium-sized suits on the International Space Station wasn't ready to go.\n\nAstronaut Christina Koch had planned to spacewalk with Anne McClain but because McClain preferred a medium suit and there was only one available, NASA swapped Koch for astronaut Nick Hague on the walk.\n\nBut NASA said Tuesday it is going to try again for an all-female spacewalk on Oct. 21, this time with Koch and fellow astronaut Jessica Meir.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the two will exit the International Space Station as part of a series of spacewalks to install new batteries on the aging orbital outpost.", "description": "The space agency unveils two new spacesuits for a planned 2024 return to the moon.
