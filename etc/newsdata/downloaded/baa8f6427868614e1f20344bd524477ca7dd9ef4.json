The pure eroticism? Its emotional undercurrents? The shift and flow of the camera? Of course, there\u2019s no real answer.\n\nOur concept of how sex should work on film speaks to so many variants: what personally gets us hot under the collar, whether we seek the fantastic or the realist, or how these films should tie in emotionally with the rest of the film. A great sex scene can be raw and passionate, languid and romantic; it can be tinged with an air of sadness and longing, or even downright hilarious.\n\nThe criteria are pretty much wide open. So, in that light, here are the candidates for some of the best sex scenes ever put to film:\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The 10 best sex scenes in film 1/10 Blue Valentine Derek Cianfrance dared to portray sex with any sense of realism, both physically and emotionally, only to quickly get slapped with an NC-17 rating for showing Michelle Williams\u2019 character, Cindy, on the receiving end of oral sex. \u201cThe sex felt real - it wasn't sexy or 'a sex scene', and that's why we got into trouble,\u201d co-star Ryan Gosling remarked to The Observer at the time. \u201cYou shouldn't be penalised for doing a good job.\u201d After successfully appealing against the MPAA\u2019s decision, Blue Valentine reached cinemas as an R, thankfully allowing mainstream audiences to see how emotionally complex a matter sex can actually be, especially in a broken down marriage like the one shared by its lead characters. 2/10 Love & Basketball Gina Prince-Bythewood has masterfully shown Hollywood how cinema can portray realistic sex without any loss of romanticism or intimacy. That\u2019s especially true of her directorial debut, 2000\u2019s Love & Basketball, in which Monica (Sanaa Lathan) loses her virginity to childhood sweetheart, Quincy (Omar Epps). The moment is wonderfully tender, aided by Maxwell\u2019s cover of Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work\u201d, while being one of the rare films that actually shows the use of a condom. \u201cThe only note that I ever got from the studio during the filmmaking process was that when I shot that scene, they looked at the dailies and they said, they didn\u2019t think she was enjoying it enough,\u201d Prince-Bythewood told The Huffington Post. \u201cAnd my argument was, it\u2019s the first time and despite what the male fantasy might be, it\u2019s not that great.\u201d New Line Cinema 3/10 Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s raucous classic inverts the American sex comedy: Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are stereotypical, sex-obsessed young men distraught at the concept of their girlfriends leaving the country. Choosing to live as bachelors, they befriend an older woman (Maribel Verd\u00fa), who seduces both of them. Yet, the film drives them towards one, real truth: their own bisexuality, finally freed during the film\u2019s famous threesome. Though Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n's conclusion is tragic - Julio and Tenoch's reject their own truth, turn their backs on each other, and suppress their feelings - their threesome still marks a moment of genuine, harmonious sensuality. 20th Century Fox 4/10 God's Own Country God\u2019s Own Country star Alec Secareanu admitted he was initially \u201cvery afraid\u201d of the kinds of scenes he would be tasked with filming for the gay drama film. \u201cBut the way each character has sex tells a lot about them; the way that they develop their relationship,\u201d he told Attitude. The first sexual encounter between Secareanu\u2019s character Gheorghe and Johnny (Josh O\u2019Connor) is quick, aggressive and with little intimacy. As Johnny slowly learns to open up to Gheroghe, their second encounter is far more romantic; intense in a different way to the first. Both actors later told of how they developed a close bond in real life after working together on-screen. Orion Pictures 5/10 Carol A film that finds its eroticism in small gestures - in the languid rest of a glove, in a glance, shared across a crowded room - when it comes to director Todd Haynes actually filming the first time Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) have sex, their chemistry is already so palpable that the moment feels nothing short of explosive. \u201cIt's very much like shooting a musical number,\u201d Haynes told E!News of the scene. \u201cYou start the music and basically you just go and the camera finds the moments and the beats. And we had some amazing material with these two women to work with.\u201d StudioCanal 6/10 Moonlight Barry Jenkins\u2019 Oscar-winner is one of the most tender depictions of yearning in modern cinema. Its protagonist Chiron (played by Ashton Sanders here, at other points by Alex R. Hibbert and Trevante Rhodes) experiences his first sexual encounter with fellow student Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) on a quiet, isolated beach. Their fumbling may pay testament to the awkwardness of a teenager\u2019s first experiences, but Jenkins\u2019 approach also gives the moment a profound grace, and an acknowledgement of how it will come to shape Chiron\u2019s own view of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I filmed a sex scene. It\u2019s the first time these actors had performed a sex scene,\u201d Jenkins told Entertainment Weekly of the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s not gratuitous. It\u2019s very delicate in keeping with most of the film, but it kept me up at night. I really wanted to get the feelings of that first sort of sexual expression, and I wanted to get it right\u2026 but then, when we got to shoot it, it rolled off like butter.\u201d A24 7/10 Don't Look Now Much like Blue Valentine, Nicolas Roeg\u2019s 1973 classic swiftly faced controversy due to a sex scene so emotionally faithful (while also depicting a female character, Julie Christie\u2019s Laura, receiving oral sex), that it caused clashes with censors. A grieving couple desperately holding onto the shreds of their marriage after the death of their child, Laura and John (Donald Sutherland)\u2019s raw emotions and vulnerability in this moment are famously intercut with post-coital preparations to go to dinner - an attempt, in fact, to satiate censors. Christie herself admitted the film\u2019s innovations made the scene difficult to film since, \u201cThere were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [Roeg] shouted instructions.\" British Lion Films 8/10 Team America: World Police Sex is funny, sometimes hilarious. There\u2019s no getting through this list without acknowledging that fact, and there\u2019s no better film to summarise it than Team America: World Police and its infamous puppet intercourse, enthusiastically filing through every sexual position in the book. As puppet creator Stephen Chiodo noted to MovieWeb, it\u2019s the scene\u2019s bracing artifice that\u2019s actually the key to its humour. As he explained, \u201cThe more realistic it became, the less funny it was. The more axes of movement, the more lifelike movement we gave the puppets during the sex scene, it just wasn\u2019t funny. But when you had them stiff like dolls, kind of rutting, it just was funny.\u201d Paramount Pictures 9/10 Mulholland Drive Trust David Lynch to create a highly-charged sex scene that inevitably only becomes part of the web created to deceive and befuddle us. Rita (Laura Harring) and Betty (Naomi Watts) may consummate their bubbling affections for each other in a sensuous, dreamlike manner - but who is Rita in this moment? Who is Betty? Is this encounter real or imagined? This moment of lush, Hollywood perfection only creates the set up for Mulholland Drive\u2019s earth-shattering twist. Betty is now Diane, and her own sexual experience couldn\u2019t be any more different: a tear-soaked, anguished masturbation scene that seems exemplary of her own broken soul. 10/10 Unfaithful One of the finest examples of the erotic thriller, director Adrian Lyne depicts the extramarital affair in its full urgency, its entire spectrum of conflicted emotions, as suburban housewife Connie (Diane Lane) becomes enraptured by a handsome young Frenchman (Olivier Martinez). Their initial encounter is at first tenuous, tender, before a hunger seems to consume Connie and her guilt is momentarily forgotten in the throes of extreme passion, only for them to creep slowly back on the train ride home. The memory of its erotic power, the searing regret; those feelings soon become feverishly intertwined. 20th Century Fox 1/10 Blue Valentine Derek Cianfrance dared to portray sex with any sense of realism, both physically and emotionally, only to quickly get slapped with an NC-17 rating for showing Michelle Williams\u2019 character, Cindy, on the receiving end of oral sex. \u201cThe sex felt real - it wasn't sexy or 'a sex scene', and that's why we got into trouble,\u201d co-star Ryan Gosling remarked to The Observer at the time. \u201cYou shouldn't be penalised for doing a good job.\u201d After successfully appealing against the MPAA\u2019s decision, Blue Valentine reached cinemas as an R, thankfully allowing mainstream audiences to see how emotionally complex a matter sex can actually be, especially in a broken down marriage like the one shared by its lead characters. 2/10 Love & Basketball Gina Prince-Bythewood has masterfully shown Hollywood how cinema can portray realistic sex without any loss of romanticism or intimacy.
