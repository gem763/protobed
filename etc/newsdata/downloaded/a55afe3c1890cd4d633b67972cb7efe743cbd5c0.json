Last night we saw a hint of Nate\u2019s temper. Hmm I wonder where he gets that from? (see gif) One way or another, Nate is a Dingle #Emmerdale #twitter.\"\n\nWhile another commented: \"Temper temper Nate #Emmerdale.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nA third remarked: \"#emmerdale nate is an effing psycho. Bin him off moira.\"\n\nActress Sally Dexter, who plays Cain's mum Faith, told Mirror TV at the Inside Soap Awards earlier this week that there would be a huge twist regarding Nate's true identity.\n\nShe said: \"\"Yes, there is a very shocking twist with Nate's identity and it has dire consequences for my son Cain, for Moira my daughter-in-law, and me.\n\n\"We have to come through a heavy storm and some of us might not make it. It was some of the most harrowingly emotional scenes I've ever done.\"\n\n*Emmerdale returns on Monday at 7pm on ITV", "description": "Fans were convinced they found proof during last night's Emmerdale episode", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554792.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emmerdale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
