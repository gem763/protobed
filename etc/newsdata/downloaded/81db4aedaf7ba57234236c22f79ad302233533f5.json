It will offer a high-yield savings account with no fees or minimum balance requirement, and roll it out to 90 million US customers later this month.\n\nThe account is starting out with a 2.03% annual percentage yield \u2014 not the best on the market, but higher than the current national average savings rate of 0.09% according to the FDIC.\n\nBut Credit Karma says it does not want to become a lender itself, and has no aspirations to become a digital bank.\n\n\"We don't want to be a neobank, and we don't want to be a lender,\" said CEO Ken Lin at a press event on Thursday night. \"You can't be unbiased and objective if you're providing the products you're trying to help your customers understand.\"\n\nLike fintechs offering financial products, Credit Karma is working with a partner bank \u2014 MVB Bank in this case. MVB will hold the funds deposited into the savings account and offer FDIC insurance up to $5 million.\n\nUsing Credit Karma's existing network across over 800 banks, its savings rate will move competitively with the market, so customers won't have to monitor rates across banks to ensure they are getting a high rate.\n\nRead more: $4 billion Credit Karma's CEO reveals how a single meeting in 2008 saved the company from going under\n\nThe $4 billion startup made its name providing free credit scores. It also provides financial advice and content, including lists of best credit cards, personal and auto loan recommendations, and unclaimed money searches.\n\nCredit Karma hopes that the product will appeal to their existing users, who may not understand the benefits of high-yield savings. The platform will include a savings simulator, where users can toggle recurring contribution amounts over time to see how their savings will grow.\n\nLeaning on its consumer-focused brand, Credit Karma could be well positioned to build out its banking consumer base using the high-yield savings, before venturing into other offerings like retirement products.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve's recent rate cuts, the high-yield savings market has seen a decrease in APY across the board. Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which also offers a no minimum balance, no fee account, initially offered 2.25% APY, cut to 2.15% in July, then again cut to 2.00% in August.\n\nFintech Betterment is offering up to 2.11%, if you get on the waitlist for their upcoming checking account. Competitor Wealthfront offers 2.07% on its high-yield account.\n\nRead more: Here's how the Fed sets interest rates and why it matters", "description": "Credit Karma, known for helping track credit scores and compare financial products, is now offering a more direct way for people to plug into savings accounts.", "authors": ["Shannen Balogh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d974348e6a38109973687db?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
