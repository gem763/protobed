I love the girls, but from someone who's been there, I'd tell them to give themselves a bit of space from each other on the road, as it's easy to fall out.\n\n\"I remember some of the fight we had in Atomic Kitten back in the day. Once, Liz punched me from behind after we had a little row. I was furious and got my own back.\n\n\"I made her get changed in the toilets at SMTV Live, then I stamped on her feet while we were up on stage singing Whole Again.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"It was silly stuff, but we were sisters, and sisters fight! I just hope lovely Little Mix stay on good terms - as least until the end of the tour!\"\n\nLittle Mix have a lot more than their tour coming up.\n\nThey recently announced that they're launching a BBC show to rival X Factor .\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLittle Mix: The Search, on BBC One, will see them hunt for amazing talent to help create and nurture a new band who'll support them on tour next year.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
