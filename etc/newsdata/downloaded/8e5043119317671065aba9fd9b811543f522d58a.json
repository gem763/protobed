They climbed over each other in an attempt to get out after being confined in the sac\n\nHe added that it was still important for more funnel webs to be handed in to the park.\n\nMr Christensen said: 'Catching funnel webs can be a safe practice for sensible adults. When collecting spiders adults should be equipped with a spider safety kit including a glass jar with air holes in the lid, and a plastic ruler to guide the spider into the jar.\n\n'We encourage parents to educate children that should they locate a spider of any kind that they find a parent immediately and do not try and touch the spider with their hands.'\n\nThe spiders are often found in shady, sheltered and damp places.\n\nThey have been found in shoes and around pools in the past.", "description": "The footage from Australian Reptile Park, on the NSW Central Coast, showed the sac opened with a scapel and tongs - allowing for hundreds of deadly creatures to crawl out.", "authors": ["Claudia Poposki For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19513584-0-image-a-4_1570657777947.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
