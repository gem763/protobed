This included increases in sexual offences, such as rape and other violence against women.\"\n\nSeldom used provision\n\nThis comes almost two weeks after Ramaphosa addressed a large protest outside Parliament and later that evening delivered a pre-recorded, televised speech on the matter.\n\nThe sitting is scheduled to start at 14:00.\n\nThe NCOP rescheduled its work to accommodate the special sitting.\n\nThis week was set aside for the NCOP to do provincial oversight visits, but its programme for Wednesday will be shifted to Thursday, and the programme for Thursday to Friday.\n\nAlthough the Constitution allows the president to call such a sitting, the provision is seldom used other than for State of the Nation Addresses.\n\nIn 2005, then-president Thabo Mbeki called such a sitting to announce that he had fired Jacob Zuma as deputy president, or rather, to \"release the Honourable Jacob Zuma from his responsibilities as deputy president of the republic and member of the Cabinet\".\n\nThe previous time such a sitting was called was in 2013, when former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan addressed both houses of Parliament.", "description": "Focus the attention of MPs and the nation at large on the crisis of gender-based violence and femicide - this is the purpose of the urgent sitting of both houses of Parliament which President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9344/fb85277230724eb196c7fffeff8de370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
