Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2018s campaign has reported what he called a \u201cdeath threat\u201d to the FBI after a Republican lawmaker in Texas tweeted at him, \u201cMy AR is ready for you.\u201d\n\nThat inflammatory remark was from state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who has represented a district outside Houston since 2017 and is reportedly one of the most socially conservative members of the Texas legislature.\n\nCain, 34, had responded to a tweet from O\u2019Rourke echoing what O\u2019Rourke said in Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate, when he told moderator David Muir, \u201cIf it\u2019s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield \u2026. hell yes we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-4.\u201d\n\nHis campaign tweeted a T-shirt for sale with that same comment on it, to which Cain responded, \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis,\u201d referring to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s legal name. Cain\u2019s tweet was later deleted by Twitter for breaking their rules on \u201cviolence and wishing harm against others,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson tells PEOPLE.\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded on his own Twitter account, calling Cain\u2019s tweet a \u201cdeath threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else,\u201d he wrote.\n\nState Rep. Mary Gonz\u00e1lez, a Democrat, also responded to Cain, \u201cThe language you are using and the way you are using it is dangerous. We need leaders who want to change our culture of violence.\u201d\n\nAn O\u2019Rourke spokeswoman confirms the campaign reported Cain\u2019s tweet to the FBI but declined to comment further or answer questions about which FBI office it was reported to or if they officially alleged the tweet was an illegal threat.\n\nMessages left with Cain were not immediately returned on Friday.\n\nWhile \u201ctrue threats\u201d are not protected by the First Amendment, according to the Supreme Court, what actually constitutes such a threat is less clear. However, lower courts have delineated between threats on the one hand and \u201cpolitical hyperbole\u201d on the other.\n\nRELATED: Beto O\u2019Rourke Reveals His Ancestors Owned Slaves \u2014 We Must \u2018Repair the Damage Done\u2019\n\nThis is a death threat, Representative.

Briscoe Cain | Scott Eisen/Getty; Briscoe Cain/Facebook More\n\nAs part of his campaign, O\u2019Rourke has proposed a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons nationwide \u2014 which critics have called confiscation that betrays the Second Amendment.\n\nAsked to explain his thinking at Thursday\u2019s debate, O\u2019Rourke spoke about the havoc such guns can wreak, as in West Texas last month where authorities say a gunman used an assault weapon to kill seven people.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield, if the high-impact, high-velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. \u2026 We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nRELATED: This Shot of Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke Is Your New Election Meme\n\n\u201cIn Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren\u2019t enough ambulances to get to them in time,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nResponding to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s tweet that Cain had threatened him, Cain wrote back, \u201cYou\u2019re a child Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nHis official Facebook page soon began promoting new merchandise: a T-shirt with the phrase \u201cCome and Take It.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe unofficial motto of Texas has long been, \u2018Come And Take It,\u2019 \u201cCain wrote. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand that Robert Francis, you\u2019ve spent too much time in DC.\u201d", "description": "Beto O'Rourke Reports Lawmaker's Tweet 'Threat' to FBI", "authors": ["Adam Carlson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o0k5fv_DcDVAsw8vuQGXsg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/4ffa0eeb66ef800fa942c17885a22cdf", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
