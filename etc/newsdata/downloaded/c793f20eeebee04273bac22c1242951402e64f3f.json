Regardless of the words he utters or the order he utters them in, if it\u2019s possible to take them out of context in order to portray the president in a bad light, they will do it, every single time.\n\nSo it was last week, when Trump got into a heap of trouble with the libs, particularly Jewish libs, for using the D word - as in \u201cdisloyal\u201d - not once, but twice to describe Jewish folks who vote Democratic.\n\n\u201cWhere has the Democratic Party gone? Where have they gone where they are defending these two people over the state of Israel? I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty,\" Trump said Tuesday. Then, the very next day, he followed that up with this: \"In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people, and you're being very disloyal to Israel, and only weak people would say anything other than that.\u201d\n\nIn four sentences over two days, the president of the United States managed to tick off 75 plus percent of American Jews by calling them both ignorant and disloyal. Now \u201cignorant\u201d is one thing. I could make a pretty credible argument that anyone of any IQ level who votes Democratic is, well, pretty ignorant, at least insofar as their knowledge of general history, historical patterns, current events, economics, human nature, and geopolitics is concerned. And at least in my own view, I\u2019d be correct (for whatever that\u2019s worth). But \u201cdisloyal\u201d is another thing altogether, especially when it comes to Jewish people. In fact, it\u2019s actually an old antisemitic canard dating back to the period of Egyptian bondage, implying that Jews are somehow disloyal to the nations in which they reside.\n\nBut Trump clearly wasn\u2019t saying Jewish Democrats are being disloyal to America. If you read both quotes carefully, in context, they clearly mean being disloyal to Israel. But that didn\u2019t stop the president - who has a Jewish son-in-law, a converted Jewish daughter, and Jewish grandchildren - from being accused of antisemitism.\n\nBend the Arc: Jewish Action CEO Stosh Cotler said, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s abhorrent statement today accusing the vast majority of Jewish Americans who oppose him of \u2018disloyalty\u2019 is textbook antisemitism and should be called out as such, without hesitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are sick and tired of Trump\u2019s repeated use of anti-Semitic tropes and his inciting of hate and violence against Jews,\u201d tweeted the Jewish Democratic Council of America. \u201cThe Jewish community is less safe today because of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when anti-Semitic incidents have increased \u2014 due to the president\u2019s emboldening of white nationalism \u2014 Trump is repeating an anti-Semitic trope,\u201d said Jewish Democratic Council of America executive director Halie Soifer.\n\nNew York City comptroller Scott Stringer wrote: \u201cAs a Jew (and lifelong Democrat) this language from the president evokes an ugly past. Accusing 75 percent of the Jewish community of \u2018disloyalty\u2019 is dangerous. If Donald Trump wants to find who\u2019s being disloyal to America, he can start by looking in the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump wants you to believe American Jews are \u2018disloyal\u2019 towards Israel & the United States b/c the majority of U.S. Jews support Democrats,\u201d liberal pastor Chuck Currie tweeted. \u201cI guess today is anti-Semitism day at The White House.\u201d\n\nFox News contributor Jessica Tarlov called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cdisgusting\u201d during a Fox News \u201cOutnumbered\u201d segment on the topic: \u201cHe called me, a Democratic Jewish voter in America, \u2018dumb and disloyal.\u2019 That is disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has no place using that trope.\u201d\n\nThe Huffington Post accused Trump of reviving \u201can antisemitic attack\u201d on Jewish Democrats.\u201d\n\nWriting for the Daily Beast, Jay Michaelson, seeming to at least understood the original intent of the president\u2019s statement, nevertheless accused Trump of having \u201cinverted\u201d the accusation: \u201cHis claim\u2014besides being absurd, offensive, manipulative, and reprehensible\u2014is that American Jews are being disloyal by not supporting Israel enough. The problem isn\u2019t that we\u2019re betraying America. The problem is that we\u2019re betraying Israel. American Jews, long suspected of \u2018dual loyalty,\u2019 are now being accused of not being dual-loyal-enough.\u201d\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t without defenders, however, including author and former Israeli Air Force pilot Tal Keinan, who called media reactions to Trump\u2019s comments, particularly attempts to label him as antisemitic, \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d He even went so far as to thank Fox News anchor Gillian Turner for playing \u201cthe whole clip\u201d of Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m glad you played the whole clip, because I think the president makes it clear he\u2019s talking about disloyalty to the Jewish people and to Israel, not disloyalty to the United States, and that\u2019s an important distinction,\u201d said Keinan. \u201cThere\u2019s been some disingenuous reactions to that. He was not raising the old canard.\u201d\n\nNo, indeed he was not. But the fact that the media used such a flimsy pretext to unjustly try to brand the president with one of the worst labels ever says everything about their blatant bias and dishonesty.\n\nEditor's note: This column has been updated.", "description": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine any single individual being more maligned .09/02/2019 3:02:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/ce482cc3-e9d5-499c-8624-5977d1b94aa9.png"}
