A total of 5.3% have said that they own some bitcoins, but approximately 20.3% said that they\u2019ve never heard of it.\n\n5.3% Of UK Citizens Own Bitcoin\n\nThe matter of Bitcoin ownership has always been an interesting one among the crypto community. A recent survey in the UK revealed that around 5.3% own bitcoin.\n\nOut of that 5.3 %, around 2% plan to buy more and 3.3% don\u2019t have intentions of the kind. Needless to say, the low ownership percentage suggests that there\u2019s plenty of room for further adoption.\n\n20% Have Never Heard Of Bitcoin\n\nAccording to the survey, 20.3% have never heard of Bitcoin and interestingly enough, according to the report, the percentage rises to 25.5 when only males between 25-34-years-old are targeted. This might leave more open space for educational programs on the matter.\n\nThe survey also shows that 6.8% don\u2019t have any bitcoins currently but are planning to invest in it. With males from 35 to 44-years-old, the number goes as high as 11.6%.\n\nWith the upcoming Brexit, it\u2019s probably worth noting that Bitcoin may appear as a riskier option to some British Investors, especially when we consider the volatility and the severe price actions of late. This is perhaps one of the reasons for the high percentage of people who don\u2019t actually own any bitcoins. As per the survey, 67.5% of the respondents don\u2019t own any bitcoin and they also don\u2019t have any intentions of buying.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported several weeks ago, a similar poll was taken amid 5,000 Americans and it showed interesting results as well. 64% of all participants answered that they don\u2019t have any bitcoins and are not planning to buy while 6.2% claimed that they already have some.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "2,500 citizens of the UK took place in a recent survey regarding their stance on Bitcoin as an investment and the results are rather interesting.
