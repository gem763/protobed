Drucker (@DavidMDrucker) August 20, 2019\n\nDems, nominate this man at your own risk:\n\nIt is unfair to expect Vice President Biden to remember that he served with President Barack Obama. It is equally unfair to expect him to remember the G-8 is now the G-7. People just keep knit picking these small boo boos. Remember, he is likable Uncle Joe. \u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) August 28, 2019\n\nBiden calls the G-7 the \u201cG-8.\u201d Pretty soon he\u2019ll be talking about World War VII and quoting \u201cMalcolm the Tenth.\u201d When my mom told me that in America \u201canyone can grow up and be president\u201d I\u2019m not sure this bumbling fool is what she had in mind \u2014 Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 29, 2019\n\n.@JoeBiden called the G-7 Summit, the \u201cG-8,\u201d despite the fact that only 7 member nations were at the Summit. And then claimed, \u201cif I have any expertise, it\u2019s in American foreign policy.\u201d His campaign is just becoming a parody at this point \u2935\ufe0fpic.twitter.com/bPKhyUddZK \u2014 Students For Trump (@TrumpStudents) August 28, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"...Biden refers to the G8, but it\u2019s been the Group of 7 nations since Russia was kicked out in\u201914.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/biden_ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
