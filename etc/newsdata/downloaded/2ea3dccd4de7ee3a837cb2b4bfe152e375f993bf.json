Easily reached on twice-weekly British Airways flights from London Gatwick, St Kitts is a small, friendly and vibrant island with plenty to enjoy from rainforest hikes to a lazy catamaran cruise. Winter temperatures hover around 25C and the landscape is a captivating mix of secluded beaches, soft emerald hills and mighty volcanic mountains.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBeach bliss\n\nSt Kitts has sands for all holiday moods, from the gentle, family-friendly waters lapping the mile-long curve of Cockleshell Bay to breezy Atlantic shores much loved by walkers and kitesurfers. Inviting beach bars are never far away, such as the Castaway-style ShipWreck on South Friars Bay, which has live music on Sunday afternoons, and Salt Plage in Christophe Harbour with a smart waterfront deck ideal for sipping expertly crafted cocktails as the sun sets.\n\nNatural splendour\n\nRising to 3,972ft, Mt Liamuiga is the island's majestic green peak \u2013 if you like a challenge, take a guided hike up through the rainforest to admire its half-mile-wide crater. For something more leisurely, sit back on the top deck of the St Kitts Scenic Railway as it trundles round the north coast on a century-old narrow-gauge line originally used to transport sugar cane.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
