Breck, a resident of the 15-story Smith Tower building.\n\nAccording to court papers, the two female victims - Enilia Montoya, 73, and Shawna Garris, 44 - told investigators that Breck had employed Garris as his caregiver.\n\nMontoya is the caregiver's neighbor.\n\nWhen Breck offered Garris money to be his mistress weeks ago, she refused. Breck then fired her, according to KOIN-TV.\n\nGarris told police that she was also working for Breck's neighbor, Montoya.\n\nRobert E. Breck, 80, is seen (wearing a baseball hat) being escorted in handcuffs by police in Vancouver, Washington on Thursday\n\nBreck is alleged to have shot dead a man and critically wounded two women in the lobby of his retirement residence on Thursday\n\nThe shooting took place inside the Smith Tower apartment building (above) in Vancouver, Washington on Thursday\n\nAccording to the police, Montoya told Garris that Breck was spreading rumors around the apartment complex about her and another man, who turned out to be Tunstall.\n\nMontoya told police that she confronted Breck and demanded that he stop spreading rumors.\n\nDuring this confrontation, which took place in the lobby on Thursday, Breck opened fire and shot Tunstall, Garris, and Montoya.\n\nTunstall was pronounced dead at the scene. Garris and Montoya were rushed to a local hospital, where they were listed in critical condition.\n\nAfter the shooting on Thursday in the lobby, Breck barricaded himself inside his apartment on the 13th floor.\n\nVancouver Police spokeswoman Kim Kapp said he surrendered after two hours.\n\nBreck appeared in court on Friday morning.\n\nSome parts of the building had been evacuated during the standoff and other residents were told to stay inside their apartments.\n\nAll were allowed back into their residences Thursday evening, police said.\n\nBreck is pictured above being wheeled into Clark County Superior Court on Friday for his initial court appearance\n\nKapp said police did not know what led to the shooting or the identities of the people who were shot.\n\nBreck and the victims reportedly were locked in an ongoing disagreement, a friend of Breck told KOIN-TV.\n\n\u2018They had a little gripe going for quite a while and I think Bob just got tired of it,\u2019 the friend, Jonny Moffey, said.\n\nMoffey said he believes that the two wounded women were connected to the man who was killed.\n\n'[Breck] doesn't bother anybody, but this one particular person he said was harassing him, and I know how that is,' Moffey told KOIN-TV.\n\n'That\u2019s all I can say.'\n\nKapp said the patrol officers who responded were replaced with SWAT team officers who have more tactical training because of the complexity of the situation.\n\nDuring negotiations with the suspect, SWAT officers could be seen standing on balconies on several floors.\n\n'This is a situation where it\u00b4s a retirement community, so we have elderly residents as well as an elevator situation,' Kapp said.\n\n'We don\u00b4t know where the suspect is when you have a multi-story building like that.'\n\nAustin Studebaker said he was buying drinks at a convenience store across the street from the building when he saw 'the most cop cars I've ever seen in my life swarm in.'\n\nStudebaker said officers were carrying rifles and many were wearing body armor. Then Studebaker saw authorities carry a bleeding person out on a stretcher.\n\n'It's just weird, and I want to know what\u00b4s happening,' he said.\n\nA police drone is seen alongside the Smith Tower in Vancouver on Thursday during the response to the reports of a shooting\n\nWomen evacuate from Smith Tower apartments with the help of law enforcement on Thursday\n\nVancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle said in a statement that 'our hearts go out to the victims and their families as they deal with this tragedy.'\n\nVancouver is a city of about 175,000 people just north of Portland, Oregon.\n\nBreck, who has lived in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area for decades, is listed as having started a construction business in Clark County in 1993.\n\nIn 2001, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, according to Oregon Live.\n\nBreck does not have a prior criminal record. He was flagged for traffic violations in 1992 and 2003, but those complaints were dismissed.\n\nIva Gjerde, 94, who lives on the 13th floor of Smith Tower - the same floor where Breck barricaded himself in his apartment - told Oregon Live she has known him for more than 20 years.\n\n'He was my neighbor,' Gjerde said.\n\n'As far as I knew, he was friendly and nice. There was never a problem with him at all.'\n\nGjerde said she was allowed back into her apartment at around 5:15pm on Thursday after police evacuated all tenants.\n\nShe said she noticed SWAT officers carrying rifles in her hallway.\n\n'He just took me by the arm and led me downstairs,' she said.\n\nPolice have yet to say what the motive for the shooting was. The identities of the victims have also yet to be revealed\n\n'I didn't know what to think. It was scarier than heck.'\n\nGjerde said she and other tenants were taken to a bus, where they sat for an hour before they were allowed back into the building.\n\nAt no time did she hear gunshots on the 13th floor, she said.\n\nThe Smith Tower is a retirement community for residents 62 years of age and older, according to its website.\n\nThe building has 170 residential units - all of them either studios or one-bedroom apartments.\n\nThe apartments offer views of the Columbia River and the nearby Cascade foothills.\n\nThe complex is owned by a nonprofit corporation of local labor unions.", "description": "The shooter was identified by police Thursday evening as 80-year-old Robert E.
