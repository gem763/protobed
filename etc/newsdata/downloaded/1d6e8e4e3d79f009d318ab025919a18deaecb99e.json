The bag contained drinks bottles a small amount of Kenyan shillings.\n\nA Met Police spokesperson said: 'Work continues to establish the man's identity. Officers believe the man to be Kenyan but are keeping an open mind.'\n\nThe man, thought to be in his 30s, fell to earth on June 30 and landed in a garden in Clapham, south London.\n\nA post-mortem held on 3 July gave cause of death as multiple injuries.\n\nThe man is believed to have fallen from the landing gear compartment as the aircraft approached Heathrow Airport.\n\nPolice say the death is not being treated as suspicious and we continue to liaise with the Coroner.\n\nThe man fell into the back garden of a house in Clapham. This is the scene the following day\n\nPolice have also released a picture of the man's bag in the hope someone will know him\n\nThe airliner swerved over London as he it came into land. The man is thought to the fallen out as it lowered its landing gear\n\nDetective Sergeant Paul Graves, of the South Central Command Unit, said: 'We have pursued a number of lines of inquiry in what has been a very sad incident to investigate.\n\n'This man has a family somewhere who need to know what has happened to their loved one.\n\n'Our investigation has included liaison with the authorities in Kenya, from where the flight took off, but so far our efforts to identify this man have proved fruitless.\n\n'I hope by releasing this e-fit someone known to the deceased will recognise him and make contact.'\n\nThe man narrowly hit John Baldock, who was sunbathing in the garden of the Clapham house when the incident unfolded.\n\nThe man landed in the back garden of this townhouse in Clapham, south London in July\n\nThe strap of the bag had the distinctive lettering 'MCA' written onto it, and the bag also contained a small amount of Kenyan currency\n\nThe body landed partly on concrete paving slabs and an astroturf lawn - leaving a crater in the garden.\n\nShocked neighbours said it was lucky no one on the ground was hurt, as hundreds of people were enjoying the weather on Clapham Common just a short distance away.\n\nNeighbours said Mr Renwick was 'very shaken' by the incident and there was 'blood all over the walls of the garden'.\n\nFormer Oxford University student John Baldock was in the garden of the home\n\nOne female neighbour told MailOnline: 'There was an almighty bang. At first I thought it was some scaffolding falling down and thought nothing more about it.\n\n'My husband decided to see what was going on and went upstairs to take a look. He was obviously quite shocked and went out into the street where my neighbour was standing on the phone to the police.\n\n'He was really shaken up. He'd been in the garden when it happened and the body must have landed so close to where he was.\n\n'My husband came back in and I asked him what was going on and he said 'haven't you seen the man? The man who fell from the sky?'\n\n'I wondered what he was talking about and went up to see for myself and there in the middle of the lawn was a body of a man.'", "description": "The man, who is thought to be Kenyan,\u00a0plunged to his death from the landing gear compartment of the Kenyan Airways plane, which took off from Nairobi and went on to land at Heathrow in July.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19843674-0-image-a-26_1571324849669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
