Peterson wasn\u2019t active for Week 1, and then received only 10 carries as the team\u2019s primary runner in Week 2.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nHow is Peterson handling that situation? It\u2019s gotten to a point where he wants to truck someone in the team\u2019s front office. No, really.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPeterson, 34, revealed that nugget to Darren M. Haynes of WUSA 9 in Maryland. When Haynes asked which Washington player Peterson would love to run over, Peterson responded with, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one guy that I would just want to run over that\u2019s on the team.\u201d Peterson then waits a beat before saying, \u201cNow, if you would have said the front office, I could have had a couple options.\u201d\n\nPeterson is clearly playing that answer for laughs.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, given everything that\u2019s happened with Peterson this season, there may be a kernel of truth to his statement. After the way he\u2019s been handled, Peterson could be frustrated with the team. Peterson was a surprise inactive in Week 1 after rushing for 1,042 yards last season.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible this has nothing to do with Peterson. It might be more of a statement about how the team has handled offensive lineman Trent Williams. Peterson and Williams \u2014 who is currently holding out \u2014 are close. The two went to the University of Oklahoma, and have talked in person recently. Peterson may be frustrated the team hasn\u2019t done more for Williams.\n\nPeterson has no choice but to put that animosity aside for now. With Derrius Guice injured, Washington will rely on Peterson once again. Whether he likes it or not, Peterson is stuck with Washington for the time being.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
