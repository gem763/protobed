Seidel further explained the group\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cWe need more compassion in our criminal justice system,\u201d Seidel wrote, \u201cbut here, compassion crossed the line into coercion. Judges cannot impose their personal religion on others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more compassion in our criminal justice system, but here, compassion crossed the line into coercion.

Seidel, attorney, Freedom from Religion Foundation\n\nSeidel is the author of \u201cThe Founding Myth: Why Christian Nationalism is Un-American.\u201d\n\nNeither the group nor Seidel appeared to demand punishment for the judge. Their messages seemed aimed only at drawing attention to a \u201cpossible violation\u201d of rules of judicial conduct.\n\nHowever, another group \u2013 the Texas-based First Liberty Institute, which supports religious freedom \u2013 came to the judge\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cWe should all be thankful the law allows Judge Kemp\u2019s actions,\u201d said Hiram Sasser, legal counsel for the First Liberty Institute. \u201cWe stand with her and will gladly lead the charge in defending her noble and legal actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should all be thankful the law allows Judge Kemp\u2019s actions.

Guyger had been a member of the Dallas force for nearly five years.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the atheist group posted a Twitter message objecting to Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s support of \u201cBring Your Bible to School Day,\u201d saying the Republican governor\u2019s stand was \u201cnarrow-minded and totally inappropriate.\u201d", "description": "An atheist group that has counted Ron Reagan Jr. among its members says it was inappropriate for a judge to give a Bible to Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who convicted this week of murdering a neighbor last year.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio", "Andrew L.
