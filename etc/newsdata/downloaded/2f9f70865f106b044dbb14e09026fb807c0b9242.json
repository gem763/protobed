The new season brings Berk, Brown, France, Porowski and Van Ness to Philadelphia; its production began in June.\n\nSpeaking to The Los Angeles Times a few months back, Berk said he believes the show\u2019s biggest impact takes place off-camera.\n\n\u201cMy favorite stories I\u2019m getting [are] the ministers who will message me and come up to me in public and say, \u2018You know, my whole life, I was taught that being gay was a choice and it was wrong and you\u2019re going to hell, and you were evil, and I have also taught that in my church and my congregation\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hearing you say on the Mama Tammye episode that you used to cry every Sunday and every single day, begging God not to make you gay, yet you\u2019re still gay, made me realize it wasn\u2019t a choice. And that gay people don\u2019t have a choice and they are born that way. I\u2019ll never preach that hate in my church again.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if one more kid doesn\u2019t have to grow up like that, then \u2026 it\u2019s worth it all,\u201d he added.", "description": "The Emmy-winning stars of the Netflix makeover series will hit Tokyo for a special, 4-episode season.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b87272100002a04330646.jpeg?cache=zobefxsbl9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
