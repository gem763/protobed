Biden has always massaged his stories to craft simple, teachable moments from the often-complex fabric of real life. For the most part, voters and the media have been charitable to these slight exaggerations of fact. Not so with Biden\u2019s most recent attempt to combine several different personal experiences into one tall tale of an Afghan war story.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFudging the truth is a risky gambit for any politician; doing so with war stories risks doing serious and lasting damage to the tale-spinner\u2019s credibility. Biden\u2019s response, that \u201cthe details are irrelevant\u201d when trying to teach a moral lesson, was a textbook example of how not to climb out of a hole.\n\nBiden\u2019s war story mix-up comes as his own staff considers limiting the public events where Biden routinely makes news more for his stumbles than for any new policy proposals. Beltway conventional wisdom says Team Biden is hedging against future gaffes by pulling Biden away from unscripted events.\n\nThere is little evidence to show that gaffes move poll numbers in any meaningful way. A look back at Donald Trump\u2019s rambling, error-saturated 2016 campaign (and nearly every day of his presidency since) shows how little gaffes register when voters assess whom to support at the ballot box. Biden\u2019s team knows that.\n\nBiden\u2019s senior team isn\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 concerned about misspeaks. They\u2019re concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to defend, or even convincingly explain, some of the more challenging aspects of his long legislative career.\n\nWhen confronted with concerns about Biden\u2019s strength as the Democratic standard bearer, party insiders turn to the comforting myth of \u201celectability.\u201d Joe Biden can appeal to centrists, the logic goes, even though Biden provably failed to ignite the passion of this much-fetishized voter bloc during his 1988 campaign or two decades later in 2008.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow the Biden-as-electable mythos is taking its first major blows. His campaign staff are already working the media to lower expectations for his performance in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Just yesterday, three senior Biden staffers floated the idea that Biden would remain the most electable Democrat even if he failed to win over Democrats in the first three major contests.\n\nIt\u2019s awfully early to lower expectations so dramatically, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether the coalition Biden has assembled can survive successive rounds of underperformance. For all of Biden\u2019s focus on his electability in a head-to-head matchup with Trump, no one seemed to ask if Biden was electable enough to survive the most diverse, talent-filled Democratic primary in modern memory.\n\nBiden\u2019s numbers are already softening as Elizabeth Warren rises to second place in Iowa on the back of an unapologetic progressive message. In New Hampshire, Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump doubles down on Dorian's threat to Alabama Buttigieg on Trump hurricane map: 'I feel sorry for the president' Human Rights Campaign, CNN to hold LGBTQ town hall with 2020 Democrats MORE has been wowing crowds and packing larger and larger barns, diners and convention halls with engaged listeners.

Misleading voters about his support for the Iraq War does. Momentarily forgetting you\u2019re in New Hampshire doesn\u2019t make Democrats in Concord question Joe Biden\u2019s credentials. Defending the ruinous 1994 Crime Bill even after its societal harm has become clear does.\n\nJoe Biden may reduce his gaffes by limiting his exposure and maintaining message discipline. Hiding his shortcomings as a legislator is a much more daunting task.\n\nShrugging off questions on school integration, the Hyde Amendment and the Iraq War might have worked for a stronger frontrunner in a less diverse primary. But the 2019 Democratic field doesn\u2019t look or sound or act like any before it. It is a more progressive, more demographically representative portrait of the American people than any primary field in our political history. Biden\u2019s struggle to grapple with this shift shows how ill-prepared he is to stand a thorough re-examination of his record.\n\nIn a Democratic primary field flush with accomplished, forward-looking talent, Democratic voters in the early primary states are already beginning to ask: Does Joe Biden represent me? If Biden\u2019s worrying polling average is any indication, Democrats aren\u2019t sure.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics.
