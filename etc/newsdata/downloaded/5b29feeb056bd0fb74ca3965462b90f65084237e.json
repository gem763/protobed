Netwealth co-managing director Michael Heine has previously told the Financial Review the company would absorb any costs stemming from the low rate environment before allowing end customers to face negative returns.\n\nBut notwithstanding the predictions of a major downsizing among advisers who are responsible for the vast bulk of its funds under management, Mr Heine insists Netwealth is better placed than other investment platforms and adviser-focused service providers to weather the storm.\n\n\"We\u2019re working very hard to make sure we are focused on the firms that are going to survive,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the money\n\nAs well as focusing its business development and sales pipeline on those practices who already meet the education requirements and are bullish on the industry\u2019s future, Netwealth is positioning itself to service some of the orphaned clients and their funds if and when their current advisers do retire.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of groups that are out there acquiring [other firms and client books] and are going to get bigger and bigger,\u201d Mr Heine said. \u201cSo the money and clients those exiting advisers look after is likely to be re-allocated to newer advisers or remaining firms. We think that\u2019s an opportunity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to identify those firms more likely to survive the disruption, Mr Heine is taking his cues from private equity-backed players like New York-based Focus Financial Partners and the AZ Next Generation Advisory business, run by former ANZ Wealth distribution chief Paul Barrett, both of whom are on the hunt for Australian financial advice firms with promising profit outlooks.\n\nThe entry of these capital investors gives Netwealth comfort that the financial advice market\u2019s future is promising, even though its size may be diminished in the near term.\n\n\u201cThe whole industry will be turning over and re-setting over the next three years,\u201d Mr Heine said. \u201cThen we will have seen who the winners and losers are.\u201d\n\nNetwealth clearly sees itself as being among the former.", "description": "As it officially enters the ASX 200, the investment platform says it isn\u2019t over-exposed to the troubled financial adviser market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_549%2C$y_75/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9037ac014104700cff3578051b93b07296b0c4d5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
