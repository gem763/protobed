So there is a clear link between the NBN and take up of digital technology -- and there is in turn a clear link between the take up of digital technology and productivity improvements.\"\n\nFletcher said there are currently 10.2 million premises that are able to connect to the NBN, but only 5.8 million have done so. He boasted this year, in a typical week, that the NBN is enabling connections for more than 49,000 premises, and each week, nearly 40,000 premises are signing up for an NBN service.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, NBN announced a new connectivity option, Network Extensions, that will allow organisations with infrastructure and devices that operate outside of residential or business premises locations to connect to the NBN through a retail service provider.\n\nIt will provide network services for traffic signals, traffic cameras, roadside emergency points, rail boom gates, street light controllers, certain types of CCTV, stand-alone ATMs, environmental sensors, and public transport infrastructure.\n\nNBN also released its second pricing review consultation paper earlier this week, which proposed three new plans at the top end of its pricing structure, all with lower upload speeds than its existing plans at those tiers.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Meanwhile, the NBN has been touted by the government as boosting Australia-wide productivity.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/19/07f8092d-e6a1-4c21-8d06-72188508a99b/thumbnail/770x578/555625efe84c61bd5b0b5b9bb9422b77/nbn-cover.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
