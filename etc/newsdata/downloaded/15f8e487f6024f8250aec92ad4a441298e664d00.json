The incinerator building also incorporates hiking and running trails, a street fitness gym and the world\u2019s highest outdoor climbing wall, an 85-metre \u201cnatural mountain\u201d complete with overhangs that rises the full height of the main structure.\n\nIn Copenhagen, green transformation goes hand-in-hand with job creation, a growing economy and a better quality of life Frank Jensen, lord mayor\n\nIt\u2019s all part of Copenhagen\u2019s plan to be net carbon-neutral by 2025. Even now, after a summer that saw wildfires ravage the Arctic Circle and ice sheets in Greenland suffer near-record levels of melt, the goal seems ambitious. In 2009, when the project was formulated, it was positively revolutionary.\n\n\u201cA green, smart, carbon-neutral city,\u201d declared the cover of the climate action plan, before detailing the scale of the challenge: 100 new wind turbines; a 20% reduction in both heat and commercial electricity consumption; 75% of all journeys to be by bike, on foot, or by public transport; the biogas-ification of all organic waste; 60,000 sq metres of new solar panels; and 100% of the city\u2019s heating requirements to be met by renewables.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People cycle in central Copenhagen.

There\u2019s still not a climate project anywhere else in the world that comes close.\n\nAnd, so far, it\u2019s working. CO2 emissions have been reduced by 42% since 2005, and while challenges around mobility and energy consumption remain (new technologies such as better batteries and carbon capture are being implemented), the city says it is on track to achieve its ultimate goal.\n\nProsaic but practical: unsexy ways cities can fight the climate crisis \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nMore significant still is that Copenhagen has achieved this while continuing to grow in traditional economic terms. Even as some commentators insist that nothing short of a total rethink of free-market economics and corporate structures is required to stave off global catastrophe, the Danish capital\u2019s carbon transformation has happened alongside a 25% growth in its economy over two decades. Copenhagen\u2019s experience will be a model for other world cities.\n\nThe sentiment that lies behind Arc\u2019s conception as a multi-use public good \u2013 \u201chedonistic sustainability\u201d \u2013 is echoed by Bo Asmus Kjeldgaard, former mayor of Copenhagen for the environment and the man originally tasked, back in 2010, with making the plan a reality.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Amager Resource Centre. Photograph: Gonzales Photo/Alamy\n\n\u201cWe combined life quality with sustainability and called it \u2018liveability\u2019,\u201d says Kjeldgaard, now CEO of his own climate adaptation company, Greenovation. \u201cWe succeeded in building a good narrative around this, one that everybody could believe in.\u201d\n\nThe idea was first floated in the late 1990s, when the newly elected Kjeldgaard had a vision of Copenhagen as the environmental capital of Europe. His enthusiasm ran into political intransigence, however, and despite some success, a lack of budget meant most of his work became \u201cjust another branding exercise \u2013 it was greenwashing\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re such a rich country \u2013 change should be easy for us Claus Nielsen, furniture maker and designer\n\nBut after stints as mayor of family and the labour market, and children and young people, he ended up back at environment in 2010 with renewed determination and, crucially, a broader mandate from the city council. \u201cI said: \u2018This time, we have to do it right,\u2019\u201d he recalls, \u201cso we made detailed, concrete plans for every area, set the carbon target, and demanded the money and the manpower to make it a reality.\u201d\n\nHe brought on board more than 200 stakeholders, from businesses to academia to citizen representatives, and helped them develop 22 specific business plans and 65 separate projects. So far the plan appears on track: there has been a 15% reduction in heat consumption, 66% of all trips in the city are now by bike, on foot or public transport, and 51% of heat and power comes from renewables.\n\nThe onus placed on ordinary Copenhageners to walk and cycle more, pay higher taxes (especially on cars) and put up with the inconvenience of infrastructure construction has generally been met with understanding and good grace. And while some people remain critical of the fact that Copenhagen airport is not factored into the CO2 calculations \u2013 it lies beyond the city\u2019s boundaries \u2013 and grumble about precise definitions and formulae, dissent has been rare.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Copenhagen airport is not factored into the CO2 calculations, which has drawn criticism. Photograph: Hjorth Henning/AP\n\nThis relative lack of nimbyism and carping about change can, says Frank Jensen, the city\u2019s lord mayor, be traced to longstanding political traditions.\n\n\u201cCaring for the environment and taking responsibility for society in general has been an integral part of the upbringing of many Danes,\u201d he says. \u201cMoreover, there is a general awareness that climate change now calls for immediate, ambitious and collective action.\u201d A 2018 survey by Concito, a thinktank, found that such action was a top priority for voters.\n\nJensen is keen to stress the cooperative nature of the plan and says \u201cour visions have to be grounded in the everyday lives of people to be politically feasible\u201d. Indeed, involving so many stakeholders, and allowing them to actively help shape both the ends and the means, has been key to the plan\u2019s success so far and the continued goodwill it enjoys. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to note that we [the authorities] cannot do this alone,\u201d says J\u00f8rgen Abildgaard, Copenhagen\u2019s executive climate programme director.\n\nMany businesses around the world have typically been reluctant to embrace sustainability when a dip in profits or inconvenience might be the result, but not in Copenhagen. Martin Manthorpe, director of strategy, business development and public affairs at NCC, one of Scandinavia\u2019s largest construction and industrial groups, was brought in early on by Abildgaard to represent industry on the municipality\u2019s climate panel, and to facilitate discussions with the wider business community. He thinks there are several reasons why.\n\n\u201cThe Danes have a trading mindset, meaning \u2018What will I have to sell tomorrow?\u2019 is just as important as \u2018What am I producing today?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, many big Danish companies are still ultimately family-owned, so the culture leans more towards long-term thinking.\u201d\n\nIt is, he says, natural for business to be concerned with issues around sustainability and be willing to endure short-term pain: \u201cTo do responsible, long-term business, you need to see yourself as part of the larger puzzle that is called \u2018society\u2019.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People in central Copenhagen take part in the Global Climate Strike on 20 September 2019.

We\u2019re told sustainability brings only benefits and we\u2019ve got no reason to be suspicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one would dare argue against the environment,\u201d says his friend Claus Nielsen, a furniture maker and designer. \u201cWe\u2019re such a rich country \u2013 change should be easy for us.\u201d Nielsen talks about how enlightened his kids are \u2013 \u201cmy 11-year-old daughter is now a flexitarian\u201d \u2013 and says that nowadays he mainly buys organic; Haugaard doesn\u2019t see a problem with getting rid of petrol cars (the whole country is aiming to be fossil fuel-free by 2050).\n\nAbove all, there\u2019s a belief that sustainability need not make the city poorer: that innovation and \u201cgreen growth\u201d can be lucrative in and of themselves. \u201cIn Copenhagen, green transformation goes hand-in-hand with job creation, a growing economy and a better quality of life,\u201d says Jensen. \u201cWe have also shown that it\u2019s possible to combine this transition with economic growth and market opportunities for businesses, and I think that other countries can learn from our example.\u201d\n\nBesides, as Jensen notes, there is little alternative, and even less time: \u201cNational states have failed to take enough responsibility, but cities have the power and will to create concrete solutions. We need to start accelerating their implementation \u2013 we need to act now.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Green growth and \u2018hedonistic sustainability\u2019 have helped keep the public on board as the Danish capital seeks to reach its goal by 2025 \u2013 and so far it\u2019s all going according to plan", "authors": ["Derek Robertson In Copenhagen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc96271984cffb2d7f531ac9fae6af5a790dcaf0/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05fbd6ffe3f48d8a54829662d4be580a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
