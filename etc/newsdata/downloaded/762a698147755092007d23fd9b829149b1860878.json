PBS is still one of the countries largest distribution platforms reaching a huge audience across all demographics, according to Burns.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the Upper West Side and Nob Hill, we get great ratings in Oklahoma and Arkansas and West Virginia and Alaska and not just for Country Music,\u201d he said.\n\nThe film Country Music is now broadcasting on PBS and the first four episodes are available via streaming on PBS online platforms. The final four episodes begin streaming September 22. The entire series will be available for six months.\n\nBurns said he\u2019s hitched his wagon to PBS but eventually his films will wind up on giant streaming platforms like Netflix (NFLX).\n\nCountry Music\u2019s heart breaking stories\n\n\n\n\n\nBurns\u2019 \u201cCountry Music\u201d chronicles the history of country music and includes stories about some of its greats like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton.\n\n\u201cWhen you find out why Dolly Parton wrote, \u2018I Will Always Love You\u2019 her version, which is fantastic, but doesn\u2019t have the crossover success of Whitney Houston\u2019s magnificent version, her\u2019s will soar past Whitney because you will understand the circumstances of how it went,\u201d said Burns.\n\nHe said the documentary is a story about the United States, \u201cIn which African-Americans are a central part. It\u2019s about class too, rising up from poverty\u201d and also about songwriting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a child of R&B and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and I knew the crossover folks like Emmylou Harris and Johnny Cash, but I had no idea the depth of this story. It\u2019s kind of a Russian novel of intertwined stuff about American creativity,\u201d he said.\n\nBurns said 99% of people want almost the exact same thing and his films capture that by answering one question, who are we as Americans. \u201cWhat I learned was first there\u2019s no them. There\u2019s only us.\u201d\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Documentary film director Ken Burns discusses his country music documentary and why PBS gives him more freedom than a streaming service would.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6OhpSRiQPj7milH4NFzljA--~B/aD0yMjg1O3c9MzE5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6f79f840-db03-11e9-ae3e-7ea807088842", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
