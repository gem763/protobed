The once-influential Spy was a casualty of the 1990s.\n\nAt MAD's peak in the early 1970s, its circulation was more than 2 million. People read it for both its pungent political humor and its deeply adolescent jokes.\n\nIn 2017, that number had reportedly dropped to 140,000.\n\nMAD isn't completely shutting down, but it will be radically downsized and changed.\n\nReaders will only be able to find the 67-year-old humor magazine at comic book stores and through subscriptions.\n\nAfter issue No. 10 this fall, there will no longer be new content, except for end-of-year specials, which will be all new. Starting with issue No. 11, the magazine will feature classic, best-of and nostalgic content, repackaged with new covers.", "description": "At MAD magazine's peak in the early 1970s, its circulation peaked at more than 2 million.
