They could pretty much have picked their preferred final score. It was 20-0 and halftime and 30-0 in the third quarter. The Patriots gave quarterback Tom Brady part of the fourth quarter off and coasted to a 30-14 triumph at Gillette Stadium to improve their record to 3-0.\n\nAntonio Brown says he\u2019s done with NFL, blasts Robert Kraft and Ben Roethlisberger\n\nBut it was a necessary exercise for the Patriots to take the next step after Friday\u2019s release of Brown, the seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver whose signing had been announced only 11 days earlier. And there are bigger remaining issues, especially after wide receiver Julian Edelman left Sunday\u2019s victory with what was called a chest injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s just part of football season,\u201d Brady said after the game. \u201cAttrition plays a part. ... It\u2019s just the nature of the sport. It\u2019s a tough sport.\u201d\n\nNo other NFL team is as singular in its focus as the Patriots are. No other team is as unwavering its football discipline. No other team is as ruthlessly competitive. That\u2019s why the Patriots are six-time Super Bowl champions with Belichick as their coach and Brady as their quarterback, even as the supporting cast of players around Brady changes constantly.\n\nBut Brown has become so disruptive that this was a unique challenge even for Belichick and the Patriots. Belichick cut short a news conference Friday, before Brown\u2019s release, because of a string of questions about Brown. A team official and Belichick had done the same thing at a news conference the previous week because of unrelenting questions from media members about Brown.\n\nThat\u2019s extremely rare for Belichick, who usually is able to fend off unwanted questions by the media with his dour nonanswers. One veteran Belichick watcher could recall it happening only one other time during his Patriots tenure. This is a coach and an organization, remember, that endured the Spygate and Deflategate scandals. For the normally unflappable Belichick to become so flappable is telling.\n\nIt is Belichick who is said to have wanted to sign Brown, following Brown\u2019s release by the Oakland Raiders, for football reasons. Kraft did not stand in the way of what was, at that point, a football decision. When Brown\u2019s spot on the roster became more than a football issue with the emergence of accusations by two women of rape, sexual assault and intimidation, team officials began their deliberations about the possibility of releasing Brown while the NFL conducted its investigation and contemplated the prospect of placing him on paid leave via the commissioner\u2019s exempt list.\n\nThe Patriots kept Brown on the roster for one game before the team\u2019s decision-makers came to a consensus Friday, after the news of the second accuser and the texts, and released him. There remains a potential fight with Brown and the NFL Players Association over the guaranteed money in Brown\u2019s contract. The deal included a $9 million signing bonus, the first $5 million of which was to be paid Monday, and also contained contract language prohibiting Brown from criticizing the team or its ownership and from acting in a manner to undermine the public\u2019s respect for the team.\n\nThe Patriots clearly were displeased about Brown\u2019s Twitter reference to Kraft, who is challenging the misdemeanor charges against him in court in Florida and has not been convicted. He also has not been disciplined by the NFL, with the criminal case still pending while the prosecution appeals a crucial ruling in Kraft\u2019s favor that suppressed video evidence. The Patriots, through a spokesman, declined to respond before the game to Brown\u2019s social-media comments.\n\nBut there also are football implications to Brown\u2019s quick exit. The depth of Brady\u2019s pass-catching corps was an issue in training camp, especially given the offseason retirement of tight end Rob Gronkowski. But then wide receiver Josh Gordon was reinstated by the NFL from his latest suspension under the substance abuse policy and Brown was added. Suddenly, Brady appeared to have a surplus at wideout with Edelman, Gordon and Brown.\n\nHow Antonio Brown\u2019s deal with the Patriots dissolved in a matter of days\n\nWithout Brown, the wide receiver spot becomes a question mark again. Edelman left the field during the final minute of the first half Sunday after a hard fall when being tackled. He initially was called questionable to return before later being ruled out for the remainder of the game. If the injury is significant, that\u2019s a major problem for Brady and the Patriots.\n\nThe state of the injury-depleted offensive line also is an issue. But Brady is playing well, and finished with 306 yards and two touchdowns Sunday. Belichick provided no update on Edelman\u2019s injury status during a postgame news conference in which he cited \u201csome good things\u201d but also \u201ca lot of things we can work on.\u201d Belichick was back to being Belichick, clearly.\n\nThe coach is as resourceful as ever. The defense is very good. The Patriots didn\u2019t allow a touchdown this season until the Jets scored in the third quarter Sunday on the recovery of a muffed punt.\n\nThe Patriots are not the team that they could have been with Brown if things had worked out with him. The rest of the NFL now has a chance, albeit perhaps a slim one. They are still the Patriots, after all, and they were right back to doing their thing Sunday.", "description": "New England's receiving corps, which looked to be a strength just last week, is once again a question mark.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ADMMXJW5NEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
