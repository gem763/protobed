Their matters have been before the courts and they remain in custody at the moment.\n\nReports said the drug bust was part of an operation called \u201cBullseye\u201d that aimed to stop cross-boundary drug trafficking, according to Travel Pulse.\n\nLunga Ngqengelele, a spokesperson from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), said that although the names of the flight attendants have not been released, their families have been notified of the arrests.\n\n\u201cThe South African consulate-general in Hong Kong is rendering the necessary consular assistance and Dirco is also in contact with their families in South Africa. Due to consular privacy, the department is not in a position to release their names or any further details,\u201d Ngqengelele concluded.\n\nTlali declined to comment further regarding the case but did note that \u201cSAA would equally like to emphasize that the airline remains intolerant of any criminality by any of its employees. The course of action the company may pursue will be informed by its policies and the outcome of the cases.\u201d", "description": "Two South African Airways (SAA) flight attendants were arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle $3 million worth of cocaine into Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/airplane-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
