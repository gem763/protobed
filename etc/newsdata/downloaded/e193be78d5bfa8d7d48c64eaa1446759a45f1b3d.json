I want to be an ally and I will be an ally for Quebec.\"\n\nLepage pointed out Singh is the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Canada and asked his perspective on the Trudeau blackface photos.\n\n\"I've fought against racism with my hands,\" Singh said. \"Not everyone is able to fight back.\"\n\nHe said Trudeau's decision to wear blackface was bad judgment.\n\n\"For many people it brings up memories of things that happened in their lives,\" Singh said.\n\nWhen asked about the law formerly known as Bill 21, which would prevent public employees from wearing religious symbols \u2014 such as Singh's turban \u2014 at work, the NDP leader assured Lepage he's aware of Quebec's \"competence\" in that file, but that he's against laws that divide the population.\n\n\"I think the job of a politician is to find ways to bring people together,\" Singh said.\n\nHowever, he said an NDP government would not join legal challenges to the law.\n\nSingh repeated that he doesn't think Bernier should take part in the televised leaders debates.\n\nHe said it was a difficult decision to make, since he believes in free expression. But Bernier goes too far.\n\n\"There's a moment that it jumps from exchange of ideas to promotion of hateful and divisive ideas that increase tensions,\" Singh said. \"We must not give a platform to a person who divides the population.\"\n\nIn regard to the environment, Singh said his party has several proposals ideas to create jobs while reducing emissions, such as ecological renovations for buildings.\n\nHe said it was a bad decision for the Liberal government to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that an NDP government would not go ahead with its expansion.\n\nAfter the Orange Crush\n\nSingh wants to at least hold his party's Quebec seats. NDP support has slumped since Jack Layton's Orange Crush in 2011, when the party took 59 of the province's 78 seats.\n\nCBC's poll tracker suggests the party has, on average, only 8.8 per cent of the vote in the province, while the Greens had 8.7 per cent as of Sunday evening.\n\nTout le monde en parle, a highly popular weekly talk show, has become a key campaign stop for politicians seeking to sway the province's francophones.\n\nThe NDP platform for the province promises more powers on portfolios including the environment, language, immigration and justice.\n\nSingh says he wants his party to be \"an ally to Quebec and the French language.\"", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh appeared on Quebec's flagship talk show on Sunday, saying he shares Quebecers' values on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293523.1569204859!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jagmeet-singh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
