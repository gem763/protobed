He gets to call a Browns game when NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d travels to Cleveland for the first time since 2008.\n\nWhen he was starting out as an analyst, it seemed like Browns games were all that Collinsworth was doing.\n\nBefore Collinsworth became a 16-time Sports Emmy winner and regarded as one of the top analysts in any sport, he was a struggling broadcaster working his way up the depth chart at NBC.\n\n\u201cWhatever the worst game was, I was on it and thank goodness I was,\u201d Collinsworth said when recounting his early days with NBC. \u201cThe idea I am still doing games after all my early screw ups is amazing,\u201d\n\nDuring Collinsworth\u2019s first four seasons with NBC, 15 of his first 38 games involved the Browns. He has since had them only three times since the start of the 1995 season.\n\nCollinsworth retired in 1989 after an eight-year career with the Cincinnati Bengals. He quickly transitioned into media, hosting a sports talk show on radio in Cincinnati along with reporting for HBO\u2019s \u201cInside the NFL\u201d while attending law school.\n\nIn 1990, he became one of the co-hosts of \u201cInside the NFL\u201d and was hired by NBC for four games. Collinsworth was paired with Jim Donovan, the longtime sports director at Cleveland\u2019s NBC affiliate.\n\nThe first game they did was in Buffalo when the Bills hosted the Colts. To say Collinsworth came in blind might be an understatement.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what I was doing. It\u2019s not like they give you a class,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid Michaels was my producer. I had two manila folders with the names of the offense and defense on them. That was the extent of my getting ready for the game.\u201d\n\nMichaels called Terry Bradshaw, who was calling games for CBS at the time. Bradshaw sent the boards overnight he used to prepare for games, which helped give Collinsworth an example of how to do pregame preparations.\n\nCollinsworth has long appreciated Donovan for his patience that first year and still refers to him as \u201cmy original dance partner\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe would help me with notes and things to say,\u201d Collinsworth said. \u201cHe knew all the players and I was hollering and making stuff up.\u201d\n\nNBC was also adjusting to its new analyst, especially when it came to the spelling of his last name. A graphic before a game at Cleveland in 1990 had \u201cCris Collingsworth.\u201d\n\nDonovan, who has been the Browns\u2019 radio voice since 1999, said what he appreciated about Collinsworth was that he wasn\u2019t afraid to give his opinion.\n\n\u201cHe spoke his mind and didn\u2019t have any fear,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of guys would come from the field to the booth and would be very guarded and not critical of a player or coach. He called the game the way he saw it, which was refreshing.\u201d\n\nCollinsworth also wasn\u2019t afraid to speak his mind when it came to asking for a raise from NBC. He said he remembered a couple of the airline tickets to get to games cost more than what he made for the game and he tried to get them to double his salary.\n\nNBC not only didn\u2019t give a Collinsworth a raise, it didn\u2019t use him for any games in 1991. NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol brought him back in 1992 for NFL games and also Notre Dame home games.\n\nAl Michaels, Collinsworth\u2019s current partner at NBC, said he heard one of Collinsworth\u2019s early broadcasts and knew he had potential.\n\nHe said one of Collinsworth\u2019s strengths is that he immersed himself in how a broadcast works from the ground up.\n\n\u201cCris has never been in the ex-jock business, he has been in the broadcast business,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cHe knows what everyone on the crew does and wanted to discover the inner workings. He sees the game perfectly. He can look at four different things going on during a play and be able to break it down.\u201d\n\nCollinsworth acknowledges it took him a couple of seasons to find his stride as an analyst, but he said Donovan deserves credit for helping him. The two are likely to get together before the Rams-Browns game Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe was great in setting me up and what to say. Everyone has great memories of their first dance partner,\u201d Collinsworth said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cris Collinsworth will get to experience a rarity this week.
