You\u2019ve now got an index to track.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nIndex provider MSCI has launched a new set of thematic indexes for investors looking to focus their exposure on major trends such as millennials or disruptive technology which it expects to shape society and the economy for decades to come.\n\nEquity indexing is big business with providers such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, Nasdaq, S&P and Dow Jones jostling for market share in an investment landscape where replicating lists of securities compiled along certain criteria has become increasingly popular and a benchmark for active investors.\n\nTraditionally, index providers have sliced and diced stocks along sectors, size or geographic lines, but thematic indexing has emerged as a theme in recent years.\n\nMSCI launched its first four thematic indexes with little fanfare as a test balloon late last year. However, those themes ranging from robotics to ageing society were \u201cnot very original\u201d and addressing mostly already well established trends, said Stephane Mattatia, head of index products EMEA at MSCI.\n\nNow MSCI is ready to push out the boat a bit - identifying five new ones in a pun to help investors catch an upside from a demographic and technological shift.\n\nApart from disruptive technology and millennials - referring to those born between 1980 and mid-1990s - the new batch of indexes includes smart cities, digital economy and future mobility.\n\n\u201cWe are partnering up with external experts, which are not from the financial sphere but experts in their own fields,\u201d said Mattatia, adding MSCI had worked with author and strategic advisor Lukas Neckermann on the mobility and smart cities index.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for us to make sure that the theme is relevant for the economy and secondly it is difficult for us to find the right parameters for the theme.\u201d\n\nMSCI isn\u2019t the only index provider trying to ride the thematic indexing wave: Nasdaq launched a number of artificial intelligence and robotics indexes in recent years. Indexes for clean energy and ESG indexes are proliferating.\n\nFor MSCI, choosing index components is a language-based process.\n\nOnce a trend has been singled out, MSCI will identify half a dozen defining seed words - for the millennials benchmark, the list contained the likes of \u201cnew generation\u201d or \u201cnew technology\u201d.\n\nUsing those seed words, MSCI derives a list of around 50 keywords, which in this case contains the likes of \u201cshared economy\u201d, \u201corganic food\u201d or \u201csport\u201d.\n\nThe number of word matches in company results\u2019 filings plus other filters provide a score which helps decide index membership, Mattatia explained.\n\nMSCI\u2019s millennial index contains 601 constituents and among the top ones are Apple APPL.O, Microsoft (MSFT.O), Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Netflix NTFLX.O and Paypal (PYPL.O).", "description": "Want to invest in the habits of thirtysomethings?
