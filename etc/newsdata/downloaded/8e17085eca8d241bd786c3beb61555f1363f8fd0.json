Even to this day.\n\nWhen the former TV news anchor spoke at Georgetown University at an event titled \u201cThe Healing Power of Communication\u201d in August, 2019, she said she wished she had talked more to her late husband, Jay Monahan, about his impending death before he succumbed to colon cancer at 42 in 1998.\n\n\u201cIt was just terrible,\u201d Couric said. \u201cAfter nine months of trying desperately to figure out some way to manage it, he lost his battle \u2014 and it was devastating.\u201d\n\nShe explained that she\u2019s writing her memoir and recently had drinks with Monahan\u2019s two doctors to \u201crevisit\u201d those days.\n\n\u201cI told them how guilty I felt about so many things about Jay\u2019s illness and that we never really discussed, you know, even entertained the idea that he might die. I was so afraid to give up hope, and make him give up hope, that we never discussed the alternative, which I really regret,\u201d Couric said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: \u2018Netiquette\u2019 tips for responding to death and grief on social media\n\nFor example, she said, \u201cHe never wrote a letter to our girls\u201d \u2014 daughters Ellie, 28, and Carrie, 23.\n\nThe fine line between maintaining hope and offering a reality check is tricky territory, said Dr. John Marshall, oncologist and director of Georgetown\u2019s Ruesch Center for the Cure of Gastrointestinal Cancers, who was interviewing Couric at the event.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we enter that world, we see the light go out,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like doing that. So the balance of being on point and brutal, if you will, and factual, versus that maintaining of hope\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be a dilemma,\u201d Couric responded. \u201cFor me, I erred on the other side \u2014 trying to protect Jay from information he had a right to hear.\u201d\n\nSo, which is more important: knowing the reality of your situation or maintaining hope?\n\nAlso read: Life lessons of the rich and famous: Why you need an estate plan\n\nMost of us don\u2019t want to hear bad news, especially this kind of bad news. And most of us don\u2019t want to talk about it, or plan for it. And yet, in recent years, the thinking about this is beginning to change as our aging population starts changing its views of death. More hope, less grim reaper?\n\nIs dying about control?\n\nHBO\u2019s documentary \u201cAlternate Endings: Six New Ways to Die in America,\u201d released in August, explores some of the ways Americans are finding meaning as life ends. And all of the ways show that the key is taking control of as much, or as best possible, of the end of life.\n\nThe documentary includes new types of urns, personalized obituaries, eco-friendly caskets, drive-through funeral viewing, living wakes (which force people to say things to each other while still alive), space burials, green burials (in which the body is wrapped in biodegradable material in a shallow grave), memorials in an underwater \u201creef vault\u201d and a seriously ill man who opts to take advantage of physician-assisted death to end his life peacefully and surrounded by family.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a $16 billion U.S. funeral industry that is being disrupted.\n\n\u201cThe baby boomer generation has had a greater degree of control over their lives than any other generation before them,\u201d \u201cAlternate Endings\u201d filmmaker Matthew O\u2019Neill told Axios in an Aug. 10, 2019, article. \u201cIt\u2019s because every topic that\u2019s taboo \u2014 be it sex, be it drugs \u2014 it\u2019s all on television and it\u2019s all being talked about. And death is the last taboo.\u201d\n\nIs dying about hope?\n\nThe film was released around the same time as the book \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to the End: Practical Advice for Living Life and Facing Death\u201d by Dr. BJ Miller and Shoshana Berger was on The Washington Post\u2019s Top 10 best sellers list. The book includes practical advice (take your favorite quilt to the hospital) and wisdom (\u201clove\u201d is what matters most in the end).\n\nRead: How to make sure your estate plan won\u2019t cause a family fight\n\nMiller, too, addresses the idea of hope.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe that we, as a species, will do better if we come to terms with our mortality earlier in life,\u201d he said in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show Aug. 5, 2019. \u201cGet used to exercising hope within the framework of life being short and precious.\u201d\n\nBoomers do seem to be getting better about not only facing death, but also embracing it. The Conversation Project, Death over Dinner project, Death Cafes \u2014 all have been propelling us towards a more open view of death for nearly a decade. Remember how Swedish Death Cleaning became \u201ca thing\u201d two years ago?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s about hope and control\n\nDe-stigmatizing death. Having a \u201cgood death.\u201d Those are the goals.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Academy of Medical Sciences installed \u201cThe Departure Lounge\u201d in a London mall in May. It was designed to look like a departure lounge at an airport, complete with all that baggage we have, with the idea of getting people to talk about death. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we say the \u2018D\u2019 word?\u201d the website asks.\n\nPackaged versions of the pop-up installation are now being offered to community groups across the U.K. to start a national conversation about death and dying.\n\nAs a student in Georgetown University\u2019s new Aging & Health master\u2019s program, I was treated to a guest lecture in our first semester by Becky Hsu, an assistant professor at Georgetown, who spoke to us about the Chinese concept of a \u201cgood death.\u201d\n\nHsu explained that she had spent time in China with a woman who had already bought the outfit she wants to wear for her death: pants, shirt, shoes, earrings and purse.\n\nThe woman has an embroidered pillow picked out for her head to rest on. She had a portrait taken that will be displayed at her funeral. All of these things are neatly wrapped in a cardboard box that she proudly shows off to friends and family.\n\nExplained Hsu, \u201cIt\u2019s a happy thing.\u201d", "description": "Some recent, intriguing examples of how the conversation about death is evolving.", "authors": ["Ann Oldenburg"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS988_na_dea_ZG_20191009135505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
