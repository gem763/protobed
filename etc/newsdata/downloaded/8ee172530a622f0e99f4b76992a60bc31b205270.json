It\u2019s very hard for a serial drama to hold attention at the best of times so for a scene of such length to captivate the UK in such a way was a big ask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut captivate Katie did \u2013 as fans have been racing to social media to praise her. Although it sounds like we all need to top up on the tissues we have gone through tonight.\n\nOh my god #Corrie has well and truly hit me in the heart. @KatiexMcGlynn deserves every award going for her performance. My heart sincerely goes out to everyone in sinead\u2019s situation\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Kirst-Lou\u2728\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9c (@kirst_louisexxo) October 24, 2019\n\n@KatiexMcGlynn @LisaGeorgeActor @andywhyment81 @Rob_Mallard outstanding performance from the actors, I\u2019m sitting in floods of tears watching tonight\u2019s episode of @itvcorrie lord help me tomorrow night #Corrie at its best \u2014 kelly carson (@kelly_tink1979) October 24, 2019\n\nI'm 45. I'm pretty rational (I think!), and reasonably intelligent (I hope!). I can differentiate between a character and an actor. Why, then, am I weeping for #Sinead?\n\nPossibly because this is the finest performance, and these are the most moving scenes in #Corrie's history. \u2014 John Hughes (@hughesjg) October 24, 2019\n\nSuch a powerful episode of #Corrie tonight #Sinead was incredible and heartfelt and it will be even harder as the week passes xxxxx well done to all concerned \u2014 Debbie (@xdebbiej23x) October 24, 2019\n\nSuch an emotional episode brilliantly portrayed by @KatiexMcGlynn so sincere. You just know she will be in so much more, such a talented actress will miss her in the street too #corrie \u2014 Dominic | D E A N \ud83d\udcf8 (@ddphotograph) October 24, 2019\n\nTomorrow night sees an hour long episode devoted entirely to the Sinead storyline \u2013 and will capture her final hours as she passes away. They promise to be some of the most heartbreaking scenes in the soap\u2019s history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Katie has thanked fans for their ongoing support over the storyline, tweeting: \u2018Your beautiful messages mean everything..I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch Sinead\u2019s final days if it wasn\u2019t for the support of every single one of you. I\u2019m going to miss Sinead Tinker so much, but I am so humbled to hear we\u2019re doing this storyline justice.\u2019 (sic)\n\n\"The first time I set eyes on you it was like I was coming home\"\u2026 \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc94 Our hearts are breaking for Sinead and Daniel.#Corrie Visit: https://t.co/P5cXcT73S3 if you have been affected by Sinead's story. pic.twitter.com/GKb6AhLrVk \u2014 Coronation Street (@itvcorrie) October 24, 2019\n\nKatie has been in the role for six years and the end of the storyline marks a devastating new journey for Daniel.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Devastating scenes.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sinead-Tinker-in-Coronation-Street-213d_1571948473.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
