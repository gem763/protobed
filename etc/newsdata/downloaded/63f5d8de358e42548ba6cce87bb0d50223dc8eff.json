But first, a couple of things.\n\nReader Matt in VA, a stalwart Trump backer who really does hate with the hate of a thousand million suns what he calls \u201cRespectable Conservatism\u201d (= any conservatism that criticizes Trump) so much that it colors everything, comments on why people like him feel the way they do:\n\nIt\u2019s emotional. Trump voters think that movement/respectable conservatives are worse, and more, than they are *traitors.* It is an intensity of feeling like how Dante put traitors at the very center of Hell. Trump voters feel *betrayed* by the Republican Party. It is emotional and connected to the way people feel about those deep and mythopoetic topics, blood and soil. The media dropped story after story after story after story, wall-to-wall-to-wall, about Trump\u2019s corruption and self-dealing in 2015 and 2016. It didn\u2019t make a difference then, and it won\u2019t now. This is about matters of the heart. Movement conservatism/respectable conservatism has lost people in a way that is emotional; and other people, people like me, hate it in a way that colors everything. It would not be unfair or false to say that this political question touches the very way we feel about our own fathers.\n\nSimilarly, back in 2017, the left-liberal Swarthmore professor Tim Burke wrote about \u201cTrump As Desecration\u201d. Excerpt:\n\nWhy are so many of us feeling deep distress each day, sometimes over what seem like relatively trivial or incidental information (like Trump pushing aside heads of state?) Because Trump is sacrilege. Trump is the Piss Christ of liberals and leftists. His every breath is a bb-gun shot through a cathedral window, bacon on the doorstep of a mosque, the explosion of an ancient Buddha statue. He offends against the notion that merit and hard work will be rewarded. Against the idea that leadership and knowledge are necessary partners. Against deep assumptions about the dignity of self-control. Against a feeling that leaders should at least pretend to be more dedicated to their institutions and missions than themselves. Against the feeling that consequential decisions should be performed as consequential. Against the feeling that a man should be ashamed of sexual predation and assault if caught on tape exalting it. Against the sense that anyone who writes or speaks in the public sphere is both responsible for what they\u2019ve said and should have to reconcile what they\u2019ve said in the past with what they\u2019re doing in the present. These are emotional commitments before they are things we would defend as substantive, reasoned propositions. They\u2019re interwoven into how many of us inhabit social class and working life, but sometimes spill over both class and work to connect us with unlike people who nevertheless have similar expectations about leaders and public figures. Even when we intellectually understand that our sense of the sacred in civic and public life may be dysfunctionally entangled in stifling technocratic arrogance or neoliberal visions of governmentality, even when we believe ourselves to be open to a more carnivalesque or improvisational mode of public leadership, we still have very deep feelings about what\u2019s proper and improper, righteous and demonic, sanitary and repellant. And Trump is violating every intuition, every deep reservoir of feeling we have about how one ought to be a man, a leader, a symbol of our national identity. We are not distracted when we respond to those feelings. In fact, we might be better off to articulate our responses as feelings, as intense and profound and utterly righteous feelings.\n\nI encountered that Burke piece via a great 2017 New Atlantis essay by Alan Jacobs, in which he attempted to explain campus wokeness as a form of myth. I can\u2019t do justice to this essay by quoting it at length here. Let me just quote this from the beginning, where Jacobs talks about the intractability of campus protests:\n\nThe problem lies in a failure to grasp the true nature of the students\u2019 position. If we are going to understand that position, we will need to draw on intellectual sources quite other than those typically invoked. What is required of us is the study of myth \u2014 and not in any pejorative or dismissive sense, but in the sense of an ineradicable element of human consciousness. In his book The Presence of Myth, first published in English translation in 1989, the Polish philosopher Leszek Ko\u0142akowski divides our civilization into two \u201ccores.\u201d This is his term for two cognitive, social, and ethical networks, \u201ctwo different sources of energy active in man\u2019s conscious relation to the world.\u201d One of these cores is \u201ctechnological,\u201d the other \u201cmythical.\u201d The term \u201ctechnological core\u201d is potentially misleading. Ko\u0142akowski is speaking of something broader than what we usually mean by \u201ctechnological,\u201d something influenced by Martin Heidegger\u2019s understanding. To Heidegger, and therefore I think to Ko\u0142akowski, technology is not the product of science; rather, science is the product of a \u201ctechnological enframing.\u201d Technology, on this view, is not a set of methods or inventions but a stance toward the world that is instrumental and manipulative, in relatively neutral senses of those words. The technological core is analytical, sequential, and empirical. Another way to put this is to say that what belongs to the technological core is what we find to hand: whatever occupies the lifeworld we share, and is therefore subject to our manipulation and control, and to debates about what it is and what might be done with it. To this core belong instrumental and discursive reason, including all the sciences and most forms of philosophy \u2014 everything that reckons with the possible uses of human power to shape ourselves and our environment. The technological core undergirds and produces the phenomena we typically refer to as technological. The \u201cmythical core\u201d of civilization, by contrast, describes that aspect of our experience \u201cnot revealed by scientific questions and beliefs.\u201d It encompasses the \u201cnonempirical unconditioned reality\u201d of our experience, that which is not amenable to confirmation or disconfirmation. As will become clearer below, the mythical core describes our most fundamental relation to the world. It is our metaphysical background, the elements prior to our manipulation and control. For Ko\u0142akowski, the failure to distinguish between the mythical and technological cores leads to a failure to understand many social trends and events. Ko\u0142akowski brackets the question of whether \u201cnonempirical unconditioned reality\u201d actually exists \u2014 that is, of whether metaphysics is fictional. He is interested, rather, in the impulse toward connecting with such a reality, which he says is persistent in human civilization, though it takes many forms. He also wants to understand this mythical core on its own terms. But this understanding can be difficult, for our society \u201cwishes to include myth in the technological order, that is \u2026 it seeks justification for myth.\u201d And the only way to seek justification for myth is to analyze it into components and reassemble them in a logical sequence. That is to say, myth can only be justified by ceasing to be myth: The Gospel phrase, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life,\u201d appears to an eye accustomed to rudimentary logical distinctions a jumble of words justified at best as metaphor translatable into several distinct utterances: \u201cI am offering you proper directives,\u201d \u201cI proclaim the truth,\u201d and \u201cIf you obey me I guarantee that you shall have eternal life,\u201d and so on. In fact, these sorts of conjectured metaphors are literal, do not demand to be understood and to be translated into the separate languages of values and information. One can participate in mythical experience only with the fullness of one\u2019s personality, in which the acquisition of information and the absorption of directives are inseparable. All names which participators in myths have given to their participation \u2014 \u201cillumination\u201d or \u201cawakening\u201d or such like \u2014 refer to the complete acts of entry into the mythical order; all distinctions of desire, understanding, and will in relation to these global acts is a derivative intellectual reconstruction. This description is deeply insightful, useful to reflection on many cultural phenomena. But here we need only observe that it helps to explain a great deal of what\u2019s happening on certain American college campuses these days.\n\nPlease do read the entire essay. It\u2019s very rewarding.\n\nBorrowing from Kolakowski\u2019s two categories \u2014 the Technological and the Mythological \u2014 Jacobs concludes that our society has moved from one kind of conflict (Technological vs. Mythological) to a clash of mythologies.\n\nTo go deep into this point, I highly recommend this 2018 essay from Areo analyzing Social Justice as a form of religion. It\u2019s incredibly illuminating, in that it shows how the tenets of Social Justice ideology are held by believers as outside of rational examination. To try to submit them to rational examination and debate is to subject them to demythologizing \u2014 and that is what the SJWs fiercely reject. As James Lindsay writes in that essay:\n\nIdentities in Social Justice are understood mythologically by being reinvented as ideologies\u2014including whiteness, blackness, and masculinity\u2014established in (\u201cauthentic\u201d) expressions of lived experience and defined according to the articles of faith of applied postmodernism. As such, they are not to be reasoned with, and they cannot be disagreed with or challenged \u201cwithout tearing holes in the web and leaving it dangling and useless.\u201d This is where you should check back with that bookmark about the totalizing understanding of social construction with regard to gender (and even sex), which should make it clear that social (and critical) constructivism is a part of the mythological core of Social Justice. As explained by Ko\u0142akowski, \u201cOne can participate in mythical experience only with the fullness of one\u2019s personality, in which the acquisition of information and the absorption of directives are inseparable.\u201d This can be taken as a reliable sign that mythological thinking in service to sacrosanct ideas is taking place.\n\nIt strikes many of us conservatives (and old-school liberals) as bizarre, hysterical, and manipulative when SJWs react to skeptical questioning of their claims with some version of, \u201cYou are trying to debate my right to exist!\u201d But as Kolakowski et al. would say, that\u2019s because we outsiders are trying to subject mythological knowledge to technocratic analysis. Since the Enlightenment, generally, and certainly since the 19th century, Christians have had to get accustomed to our beliefs treated not as facts, but as myth. SJWs react to the same thing, when applied to their core beliefs, with the fervor of a fundamentalist mob. Those who challenge them are not just wrong, they\u2019re evil. They\u2019re blasphemous.\n\nThe paradigmatic example of the futility of employing technocratic means to combat mythological fervor is poor Prof. Nicholas Christakis attempting to reason with the SJW mob on the grounds at Yale. Remember this, from 2015?:\n\nNo matter how patiently he tried to engage the students with discursive reason, it didn\u2019t work. They were operating from different cores.\n\nThere are two basic reasons, I think, why liberals fail to appreciate the challenge from these SJW radicals.\n\nFirst, they assume that because these students are usually secular, that their orientation towards their cause is not religious. Liberals have it in their minds that only Religious Right people are irrational. They let their guard down around SJWs, thinking that the SJWs are technologically oriented (in the Kolakowskian sense), when in fact they\u2019re mythological.\n\nSecond, the SJWs advocate for causes that liberals generally support: equality, diversity, and so on. It\u2019s easy to see why liberals in positions of authority capitulate to these tirades from left-wing students, whereas if they were coming from the right, they would not tolerate it for a second. Liberals, especially those in power, may feel guilty about their \u201cprivilege,\u201d and feel that they are not sufficiently committed to the causes of racial justice, gay rights, feminism, and so forth. \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity.\u201d\n\nSJWs are conquering institutions everywhere, none as thoroughly, or as consequentially, as the university. They have succeeded in causing institutions to treat their beliefs as knowledge, writes James Lindsay in that Areo essay. More:\n\nSocial Justice is an application of postmodern philosophy, we must remember. That means that Social Justice is a moral tribe whose central fascination is power and how it can shape society. And its agenda has never been secret: it is openly to remake society according to its aims and \u201ctheories.\u201d This means that Social Justice is a collection of moral tribes, whose primary agenda is its own institutionalization, and they\u2019ve made the universities not only into their cathedrals but also, in something of an ironic throwback, into their seminaries. By seeking to conquer educational institutions first, Social Justice has effected a social and cultural coup that religious hardliners have only been able to dream about for most of the past century.\n\nEmphasis mine. In an advanced, secular, technological society like ours, capturing the educational institutions really is capturing the highest ground. Everyone who will be moving into leadership positions in every other institutions will first pass through university \u2014 and that means they will be indoctrinated into the \u201cfaith system\u201d (Lindsay\u2019s term) of Social Justice. Many readers who work in media or in corporate America can tell you that Social Justice is already taken as fact within those environments. The New York Times, the most important journalistic institution in America, is facing a civil war within its ranks, between old school liberals in higher ranks, and younger reporters and editors coming from colleges that have inculcated them with the SJW gospel. Using the Kolakowski model, older journalists were trained to consider journalism as a craft within the Technological core; the younger ones see it as part of the Mythological core.\n\nSo, what does this have to do with David French and Sohrab Ahmari?\n\nFrench, as you\u2019ll recall, is a conservative Evangelical lawyer who believes that the classical liberal system we have now offers us enough resources to fight against left-liberalism\u2019s excesses.\n\nSohrab Ahmari is the journalist who believes that French\u2019s approach is too polite, and that the right needs to fight harder, with gloves off.\n\nSeen through Kolakowski\u2019s framework, we can say that French is applying technological methods to a mythological challenge. And this is reasonable, given that the liberal order is a Technological one.\n\nBut liberalism, as we know, is in crisis. More and more people on the left and right are losing faith in the fundaments of classical liberalism (see Deneen\u2019s Why Liberalism Failed). If you read the James Lindsay essay, you\u2019ll understand better why this is happening with young people in this post-Christian society. Here\u2019s an excerpt in which he comments on a Jonathan Rauch book:\n\nWithout getting too far into the details of Rauch\u2019s argument\u2014which insists that people feel that the Enlightenment liberal values and norms of Modernity are a bit too callous and dry in these regards to constitute a human cultural staple\u2014these complaints \u201cspeak less to liberal science\u2019s badness than to its completeness.\u201d In short, people often perceive them to fall short in speaking to our deeply human needs for wonder, purpose, morality, mythological interpretation, and shared belief. Thus, it should be sufficiently clear to conclude that what he calls \u201cskeptical faith\u201d makes it difficult for people to meet the precise needs premodern constructs like religion and their attendant mythologies exist to fill. These dissatisfactions spawned a new postmodern anti-Enlightenment project as a reaction to and rejection of the great, sweeping \u201cmetanarratives\u201d of Modernity that so plainly failed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rather than attempting to go backwards and linking arms with premodernists and their religions, however, the postmodernists recognized and accepted the hardest truth of the Enlightenment: God really is dead. With it, they seem to have adopted the bleak nihilism the premodernists consistently warned would come of such a conclusion, should it be embraced. Postmodern faith is therefore not like premodern faith, but it is still faith. In Social Justice, for instance, it still looks to the assurance of things hoped for, seeing itself as inexorably on the \u201cright side of history.\u201d It is also the conviction of things not seen.\n\nFrench believes that Christian faith and conservative principles can exist peaceably within modernity, which is to say, within the liberal order established by the Enlightenment. Ahmari does not and, as a right-of-center Catholic, wants to fight for an order that is built on pre-Enlightenment principles. SJWs, as postmodernists, are trying to create an order based on considering left-wing ideological beliefs as if they bore the force of metaphysical truth.\n\nIf current trends continue, though, SJWs will have conquered the institutions that produce lawyers \u2014 and may have already done so. The outward forms may remain liberal, but the core beliefs of those who administer the system will have become illiberal. This takeover of the courts by Social Justice may be hard to see, because all other institutions will have moved in the same direction. Anyway, it is difficult to grasp how core institutions of liberal democracy can remain intact if those who administer and populate them are no longer committed to classical liberal principles, but rather have gone over to the religion of Social Justice. Or, to put it another way, the courts cannot remain Technologically oriented if all the judges have a Mythological sense of justice.\n\nThe point is, French\u2019s cause may not have much of a future. David Brooks has a powerful column up today, in which he examines what to do if the presidential vote comes down to Donald Trump vs. Elizabeth Warren. He says that Warren is pretty bad for four basic reasons, but\n\n\u2026if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You\u2019re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation\u2019s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option. Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat \u2014 to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.\n\nI have said that I would either vote for Trump, or not vote. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that Trump could lead us into a situation in which I could be persuaded, like Brooks, that the threat a second Trump term poses to the country is greater than what a President Warren would mean. It\u2019s possible.\n\nBut if Warren wins, there will be millions of people like Matt in VA who do not see her as legitimate. As he puts it, this is a \u201cmatter of the heart.\u201d He believes establishment people like Brooks are guilty of \u201ctreason\u201d \u2014 a claim that Matt seems to concede in his comment quoted above he holds to as a Mythological claim. I think that is extreme and irrational, but that\u2019s beside the point. The point is that people like Matt in VA \u2014 and there are a lot of them \u2014 have lost a lot of faith in classical liberalism, which is a Technological system.\n\nNow, if Trump wins again, does anybody doubt that the Tim Burkes of the country \u2014 and there are a lot of them \u2014 will refuse to accept his legitimacy? As Burke said, he is the \u201cPiss Christ\u201d of the left (for you youngsters: that\u2019s a photo by Andres Serrano, of a crucifix submerged in urine, that caused a national controversy in the early 1990s). Trump is a Mythological figure for the left. If a Technological system (liberal democracy) produced not one, but two Trump presidencies, the sense that democracy is a fatally flawed system will likely be widespread on the left.\n\nThe danger is that we Americans could find ourselves approaching the condition of Spain in the first half of the 1930s: a nation where both left and right ceased to believe in democracy, because it was a system that allowed the other side the possibility of gaining power. The chasm between the two mythologies \u2014 on the right, Catholicism, monarchism, conservatism, reaction, and falangism; on the left, atheism, socialism, communism, and anarchism \u2014 was too great. Eventually, the Republic fell, and there was civil war, which in an essential way was a war of religion.\n\nIf I were betting on the future of America, I would say that the Matts in VA and the Tim Burkes had the momentum. The center is disappearing. And that means that Sohrab Ahmari, despite lacking in specifics (he\u2019s getting there), has a more accurate read on the nature of the conflict upon us, and what it\u2019s going to take to join the battle.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, though: how are we on the Right going to form the kind of warriors capable of resistance? The Left is already doing this through institutional capture. Harvard\u2019s integralist law professor Adrian Vermeule talks about marching through the institutions from the Right, which I certainly hope will happen, but where are these troops going to come from? The churches? At this point, alas, that\u2019s a sad joke. The ranks of homeschoolers, and other Benedict Optionistas? There aren\u2019t enough of us, and as one Catholic homeschooling mom testified here, it is no guarantee at all. The universities? Come on.\n\nI don\u2019t say that to be discouraging, but only to be realistic. We can only fight the Mythological with the Mythological. The pseudo-faith of Social Justice may be shallow, but it has the force of institutional power, and it is well on its way to capturing elites \u2014 which, as the sociologist James Davison Hunter has argued in his book To Change The World, is how cultural transformation happens:\n\nThe work of world-making and world-changing are, by and large, the work of elites: gatekeepers who provide creative direction and management within spheres of social life. Even where impetus for change draws from popular agitation, it does not gain traction until it is embraced and propagated by elites.\n\nBy all means let us attempt a Christian march through the institutions! But first, many believing Christians are going to have to march through their own institutions, especially the Catholic Church. This is going to have to be the work of generations, though \u2014 and the assault on Christian belief, both intentional and passive, by the forces of liquid modernity is unremitting.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that a religious war is coming. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be between the Social Justice crusaders and Christians, for the most part. I think it\u2019s going to be between the Social Justice crusaders and the post-Christian Right, which is to say, a confederation of nationalists and populists, and tribalists.\n\nTrump is going away at some point, but the country is not going to return to the status quo. In his must-read new book Return Of The Strong Gods, R.R. Reno analyzes the exhausted liberal society \u2014 both left-liberalism and right-liberalism \u2014 and says that we are going to see a return of \u201cstrong gods.\u201d By that, he means forces that unite us and give our lives meaning and purpose. Mythological forces, in the Kolakowskian sense. The religion of Social Justice offers strong gods. They are false gods, but they are strong. In his book \u2014 I intend to write about it in a separate post \u2014 Reno makes a case that we on the other side of that political and cultural chasm had better come up with beneficent strong gods of our own \u2014 and I think Ahmari\u2019s traditionalist version of Catholicism would qualify \u2014 or the craving for the Mythological will summon up dark ones.\n\nThat\u2019s enough for tonight. On Friday, I will be sequestered working on my book in the morning, and traveling in the afternoon. I\u2019ll update the comments as often as I can, and might be able to post a blog or two.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-491606346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
