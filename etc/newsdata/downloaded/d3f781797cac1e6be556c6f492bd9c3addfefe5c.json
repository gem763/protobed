And then, I think we're going to look back and say, 'What were we thinking,'\" he predicted.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Peloton priced its initial public offering at $29 per share, the high-end of the expected range. The IPO raised $1.16 billion, valuing the company at $8.1 billion.\n\nIn an earlier interview on \"Squawk Box,\" Peloton Interactive co-founder and CEO John Foley said it could have been priced even higher. \"We think we generally left something on the table in terms of pricing,\" he explained. \"I feel like we weren't greedy.\"\n\nCramer sees it differently. \"People get very excited about a stock like this. They shouldn't be. I wish this thing were priced at like $22, $23 and went higher,\" he added.\n\nPeloton describing itself as more than a high-end bike and treadmill maker is dubious, Cramer suggested.\n\nFoley said Peloton is a media company, in addition an exercise machine, technology, and subscription company. \"To the extent that we stream close to 1,000 hours of live television programming around the world every month, it's hard not to say we're a media company as well,\" he said. \"I mean, this is original programming. We have thousands of classes on demand and we have almost 1,000 live classes every month.\"\n\n\"It's great they can portray all these things,\" said Cramer. But at the end of the day, he argued, \"It's a company that's an exercycle.\"\n\n\"My wife has it. She regularly hangs laundry on it, which is terrific because I don't want the laundry in my closet,\" said Cramer, in a new twist on Monday's \"hang your towels up'\" hyperbole.\n\nHowever, on a serious note, he said, \"I just don't want people to lose money.\"\n\nPeloton was not immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment on Cramer's remarks.\n\nEarlier this month, Cramer spoke out against the embattled WeWork IPO before the offering was delayed. He also wasn't too hot on SmileDirectClub, which has had a rocky debut.", "description": "\"This is the kind of thing that will be exciting for today, tomorrow.
