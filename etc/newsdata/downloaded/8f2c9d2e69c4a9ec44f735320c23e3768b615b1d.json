Photo: Courtesy of retailer\n\nWith temperatures outside (finally!) dropping, our footwear wardrobe is transitioning from sandals (or socks and sandals) to just closed-toe shoes. And just in time for this transition, Zappos has gone and put a bunch of snazzy Pendleton socks on sale. The Oregon-based brand is known for its cozy blankets in bright stripes and colorful Western-inspired patterns \u2014 and its socks share many of those same details. The sale includes cotton- and wool-blend socks in no-show, crew-cut, and over-the-knee styles, with various nature- and National Park\u2013themed patterns and prints (a few of which you could even wear on those warm fall days when socks and sandals may still be appropriate). The best part: You can get some for as little as $8.\n\nPendleton San Miguel Camp Sock $21 (was $25, now 16% off) $21 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Falcon Cove Crew Socks $11 (was $13, now 15% off) $11 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton National Park Crew Socks - Yosemite Stripe $11 (was $13, now 15% off) $11 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Falcon Cove Hidden No Show Socks $8 (was $9, now 11% off) $8 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Tsi Mayoh Quarter Socks - Performance Capsule $23 (was $25, now 8% off) $23 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Merino Jacquard Park Crew Socks $23 (was $25, now 8% off) $23 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton National Park Crew Socks - Acadia Stripe $11 (was $13, now 15% off) $11 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Crater Lake National Park Stripe Moc Socks $8 (was $9, now 11% off) $8 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Tsi Mayoh Quarter Socks - Performance Capsule $23 (was $25, now 8% off) $23 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Tolovana Over the Knee Socks $26 (was $29, now 10% off) $26 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Sunset Cross Knee High Socks $24 (was $27, now 11% off) $24 at Zappos Buy\n\nPendleton Color Block Crew Socks $21 (was $25, now 16% off) $21 at Zappos Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
