Coetzee, stars Oscar winner Mark Rylance as The Magistrate, a down-to-earth and well-liked administrator of an isolated border outpost, which is part of an unnamed empire.\n\nWhen Depp\u2019s Colonel Joll arrives for an investigation of potential future attacks by \u201cThe Barbarians\u201d, his brutal methods with dealing with the supposed enemy shock The Magistrate.\n\nThe treatment of one young woman particularly affects him and The Magistrate, who is never named, soon begins to question his loyalties.\n\n\u201cIt felt all too relevant to today in many ways in a lot of different places in the world,\u201d Depp told a news conference at the Venice Film Festival where the movie premiered on Friday.\n\nWearing dark metallic sunglasses, described as \u201cmenacing\u201d by Depp, Joll from the outset wants to make The Magistrate feel uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI find the most interesting thing about bad guys throughout history ... those people don\u2019t wake up in the morning and while they\u2019re shaving swear to themselves \u2018I\u2019m going to be the meanest worst human being, I\u2019m going to cause as much havoc as possible\u2019,\u201d Depp said.\n\n\u201c(Joll) seemed very different to me than a bad guy ... If you try to think how is a man like that built, how do they arrive at that place ... Joll is to me a series of very strong protective walls that he\u2019s built ... to escape feeling.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, director Ciro Guerra said that when he first embarked on the project, \u201cit felt like an allegory of a distant place and a distant time\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd by the time it\u2019s finished it is now a film about today and here and now.\u201d\n\nRylance\u2019s Magistrate is nearing retirement when his world is turned upside down. He appears helpless but soon takes matter into his own hands even if it costs him.\n\n\u201cThis film has the potential to raise a lot of compassion and empathy and yes, certainly, when I first encountered the story it made me ask a lot of questions,\u201d Rylance told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWaiting for the Barbarians\u201d is one of 21 films competing for the Golden Lion prize at the festival, where Depp\u2019s daughter Lily-Rose Depp premiered her film \u201cThe King\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. The only thing it can do is bring a smile to my face,\u201d Depp said when asked about his daughter\u2019s acting career. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of her, she\u2019s impressive. She\u2019s my god, she and my son, they\u2019re are my gods.\u201d", "description": "Hollywood star Johnny Depp turns into a cold and cruel officer in \"Waiting for the Barbarians\", a drama its cast and director say may be set in a faraway desert outpost but is relevant to today's world.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Hanna Rantala", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427003364&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851OQ-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
