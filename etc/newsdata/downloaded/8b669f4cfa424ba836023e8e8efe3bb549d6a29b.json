Originally the Libra Association had 27 potential members, but several companies dropped out in recent days, including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.\n\nMost of the remaining members of the Libra Association consist of venture capital firms, who often have an eye on emerging technologies and align with Facebook\u2019s interests, as well as nonprofits. But some larger companies who are now members of the association include Uber, Lyft, Spotify and European telecommunications company Vodafone. The association said in a statement that an unnamed additional 180 entities have expressed interest and have met the initial requirements to join.\n\nFacebook has faced criticism since the summer when it unveiled plans to create a separate, private currency system to allow users to make cross-border payments more easily. Politicians have said they believe Facebook\u2019s struggles with protecting users\u2019 privacy would spill over into Libra, despite it being a separate organization.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company tried to answer those criticisms by creating Libra as a legally separate entity through the Libra Association, and by not owning Libra itself. But Facebook is still involved, even at an arm\u2019s length. The association elected David Marcus, a Facebook executive and co-creator of Libra, as one of the association\u2019s five directors. Katie Haun with Andreessen Horowitz, one of the VC firms that invested in Facebook before it went public, was elected to the board as well.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the House Financial Services Committee later this month to discuss Libra. That committee is chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who has been an ardent critic of Libra from its onset.\n\nFacebook and the Libra Association have said they would not start trading or accepting deposits for Libra until they satisfy U.S. regulators concerns. Dante Disparte, Libra\u2019s head of policy and communications, said that the association is now in active talks with regulators to get approval. Facebook has also hired several Washington lobbyists to help alieve regulator and political concerns over Libra.\n\nThe other three directors elected to the association\u2019s board were Matthew Davie of Kiva Microfunds, Patrick Ellis with PayU and Wences Casares of Xapo Holdings Ltd.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Facebook officially moved forward with its plans Monday to create a new digital currency called Libra, despite several high-profile defections from the project and intense criticism from U.S. regulators and politicians.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Sweet"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/facebook_digital_currency_69899_c0-240-5760-3600_s1200x700.jpg?3b9a8ea0e82656f098dd6f7cd5420c99f93f2f69", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
