But it isn\u2019t just Shakespeare who believed that music is one of the biggest aphrodisiacs. There\u2019s a reason most songs are romantic or about love; movies are set around the theme, and lyrics have the ability to convey emotions that a person finds difficult to express. Researchers, scientists, and doctors have concluded that music can indeed boost your sex life.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts don\u2019t lie\n\nIn a survey conducted by electronics company Sonos in February 2016, in association with neuroscientist Daniel J Levitin, a whopping 67 per cent of respondents claimed to have had better sex with suitable music. Levitin says that when couples listen to music together, their neurons fire up synchronously, releasing oxytocin\u2014the love hormone. He adds, \u201cListening to new music activates the novelty detectors in our brains, and modulates levels of dopamine, the feel-good hormone.\u201d Interestingly, dopamine is released both, while listening to music and having sex. In addition, in his research findings as a doctoral student, Frank Diaz, assistant professor of music education at the University of Oregon, said music also releases serotonin, yet another neurotransmitter that helps regulate the mood.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo rules\n\nChennai-based sexologist, Dr Santhanam Jagannathan, believes that listening to the right kind of music is especially effective in helping a man with low testosterone levels. \u201cFirstly, the general taste of both partners has to be in sync. Secondly, their personality types, and positions they want to have sex in, play an important role in the selection of music. One partner may want it slow and romantic, the other, sensual and raunchy\u2013so they need to first figure out their sexual compatibility to understand what kind of music goes with the mood,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiming is key\n\nJagannathan also believes that the timing is of utmost importance. \u201cSome people may prefer music during foreplay and intercourse, while others may find it distracting, and keep it for afterplay. The solution here is to consult your significant other about what works for them.\u201d Says Sheetal Kenni*, a 25-year-old Chennai-based blogger, \u201cMy partner preferred silence during sex, since he felt that music was a mood killer during foreplay! Since I love the whole soft music and candlelight scene, we decided to let the music build the mood in the beginning, then turn it off. We would continue with the playlist after we orgasmed, so that both of us were able to get a bit of what we wanted.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBass counts\n\nA new study from Canada\u2019s McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind investigated how the brain responds to low- and high-pitched tones. Scientists found that the human ear reacted better to rhythms set by deeper, lower sounds. Psychologist relationships counsellor, Dr Harini Ramachandran, says, \u201cMusic can appeal to one\u2019s primal nature, a low-pitched beat with plenty of bass is ideal. Not only does this pump your libido, and add to the adrenalin rush, it does it in a way that causes vibrations rather than noise, making the overall ambience conducive to sex.\u201d She adds, \u201cThis kind of music can appeal to three areas in the brain\u2013to do with reward or pleasure, to do with bonding, and to process emotion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTread carefully\n\nSometimes, there\u2019s always a possibility that you could surprise your partner unpleasantly if you dig up a song they associate memories with someone else. \u201cI curated a playlist for my boyfriend for our first overnight vacation. Turns out, his ex and he used to listen to the same songs together, and he wasn\u2019t comfortable. We had to make do with no music that weekend and sat together to create a playlist that works for us,\u201d reveals Urvashi Bhatia*, a 26-year-old IT professional. While music could enhance your sex life, it is not a miracle cure for actual relationship or sex problems\u2013that\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to wade through yourself, by putting work into the process. Says Jagannathan, \u201cIf the sex is unsatisfactory, speak up and try to resolve the problem togther with your partner. While music can support all this, it can\u2019t be the only factor in taking your sex life from bad to great.\u201d", "description": "Is the perfect playlist directly proportional to boosting your sex life?
