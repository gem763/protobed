Such remarks are seen as an apparent move to help Korean society recover, after the appointment of Cho two months ago sparked large protests and counter-protests.\"But one thing gained from the strife, he says, is reconfirming the public's demand for fairness in society.He said people want the government to eradicate foul practices and unfair privileges, even the unfairness rooted in legitimate systems.The president asked for religious groups to do more to encourage healthy debate over how to achieve this.\"I would like to make this request once again. The government, including myself, needs to do more to achieve integration and harmony among the public, but I would like to say that religious leaders also need to play a greater role.\"President Moon also sought their wisdom in handling the difficult economic situation and the lack of progress being made in inter-Korean relations, due to stalled nuclear talks between North Korea and the U.S.Park Hee-jun, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
