Another case heard in the high court of England and Wales deemed the issue \u201cpolitical\u201d and non-justiciable. Appeals to both decisions will be heard by the supreme court with a decision due on Thursday.\n\nBefore the hearing scores of protesters opposing the suspension of parliament gathered outside the supreme court.\n\nQ&A What is the UK supreme court and how does it work? Show Hide The supreme court of the United Kingdom was formally established on 1 October 2009. It is the ultimate court for hearing cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance, and is the final court of appeal in the UK, except for criminal cases heard in Scotland. The supreme court took over the judicial functions of the House of Lords, separating the judiciary from the legislature. It brought an end to the system of appealing to the \"lords of appeal in ordinary\" - commonly known as the law lords. The court comprises the president and deputy president and 10 other judges of the supreme court. Judges are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to whom a name is recommended by a special selection commission. The prime minister is obliged to recommend this name. The judgments in all decided cases from the court are published on the court's website.\n\nAmong the demonstrators was a man carrying a sign describing himself as \u201cThe Incredible Sulk\u201d in reference to Johnson comparing himself to the Marvel comic character Hulk.\n\nOthers carried signs declaring: \u201cDefend Democracy,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Silence Our MP,\u201d \u201cReopen Parliament\u201d and \u201cThey Misled The Queen.\u201d\n\nLady Chakrabarti said: \u201cThere are two issues here. The first is the technical issue of justiciable \u2013 is the court entitled to be referee when there\u2019s a dispute of this kind between parliament and government?\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve dealt with that hurdle you go on to decide whether on the facts of this case, Boris Johnson and his chums were abusive. Whether they abused their prerogative power, to suspend parliament, to shut it down in this way.\u201d\n\nThe justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the BBC he backed prorogation and the government would argue in court that it was a \u201cproper course\u201d to take.\n\nIn an attempt to distance himself from a Downing Street source who cast doubt on the Scottish judiciary\u2019s independence, he lavished praise on the country\u2019s judges.\n\nBuckland said: \u201cThey are world-class. They are world-leading. Let them do their job. And I want to make sure whatever the decision is of the supreme court, we will respect the robust independence of our judiciary.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would respect the result, after Johnson and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, both said they would want to review any decision that went against them, Buckland said: \u201cThe principle of respecting the independence of our judiciary is one that runs right through our system and we must do that in this instance.\u201d\n\nThe former supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption told BBC Newsnight he thought the government ought to win but suggested judges might be outraged at Johnson\u2019s approach.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy own view is that the orthodox opinion is the one held by the English courts. But one has to accept that if you behave outrageously and defy the political culture upon which our constitution depends, a lot of judges are going to be tempted to push the limits.\n\n\u201cAnd the trouble is Boris Johnson has taken a hammer and sickle to our political culture in a way that is profoundly provocative to people who believe that there ought to be solutions consistent with our traditions.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to recent comments by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest shadow cabinet allies saying they would back remain in a second referendum, Chakrabarti said she needed to remain neutral so she could give the best advice on Brexit deals.\n\nShe also rubbished the shift by the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, to back stopping Brexit entirely by revoking article 50, describing it as illiberal and adding that she was dumbfounded a pressure group idea had become party policy.\n\nShe said the Lib Dems were turning their backs on \u201chalf the population\u201d.", "description": "Shami Chakrabarti predicts this week\u2019s hearing will rule prorogation was unlawful", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ee02a898c1c87e5f34f7bfa20d8c7add8e6ea3c/765_152_2554_1532/master/2554.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b8db38f6497678de2428587bf09b535", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
