REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nThe law eliminated four-decade-old fuel subsidies and was estimated to have freed up nearly $1.5 billion per year in the government budget, helping to shrink the fiscal deficit as required under a deal Moreno signed with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut the measure was hugely unpopular and sparked days of protests led by indigenous groups that turned increasingly violent despite a military-enforced curfew.\n\nMoreno gave into the chief demand of demonstrators late on Sunday and tweeted on Monday that a new decree would be issued to ensure that resources go to those who most need them though the details were unclear.\n\n\u201cWe have opted for peace,\u201d Moreno said on Twitter.\n\nThe clashes marked the latest in a series of political convulsions sparked by IMF-backed reform plans in Latin America, where increased polarization between the right and left is causing widespread friction amid efforts to overhaul hidebound economies.\n\nAnalysts said Moreno, who took office in 2017 after campaigning as the leftist successor to former President Rafael Correa, had been severely weakened by the protests, with the fiscal problems still unresolved.\n\n\u201cWhile Moreno has survived for now, he is not yet out of the woods. Once again, Ecuador\u2019s indigenous sector has proven its strength and now will be emboldened to look for concessions from the government in other areas,\u201d said Eileen Gavin, senior Latin America analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.\n\n\u201cThis inevitably means a slower fiscal adjustment between now and the 2021 election,\u201d Gavin added in an email.\n\nRelated Coverage Ecuador's Moreno signs decree ditching fuel subsidy cuts after protests\n\nNonetheless, Moreno\u2019s actions brought a much-needed measure of calm to the streets of the capital Quito, where residents began to restore order and clear away the makeshift blockades that sprang up in recent days.\n\nEcuadorean indigenous leader Jaime Vargas said on Monday that gasoline and diesel prices and transportation fares must return to levels that were in effect before the government\u2019s now-canceled plan to slash fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe have freed the country,\u201d Vargas said to cheers from supporters at a press conference. \u201cEnough of the pillaging of the Ecuadorean people.\u201d\n\nThe protests grew increasingly chaotic in recent days after the government launched a crackdown against extremists who it said had infiltrated protests. Authorities reported that the office of the comptroller, a local TV station and military vehicles were set on fire.\n\nIndigenous protesters who streamed into Quito from Andean and Amazonian provinces to join the protests piled into buses that departed the city on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going back to our territories,\u201d said Inti Killa, an indigenous man from the Amazonian region of Napo. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that unity and conviction of the people is a volcano that nobody can stop.\u201d\n\nOIL SECTOR\n\nThe city technically remained under a daytime curfew on Monday. But residents largely ignored it and headed to work.\n\nOne of the government\u2019s more immediate priorities will be to re-establish oil sector operations, which were suspended in some regions after protesters broke into plants.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\n\u201cWe need to re-establish oil production,\u201d said Energy Minister Carlos Perez. He added that Ecuador stopped producing some 2 million barrels of oil during the protests, costing the government more than $100 million in lost income.\n\n\u201cI expect things to be back to normal in about 15 days,\u201d Perez said.", "description": "Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno on Monday promised to repeal an IMF-backed decree that slashed fuel subsidies, as triumphant protesters who had agitated against it went home and the capital picked up the pieces left by nearly two weeks of unrest.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440823844&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1LM", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
