No public institution or foreign power has backed the opposition\u2019s charge that the move was illegal and amounted to a coup.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done well shutting Congress. It was a shame for Peru, a Congress of semi-illiterates, of swindlers,\u201d Vargas Llosa told reporters in Madrid. The author is arguably the world\u2019s most famous living Peruvian, known for his strong pro-democracy stance.\n\n\u201cI hope that in January when they elect a new Congress, citizens will choose better,\u201d he said during the presentation of his new book Fierce Times, adding that democracies of today are vulnerable to corruption, populism and demagoguery.\n\nVargas Llosa, who lives in Madrid, ran for president in Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. After running the country for 10 years, Fujimori ended up fleeing to Japan amid accusations of corruption and human rights violations and was later sentenced to prison in Peru.\n\nThe writer is one of the most significant figures of the 1960-70s literary movement known as the Latin American boom. His most successful novels, often dealing with issues of dictatorship and democracy, include The Time of the Hero and The Feast of the Goat.", "description": "Nobel-prize winning author remarks after president dismissed deputies as the country is rocked by a constitutional crisis", "authors": ["Reuters In Madrid"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298dfada7a7cda00c4edec2797672f3229cd638f/0_326_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48a6ed79d8eecc00e509c27524fc60c6", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
