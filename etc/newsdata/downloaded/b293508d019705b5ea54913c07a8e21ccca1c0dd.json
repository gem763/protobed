The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because criminal charges hadn\u2019t yet been finalized.\n\nSantos was taken into police custody early Saturday. Police say he has been arrested at least a half-dozen other times in the past two years, three times on assault charges. It wasn\u2019t clear whether he had a lawyer to speak for him.\n\nThe victims, all men, were attacked as they slept in doorways and sidewalks in three different locations in Chinatown, which is packed during daylight hours but empties out at night.\n\nPolice responded to a 911 call just before 2 a.m. as one assault was in progress. They found one man dead in the street and a second with critical head injuries.\n\nA search of the neighborhood turned up three additional bodies.\n\nThe New York Post published photos of two of the victims under white sheets, one slumped in a blood-spattered doorway, the other on the sidewalk. The identities of the victims have not been released.\n\nTwo of the men were killed on The Bowery, which cuts through the heart of Chinatown and has for decades been known as New York\u2019s skid row. Two more died on East Broadway, the neighborhood\u2019s main street.\n\nThe lone known survivor was hospitalized in critical condition. Police planned to interview him as soon as possible, Baldassano said.\n\nAnother homeless man who had slept in the area, Stephen Miller, said he knew one of the victims as kind and quiet.\n\n\u201cNo one knew him by name, but we saw him every day,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m just sad. This guy never did anything. Just had a life to live. It sucks that he\u2019s out here in the rain and everything, but it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have a life to live.\u201d\n\nThe suspect\u2019s mother, Fioraliza Rodriguez, 55, told the Daily News she had kicked him out about three years ago. He struggled with drugs, assaulted her and his grandfather, and stole from the family, she said.\n\n\u201cI never thought he would kill someone,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid of him, though, because he punched me. That\u2019s when I told him to get out of my house.\u201d\n\nFamily members told the newspaper that Santos started using drugs when he arrived from their native Dominican Republic about four years ago. The article did not cite a specific drug.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him to leave, he came back and threatened me,\u201d the suspect\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe said when I go back to Santo Domingo, he\u2019ll get people to cut my face.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s homeless population has grown to record levels over the past decade, and the homeless remain among the most vulnerable residents. In the past five years, an average of seven have been slain each year.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio launched new homeless outreach efforts early in his tenure in an attempt to move more people off the street and into shelters, but the program has faced challenges. City efforts to build more homeless shelters have dragged due to neighborhood opposition.\n\nDe Blasio tweeted Saturday that he\u2019s \u201cstunned and horrified by this senseless act of violence against the most vulnerable members of our community.\u201d\n\nThe attacks happened in one of the few downtown Manhattan areas that has retained its character as a center for new immigrants, through gentrification has started to creep in lately.\n\nDuring the day, it bustles with small shops, restaurants and markets doing business in Chinese, as a mix of residents and tourists pack the sidewalks. At night it can be desolate in some sections.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael R.
