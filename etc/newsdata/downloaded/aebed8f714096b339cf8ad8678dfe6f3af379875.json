But what\u2019s the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The candidates vying for the Democratic nomination will face off Tuesday night during the party\u2019s October primary debate on the biggest stage yet.\n\nHaving 12 candidates appearing on one stage together makes Tuesday\u2019s debate the biggest presidential primary debate in recorded political history, The New York Times reports.\n\nHere are four questions answered about Tuesday's democratic debate:\n\nHow to watch?\n\nThis will be the Democratic National Convention's fourth debate. It will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, by CNN and The New York Times, airing live at 8 p.m. EST.\n\nViewers can watch the debate on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and it can be streamed through both CNN\u2019s and the New York Times' websites.\n\nIt will additionally be available across mobile devices via CNN and The New York Timess apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV; SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.\n\nCNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and the New York Times' Marc Lacey will moderate.\n\nOpinion: Age, health and impeachment: What to watch for in this week's Democratic debate\n\nWho is debating?\n\nThe following candidates will appear on stage together in this order:\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii\n\nTom Steyer, billionaire and activist\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nAndrew Yang, entrepreneur\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nMore: Democratic debate No. 4: What you need to know\n\nMore: How do Democrats win in 2020? These battleground state leaders have some advice.\n\nThe stage placement represents how candidates are polling. It has become a three-way race leading into the October match-up as Biden, Warren, and Sanders are consistently polling in the top three, and they will be center stage for the second debate in a row.\n\nGabbard and Steyer are additions to this stage from the September debate, where 10 candidates faced off.\n\nGabbard also said Monday that she does plan to attend the debate after she had previously considered boycotting what she claimed was \"a serious threat to our democracy\" by the Democratic National Committee and the media.\n\nI will be attending the debate. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 14, 2019\n\nSanders is also planning on appearing after canceling several campaign events following a heart attack and procedure a few weeks ago. The senator had two stents inserted, but recently said that he's \"going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\"\n\nDemocratic debate: Democratic debate: Who were the winners and losers\n\nWhat are the issues?\n\nThis will be the first time the top democratic candidates have been together on one stage since the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump was announced in late September by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that subject could dominate some of the discussion as every candidate has now supported the inquiry.\n\nThis comes at the same time Steyer will be looking to make waves during his first appearance on the debate stage, and he has been making the case for impeachment for years.\n\nIt may also add pressure to Biden, who has been a consistent front-runner for the nomination, as the inquiry puts his family at the center of the investigation into the president's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThe candidates may also address Trump's decision to pull back U.S. forces from northern Syria. This move potentially enables a resurgence of the Islamic State as Turkey prepares a military assault against Kurdish fighters who helped the U.S. battle the Islamic State. The president faces widespread backlash for \"abandoning\" a U.S. ally.\n\nOther topics that could dominate the night include gun control and safety, immigration, LGBTQ rights and health care.\n\nMore: Democratic debate: Time for 2020 presidential candidates to get real on health care\n\nWho will not be on stage?\n\nFor October, candidates needed to reach 2% in at least four recognized polls and receive donations from at least 130,000 individuals.\n\nAnd despite this being the largest primary debate, there are still a few candidates who will not be gracing the stage.\n\nThese include:\n\nSen. Michael Bennet of Colorado\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock\n\nFormer Rep. John Delaney of Maryland\n\nMiramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam\n\nOhio Rep. Tim Ryan\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania\n\nAuthor and activist Marianne Williamson\n\nThe DNC recently released more difficult requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates, setting up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to the October match-up, potentially ending some campaigns.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu, Jeanine Santucci, William Cummings, Aamer Madhani\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/election-2020-four-things-you-need-know-october-debate/3977424002/", "description": "12 candidates could face topics such as impeachment, health care, gun control and more Tuesday night, starting at at 8 p.m. ET.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published A.M.
