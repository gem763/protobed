So why is health care such a glaring exception?\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which Congress passed in 2010, expanded health care coverage to nearly 20 million Americans. But it was misnamed, because it didn\u2019t make health care more affordable for most people. \u201cWhere we got it wrong is that we passed on too much cost to working Americans,\u201d Bernard Tyson, CEO of health provider Kaiser Permanente, said at the Yahoo Finance All-Markets Summit on Oct. 10. \u201cSo you end up getting, an \u2018affordable premium,\u2019 but when you go in for care you discover you have a $1,000 deductible or a $5,000 deductible.\u201d\n\nMajor health care advances are likely during the next decade, as new treatments such as gene therapy become more prevalent and technology helps many patients get better care. But don\u2019t expect the overall cost of health care to fall. Some things may get cheaper, such as routine doctor visits and some procedures. But new therapies will be expensive, driving up overall costs, and some elements of the health care economy are impervious to competition, which keeps costs high.\n\n\u201cYou have a combination of two things happening,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cYou have a system that is becoming more efficient and effective. And then you also have an industry that is evolving in ways that none of us ever imagined. The challenge with that is the affordability issue.\u201d\n\nHealth care costs aren\u2019t rising as much as they used to be, but they\u2019re still going up by more than inflation. The cost of a family insurance plan rose 5% this year, to an average of $20,576, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Overall inflation is just 2%. Individuals pay more than $6,000 of that cost, with employers paying the rest. Deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses have been rising, too.\n\nGraphic by David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nHealth-care analyst Steve van Kuiken of McKinsey points out that 60% of all health care costs are \u201cunshoppable,\u201d which means patients don\u2019t have a realistic way of comparing prices or quality, in order to get the best deal. You can\u2019t price-shop in the emergency room, for example, or request a less expensive IV bag. \u201cIt has not been a consumer-oriented industry at all,\u201d van Kuiken said at the summit. \u201cAccessing the health care system is extremely hard.\u201d\n\nSome forthcoming changes could make managing and shopping for health care easier. Tech giants have been dabbling in health care for years, mostly testing the waters with small pilot projects on patient data, health monitoring, medication reminders and other things. Now, van Kuiken says, \u201cAmazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft are getting in in a big way. They\u2019re going to start to build platforms that allow these models to scale.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates favor a single-payer government plant that would essentially eliminate insurers such as Kaiser. Tyson, not surprisingly, thinks that\u2019s the wrong way to go. He points out that 90% of Americans already have coverage in one form or another. \u201cDo we continue to focus only on coverage?\u201d he asks. \u201cOr do we really start to look at what the cost of care is and how we can deal with the inefficiencies of care? I\u2019m more worried about that.\u201d\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
