But before anyone starts getting worried, it's worth noting that the Friends star and the soccer player are merely working together.\n\nAlong with the caption, \"Too hot in the hot tub! #modernfamily,\" Cox shared a second selfie which also featured Modern Family actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet.\n\nStill, we weren't the only ones excited about Cox's snap with Beckham. Her former Friends co-star, Jennifer Aniston, couldn't resist commenting, \"Wait....WHAT'S HAPPENING?!!??\" along with some pretty choice emojis. Stonestreet was quick to reply, \"I liked it,\" and we definitely did, too.\n\nThe Beckhams visited the Modern Family set way back in August 2017, hinting even then that David was a huge fan of the show.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Cox and Beckham were recently confirmed to be appearing in Modern Family's final season, along with Jordan Peele, Elizabeth Banks, and Edward Norton. And judging by Cox's hot tub snap, the final season is going to be lit.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Cox captioned her photo, \"Too hot in the hot tub!\" \ud83d\udd25", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/27FbcoavF63cujzpdP48mg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/bc6b552e059a2af18512d97d52d9518b", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
