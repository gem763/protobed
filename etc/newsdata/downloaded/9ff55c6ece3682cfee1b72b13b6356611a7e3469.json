And today, only two cases exist: the one from the New York AG\u2019s office, and another from the Massachussets AG \u2014 which is on hold and likely dead.\n\nYet the big press conference, which featured climate-change icon Al Gore, fueled the #exxonKnew movement \u2014 and accomplished a key goal: drawing headlines.\n\n\u201cExxon Mobil Climate Change Inquiry in New York Gains Allies,\u201d reported The New York Times. \u201cAttorneys General Will Investigate Energy Firms For Climate Deception,\u201d announced BuzzFeed.\n\nThe claim: Exxon had long known that consuming oil would cause global warming but hid the facts. In fact, the company for decades published findings closely matching mainstream science. No one has ever produced any evidence of a coverup.\n\nWhich is why Schneiderman (before the revelation of horrifying personal conduct ended his career) was forced to find a different rationale: Big Oil, he said, might be \u201coverstating\u201d its assets by \u201ctrillions,\u201d by failing to account for potential future regulations that restrict fossil fuels.\n\nOops: The company had warned about the risks of new rules; that\u2019s why a Securities and Exchange Commission probe cleared it of those charges.\n\nAnd the case that now-AG Letitia James takes to trial Tuesday is a huge comedown from even that claim, charging that Exxon fraudulently used two sets of books to state the risks. The company says it merely releases different estimates for different purposes, with full disclosure.\n\nThe charge is not only a far cry from the original #ExxonKnew allegations, it\u2019s also almost certain to fail. Putting the best face on this fact, climate-change warrior Andrew Revkin tweeted Wednesday: \u201cSome lawsuits are fought for the win, some are fought for the documents. The NYS #exxonknew suit is far more likely to be the latter.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the entire thing has been a shameless exercise in prosecutorial abuse, from the outrageous harassment of nonprofits whose research the climate-crisis crew dislikes to the ethically dubious private funding of staff in the New York AG\u2019s Office.\n\nRadicals might think anything is justified in the effort to destroy the fossil-fuel industry, but prosecutors betray their public trust when they bend the law to push a private ideological agenda.\n\nIf you have a real case, you don\u2019t have to make up fake ones.", "description": "On Tuesday, the progressive legal war on Exxon will head to trial in a case most notable for how badly it has fizzled.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shutterstock_exxonmobil.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
