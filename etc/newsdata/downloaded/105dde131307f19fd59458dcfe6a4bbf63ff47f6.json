The notebooks had information linking Tony Hernandez to drug deals, according to documents from the attorney general's office.\n\nChajtur said the notebooks were used in evidence at the trial of Tony Hernandez, and that the information therein also contained coded references to Juan Orlando Hernandez.\n\nThe lawyer said he had made repeated requests that Meza client be transferred to a more high security location due to threats that were made against his life.\n\n\"We never got an answer to our requests, which makes us think the government was involved in this act,\" he said.\n\nThe president's office had no immediate comment.
