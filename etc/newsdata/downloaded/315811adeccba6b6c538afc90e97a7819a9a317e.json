The comics let us in on a few tells.\n\nThose of you with younger siblings will be able to relate to late-night comic James Corden's latest analogy for President Donald Trump. Or perhaps you are the younger sibling who has gone from proclaiming innocence in one breath to begging for an alibi to tell mom and dad in the next.\n\nWhichever camp you fit into, it isn't hard to see where Corden was going. Trump's latest effort to block a key witness from testifying before Congress during the impeachment inquiry somehow doesn't jive with his early proclamations that his phone conversation was completely innocent.\n\nLate-night comic Trevor Noah takes an even deeper look at Trump's dealings with Ukraine. He finds it suspicious that two Trump diplomats would transition from texting about possible quid pro quo to calling. Find out why he compares that move to conversations with grandma in today's Best of Late Night, above.\n\nAnd Jimmy Kimmel confirms what one member of the GOP stated: The entire scandal is indeed a clown show. Find out which part Kimmel says Trump is playing.\n\nJames Corden (Photo: Jean-Baptiste Lacroix, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAfter you watch our favorite jokes from last night's late-night lineup, vote for yours in the poll below.\n\nFollow Eileen Rivers on Twitter @msdc14.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/best-of-late-night/2019/10/09/corden-compares-trump-guilty-little-brother-best-of-late-night/3919965002/", "description": "What's a surefire sign that the president's dealings with Ukraine are impeachable?
