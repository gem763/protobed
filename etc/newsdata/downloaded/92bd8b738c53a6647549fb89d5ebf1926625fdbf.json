She also vowed to refuse to accept \u201cany contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s pledge also wouldn\u2019t stop the party or super-PACs from raising vast amounts of money on her behalf. But it may stop wealthy donors from cutting big checks if they believe it won\u2019t help them get access to the nominee.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m the Democratic nominee for president, I\u2019m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign,\u201d Warren said in a statement released by her campaign.\n\nStill, some Democrats fear it would put the party at a huge fundraising disadvantage against President Donald Trump, who\u2019s raking in vast sums of money from big donors by his own campaign and by super-PACs that support him.\n\nRufus Gifford, the finance director for former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, has said Warren\u2019s earlier suggestions to avoid high-dollar events was \u201ca colossally stupid decision\u201d that would cost Democrats not only in the presidential contest but also in down-ballot races.\n\nBut it also reflects her populist pitch to be a different kind of candidate who isn\u2019t corrupted by special interest money, and so far she has proven adept at generating small-dollar contributions that are envied by her party rivals.\n\nA Warren campaign aide said the decision to accept no more than $200 from executives and big tech or financial firms was \u201cretroactive\u201d and any contributions above $200 from those people would be returned.\n\nThe aide also said that big tech companies under this guideline will include Alphabet Inc., which is Google\u2019s parent company; Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., Lyft Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.\n\nNominees traditionally complain about the amount of time needed to raise money in a campaign and call for changes in financing presidential races, but then say they can\u2019t \u201cunilaterally disarm\u201d against a well-funded opponent.\n\nWarren\u2019s bet is that her pitch will propel her campaign in the Democratic contest -- where she\u2019s tied with Joe Biden for the top spot -- and mobilize many of the estimated 100 million eligible voters who didn\u2019t turn out in the 2016 election. Biden spends a significant amount of time raising money from traditional donor bases.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Warren\u2019s pledge would apply to the Democratic National Committee, which can accept contributions from individuals of as much as $355,000 for various accounts, including $35,500 per donor that can be used to influence the election.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t apply to outside groups like super-PACs, which under federal law cannot coordinate their activities with campaigns. In 2016, Priorities USA had more than 30 individual donors who contributed more than $1 million.\n\nObama barred contributions from registered lobbyists and corporate PACs. The DNC was outraised by its Republican counterpart in 2012 by almost $100 million, yet Obama, a popular incumbent, won overwhelmingly against rival Mitt Romney in the election. The party lifted the bans in 2016, and the DNC raised $354 million compared to $343 million for the Republican National Committee.\n\nWarren often highlights her approach to fundraising on the campaign trail, reassuring prospective voters that her campaign is fueled by them, not big dollar donors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend my time at fundraisers for bazilionaires and corporate executives,\u201d Warren said during a town hall in Austin, Texas, last month. \u201cI just don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether her grassroots fundraising model could leave her without enough money to go against Trump in the general election, Warren was adamant that a flurry of contributions between $5 and $25 would be enough. Trump and the RNC raised $125 million in the first quarter, more than all of the major Democrats combined.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren pledged Tuesday to forgo any high-dollar fundraising events if she becomes the Democratic nominee, a move that would make her the first general-election candidate to do so and could be a high-stakes gamble against a cash-rich incumbent and a well-funded GOP apparatus.But", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur", "Bill Allison", "Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bbrDAtMZ56wOt8j64wEImw--~B/aD0zNzg7dz01OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6402daac90ca61b5bfab447eccb1dece", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
