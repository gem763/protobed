LOUIS (AP) - Adam Wainwright decided to go to the tape.\n\nThe St. Louis right-hander studied a few of his past performances in an effort to regain some of the aggression from earlier in his career.\n\nIt worked perfectly for the 38-year-old veteran.\n\nWainwright tossed seven scoreless innings and Kolten Wong delivered a run-scoring triple to lead the Cardinals to a 3-1 win over the San Francisco Giants on Monday.\n\nPaul DeJong had an RBI single for the Cardinals, who have won 10 of 12. They remain three games ahead of the Chicago Cubs in the NL Central with 25 games remaining.\n\nMauricio Dubon hit his first major league homer for San Francisco, which has lost six of seven.\n\nWainwright (10-9) allowed four hits. He struck out one and did not walk a batter in a 96-pitch stint. Wainwright lowered his home ERA to 2.43 in 13 starts this season.\n\nHe credited the extra video work for his strong outing,\n\n\u201cI tried to re-channel that focus that I used to have,\u201d Wainwright said. \u201cThat attacking mentality that I used to have. I\u2019ve sort of gotten away from that the last couple starts.\n\n\u201cToday, I wanted to attack. Go out and be me.\u201d\n\nWainwright had the video crew pull highlights of his two best starts from each of the 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 seasons.\n\nSuitably inspired, he went out and recorded his third scoreless start of the year - all of seven innings or more.\n\n\u201cHe was a pitch-maker today,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cHe\u2019s always got the gas pedal down. He\u2019s got a ferocious mindset.\u201d\n\nWainwright now has 10 seasons of 10 wins or more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the (Wainwright) of old that we\u2019ve come to know,\u201d Wong said. \u201cA legacy that continues to go on.\u201d\n\nWainwright retired the last eight hitters he faced.\n\n\u201cHe was good at what he does,\u201d San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cHe slows you down, he speeds you up - a lot of different looks.\u201d\n\nCarlos Mart\u00ednez recorded four outs to pick up his 17th save in 20 chances. He leads the NL with 14 saves since the All-Star break.\n\nSt. Louis scored twice in the first off Tyler Beede (3-9), who gave up three runs on five hits over four innings. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nDexter Fowler led off with a single and scored on Wong\u2019s triple down the right field-line. Paul Goldschmidt brought in Wong with a groundout.\n\nDeJong pushed the lead to a 3-0 with his 200th career RBI in the third.\n\nSt. Louis is an NL-best 33-16 since the All-Star break.\n\nThe Cardinals, thanks to back-to-back doubleheaders on Saturday and Sunday, played five games in a span of 51 hours, 44 minutes and came away with a 4-1 record.\n\nShildt was impressed with his team\u2019s performance during the high-volume stretch.\n\n\u201cYou saw zero decline in effort mentally and physically,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cGuys were grinding every single pitch, all five games and they were rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nNO MONDAY BLUES\n\nSt. Louis improved to an NL-best 12-2 on Mondays.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: RHP Johnny Cueto will throw a side session sometime this week and could be back in the rotation this weekend, Bochy said. Cueto has missed the entire season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. He has made six rehab starts with Triple-A Sacramento. \u201cHe feels good, he\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Bochy said.\n\nCardinals: C Matt Wieters received a cortisone shot for a mild calf strain. There is no timetable for his return. \u201cHe\u2019s in a very optimistic place,\u201d Shildt said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSan Francisco RHP Dereck Rodr\u00edguez (5-7, 5.49) will face RHP Jack Flaherty (8-8, 3.71) in the second game of the four-game series on Tuesday. The Giants are 5-8 in games Rodr\u00edguez has started this season. Flaherty had a career-best four-game winning streak stopped in a 4-1 loss to Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Adam Wainwright decided to go to the tape.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Overbey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/giants_cardinals_baseball_93433_c0-221-5280-3299_s1770x1032.jpg?86e66e64956a3d47443a97095c9943e297141dd8"}
