She said she can't eat properly.\n\n'She says she is unable to work. She says she does not go out because she is afraid she will see the defendant.'\n\nCardiff Crown Court heard the pair had been together for two to three years before the relationship became 'turbulent.'\n\nDefending Jonathan Lewis said: 'He accepts he became besotted with her.\n\n'When the relationship started to falter he took it hard.\n\n'It was his first ever loving relationship.
