Golsteyn pleaded not guilty in a military court in June to allegations that he wrongfully killed an unarmed Afghan man named Rasoul in Helmand province in February 2010. He has said the shooting was justified in wartime, and that the man was a Taliban bomb maker responsible for the deaths of two Marines.\n\nMaj. Golsteyn\u2019s civilian lawyer, Phillip Stackhouse, said he\u2019s hoping the president will intervene.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful the president will exercise his executive power as commander-in-chief and take jurisdiction of this case and then dismiss the case with prejudice,\u201d Mr. Stackhouse told The Washington Times in an email. \u201cThis is the only way to allow Matt to get his life back.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe appreciate the intensifying scrutiny of the prosecution of Maj. Golsteyn. Matt was cleared in this incident years ago, yet this secretive, runaway prosecution by the Army violates his Constitutional rights and leaves the Golsteyn family in a state of constant uncertainty and fear.\u201d\n\nThe soldier\u2019s mother, Nancy Golsteyn, and Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Saturday morning to call attention to his case. Mr. Hunter said the prosecution is a result of military lawyers who are \u201choldovers\u201d from the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis is Barack Obama\u2019s U.S. Army,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cThis should not be happening. This is going to take President Trump doing something about this and just calling this off. It\u2019s going to take the intervention of the new commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nThe Army contends that Maj. Golsteyn ambushed the man after he was questioned by U.S. authorities, executed him and burned his body in a pit at a forward operating base.\n\nA trial date has been set for December, following a court hearing this week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
