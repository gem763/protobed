PlusPoints replaces the airline's previous system of Regional Premier Upgrade (RPU) and Global Premier Upgrade certificates (GPU).\n\nThe change takes effect December 4.\n\nCustomers who reach Premier Platinum, typically after flying 75,000 miles in a calendar year, will receive 40 points as a perk. Those who fly a total of 100,000 miles and reach the next tier, 1K, will get another 280 points.\n\nMost upgrades will cost a fixed number of points. Upgrading from economy to first class on a domestic flight or premium economy on an international route will cost 20 points \u2014 the equivalent of an RPU. An upgrade from premium economy to business class on a long-haul route will cost 30 points, while the same upgrade from coach will cost 40 points \u2014 previously, the traveler would need to use a GPU.\n\nSee also: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22.\n\nThe airline claims that the new system will make it easier for its most valued customers to use their upgrade benefits. Passengers can redeem points online or through United's app.\n\n\"We're making it even easier for our Premier members to use upgrades when and how they want,\" Luc Bondar, United's vice president of loyalty and the head of its MileagePlus program, said on Tuesday. \"The new PlusPoints program increases the overall number of upgrade opportunities for top tier Premier members, expands the fare classes where they can be used, and lets members request upgrades on multiple flights all at once.\"\n\nUnited elite members will still receive complimentary upgrades on flights, as well. Using PlusPoints will allow passengers to jump to the top of the waitlist.\n\nAlthough the PlusPoints program expands which ticket fares are eligible to be upgraded, upgrades will still be capacity controlled, so elite flyers will only be able to upgrade when there is space available that United does not expect will be purchased by someone else.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of recent tweaks United has made to its overall loyalty program. In August, the airline said that its frequent flyer miles would no longer be subject to expiration dates.", "description": "The new United PlusPoints scheme replaces the Regional and Global Premier Upgrade certificates its top elite frequent flyers have received.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cd9c7cc021b4c2a0446fc6a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
