More recently, raising the risk of conflict, it expanded that effort to Lebanon and Iraq.\n\nHezbollah responded last week, firing antitank missiles into this small farming community on the Lebanese border.\n\nIsraeli military officials said Hezbollah had crossed a line by firing into a civilian area rather than a closed military site. \u201cThese are places Hezbollah shouldn\u2019t take the war between wars because it will end in a war,\u201d an Israeli military official said.\n\nIsrael has widened the campaign as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fights to hold on to his post, facing a re-election bid on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Netanyahu speaks regularly about Israel\u2019s need to combat Iranian aggression, but Israel has acknowledged only some details of the military campaign.\n\nIsrael has relied on high-tech surveillance to track what its officials say are Hezbollah\u2019s efforts to manufacture precision-guided missiles and build tunnels into northern Israel.\n\nThe campaign also includes psychological operations. Last week, Israel staged the evacuation of an apparently wounded soldier to trick Hezbollah into claiming Israeli casualties after its strike on Avivim. The attack left two circular craters and a large patch of charred grass.\n\nAt the nearby Shebaa Farms, a small strip of disputed land controlled by Israel that borders Lebanon and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, the combatants have grown accustomed to exchanging fire. The approximately 10- square-mile area is surrounded by missile nets and jamming equipment, among other defenses intended to intercept incoming fire from Hezbollah.\n\nElsewhere along the Lebanon-Israel border, Israel uses drones and other means of surveillance and intelligence collection to monitor Hezbollah\u2019s activities. Mannequins have been positioned in jeeps to dupe Hezbollah on where Israeli forces are stationed.\n\nLebanese investigators inspected damage to Hezbollah\u2019s media center in August.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun called a late-August drone attack in a Beirut suburb the equivalent of a declaration of war that \u201callows us to resort to our right to defend our sovereignty.\u201d He appealed to the U.S. and France to intervene to calm the situation.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed Tuesday to strike Israeli military vehicles in its next attack.\n\nCurrent and former Israeli officials acknowledge that Israel\u2019s campaign is adding to tensions. But they say the alternative scenario is unacceptable: allowing a foe to obtain missile technology that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses and enable sneak attacks.\n\n\u201cIf someone is not ready to risk anything, he will not gain anything,\u201d said Yaakov Amidror, who was Israeli national security adviser from 2011 to 2013 and is now at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security. \u201cHere we might lose the ability to defend ourselves if they succeed to build on top of what they already have.\u201d\n\nSparring continued this week when the Lebanese group said Monday it had downed an Israeli drone, and Syrian-based militias fired rockets at Israel following a report that an airstrike had killed Tehran-supported militants near the Iraq-Syria border. Israeli officials said the drone fell because of a technical problem.\n\nSupporters of Hezbollah watched a speech by leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on Sept. 2.

Israeli forces experienced 18 years of bloody guerrilla warfare while holding a security zone in southern Lebanon, before withdrawing in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, after Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid, Israel launched a massive assault on Lebanon, during which Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets at northern Israel. The 34-day war resulted in the deaths of 165 Israeli soldiers and civilians and at least 1,100 Hezbollah fighters and Lebanese civilians.\n\nIsraeli officials believe Hezbollah has since expanded its arsenal and capabilities. They say the paramilitary group is trying to manufacture new precision-guided missiles and convert some of its 130,000 unsophisticated rockets into these more precise weapons to target Israeli military and civilian sites. Hezbollah denies the charge.\n\nHezbollah has a few dozen precision-guided missiles, mostly smuggled in from Syria, according to Israeli officials. Hezbollah isn\u2019t able to produce them in significant numbers yet, they say.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How can Israel and Hezbollah avoid another war? Join the conversation below.\n\nIsrael\u2019s efforts to reverse Hezbollah\u2019s progress toward more advanced missiles have ended a fragile lull in the conflict.\n\nAnalysts say a conflict could break out at any time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay too much attention when they say they want to avoid war,\u201d said Jacob Nagel, head of Israel\u2019s National Security Council from 2016 to 2017 and a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIf something will happen, the reaction isn\u2019t if the sides want war or not, the reaction is keeping with their best interests.\u201d\n\nThe margin for miscalculation is already narrow. On Sept. 1, one of several antitank missiles fired from Lebanon narrowly missed striking an Israeli military vehicle with five people inside, a second Israeli military official said.\n\n\u201cBoth sides are acting, hoping that it will be limited to below the escalation line,\u201d said Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israel\u2019s military intelligence who is now executive director of the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. \u201cBut they can miscalculate.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dov Lieber in Tel Aviv and Nazih Osseiran in Beirut contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "A widening campaign by Israel to blunt the threat posed by Iran\u2019s ally Hezbollah, and the pushback from beyond its borders, are raising the risk that the two sides will stumble into another war.", "authors": ["Felicia Schwartz", "Felicia.Schwartz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106343/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
