Just a few blocks from the main campus of the University of North Carolina, groups of happy-looking young people crowd the sidewalks and patronize businesses including Starbucks, Chipotle, Cold Stone Creamery, several national bank branches, a bike shop, a craft-beer brewery and a wine bar.\n\nBut like many commercial areas adjacent to major colleges, this section of Chapel Hill is primed to attract millions of additional dollars in new investment thanks to changes that were part of the 2017 tax law. Investors around the country are racing to take advantage of one of the hottest tax-planning strategies in wealth management: sticking money into \u201copportunity zones.\u201d\n\nThe program allows investors to reduce and defer paying capital-gains taxes until 2026 by investing in high-poverty communities. But because of the way the federal government wrote the rules, some census tracts\u2014including Chapel Hill\u2019s\u2014appear on paper to be high-poverty areas but are actually populated by college students with no income. As a result, a tax benefit intended to help poor areas is channeling money to places that are already relatively well-off.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Chapel Hill\u2019s opportunity zone has a poverty rate of 47%, three times the state average. But the zone\u2019s median age is 22, 99.8% of residents have high-school diplomas and 49% say they\u2019ve moved in the past year. The tract has a lot of apartments and rental units\u2014including nearly a dozen fraternity and sorority houses\u2014but the median value of owner-occupied housing is $500,000, or triple the state average.\n\nMoney is already pouring in. In April a Charlotte-based real-estate firm spent $23.5 million to buy a 119,000-square-foot Franklin Street office building with a ground-level CVS pharmacy and adjacent parking lot. \u201cIt is a bit of a head-scratcher why it is an opportunity zone,\u201d the company\u2019s vice president admitted to the Raleigh News & Observer, which noted: \u201cMost people aren\u2019t likely to think of Franklin Street as a disadvantaged area.\u201d The company plans a $12 million renovation to refresh the offices and to convert them to a technology hub. It might include a co-working space.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s 8,700 opportunity zones are in legitimately distressed communities in need of revitalization. Still, as investors have begun announcing deals taking advantage of the tax breaks, some of the projects in opportunity zones appear to fall short of the goal of spurring new investment that lifts up struggling areas.\n\nDevelopers broke ground in Kentucky last year on a $50 million, 10-story apartment building near the University of Louisville that offers \u201ca unique, unobstructed view of race track Churchill Downs,\u201d according to the trade publication of the National Apartment Association. The developer said: \u201cWe planned to build at University of Louisville, anyway, and this financing certainly made that decision even easier.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, a Fort Lauderdale developer broke ground this spring on a $40 million apartment building located in an opportunity zone. Monthly rents are expected to go for as much as $1,900. \u201cA lot of these people who are going to live there have a high income,\u201d the developer confessed to a local business publication. The complex will feature amenities including a dog park, a fitness center with a yoga and cycling studio, a full-time concierge and a fourth-floor pool with cabanas.\n\nA Pittsburgh-based real-estate investment firm announced in May that it purchased and plans to upgrade a student-housing community across a pedestrian bridge from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The complex already \u201cfeatures a 24-hour fitness center, swimming pool with LED lighting, cybercafe with free printing and a host of other amenities,\u201d the company said in a news release.\n\nA study last year by the Brookings Institution identified 33 college towns with opportunity zones in which more than 85% of residents are college students. The top three were the University of Southern California, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Illinois State University\u2014each of which has nearby opportunity zones composed of 99% college students.\n\n\u201cThere were some obvious flaws in the way this was designed,\u201d Brookings economist Adam Looney says. \u201cYou can build anything for any purpose and get the tax break.\u201d He says he has heard of opportunity-zone projects that include building self-storage facilities and solar-power generation, both of which\u2014like renovating luxury student housing\u2014have tenuous connections to community revitalization.\n\nIn Chapel Hill, the town\u2019s economic development officer, Dwight Bassett, says the opportunity zone is leading other investors to sniff around the college town\u2014a development he welcomes. Asked if he\u2019d describe the area as impoverished, he says, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He adds, however, that a North Carolina Commerce Department official told him last year that the town had two census tracts eligible to become opportunity zones. The official asked Mr. Bassett to recommend one. \u201cWe looked where we could get the most economic benefit out of it,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s the one we nominated.\u201d\n\nMr. Mecia is editor of the Charlotte Ledger, a business publication in Charlotte, N.C.", "description": "Places like Chapel Hill are poor areas on paper because they\u2019re filled with jobless college kids.", "authors": ["Tony Mecia"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107017/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
