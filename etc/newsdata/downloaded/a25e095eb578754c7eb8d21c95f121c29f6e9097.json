I don't like dating in public but\u2026if I were to ask you if we could go on a date\u2026\" Mike said, in public.\n\nKeke seemed visibly startled by the sudden question and managed to steer clear of it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next question?\u201d the Hustlers actor asked her cohost Michael Strahan, promptly moving the conversation forward. \u201cLadies, I'm at work. I'm at work, guys. Go ahead. I'm at work,\" she later added.\n\nFollowing the interaction, some fans found Mike\u2019s action uncalled for and took to Twitter to call out him out for putting Keke on the spot on live TV. \u201cMike Johnson givin\u2019 off the big red flags right now. I feel sorry for Keke, being put on the spot like that,\u201d someone commented after seeing the clip. TV personality Heather Gardner added, \"I know this was supposed to be a cute moment and all, but when will these men stop embarrassing women at work?\"\n\nLike the meme queen she is, Keke took the opportunity to turn the situation around and gift us with another relatable meme \u2014 this time around, started by herself on Twitter. And while she did not spare any details on how the situation made her feel, her post truly says it all.\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\n\nWant more from Teen Vogue?
