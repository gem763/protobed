The road near his Paris home was being protected by police in the early afternoon.\n\nThe French parliament observed a minute\u2019s silence and Richard Ferrand, the head of the lower house, said he was larger than life and likened him to a literary character. \u201cIn Chirac, France has lost a hero from Alexandre Dumas: charmer, fighter and much deeper than he wanted to appear.\u201d\n\nFerrrand said: \u201cThe French people have lost an indefatigable republican, visionary, attentive to the great debates of his time ... Jacques Chirac is part of the history of France. A France in his image: spirited, complex, often full of contradictions, always driven by a tireless republican passion.\u201d\n\nThe French Green politician David Cormand said that what stood out about Chirac on the French right was that he \u201crefused\u201d any linking up with the far right, a critique of how later leaders on the centre-right increasingly courted voters for the far-right Le Pen.\n\nIn 2002, Chirac was re-elected president with 82% of the vote after the Front National\u2019s Jean-Marie Le Pen shocked the nation by getting into the final round run-off. Chirac won because much of the leftwing electorate voted for him in order to stop the far-right leader \u2013 the left later complained that Chirac did not adjust his politics to take into account that leftwing vote. Cormand called Chirac the \u201clast Gaullist\u201d.\n\nThe former socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande hailed Chirac as a \u201cfighter\u201d who \u201cknew how to create a real link with the French people\u201d.\n\nParis\u2019s socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said the city was \u201cgrieving\u201d. The European Commission president and former Luxembourg premier, Jean-Claude Juncker, was \u201cmoved and devastated\u201d to learn of Chirac\u2019s death, a spokeswoman said, adding that Europe was losing a \u201cgreat statesman\u201d.\n\nTwice elected head of state in 1995 and 2002, his 12 years in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace made him France\u2019s second-longest-serving postwar president after his socialist predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, with one of the longest political careers in Europe.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chirac with German chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1997.

This stance, which saw France turn away from its US and UK allies, saw his anti-war stance win approval ratings of 90% at home.\n\nMarine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally (formerly the Front National) and daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, paid tribute to Chirac for his stance on Iraq, saying he was \u201ccapable of opposing madness and the war in Iraq\u201d.\n\nIn France, while attacked by the left for failing to address France\u2019s deep social divisions, unemployment and debt, he was hailed for reconciling the nation with its history by acknowledging that France as a whole was responsible for the roundup of some 76,000 Jews sent to Nazi death camps during the second world war.\n\nCalled a \u201cweathervane\u201d for shifting his political ideas, he was seen as a master of the art of electoral campaigning and hand shaking. He was an instinctive conservative but with an appeal that extended beyond the right. Chirac also served two stints as prime minister in 1974-76 and 1986-88 and was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.\n\nIt was his time at the helm of the French capital that resulted, once he had lost his presidential immunity, in a conviction for embezzlement and misuse of public funds. When he left office, he became the first former French president convicted of a crime \u2013 receiving a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of embezzling public funds as Paris mayor in order to illegally finance the rightwing party he led.\n\nChirac had rarely been seen in public in recent years and was long known to have been suffering from ill health.", "description": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande hails him as a \u2018fighter\u2019 and mayor of Paris says city is grieving", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis", "Agn\u00e8s Poirier"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07de465ff0e8520c45419baca16f64114ee955bc/0_283_2148_1288/master/2148.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9277b5ee02a5fc4e4d66318ff82a9dbe", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
