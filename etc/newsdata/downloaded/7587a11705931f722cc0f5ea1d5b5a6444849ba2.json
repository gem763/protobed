Suddenly, an application or tax form is kicked back.\n\n\u201cAnd the parents go, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 They don\u2019t even know what this means,\u201d says Velasquez, whose nonprofit helps victims of identity theft. \u201cAnd \u2026 through no fault of their own, they\u2019re left holding the bag and they are the ones that are now responsible for cleaning up that mess.\u201d\n\nAn identity theft victim at birth?\n\nThe rise in synthetic identity theft \u2014 where criminals piece together a fake consumer \u2014 is an unintended consequence of Social Security number \u201crandomization,\u201d which was initiated in 2011 to expand the pool of available numbers, she says.\n\nOld Social Security numbers had clues to geography and birth dates in the digits. Randomizing the numbers made it harder for scammers to guess them \u2014 but also made it harder for creditors to spot the bogus use of a Social Security number on an application.\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: Read this before allowing your kids to go anywhere near a computer\n\nBefore randomization, criminals typically purchased minors\u2019 Social Security numbers on the black market or tracked down the numbers of dead children. But now, sometimes the number \u201cis just completely made up,\u201d Velasquez says. Fraud-detection measures used previously have become ineffective because it\u2019s no longer possible to pair a Social Security number with a location or approximate age.\n\nCriminals often start with a not-yet-issued Social Security number to create a fake identity. If it works, the number becomes attached to a credit file for a consumer who doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHow the number gets in the credit system\n\n\u201cYou can create a credit file with almost nothing,\u201d says Adam Levin, chairman and founder of CyberScout, a company offering identity theft education and resolution services. When a credit card application with a previously unused Social Security number arrives, a new credit file is started based on the information in that application.\n\nThe thief often starts small, say, with a card marketed to credit newbies, then builds on that to get more accounts with bigger credit limits. Then, they suddenly max out all the accounts \u2014 a \u201cbust-out\u201d scheme \u2014 and walk away, leaving the accounts to go to collections and never to be paid. The child\u2019s credit reputation is left in tatters, but that\u2019s often not discovered until the child is old enough to apply for credit, by seeking a college loan, for example.\n\nSee: Credit freezes, credit locks, and fraud alerts: what\u2019s the difference?\n\nVelasquez says the solution lies in creating a process where financial institutions and other credit grantors can verify an applicant\u2019s name and number with the Social Security Administration for identity confirmation. That\u2019s in the works, she says.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to freeze credit\n\nMeanwhile, the best protection is to freeze kids\u2019 credit. While it\u2019s possible parents will discover that a child\u2019s Social Security number has already been used to build a synthetic identity, chances are it hasn\u2019t. (If it has, the sooner you clean up the mess, the better.)\n\nFreezing a child\u2019s credit can prevent their Social Security number from being used to open bogus credit accounts. Both Levin and Velasquez say they \u201cabsolutely\u201d recommend freezing a newborn\u2019s credit.\n\nAlso read: This couple fought $25,000 in fraudulent credit-card charges after falling prey to identity theft \u2014 then things got worse\n\nThe mechanics are relatively simple. Parents will need to make and send copies of documents, including birth certificates, Social Security cards and government-issued identification, to each of the three credit reporting bureaus.\n\nGo online to Equifax EFX, +0.03% and Experian EXPGY, +0.00% to print out request forms to complete and mail in with the required copies of documents. The mailing address is on each form. TransUnion TRU, +3.98% doesn\u2019t have an online form; instead, to request a freeze, write a letter and send document copies to TransUnion, P.O. Box 380, Woodlyn, PA 19094.\n\nEach credit bureau will send confirmation of the freeze, as well as a personal identification number. The PINs will be needed to unfreeze the credit file, so it\u2019s essential to keep that information and store it in a secure place.\n\n\u201cEven if it is a little difficult, this is what parents should be doing,\u201d Levin says about freezing kids\u2019 credit.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Parents may discover their newborn\u2019s Social Security number has already been tarnished.", "authors": ["Bev O Shea"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT567_nerd_b_ZG_20191017190644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
