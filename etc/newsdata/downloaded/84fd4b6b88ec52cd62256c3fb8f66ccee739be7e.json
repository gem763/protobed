Bernie Sanders unleashed his new criminal justice reform proposal in South Carolina a few days ago, and \u2014 like all Bernie Sanders proposals \u2014 it\u2019s just more evidence that he lives in a fantasy world, divorced from reality.\n\nIf enacted, his proposal would end for-profit prisons, abolish the death penalty, end the war on drugs, set national standards for the use of force by police officers, give felons the right to vote, remove questions regarding conviction histories from job and other applications, legalize \u201csafe injection sites\u201d and needle exchanges, legalize marijuana and overturn past marijuana convictions, end cash bail and civil asset forfeiture, ban the prosecution of those under 18 as adults (no matter the crime, including murder), and cut the prison population in half.\n\nThe good news is, the proposals above at least fall inside the category of \u201ccriminal justice reform.\u201d Reasonable people can disagree, and will, about the efficacy of these proposals, but at least they all can be said to fall within the general vicinity of the discussion area.\n\nThe bad news is, those aren\u2019t the only proposals found in Mr. Sanders\u2019 plan. Inside his \u201ccriminal justice reform\u201d proposal he\u2019s also lumped in a liberal wish list of policy proposals that have absolutely nothing to do with criminal justice reform, but, maybe, just maybe, could ride in on the coat tails of the proposals that do.\n\nFor instance, his proposal would also cancel all existing student debt for public defenders, spend more than $25 billion to \u201cend homelessness,\u201d enact a federal jobs guarantee, guarantee a \u201cMedicare-for-all, single-payer\u201d health insurance program, enact a $15 minimum wage, \u201censure all Americans have access to basic financial services through the Post Office,\u201d \u201ccreate a $10 billion grant program within the Minority Business Development Agency to provide grants to entrepreneurs of color,\u201d and \u201cpass the WATER Act to create a $35 billion fund to remove and replace lead pipes\u201d around the country.\n\nExcuse me, but what does creating a $35 billion fund to remove and replace lead pipes around the country have to do with criminal justice reform? Is Mr. Sanders arguing that the lead made them do it?\n\nSpending $25 billion to \u201cend homelessness?\u201d How would that work, exactly? Free cash handouts to people on the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco? Or moving more taxpayer dollars to politically-connected developers to build low-cost housing \u2026 where, exactly?\n\nA federal jobs guarantee? In an era where our economy is performing so well that unemployment is at historic lows? As it stands now, we have more jobs open than workers to fill them. In other words, the labor market is a seller\u2019s market, where workers are in the enviable position of having employers bid against each other for their services, driving wages up. Like many of Mr. Sanders\u2019 proposals, this is a solution in search of a problem.\n\nEven inside the list of policy proposals that actually can be said to deal with some aspect of criminal justice reform, Mr. Sanders\u2019 wish list goes too far.\n\nFor example, abolishing the practice of trying some minors as adults, no matter what the crime. A few years ago, in the town where I live, two 17-year-old high school students were discovered plotting a Columbine-style massacre against their fellow students. They were tried and convicted, and each was sent to prison for 40 years. That\u2019s the kind of criminal justice with which I am familiar, and comfortable \u2013 and, I\u2019ll bet, so are the vast majority of my neighbors. Sometimes it\u2019s not the age of the criminal that matters, it\u2019s the severity of the crime.\n\nEnding capital punishment and giving felons the right to vote? Strong majorities oppose both \u2014 in a May Hill-HarrisX survey, 69 percent of those surveyed opposed the idea of giving prisoners the right to vote while they\u2019re incarcerated, and Gallup shows majority support for capital punishment going back 50 years.\n\nAnd, of course \u2026 single-payer health care, where all private insurance \u2014 including those gold-plated insurance plans won by unions after hard-fought negotiations \u2014 is eliminated, no matter how well a plan might serve its patients. It just wouldn\u2019t be a Bernie Sanders policy proposal if it didn\u2019t include that.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019 \u201ccriminal justice reform\u201d proposal proposes to change a lot more than the criminal justice system. The more he proposes, the more he reveals himself to be divorced from reality, living in a fantasy world.\n\n\u2022 Jenny Beth Martin is chairman of Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
