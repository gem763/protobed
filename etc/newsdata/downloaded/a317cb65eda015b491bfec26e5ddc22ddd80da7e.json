Incredibly, the $11 billion figure was considered a win for the utility as it was much less than the amount insurance companies were seeking.\n\n\u201cThese claims are based on payments made by insurance companies to individuals and businesses with insurance coverage for wildfire damages\u201d in those catastrophic blazes, PG&E said in announcing the deal. The utility says the tentative deal with a group of insurers covers about 85% of claims from those fires. While the $11 billion sum is large, it\u2019s far smaller than the roughly $20 billion that the insurance companies wanted, after paying out billions to California wildfire victims.\n\nHowever, this settlement is only part of the picture. The Sacramento Bee reports there is already a backlash from uninsured homeowners who believe PG&E just agreed to give away money that had been set aside for them. I know it\u2019s Friday but some light math is required in order for this to make sense:\n\nThe $11 billion is $2.5 billion more than what PG&E offered the insurance carriers Monday, when the utility outlined a proposal to pay insurers $8.5 billion and the individual victims $8.4 billion, for a total of $16.9 billion. Yet in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday, the company said it was raising the total payout by $1 billion, not $2.5 billion. That suggests the company is scaling back its offer to the individual victims by $1.5 billion, said Patrick McCallum, a wine country fire victim and head of the lobbying group Up from the Ashes. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly trying to squeeze victims,\u201d McCallum said.\n\nA spokesman for PG&E denied that the company was taking money from one pot to put it in another saying, \u201cThe pot could change.\u201d Maybe so, but the fact that the company is saying \u201cit could\u201d instead \u201cit has\u201d seems significant.\n\nPG&E is rushing to exit bankruptcy in time for a court-mandated deadline next June. That\u2019s the deadline for the company to join a \u201cwildfire insurance fund\u201d set up by the state. However, the company is also facing a potential hostile takeover:\n\nThe company is also trying to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by a group of hedge funds that hold PG&E bonds and are owed billions of dollars. The bondholders have proposed a rival plan in which they\u2019d pay wildfire claims and take control of as much as 95 percent of PG&E\u2019s stock at a steep discount. PG&E\u2019s reorganization plan would repay the bondholder hedge funds in full. Because of that, PG&E considers those debts \u201cunimpaired\u201d and ordinarily the bondholders wouldn\u2019t have the right to challenge the reorganization plan.\n\nThe bondholders disagree and could fight the current plan in court. So, PG&E has many more hurdles it needs to clear but today\u2019s settlement does represent some progress.\n\nThe Camp Fire is the deadliest wildfire in California\u2019s history. It killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 structures.", "description": "\"They\u2019re clearly trying to squeeze victims.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/PGE-power-lines.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
