Services leaders were the least optimistic about growth since just after the EU referendum in July 2016.\n\nThe data suggests the wider UK economy could be contracting, with performance also declining overall in services, manufacturing and construction for a second month in a row for only the first time in seven years.\n\nIt comes a day after the FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s biggest companies suffered its worst day of losses since 2016, falling further than other European indices.\n\nOne analyst said there was \u201clittle time or vision\u201d for a major turnaround this year, with heightened Brexit uncertainty hitting business investment and consumer spending in the run-up to Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date of 31 October. Another said it raised the chances of the Bank of England cutting interest rates.\n\nREAD MORE: UK factories suffer longest downturn since financial crisis\n\nFigures below 50 indicate a decline in trading conditions on a key index compiled by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS). Readings above 50 indicate growth.\n\nThe services figure came in at 49.5 for September on the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), down from 50.6 in August. It also marked an unexpected contraction when economists had expected growth, albeit weak, predicting a reading of 50.3\n\nBleak figures on Tuesday had also shown UK factory production shrank for a fifth month in a row in September, and similarly bleak figures across the eurozone and the US sparked a widespread sell-off on global stock markets.\n\nGlobal trade tensions and a slowdown in demand have been widely blamed for poor manufacturing performance, with the car industry suffering particularly hard. The US decision to slap tariffs on certain EU goods in a row over plane subsidies exacerbated the gloom.\n\nThe PMI figures for UK factories showed them facing the longest manufacturing downturn since the financial crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson set out his Brexit plans at the Conservative party conference.

In this last month before the Brexit deadline, there is little time or vision for a major turnaround in fortunes before the end of the year,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD MORE: UK construction stuck in \u2018devastating\u2019 downturn as Brexit deters building work\n\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, called the services decline \u201cominous,\u201d resulting from an \u201cinsidious weakening of demand\u201d over the past year rather than a sudden shock.\n\nHe said the surveys pointed to a fall in GDP by 0.1% in the third quarter, which would spell recession after a decline in the second quarter.\n\nHe suggested it could raise the chances of interest rate cuts, noting: \"The increasingly dire readings push the surveys further into territory that would normally be associated with policy stimulus from the Bank of England, suggesting a greater likelihood that the next move in interest rates will be a cut.\u201d", "description": "'Ominous' figures showed services firms shedding jobs at the fastest rate in nine years, with clients delaying orders over Brexit fears.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sqU7OIj1mZLvyj5ZLYT4aQ--~B/aD0zNzQ0O3c9NTYxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/4f256f20-e5b7-11e9-93f7-cd99ec4d6d71"}
