Sepsis, known as the \u2018silent killer\u2019, strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs. It is the leading cause of avoidable death, killing at least 44,000 a year, and the Daily Mail has long campaigned for more awareness. If caught early, the infection can be controlled by antibiotics before the body goes into overdrive - ultimately leading to death within a matter of minutes. But the early symptoms of sepsis can be easily confused with more mild conditions, meaning it can be difficult to diagnose. Sepsis has similar symptoms to flu, gastroenteritis and a chest infection. These include: S lurred speech or confusion\n\nlurred speech or confusion E xtreme shivering or muscle pain\n\nxtreme shivering or muscle pain P assing no urine in a day\n\nassing no urine in a day S evere breathlessness\n\nevere breathlessness I t feels like you are dying\n\nt feels like you are dying S kin mottled or discoloured Symptoms in children are: Fast breathing\n\nFits or convulsions\n\nMottled, bluish or pale skin\n\nRashes that do not fade when pressed\n\nLethargy\n\nFeeling abnormally cold\n\nIt was previously thought that Ellis will leave Emmerdale to join his mum Jessie in Dubai.\n\nOne wrote: 'Oh!
