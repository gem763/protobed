This book of short stories, the author\u2019s first, refuses to define itself as any one thing. Instead, Smith allows each story to take on a tone, genre and life of its own.\n\nThe book moves between narrative-driven stories and unique experimental pieces. In one, Smith takes readers on a journey through a metaphor masquerading as a lazy river. In another, she dissects a child\u2019s \u201cNarrative Techniques\u201d worksheet in a way that will make readers begin to see meaning in places they never before thought to look.\n\nIn others still, readers meet a drag queen fighting for equal treatment inside a corset emporium, a couple in the throes of an addiction-triggered divorce, a jaded family watching the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and a train rider who contemplates the way headphones allow people to turn themselves off to the world.\n\nThe stories can be heavy, yet they also take on a tone of slight whimsy that makes them feel both real and fantastical all at once, the same way that these days, reality so often feels.\n\nThroughout the book, there are moments when Smith seems to be talking directly to the readers, letting them know, for example, when she is using devices like metaphor or dramatic irony. While for some writers this tactic could risk a jarring effect, in Smith\u2019s hands it feels appropriately playful and seems to create more intimacy between her and the readers. It\u2019s as if she is reminding readers that she knows they are there, that the book is a conversation, that amid all of the real chaos and struggle that her stories reference, we\u2019re in this together.\n\nAt times, this wild ride that Smith takes readers on is a delight to experience. Her characters are vivid and unique, as are her observations about the state of the world. At other times, the stories can get complex, and it\u2019s not always easy to grasp their meaning. Still, it\u2019s well worth spending time with Smith, examining and dissecting the way things are, the way things were and the way things could become.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Grand Union: Stories,\" Penguin, by Zadie Smith", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Molly Sprayregen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/book_review_grand_union_92751_c0-878-1875-1971_s1770x1032.jpg?74d9889e760849ad24e1a9344ac67f54e81798b1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
