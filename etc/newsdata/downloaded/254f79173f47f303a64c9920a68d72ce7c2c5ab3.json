At the time, my work actually made me less afraid. I genuinely liked many of the guys and knew they respected me, even felt protective of me. Walking home afterwards I felt a sense of security \u2013 false, perhaps \u2013 that I wouldn\u2019t be attacked by a man who knew I had the phone number of his parole officer. I felt, and still feel, safe, comfortable, and at home around men.\n\nanxy magazine illustration \u2013 man in window\n\nBut in other ways I\u2019ve become more pessimistic. After reading about hundreds upon hundreds of victimizations, it begins to feel inevitable and unstoppable. Men seem to pose a terrible threat. My husband, my male colleagues, my friends \u2013 they all live in the same world with James, Jay, and the others I have to evaluate.\n\nProfessionally, though, I know different. Yes, a small percentage of men who commit sex crimes are incapable of empathy; or worse, take pleasure in the suffering of those they violate. But most sex offenders are not psychopaths. They are men raised in a horrible system \u2013 frequently having suffered trauma, or abuse, or both \u2013 who lack the tools to navigate their emotions, and end up traumatizing others as a result. Or they are men who have paraphilic desires \u2013 that is, recurrent, intense, distressing, arousing fantasies that involve objects, suffering, humiliation, children, or a lack of consent \u2013but have too much shame to seek the help they need to make sure they don\u2019t hurt other people.", "description": "", "authors": ["Samantha Smithstein", "Theguardian.Com World Oct Sex-Offenders-Psychology-Not-All-Men"], "top_image": ""}
