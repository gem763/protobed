A direct Google translation, validated by multiple users, reads:\n\nWe express our strong indignation and condemnation of the events in the Hearthstone Asia-Pacific competition last weekend and resolutely oppose the dissemination of personal political ideas in any event. The involved players will be banned and the relevant explanations will be immediately terminated by any official work. At the same time, we will, as always, resolutely safeguard national dignity.\n\nGods Unchained developers Immutable, who promised to reimburse Ng Wai Chung for his lost winnings in a public statement against Chinese censorship, has faced cyberattack by presently unidentified sources. Former Blizzard fans are expressing their opinion of the company on the r/Hearthstone subreddit, employing Photoshop and exhorting the community at large not to \u201clet this die.\u201d\n\nAnd Blizzard is making it easy: Recently, the Dallas Morning News reported that \u201can assistant coach in Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch League was instructed to delete a tweet criticizing Blizzard\u2019s punishment.\u201d Thus far, there is no indication that Blizzard has even considered backing down.", "description": "Blizzard faced harsh criticism for appeasing China from U.S senators on both sides of the aisle this week.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hong-kong-protest-stepping-on-xi-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
