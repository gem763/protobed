Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denies it. Neither seem to understand that it\u2019s not up to Washington.\n\nTrump \u201cimpulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military,\u201d Biden tweeted on Wednesday, accusing President Donald Trump of a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Kurdish fighters that helped the US defeat Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).\n\nTwo days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences\u2014Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It\u2019s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, & leaves us less safe. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 9, 2019\n\nThe \u201cgreen light\u201d phrasing also found its way to most mainstream media outlets. Later in the day, Judy Woodruff of PBS NewsHour treated it as an established fact, asking Pompeo to comment on the Turkish operation in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cDoes the US take responsibility for whatever the outcome is, because the US has given Turkey a green light?\u201d asked Woodruff.\n\n\u201cWell, that's just false. The United States didn't give Turkey a green light,\u201d Pompeo replied.\n\n.@JudyWoodruff: Does the US take responsibility for whatever the outcome is, because the US has given Turkey a green light? @SecPompeo: Yeah, well that's just false. The United States didn't give Turkey a green light.\n\n\n\n(He was given time to expand on that... he did not.) \u2014 Ali Rogin (@AliRogin) October 9, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s technically correct. As Turkey launched \u2018Operation Peace Spring,\u2019 bombing Kurdish targets in northern Syria on Wednesday, Trump issued a statement calling it \u201ca bad idea\u201d and warning Ankara that it was now responsible not just for the safety of civilians in the area, but the fate of IS prisoners.\n\nHowever, the real issue isn\u2019t whether Washington did or did not give Ankara the \u201cgreen light\u201d for its military adventure. The question no one in Washington or the legacy media seems to be asking is whether such permission was up to the US to give \u2013 because the obvious answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkey bombs Syria: Erdogan begins \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019\n\nAmerican politicians and pundits of all stripes love to talk about the \u201crules-based international order,\u201d but one of the actual, written rules of that order is that the world consists of sovereign nation-states, one of which is Syria. Both the US and Turkey have had troops in Syria for years. Yet neither has been invited by the Syrian government \u2013 unlike, say, Russia, which has had an expeditionary force there on request from Damascus since 2015.\n\nOnly Damascus, or the UN Security Council, can legitimately give the \u201cgreen light\u201d for a military intervention in Syrian territory. Neither has done so.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
