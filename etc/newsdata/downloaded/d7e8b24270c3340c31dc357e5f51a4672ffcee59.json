Beto O\u2019Rourke blasted Facebook for allowing Trump\u2019s re-election campaign to post a misleading attack ad against Joe Biden on the platform, vowing that as president he would look to place the same restrictions on social media platforms that exist for publishers. That could mean, for instance, seeking to erase tech companies' immunity from lawsuits over user-posted content. \u201cWe would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nThe fiery exchanges represent an escalation of the war of words against Silicon Valley among the field of 2020 presidential contenders, marking the first time in months of Democratic debates that tech criticism has emerged as a major point of discussion. Frustration with the industry is already boiling over in Washington, but several candidates have made major campaign planks out of vows to turn up the heat on the tech sector if elected.\n\nThose calls continued Wednesday night at the fourth Democratic Presidential Debate, moderated by CNN and The New York Times, where candidates took turns airing their long list of grievances against industry giants.\n\nFormer tech entrepreneur-turned-critic Andrew Yang kicked off the bashing session early on, jabbing Amazon for not paying any federal income taxes in 2018 and suggesting it and other tech titans like Google and Facebook should face a stiffer tax bill. That argument has become a frequent line of attack by not just Yang but also top contenders Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who have unveiled plans to raise taxes on massive corporations like Amazon.\n\nThey also pointed to the vanishing of jobs from wide swaths of the U.S. economy as online commerce and automation take hold \u2014 a trend that has included factory workers and brick-and-mortar retailers but could someday include truckers sidelined by self-driving semis.\n\nThe hits later turned to longstanding Democratic criticisms that social media companies have allowed Trump to get away with breaking their policies against hate speech, disinformation and targeted harassment with impunity.\n\nHarris, who recently called on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account over a series of incendiary tweets, said it's a \u201cgrave injustice when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and particularly when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s Twitter page. \u201cIt is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.\u201d\n\nBut even as candidates found agreement calling for more scrutiny of Silicon Valley heavyweights, they diverged on how to go about cracking down on those companies.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, for one, said it wasn\u2019t a candidate\u2019s place to call for the break up for a specific company, like Warren has done. But instead, he said, \u201cWe need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road\u201d for the digital companies, including setting restrictions for how they handle users\u2019 personal information online.\n\nYang similarly expressed skepticism about the push to break up the major companies, saying that that action alone won\u2019t \u201crevive main street businesses around the country.\u201d But he did suggest that taxing tech giants higher could fund programs like his signature proposal to give every citizen $1,000 a month as a universal basic income.\n\n\"If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot-truck mile, every Facebook ad \u2014 we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlexandra S.
