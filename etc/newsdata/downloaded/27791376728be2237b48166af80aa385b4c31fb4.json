(You can watch the full video at the end of this story.) Researchers at the Science and Global Security lab at Princeton University created the animation, which shows how a battle between Russia and NATO allies that uses so-called low-yield or \"tactical\" nuclear weapons\u2014 which can pack a blast equivalent to those the US used to destroy Hiroshima or Nagasaki in World War II \u2014 might feasibly and quickly snowball into a global nuclear war.\n\n\"This project is motivated by the need to highlight the potentially catastrophic consequences of current US and Russian nuclear war plans. The risk of nuclear war has increased dramatically in the past two years,\" the project states on its website.\n\nThe video has an ominous, droning soundtrack and a digital map design straight out of the 1983 movie \"WarGames.\" The Cold War-era movie, in which a young Matthew Broderick accidentally triggers a nuclear war, \"was exactly the reference point,\" simulation designer Alex Wellerstein told Insider.\n\nBut while simulations can be frightening, they can also be incredibly helpful: governments can use them to develop contingency plans to respond to nuclear disasters and attacks in the least escalatory way, and they can also help ordinary citizens learn how to survive a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Plan A\" comes as tensions between Russia and NATO allies ratchet up. Both Russia and the US are testing weapons previously banned under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, often called INF. Russian bombers have also cruised into US airspace repeatedly, and the US recently sent its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber on a mission in the Arctic\u2014 right in Russia's backyard.\n\nThis is how a NATO-Russian confrontation could quickly escalate into nuclear war.", "description": "\"Plan A\" is a hypothetical yet eerily plausible scenario imagined by nuclear weapons experts.
