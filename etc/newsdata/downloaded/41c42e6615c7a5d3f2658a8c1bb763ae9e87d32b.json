They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\"\n\nOn Friday, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Politico that she was referring to the Gabbard.\n\nMerrill did not respond to a request for comment but has published negative tweets about Gabbard in recent days.\n\n\"Assad day for your candidacy,\" he wrote snidely in a retweet of her comments slamming Clinton, referring to a controversial meeting Gabbard said she held with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a trip to that country.\n\nOn Oct. 10, after Gabbard suggested that she might boycott the party's Ohio debate, Merrill tweeted, \"I'm seriously considering watching if you promise you won't be there.\"\n\nGabbard, who is a veteran, has not polled above single digits in the race for the Democrats' nomination. Despite her liberal views on most issues, she has won praise from some Trump supporters and conservative Fox News hosts, as well as Russian state media and its online surrogates.\n\nShe is a fierce opponent of what she calls \"forever wars,\" and her candidacy has also been praised by liberals including some supporters of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.", "description": "Gabbard calls Clinton 'personification of the rot' as war of words heats up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I001_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
