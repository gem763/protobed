The gist: While the freshman representative was running for office, she and her husband were mutually involved in an extramarital relationship with a female campaign staffer \u2014 a liaison Hill has since acknowledged. Her husband also alleged that, once in office, Hill had an affair with a male staffer \u2014 which she denied.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stories weren\u2019t presented as breaking news so much as humiliation bombs: They included multiple naked photos of Hill, plus revelations that her estranged husband had shared such images under online threads called \u201cwifesharing,\u201d and other X-rated unprintable terms. The inclusion of photographic \u201cevidence\u201d was unnecessary by any measure. The photos did not, after all, address the matter of whether Hill had abused her position \u2014 the only germane issue, given conversations we\u2019ve all been having about workplace power dynamics and coercion. The point of the images was to imply that Hill was a kinky slut. The point was shame.\n\nHill knew she\u2019d erred: \u201cEven a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate,\u201d she wrote in a statement when the story broke last week. But her resignation Sunday evening was clearly a preemptive move: She said that her \u201cabusive\u201d husband had released the photos in a \u201csmear campaign,\u201d and she didn\u2019t know how many more might follow. \u201cI know that as long as I\u2019m in Congress we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d\n\nSigh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHill erred. But it\u2019s hard to denounce her infractions when the people trumpeting them are such ghouls. It would be so much easier to applaud her resignation if it had come after a congressional investigation \u2014 one was already underway \u2014 instead of coming as a result of revenge porn.\n\nHere are some phrases that are pertinent to parsing out the ethics of Katie Hill\u2019s behavior: Power dynamics. Improper relationship. Potential special favors? Potential misuse of campaign funds? Official congressional rules related to lawmaker/staffer relationships.\n\nHere are some phrases that are not pertinent: Throuple. Wifesharing. Bikini line. Naked hairbrushing. Lesbian affair.\n\nAD\n\nThe first set of phrases is about figuring out whether Hill should have resigned. The second is about how many pearls we get to clutch as she shows herself the door.\n\nAD\n\nWhile we\u2019re having this discussion, we could point out a few things. We could point out that Hill\u2019s fellow California representative, Republican Duncan D. Hunter, was indicted on a charge of using campaign funds to support extramarital affairs with five women (five!), and still hasn\u2019t stepped down.\n\nOr we could get into the fact that it was only last year that the House began prohibiting relationships between representatives and staffers. And after decades of male politicians getting away with it, it\u2019s a major eyeroll that one of the first to be punished is an openly bisexual millennial woman.\n\nAD\n\nOr we could just keep it simple: The current president of the United States is alleged to have paid off a porn star to keep their affair quiet.\n\nWe could point all of these things out, and I guess I just did, but then we\u2019d be having a discussion not about right and wrong but about tit for tat: Who we\u2019ll make pay, but only if we\u2019ve extracted the same toll from someone else. Whose failure to be a decent human now excuses another lawmaker\u2019s failure to be a decent human.\n\nAD\n\nKatie Hill was pushed out for all the wrong reasons, but she\u2019s trying to do the decent human thing now. She\u2019s acknowledging that elected officials can and should be held to higher standards. She\u2019s sparing her constituents the drama of an investigation and grotesque news cycle, realizing that they deserve good governance, not a distracting scandal.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s all admirable, isn\u2019t it? She was right to step down. Goose/gander, etc. She made a mistake and had to set an example.\n\nBlah blah blah, blah blah blah.\n\nRead more by Monica Hesse:\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.
