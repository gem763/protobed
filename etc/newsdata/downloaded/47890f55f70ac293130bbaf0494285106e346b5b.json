They play the Czech Republic in Prague on Friday and then at the Vasil Levski national stadium in Bulgaria, which will have a reduced capacity by orders of Uefa because of racial abuse during the games against the Czechs and Kosovo in June.\n\nThe FA said that the players\u2019 agreement was to follow the Uefa protocol: that racial abuse is reported first to the referee, who calls for a stadium announcement, and if that fails to solve the problem, the players are taken off the pitch. The FA says that the players will then be consulted on the final step: a discussion with Uefa and the officials as to whether they will go back onto the pitch.\n\nAbraham said the squad had held \u201cseveral meetings\u201d, with Kane supporting the approach that the team reach their own decision. \u201cHarry Kane even said that if it happens and we\u2019re not happy with it, we speak to the player [concerned] and if he\u2019s not happy, we all come off the pitch together,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cIt\u2019s a team thing. Don\u2019t isolate one person, we\u2019re a whole team. If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHarry Kane did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps, if we decide that we want to stop the game \u2013 no matter what the score is \u2013 if we\u2019re not happy with it, as a team we\u2019ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.\u201d\n\nAbraham also said the players would allow Uefa to try to bring the situation under control. Asked whether it should be one strike or three for offenders, he said: \u201cFor me, personally, I think it\u2019s just one strike because it gives people excuses. One time, twice, three times \u2013 it gives silly people excuses. Like we were all saying [on Monday], if it happens and let\u2019s say there\u2019s a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.\u201d", "description": "Tammy Abraham, the Chelsea striker, says the England team will walk off the pitch in Sofia on Monday if one of them is racially abused from the stands and the players feel that the Uefa protocol designed to combat it proves ineffective.", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Chief Football Writer", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212437309-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMkNVuEiQYtpaGCtNshjkEPH8-_HtBp0fqcrb03eEqB8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
