The Tuscaloosa News reports the money will be used for safety improvements in 250 homes in the city. Tuscaloosa is the only Alabama city to receive money under a $314 million program overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Money is going to 77 state and local agencies nationwide. Lead paint is sometimes found in the paint that\u2019s in older homes, and exposure to the metal can cause damage to the brain and nervous system in children. Officials in Tuscaloosa will work with housing agencies, medical and social service providers to identify homes with lead-based hazards.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A new report by a nonpartisan watchdog group says the U.S. Forest Service has lost nearly $600 million through its management of the Tongass National Forest. Coast Alaska reports the study by Taxpayers for Common Sense calculates the service\u2019s losses through roadbuilding and timber sales. The report says the average net loss has been about $30 million annually over the past 20 years. The group cites a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office detailing the average annual cost of the Tongass timber program without factoring the cost of building access roads. The group projects a net loss of at least $180 million despite the Forest Service projecting the availability of an additional 300 million feet of boards in the next four years.\n\nArizona\n\nThe Little Colorado River, about a half-mile from where it empties into the much larger Colorado River in northeastern Arizona. (Photo: Lisa Winters/Grand Canyon Trust via AP)\n\nFlagstaff: A Colorado River tributary in northeastern Arizona is being eyed for power generation. A newly formed Phoenix company wants to put up dams on the Little Colorado River. Pumped Hydro Storage LLC is seeking approval from the federal government to study sites on the Navajo Nation. Nothing would happen without the tribe\u2019s approval. Tribal President Jonathan Nez says the Navajo Nation would need to consider the impacts of the proposals on water, the economy and the environment and hear from those living in the area. Environmentalists say the protection of sacred sites, an endangered fish and the serenity of the larger Grand Canyon region is at stake. The hydropower industry says there\u2019s renewed interest in pumped storage facilities to supplement wind and solar energy.\n\nArkansas\n\nMayor Frank Scott speaks at a press conference Monday in Little Rock, Ark. (Photo: Andrew Demillo/AP)\n\nLittle Rock: The mayor on Monday proposed returning local control to the city\u2019s schools after a state plan to grant only limited authority sparked fears that the district could revert to a racially divided, \u201cseparate but equal\u201d system 62 years after the desegregation of Central High School. Mayor Frank Scott proposed forming a temporary school board appointed by the city and state to run the district from January until a local board is elected in November 2020. Arkansas has been in control of the 23,000-student district since January 2015, when the district was taken over because of low test scores at several schools. Scott asked the state Board of Education to take up the proposal when it meets this week and said he also has discussed it with Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Education Secretary Johnny Key.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPharmacist Clint Hopkins displays the HIV prevention drug Truvada at Pucci\u2019s Pharmacy in Sacramento, Calif., on Monday. (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nSacramento: Pharmacists in the state will be able to dispense HIV prevention pills to patients without a doctor\u2019s prescription after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation Monday that supporters say will greatly reduce the spread of infection. Advocates of Senate Bill 159 say California is the first state to authorize pre-exposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP, and post-exposure prophylaxis, known as PEP, without prescriptions. California is already considered a leader in AIDS prevention, they say. PrEP is a once-daily pill for HIV-negative people, while PEP is a medication that people take to prevent the virus from taking hold. Supporters say PEP significantly reduces the risk of infection, but only if started within 72 hours of exposure to the virus. Not everyone can get to a doctor in that time frame, says Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A group of demonstrators against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement disrupted a City Council meeting after breaking out in chants. The Sentinel reports that the Aurora City Council meeting was briefly suspended Monday after some council members left their seats while police escorted demonstrators outside. Authorities say anti-ICE protesters made multiple demands of the city during public comment, including ending the use of city resources to help ICE, prohibiting participation in ICE functions and barring police from profiling prior to making stops. Officials say the city doesn\u2019t invest funds in private prisons, and officers do not participate in ICE arrests, according to department policy.\n\nConnecticut\n\nA grave marker at the Northwood Cemetery in Windsor, Conn. (Photo: Lt. Paul Cicero/Hartford Police Department via AP)\n\nWindsor: Authorities exhumed the bodies Monday of two victims of the 1944 Hartford circus fire in the hopes of determining whether one of them is a woman who is among five people still listed as missing after the tragedy. The exhumations at Northwood Cemetery in Windsor occurred about 2 miles from the site of the big top fire that killed 168 people and injured 682 others. Forensic experts at the chief medical examiner\u2019s office will try to determine whether one of the two unidentified women was 47-year-old Grace Fifield, of Newport, Vermont, who was never seen again after attending the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 6, 1944. Officials will compare DNA samples taken from the remains to ones provided by Fifield\u2019s granddaughter, Sandra Sumrow.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Five of the state\u2019s previous governors and two of its former chief justices are backing Gov. John Carney in his attempt to preserve a Delaware law that requires a political balance among state court judges. The former officials have filed legal briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Carney, who has asked the court to reverse a federal court decision that struck down the state constitutional provision that requires Carney to split judicial nominations and judgeships between the two major political parties. Former Govs. Jack Markell, Ruth Ann Minner, Tom Carper, Dale Wolf and Michael Castle filed a brief to back Carney. Former Delaware Chief Justices Myron T. Steele and E. Norman Veasey filed a separate brief in support of Carney. Seventeen law professors from across the country filed a third supporting brief.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Lawmakers in the district are considering a tax on sugary drinks containing \u201cnatural common sweeteners.\u201d The Washington Post reports the bill proposed Monday by council member Brianne K. Nadeau would levy a 1.5 cent-per-ounce excise tax on the sweet drinks. It wouldn\u2019t apply to alcohol, milk, all-natural juices or drinks with artificial sweeteners, such as diet soda. The newspaper notes this would be one of the highest taxes on sugary drinks in the nation. The bill would replace the city\u2019s recently passed 2% additional sales tax on soft drinks. Researchers say higher sales taxes don\u2019t affect consumer decisions, as the extra cost is added at the register, after a consumer has already picked their product. An excise cost would be imposed on distributors, who would then raise sticker prices.\n\nFlorida\n\nKathie Dee walks past dead fish at Seagate Beach on Oct. 1 in Naples, Fla. Collier County officials have been receiving reports of fish kills as red tide season looms. (Photo: Wangyuxuan Xu/Naples Daily News)\n\nSt. Petersburg: Scientists say toxic red tide is back in the waters off the state\u2019s southwest coast after fading away earlier this year following a 15-month bloom. Biologists at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute said Friday that samples taken from the waters off the shore of Collier County found high concentrations of the toxic algae where they also received reports of dead fish and cases of respiratory irritation. Red tide is a natural occurrence that happens due to the presence of nutrients in salt water and an organism called a dinoflagellate. The 15-month bloom caused respiratory irritation in people and killed sea turtles, manatees, dolphins and fish. Scientists also observed low concentrations of the red tide algae in Lee County, according to the institute\u2019s red tide status report.\n\nGeorgia\n\nOprah Winfrey says she\u2019s giving $13 million to increase a scholarship endowment at Morehouse College, an all-male, historically black college in Atlanta. (Photo: Michel Euler/AP)\n\nAtlanta: Oprah Winfrey says she\u2019s giving $13 million to increase a scholarship endowment at a historically black college. Winfrey announced her plan Monday at Morehouse College, adding to the $12 million she gave to the all-male college 30 years ago. She was meeting with 47 students already benefiting from the existing endowment. Morehouse President David Thomas says Winfrey\u2019s endowment has paid to educate almost 600 students over the past three decades. Winfrey\u2019s announcement came weeks after Morehouse announced it would cut some employee salaries and retirement contributions to increase student aid and would also eliminate some jobs. Billionaire Robert Smith won wide notice earlier this year when he promised to repay all student and family loans accumulated by Morehouse\u2019s class of 2019. That one-time gift will be worth $34 million.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A county agency has found nearly 10% of tsunami warning sirens on Hawaii Island are inoperable. West Hawaii Today reports Hawaii County Civil Defense made the determination following an Oct. 1 test of the Big Island\u2019s outdoor warning system. Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno says nine of the 92 sirens installed in communities around the island did not work during the test. The sirens warn people to move to high ground when an approaching tsunami is detected. Civil defense sends tsunami alerts via cellphone, but not all areas have reliable service, nor are all residents registered. Magno says the state Emergency Management Agency is responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of sirens across Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The city has closed a day shelter for homeless families and plans on moving some funding to Interfaith Sanctuary Shelter, which will begin offering day-shelter services seven days a week this month. Interfaith Sanctuary Jodi Peterson-Stigers told the Idaho Statesman shelter officials hope to reduce the trauma families experience from having nowhere to go on the weekends. Boise spokesman Mike Journee says attendance at the city day shelter has been declining since Interfaith Sanctuary opened its day shelter in late 2017, so it made sense to close the city facility and rely on Interfaith Sanctuary for the service. The city plans to lease the site of its former shelter to Jesse Tree, a private nonprofit that provides assistance to low-income people struggling to pay rent or facing eviction.\n\nIllinois\n\nAurora: An overnight fire has destroyed a historic Masonic temple that was abandoned more than a decade ago. The fire began about 10 p.m. Monday in the Lincoln Masonic Temple in the Chicago suburb about 40 miles west of Chicago. A portion of the building collapsed onto power lines, cutting power to some homes as firefighters worked to douse the flames. Aurora Fire Chief Gary Krienitz tells WLS-TV the building\u2019s structural integrity was a big challenge for crews. The 50,000-square-foot building was built in 1922 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It\u2019s been empty since 2008, when it was last used as a banquet hall. Aurora officials then shut the building down due to potentially hazardous conditions.\n\nIndiana\n\nA load of frozen bagels that ended up toasted and strewn along Interstate 65 near Rensselaer, Ind. (Photo: Trooper Mason Wiley/Indiana State Police via AP)\n\nRensselaer: Thousands of bagels went from frozen to toasted Sunday evening after a semi hauling the beloved breakfast item went up in flames. An off-duty Indiana State Police trooper saw a semi driving north on I-65 that was smoking heavily from its rear axle, according to the Indiana State Police. By the time the trooper arrived at the truck, its brakes were engulfed in flames, and the fire was spreading to the trailer itself. The rear tires of the semi also exploded due to the heat from the brake fire, state police said. The driver was eventually able to disconnect the tractor from the trailer, and the fire was extinguished. The semi was carrying 38,000 pounds of frozen bagels, state police said. The fire closed the right lane of northbound I-65 near Rensselaer until about 1 a.m. Monday.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The city has become the first in the state to approve a measure banning the city and many businesses from asking about applicants\u2019 criminal records in early stages of the hiring process. The City Council approved the so-called ban-the-box ordinance, which doesn\u2019t let employers ask about an applicant\u2019s criminal history until after making a conditional job offer, according to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The measure is intended to ensure people with criminal convictions get a fair chance of getting jobs by encouraging employers not to discard applications only because potential workers check a box stating they have been convicted of a crime. Similar measures have been passed in dozens of cities around the country, but Waterloo is the first city in Iowa to approve such an ordinance.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The state\u2019s second-largest city has passed an ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. KCUR reports that the City Council in this Kansas City suburb passed the measure Monday with a 10-1 vote. The new ordinance prevents residents and employees from being denied housing, employment or services from businesses because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Backers were overjoyed. Brett Hoedl, of Equality Kansas of Metro Kansas City, said it could create pressure for adoption of a statewide law. Nearly two dozen states outlaw discrimination against someone because they are LGBTQ. Missouri and Kansas aren\u2019t among them. Council Member Dave White voted for the ordinance but said he wanted more teeth in the legislation. The ordinance allows fines of up to $1,000.\n\nKentucky\n\nThis young elephant calf at the Louisville Zoo in Louisville, Ky., needs a name, and it looks like it\u2019ll be Fitz, Rocket or Walt. (Photo: Kyle L. Shepherd via AP)\n\nLouisville: A young elephant calf born this summer has just about everything he needs, except a name. But he\u2019s a step closer to getting one. The Louisville Zoo has announced three finalists: Fitz, Rocket and Walt. A Monday zoo statement says that more than 15,000 names were submitted for the calf born Aug. 2. Kristin Hays of Prospect submitted \u201cFitz\u201d after her great-grandfather, who loved elephants. Tatyana Malkin\u2019s 9-year-old daughter, Sofia, asked her to submit \u201cRocket\u201d to go with the zoo\u2019s recently named bongo, \u201cGroot,\u201d both from the movie \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d and Taylor Barr of Meade County submitted \u201cWalt\u201d after Walt Disney. Zoo visitors can drop coins or bills in a kiosk to vote at the zoo, or vote online with credit card donations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards is the only Democratic governor in the Deep South. (Photo: Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP)\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards is battling to hold onto the Democrats\u2019 only governorship in the Deep South, with an onslaught of national GOP firepower aimed at ousting him. Republicans see Edwards\u2019 2015 victory as a fluke and believe they can recapture the governor\u2019s mansion in a state with no other Democratic statewide elected officials. But the moderate Edwards is an anti-abortion, pro-gun former Army ranger. And he is proving remarkably resilient deep in the heart of Trump country. Edwards is leading in the polls, within striking distance of outright victory in Saturday\u2019s primary, when all candidates run against each other on the same ballot. National Republican leaders are barnstorming the state trying to energize GOP voters and keep Edwards from claiming enough cross-party support to top 50%.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Marijuana enthusiasts in the Pine Tree State will probably be able to purchase their preferred products in retail stores by March 2020 after years of waiting. Voters approved legal adult-use marijuana at the polls in November 2016, and the road to legal sales has been long and bumpy. The state\u2019s Office of Marijuana Policy says a key act passed by the Legislature is now in effect, and that means the office is in a position to complete final adoption of Maine\u2019s marijuana rules. The act made tweaks to Maine\u2019s Marijuana Legalization Act that were necessary for the marijuana office to adopt the rules, which it is expected to do within two months. That means it will probably be able to accept applications for retail marijuana sales by the end of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A City Council committee has modified a proposed ban of plastic bags to focus on particularly thin plastic. The Baltimore Sun reports the Judiciary Committee voted 4-2 Monday to amend the proposed ban to apply only to bags thinner than about two-thousandths of an inch. The newspaper says the move upset bill sponsor Councilman Bill Henry and environmentalists, who say the bags are barely distinguishable from thinner grocery bags. Retailers argue the thin bags are reusable. Henry says retailers could just continue to use plastic bags under the amended language, and the added thickness of permitted bags wouldn\u2019t be enough to encourage their reuse.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMakeeba McCreary, left, chief of learning and community engagement for Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, and student actor Jennifer Rosa present a video describing a new protocol for student group visits at the museum, Oct. 2 in Boston. (Photo: Elise Amendola/AP)\n\nBoston: Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts has been scrambling to make amends since black students were mistreated on a class trip in May. The world-class museum was accused of racism after students said they were harangued by white patrons and a staff member who allegedly told the children: \u201cNo food, no drink and no watermelon.\u201d Makeeba McCreary, MFA\u2019s chief of learning and community engagement, says the museum has doubled down on efforts to be a more diverse, inclusive place. In addition to banning two patrons and launching an internal investigation and an independent review, the MFA has created a new position: senior director of inclusion. It\u2019s given over an entire wing to female artists in \u201cWomen Take the Floor,\u201d an exhibition timed to coincide with next year\u2019s centennial of U.S. women winning the right to vote. And this month, for the first time, it\u2019ll open its doors for free to celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nMichigan\n\nKirtland's warbler (Photo: Roger Eriksson/Michigan Audubon)\n\nDetroit: At its darkest hour, in the early 1950s, fewer than 20 male Kirtland\u2019s warblers were counted in the world. Today, after a concerted recovery effort by federal and state wildlife management agencies, conservation groups and the timber industry, the black-and-gray songbird with a yellow underbelly, a uniquely Michigan-centric species, has more than 2,000 nesting pairs. As a result, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday removed the bird from the federal list of endangered species. Kirtland\u2019s warblers have historically nested in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The birds require very specific conditions \u2013 large stands of young, dense jack pine forest. If the trees are older, the birds, for some reason, won\u2019t use them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is threatening to sue the city for trying to force it to pay $530,000 in security costs for this week\u2019s rally. Trump\u2019s campaign accused Mayor Jacob Frey, who has been critical of the president, of \u201cconjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security\u201d at Thursday\u2019s rally at Target Center. The campaign said arena management attempted to pass the costs to the campaign under threat of withholding use of the arena. It also said the sum was far more than that for a 2009 health care rally at the building by President Barack Obama. The Star Tribune says the city based its estimate on methodology for past major events like the 2018 Super Bowl and Final Four. Frey said when Trump\u2019s rally was announced last month that Trump\u2019s \u201cmessage of hatred\u201d was unwelcome.\n\nMississippi\n\nAnti-abortion activist Doug Lane calls out to a woman driving into the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization clinic in Jackson, Miss., on Oct. 2. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis/AP)\n\nJackson: A federal court that rejected the state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban should have let the state present evidence about whether a fetus experiences pain, an attorney for the state argued Monday. But a lawyer for Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic said the Supreme Court has been clear that a woman has a right to have an abortion before the fetus is viable. The arguments came during a hearing at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on a Mississippi law that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It\u2019s one of many laws pushed by conservative states in recent years, aimed at trying to persuade the increasingly conservative Supreme Court to further restrict the amount of time when abortion is legally available, or even to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The city has banned so-called conversion therapy for minors. The Columbia Daily Tribune reports the City Council voted unanimously Monday to become the first in the state to ban the practice. \u201cConversion therapy\u201d is the scientifically discredited practice of using therapy to \u201cconvert\u201d LGBTQ people to heterosexuality or traditional gender expectations. A Democratic state lawmaker proposed a statewide ban on the practice during this year\u2019s annual legislative session. But the bill didn\u2019t get a hearing in the Republican-led Legislature. Columbia is home to the University of Missouri System\u2019s flagship campus and trends more liberal than many other areas of the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHarlem: The City Council has voted to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day. The Billings Gazette reports Harlem passed a resolution last month to join Missoula, Bozeman and Helena as Montana cities that have changed the name of the federal holiday that will be marked next Monday. Harlem is located just outside the Fort Belknap Reservation. Columbus Day recognizes Christopher Columbus, whose 1492 voyage spurred European colonization of the Americas. Native Americans say celebrating Columbus ignores the atrocities and violence inflicted on their ancestors. The Montana House passed a bill in 2019 to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day statewide, but it died in a Senate committee.\n\nNebraska\n\nTerrytown: City Council members have decided to put off indefinitely a proposed ordinance that would have barred anyone from feeding geese or other wild critters inside city limits. The council had scheduled a third and final reading and vote last week. But City Attorney Libby Stobel told the council Thursday that the proposal conflicts with a proposed zoning change that would allow residents to keep up to eight hens, either chicken, duck or turkey. The Scottsbluff Star-Herald reports that Stobel says the proposed ordinance defines ducks as waterfowl, so if the proposal were to be passed, people would be allowed to own ducks but not feed them. Stobel recommended that before more discussion, council members should determine whether the ordinance was worth pursuing. They voted 4-0 to stop any further consideration of the measure.\n\nNevada\n\nMount Rose Summit near Reno, Nev., under snow overlooking Lake Tahoe on March 4. (Photo: Benjamin Spillman and Sam Gross)\n\nReno: Maintaining the state\u2019s status as keeper of the highest year-round highway pass in the Sierra Nevada might get a little more difficult this winter, but the Nevada Department of Transportation insists it is up to the task. The department has concerns about the reliability of a remote-operated system that uses propane-powered blasts to trigger controlled avalanches on Nevada State Route 431 at the Mount Rose Summit. The human-triggered avalanches clear the snow load from slopes overhanging the highway, thus making the roadway safer for drivers once the avalanche debris is cleared. But that system is showing its age, NDOT spokesperson Meg Ragonese says, and the department is making contingency plans in the event the system can\u2019t operate during the upcoming winter.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation says New Hampshire will be getting more than $600,000 in federal funds to help law enforcement agencies fight the opioid crisis. U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen says the state is receiving $664,673 through the Department of Justice\u2019s Community Oriented Policing Services program. Of that, $489,674 will go to the New Hampshire Department of Safety for the state\u2019s Anti-Heroin Task Force and $174,999 to Dartmouth College for a program supporting the hiring of law enforcement officers and expansion of community policing. State Police Col. Chris Wagner welcomed the funding, saying it will drive cross-border initiatives to disrupt drug trafficking organizations that fuel the opioid epidemic.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nThe Dr. Floyd Moreland Dentzel-Looff Carousel at Casino Pier in Seaside Heights, N.J. (Photo: Peter Ackerman)\n\nSeaside Heights: The New Jersey Historic Trust is providing a $750,000 grant to help refurbish a 109-year-old carousel. The money will go toward restoring the 1910 Dr. Floyd L. Moreland Dentzel-Looff Carousel at the Casino Pier arcade in Seaside Heights. But the funds won\u2019t be made available until the grant is approved by the Legislature and receives Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s signature. The carousel was shut down in early April and will be dismantled later this month. The ride will be temporarily moved into storage, and its mechanical parts will be inspected. Seaside Heights Mayor Anthony Vaz says he hopes the refurbished carousel is running by 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: About a quarter of Navajo women and some infants who were part of a federally funded study on uranium exposure had high levels of the radioactive metal in their systems, decades after mining for Cold War weaponry ended on their reservation, a U.S. health official said Monday. The preliminary findings from the University of New Mexico study were shared during a congressional field hearing in Albuquerque. Dr. Loretta Christensen \u2013 the chief medical officer on the Navajo Nation for Indian Health Service, a partner in the research \u2013 said 781 women were screened during an initial phase of the study that ended last year. Among them, 26% had concentrations of uranium that exceeded levels found in the highest 5% of the U.S. population, and newborns with equally high concentrations continued to be exposed to uranium during their first year, she said.\n\nNew York\n\nA brook trout caught by biologists at Lake Colden near Keene, N.Y. (Photo: New York Department of Environmental Conservation via AP)\n\nAlbany: Brook trout have been discovered in a high-elevation Adirondack Mountains lake for the first time since the lake was declared fishless due to acid rain 32 years ago. The Department of Environmental Conservation says the breeding population of trout in Lake Colden in the High Peaks Wilderness demonstrates the effectiveness of clean air regulations enacted since the 1980s. Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from fossil fuel combustion mix with moisture in the air to produce sulfuric and nitric acid. In the 1960s, scientists determined it was causing tree die-offs in higher elevations of the Catskills and Adirondacks and had made many lakes and streams too acidic to support fish. Ongoing sampling has shown improving water quality since air pollution emissions have been reduced.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nStatesville: The star of CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Profit\u201d has settled a yearlong dispute with the city over a huge American flag at the reality TV star\u2019s recreational vehicle store. News outlets report Statesville Mayor Costi Kutteh announced the settlement with Marcus Lemonis on Monday, allowing the flag to continue flying outside Lemonis\u2019 Gander RV company. At 40 feet by 80 feet, the flag violates a city ordinance limiting flags to 25 feet by 40 feet. The settlement requires Gander RV to pay about $16,000 for fines and legal costs and the council to change the ordinance to allow the flag. The council voted against that in June but unanimously agreed to it this time, just ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State environmental regulators have signed an agreement with the federal government that permits companies to self-report infractions in exchange for exemption from fines. The Bismarck Tribune reports the state Department of Environmental Quality signed a memorandum with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday. The agreement follows a North Dakota law passed in 2017 that gives companies the choice of conducting self-audits at power plants, oil and gas sites, and waste facilities and then reporting issues they identify to the state. Environmental Quality director Dave Glatt says the types of infractions could include companies forgetting to submit paperwork or neglecting to secure a necessary permit for a facility.\n\nOhio\n\n\"Rising Out of Hatred: The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist\" by Eli Saslow (Photo: Submitted)\n\nDayton: Books on a young white supremacist\u2019s awakening and on Iranian refugees in Sweden are winners of awards celebrating literature\u2019s power to promote peace and understanding. Dayton Literary Peace Prize officials say Eli Saslow\u2019s \u201cRising Out of Hatred\u201d won for nonfiction, and Golnaz Hashemzadeh Bonde\u2019s \u201cWhat We Owe\u201d won for fiction. Runners-up are Wil Haygood\u2019s \u201cTigerland,\u201d about an inner-city Ohio school\u2019s 1969 athletic triumphs, in nonfiction and Richard Powers\u2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d about human impact on forests, in fiction. Winners receive $10,000 each and runners-up $5,000 each. A Nov. 3 gala is planned in Dayton. The literary peace prizes grew out of the 1995 Bosnia peace accords negotiated in the southwestern Ohio city.\n\nOklahoma\n\nKristi Williams, left, and Chief Egunwale Amusan view a cemetery map Monday during a search for possible mass burial graves from Tulsa\u2019s 1921 Race Massacre at Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, Okla. (Photo: Mike Simons/Tulsa World via AP)\n\nTulsa: A committee overseeing a project to find the remains of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre says more areas should be investigated. The Oklahoma Archaeological Survey used ground-penetrating radar to search north Tulsa\u2019s Oaklawn Cemetery on Monday. It also plans to search another cemetery and a park for the victims of the violence that left as many as 300 dead on Tulsa\u2019s Black Wall Street. Oversight committee member and state Rep. Regina Goodwin says searchers should also look under U.S. Highway 75, adjacent to the cemetery, where she believes bodies may have been buried. Officials say Monday\u2019s search was largely inconclusive because nearby cameras and cellphones interfered with scanning equipment. Bystanders are asked to stay at least 300 feet away. The area will be searched again.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: If state lawmakers again fail to pass a law regulating greenhouse gas emissions next year, voters could be called on to do it. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports three initiative petitions filed with the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s Office on Monday would require the state to phase out electricity sources that contribute to global warming and transition to a carbon-free economy by 2050. If they proceed to the November 2020 ballot, the measures would likely usher in a bruising ballot fight. But one of the organizations spearheading the efforts, clean energy coalition Renew Oregon, is hoping the measures instead add urgency to next year\u2019s legislative session. The carbon cap bill has been in the works for over a decade and was the focus of a tussle in the Legislature this year, flaming out amid a walkout by Senate Republicans.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh is moving to block a new election seeking to unionize graduate student workers that has been proposed by a state labor board official. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports the university said in a statement Tuesday that it disagrees with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board official\u2019s finding of unfair labor practices. A university statement Tuesday said the institution \u201cacted appropriately leading up to and throughout the April 2019 election,\u201d which left the United Steelworkers 37 votes short. The union and student organizers accused university officials of tactics including coercion that discouraged the vote. The university had 20 days to respond to the hearing examiner\u2019s Sept. 18 proposed ruling and order for a new election. The matter is now expected to go before the full labor board.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has awarded $12.4 million in the state to protect low-income families from lead-based paint and home health hazards. The agency and U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, announced Monday that RIHousing is getting $8.4 million, and the city of Woonsocket is getting $4 million. Reed says lead poisoning remains a real problem that affects too many kids. RIHousing, created by the General Assembly, provides mortgage loans and other assistance to homebuyers. It will address lead hazards in 340 homes for low-income families with children and perform assessments in another 118 units. The work will be targeted in Pawtucket and Central Falls.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWalhalla: A police officer killed in the line of duty in 1928 is finally being remembered at a national law enforcement memorial. Oconee County Sheriff Mike Crenshaw said research by his employees showed Officer William Henry Talley confronted two men disrupting a church service near Salem on Oct. 11, 1928. The men beat him in the head with a club or stick, and he died the next day at age 52. Crenshaw says one man was sentenced to life in prison and the other to 10 years. Crenshaw said in a statement that the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., reviewed the research and will place Talley\u2019s name on its memorial. Talley worked for the Oconee County Rural Police Department, the predecessor to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTokata Iron Eyes chants as she and Greta Thunberg lead a march to the mayor\u2019s office during the Climate Change Rally and March on Monday in Rapid City, S.D. (Photo: Adam Fondren/Rapid City Journal via AP)\n\nRapid City: Two 16-year-old activists, one from Pine Ridge Reservation and one from Sweden, urged politicians Monday to listen to indigenous people on climate change. At a rally in Rapid City that attracted hundreds of people, Greta Thunberg spoke out against the proposed path of the Keystone XL pipeline through South Dakota, which she said is \u201cnot morally defensible.\u201d \u201cIndigenous peoples have been leading this fight for centuries,\u201d the Swedish teen said. \u201cThey have taken care of the planet, and they have lived in balance with nature, and we need to make sure that they\u2019re voices are being heard.\u201d Tokata Iron Eyes planned the rally and invited Thunberg to speak at the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock reservations. \u201cWe are marching for our lives, we are marching for climate justice, and we are marching for indigenous rights at the same time \u2013 because those two things go hand in hand,\u201d Iron Eyes said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A group of voters is appealing a judge\u2019s dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the security of voting machines in the state\u2019s largest county and calling for a switch to a handwritten ballot and a voter-verifiable paper trail. Lawyer Carol Chumney says Shelby County Advocates for Valid Elections has filed an appeal to U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker\u2019s ruling last month that their lawsuit failed to show any harm has come to them and that they have no legal standing. The lawsuit claims the outdated touchscreen voting machines are not secure because they do not produce a voter-verifiable paper trail, and security safeguards are needed to shield the system from outside manipulation. The voters\u2019 group says Parker disregarded that \u201cthere is circumstantial evidence that election tampering has occurred\u201d in the county.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas A&M University officials decided to ban e-cigarettes from all campuses because of the health risks associated with smoking them. Chancellor John Sharp announced Tuesday in a memo that the ban will go in effect \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on all A&M system campuses across the state, including the flagship university in College Station and Tarleton State University and Texas A&M University-Commerce in North Texas. The ban is applicable to students, faculty and staff at 11 universities and across eight state agencies. \u201cThis health threat is serious enough that I want to see the ban include every building, outside space, parking lot, garage and laboratory within the Texas A&M System,\u201d Sharp said in the memo. He noted smoking is prohibited in most areas of the A&M system.\n\nUtah\n\nPeople crowd the trail known as The Narrows at Zion National Park over the summer. (Photo: Photo: Courtesy of Zion National Park)\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park visitation set records this summer, averaging more than a half-million visitors per month. Yearly park visitors have more than doubled over the past decade at the southern Utah park known for its red-rock cliffs and narrow slot canyons. Park officials have been struggling with how to handle the crowds, and this year they limited the number of people who could hike two of the most popular trails on holidays. Park spokesman Eugenne Moisa says visitors to Angels Landing and the Narrows were kept waiting in the shade, instead of on the narrow, sunny trails. The nonprofit Zion Forever Project is also accepting donations to expand access to the east side of the park in hopes of dispersing visitors to that less-visited area.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The City Council has passed a resolution that aims to let noncitizens vote in city elections. Councilors voted in favor of the resolution 10-2 on Monday. Councilor Adam Roof, who wrote the resolution, says everyone in Burlington should get a vote because they\u2019re all affected by the decisions of local government. He tells WCAX-TV that expanding voting rights would \u201cbuild a more inclusive community\u201d and make it easier for everyone in Burlington to participate in the democratic process. Council President Kurt Wright says he voted against the proposal because he believes only American citizens should have the right to vote. The resolution needs ultimate approval from the Legislature before it can become law.\n\nVirginia\n\nA statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Va. (Photo: Julia Rendleman, AP)\n\nCharlottesville: The city is preparing to appeal its defeat in a lawsuit over two Confederate monuments. The Daily Progress reports the City Council on Monday night authorized the city attorney to appeal once a judge delivers his final ruling against removing statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore ruled last month that monuments don\u2019t send a racially discriminatory message. He also issued a permanent injunction preventing the city from removing the statues. A group of residents sued the city, citing a state law that protects war memorials. The only outstanding issue is their request for more than $600,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 15.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking changes in how his state deals with problem wolves in Ferry County, in an effort to reduce the number of gray wolves being killed. (Photo: Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife via AP)\n\nSpokane: Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking ways to reduce the number of wolves killed by the state. Inslee sent a letter Tuesday to the Department of Fish and Wildlife saying the statewide wolf management plan does not appear to be working in the Kettle River Range area of Ferry County, where the state has killed about two dozen wolves that were preying on cattle. His efforts come as wildlife experts say the vast majority of the predators are causing no trouble. The Ferry County situation is unique, experts said. \u201cAbout 90% of wolf packs are co-existing in our state without livestock conflicts,\u201d the agency said in a statement. The Kettle River Range is different because the lush, steep terrain is ideal wolf habitat that is also shared with large cattle ranches, making predation an issue.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWest Virginia Supreme Court Justice Margaret Workman was impeached by the House of Delegates last year, but her trial was blocked. (Photo: John Raby/AP)\n\nCharleston: The U.S. Supreme Court says it will leave in place a court decision that derailed the impeachment trials of three West Virginia Supreme Court justices accused of corruption. The case was one of a long list of those the high court announced Monday that it wouldn\u2019t hear. In question was a decision by five acting justices of West Virginia\u2019s highest court who ruled last year that prosecuting then-state Chief Justice Margaret Workman in the state Senate would violate West Virginia Constitution\u2019s separation of powers clause. That ruling in Workman\u2019s case was later applied to also halt impeachment proceedings against two other justices who have since left the court: Robin Davis and Allen Loughry. Davis retired after the House approved impeachment charges against her. Loughry resigned after being convicted in federal court of felony fraud charges.\n\nWisconsin\n\nDemocratic Wisconsin Rep. Jimmy Anderson, who is paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, says it is \u201coffensive, disappointing\u201d and \u201cfrustrating\u201d that Republicans did not consult with him before proposing ways to accommodate his needs. (Photo: Scott Bauer/AP)\n\nMadison: A paralyzed state lawmaker would be allowed to call into committee meetings he can\u2019t attend in person under rule changes Republicans unveiled Tuesday that are designed to meet demands the Democrat made nearly a year ago. But Democrats and Rep. Jimmy Anderson, who is paralyzed from the waist down, objected to Republicans tying the accommodations with several other rule changes that would strengthen GOP power in the Assembly. One of the most significant would allow Republicans to take multiple votes on overrides of vetoes made by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. \u201cI don\u2019t know why these are all being mixed together,\u201d Anderson said. Republicans didn\u2019t include Anderson in discussion of the accommodations, which he called \u201coffensive, disappointing and frankly really frustrating.\u201d\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A hunting advocacy group seeks to eliminate mountain biking and all-terrain vehicles in two wilderness study areas in the western part of the state. The group Mountain Pursuit sued the U.S. Forest Service in federal court in Casper on Sept. 26. The lawsuit targets mountain biking in the Palisades Wilderness Study Area and biking and ATVs in the Shoal Creek Wilderness Study Area. The group claims that the Forest Service allows bikes and ATVs but that the law that established the areas doesn\u2019t. Wilderness study areas are candidates for designation as wilderness, where mechanized transportation is prohibited. Forest Service spokeswoman Mary Cernicek declined comment Friday, citing policy not to comment on litigation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/09/teen-climate-activists-highway-bagel-roast-red-tide-news-around-states/40286763/", "description": "Study finds high levels of uranium in Navajo women and infants, bodies from tragic 1944 circus fire exhumed in Connecticut, and more", "authors": ["Usa Today Network", "Wire Reports", "Published A.M.
