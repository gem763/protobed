Particularly, for women.\n\nParticularly for women who genuinely want to do what they can to protect themselves from abusive predatory pieces of scum \u2014 and in so doing, help other women protect themselves from similarly abusive predatory pieces of scum.\n\nLauer, it should be noted, in a three-page open letter, has denied the rape allegations, which came to light in a book written by Ronan Farrow.\n\nHe says the anal sex was consensual.\n\nHe also points to the fact that Nevils continued to have a sexual relationship with him post Sochi \u2014 post-alleged rape \u2014 as proof that he\u2019s telling the truth.\n\nLauer\u2019s got a case.\n\nNevils\u2019 story, told to Farrow, is this: She said that after she and Lauer downed several drinks, including vodka shots, in the bar-slash-restaurant area of the Sochi hotel, he invited her to go to his private hotel room. She said yes.\n\n\u201c[I] had no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience,\u201d Nevils told Farrow in his book.\n\nShe said it wasn\u2019t long before Lauer threw her on the bed and raped her.\n\nShe said she continued to see Lauer romantically for some time after that alleged rape because she worried he would end her career if she stopped having sex with him.\n\nNot exactly an airtight accuser, is she?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: A woman who claims rape ought to be given the benefit of the doubt. She ought to be automatically treated with sympathy, compassion \u2014 and legal help. She ought to be given the encouragement to be courageous enough to testify against her attackers so that justice might prevail, and so that warning messages might be sent to all the other would-be attackers of the world.\n\nBut Nevils isn\u2019t that woman. She\u2019s an exception to the \u201cought to.\u201d\n\nFact is, you can\u2019t engage in an adulterous relationship, an adulterous alcohol-dueled relationship, then go back in time, when the relationship ends, and say oh hey, you know that first time we had sex? \u2014 well it was really a rape.\n\nWell, actually, you can.\n\nBut it sure doesn\u2019t sell as a story of total and unquestionable truth. It sure doesn\u2019t present as proof of victimhood.\n\nMoreover, it sure doesn\u2019t help the cause of women who are viciously sexually abused and raped \u2014 and afraid to come forward because they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be believed.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
