That\u2019s what people said that I said,\" he told host Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d of his Thursday news conference, claiming that \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was \u201creporters\u2019\u201d language, not his.\n\n\"I have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mulvaney had told reporters Thursday at the White House. \u201cThere's going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d Since then he\u2019s taken heat for his comments, which appeared to admit to a quid pro quo, despite strong denials from the Trump administration.\n\n\"I believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could only come to one conclusion,\" Wallace said, playing a video clip from the news conference in which Mulvaney listed three reasons for why aid to Ukraine had been withheld, rather than the two he brought up on Sunday: corruption in the country, whether other countries were participating in support of Ukraine and \u201cwhether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nWallace then quoted a senior Justice Department official who said the withholding of aid in regards to a department investigation was \u201cnews to us.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, though, did acknowledge he could \u201cabsolutely\u201d see how people took his words \u201cthe wrong way,\u201d but continued to emphasize he \u201cnever said it was a \u2018quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection to the DNC server,\u201d Mulvaney insisted to a doubtful Wallace.\n\nMulvaney also \u201cabsolutely, positively\u201d denied having offered his resignation to President Donald Trump after the controversial news conference.\n\n\"I'm very happy working there,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cDid I have the perfect press conference?
