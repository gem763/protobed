Even what seems like the most private setting online can be exposed, just ask Coleen Rooney.\"\n\nJapan has seen several attacks by fans on female pop stars in recent years:\n\nIn 2016, Japanese singer Mayu Tomita was left in a critical condition after being repeatedly stabbed by a fan as she was waiting to perform at a concert in Tokyo. It was reported this year that she was suing the government for not doing enough to protect her\n\nPop star Maho Yamaguchi went public earlier this year with allegations that she had been assaulted by two obsessive fans\n\nShuichiro Hoshi, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University and expert on the risks of social media, told the Tokyo Reporter that improved picture quality on smartphone cameras had increased the risk of private information \"being leaked unexpectedly\".\n\n\"In other words, the risk of a so-called 'digital stalker' is on the rise,\" he said.", "description": "A Japanese man accused of assaulting a singer says he located her through the reflection in her eyes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E1D0/production/_109180875_07e11bc3-84cd-4aeb-aa1f-66813e0503d4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
