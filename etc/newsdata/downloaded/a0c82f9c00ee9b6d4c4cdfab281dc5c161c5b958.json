He showed off a portion of the 30-foot-tall bollard wall and even beams bearing signature Trumpian descriptions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cLook at the inner tube to see what happens, because after the wall is up, we pour concrete and concrete goes into the tube, and in addition to that we have rebar,\u201d Trump explained to reporters, referring to a stack of the hollow steel beams that would eventually make up the wall.\n\n\u201cSo if you think you\u2019re going to cut it with a blowtorch, that doesn\u2019t work because you hit concrete,\u201d he continued, \u201cand if you think you\u2019re going to go through the concrete, that doesn\u2019t work because we have very powerful rebar inside.\u201d\n\nTrump also talked up the concrete filling being used for the beams, telling reporters that workers were using \u201ca very powerful concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a lot of technological advances have been made with concrete,\u201d he added. \u201cIt sounds pretty simple but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a pretty powerful concrete. So you have the rebar, you have the outer crust and you have \u2014 the inside is concrete and it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThe wall, which Trump said had been described to him as the \u201cRolls-Royce version\u201d of a border barrier, had even undergone extensive testing to ensure that immigrants would be unable to scale the structure.\n\n\u201cWe actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class climbers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had 20 mountain climbers. That\u2019s all they do, they love to climb mountains.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them were champions, and we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb,\u201d he continued, gesturing to the stack of beams behind him.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/1139/1155968404_6007507802001_6007508885001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nAfter allowing his acting heads of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss other features of the wall, the president began to elaborate on the structure\u2019s technological assets.\n\n\u201cOne thing we haven\u2019t mentioned is technology,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re wired so that we will know if somebody\u2019s trying to break through.\u201d He then offered the floor to Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, acting head of the Army Corps, who quickly answered: \u201cSir, there could be some merit in not discussing that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t done.\n\nFortifying the wall even more, he said, was the fact that the steel wall\u2019s beams are heat conductors. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to absorb heat, so it\u2019s extremely hot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to touch it. You can fry an egg on that wall.\u201d\n\nThe president said he was talked out of his initial vision for the wall \u2014 a solid concrete block \u2014 though he asserted it would have been cheaper to use it. \u201cIt\u2019s more expensive, but it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he acquiesced to what officials referred to as a \u201cgame changer\u201d of a design, as well as their \u201ceconomic\u201d suggestion to leave the slats their natural rust color, rather than painting the entire structure a heat-absorbing black.\n\nThe wall, for which progress had been extremely slow going because of funding issues, was even attracting international attention, Trump claimed on Wednesday. \u201cOther countries are now coming, as you know, and they are starting the wall,\u201d he said, though he declined to offer any examples. \u201cThe only thing is, I\u2019m not sure they can afford a wall like this.\u201d\n\nAfter talking through the design features of the barrier, he then took questions from reporters on everything from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate cut to the turnover within the Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with enacting his immigration agenda.\n\nThen he walked off to examine the wall up close \u2014 but not before giving it his seal of approval, literally, by placing his signature on a beam with a permanent marker.", "description": "\u201cYou won't be able to touch it.
