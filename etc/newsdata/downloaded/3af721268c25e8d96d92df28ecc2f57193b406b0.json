The Queen\u2019s Speech, which usually takes place annually, allows the government to set out their political agenda for the next Parliamentary session. During the speech, the Queen will announce laws the government wants Parliament to approve, which is televised from the House of Commons. Watch the Queen\u2019s Speech live here: Lady Usher of the Black Rod (Picture: AFP) It is part of the State Opening of Parliamentary ceremony, which starts with the Queen travelling in horse-drawn carriage \u2013 the Diamond Jubilee Coach \u2013 from Buckingham Palace to Westminster. Before departing for the occasion, Queen Elizabeth II would have received the speech, written by ministers, from the throne of the House of Lords. Before she arrived, the priceless Imperial State Crown and other regalia used in the ceremony was brought to Parliament in a separate heavily-guarded carriage. The crown includes 2,868 diamonds, including the Second Star of Africa diamond, and many other gems. The crown was made for King George VI\u2019s coronation in 1937, based on a crown designed for Queen Victoria in 1838. As the Queen made her way over, MPs were called to the House of Commons by Black Road \u2013 a House of Lords official. Black Rod has the doors shut in their face and knocks three times before entering the Commons, in a bid to symbolise the chamber\u2019s independence from monarchy.\n\nMore to follow\u2026", "description": "Queen Elizabeth has arrived at Westminster to deliver the Queen's Speech, just weeks ahead of Brexit.", "authors": ["Elisa Menendez"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89832343_1571052540.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
