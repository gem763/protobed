Direct air capture technology works almost exactly like it sounds. Giant fans draw ambient air into contact with an aqueous solution that picks out and traps carbon dioxide. Through heating and a handful of familiar chemical reactions, that same carbon dioxide is re-extracted and ready for further use -as a carbon source for making valuable chemicals like fuels, or for storage via a sequestration strategy of choice. Giant fans draw ambient air into contact with an aqueous solution that picks out and traps carbon dioxide. Through heating and a handful of familiar chemical reactions, carbon dioxide is re-extracted and ready for further use The resulting fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, are compatible with existing fuel distribution and transportation infrastructure.\n\n'It causes one to think differently about the climate problem when you have a backstop,' he said.\n\n'And the ultimate temperature we have to suffer through is going to be lower.'\n\nCarbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company backed by Bill Gates, recently outlined the design of a large industrial plant that it said could capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a cost of between $94 and $232 a tonne.\n\nThat is well below past estimates of about $600 a tonne by the American Physical Society, said David Keith, a Harvard University physics professor and the founder of Carbon Engineering who led the research.\n\nClimeworks, a Swiss company and Carbon Engineering's main rival, recently said it was hoping to cut its production price to $100 a tonne in the next 5-10 years, from about $600 now.\n\nIt sells carbon dioxide to greenhouses as an airborne fertiliser to grow tomatoes or cucumbers.\n\nCarbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company backed by Bill Gates, recently outlined the design of a large industrial plant that it said could capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a cost of between $94 and $232 a tonne.\n\nThe report comes on the heels of a United Nations science report that painted a bleak picture of the world's ability to avoid dangerous warming.\n\nWednesday's study 'is sort of more optimistic; it gives some operational advice,' said Kate Gordon, a research scholar at the Columbia Center for Global Energy policy who was not part of the report's panel.\n\nThe 370-page report called for the nation to invest in technologies and methods that would remove the heat-trapping gasses like carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that are generated from human activities like burning coal and natural gas for electricity, or burning gasoline and diesel for transportation.\n\nWHAT THE REPORT RECOMMENDS The technologies outlined include the simple and the futuristic: Plant more trees and manage forests better, and limit the amount of land used by people. Plants take carbon dioxide from the air and use it to grow.\n\nConserve soils better so they can store more carbon dioxide and produce more food.\n\nConserve and restore coastal plants, like marshlands and sea grass beds.\n\nA relatively new technology called direct air capture. Pilot projects have started using giant fans that pull in air, use a chemical reaction to suck carbon out, and then inject it underground.\n\nA still-to-be-worked out technology that relies on certain types of rock that can absorb carbon dioxide.\n\nBurning more biofuel - like wood - and capturing the carbon dioxide after combustion and either burying it underground or making it into solids that can be spread on dirt.\n\n'These technologies will clearly help since we have screwed up a lot,' said Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Mario Molina of the University of California San Diego, who wasn't part of the report's panel.\n\nThe good news is that technology in this field has advanced more in the past nine months than it had in the previous decade, said study co-author Christopher Jones, an engineering professor of Georgia Tech.\n\nPacala said the natural methods like tree planting is pretty cheap and available now. But he said they can only do so much because 'there's a limit to available land.'\n\nJason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma who wasn't part of the report, called the bioenergy method the most promising, but not necessarily the easiest.\n\nThe direct air capture, being used by Climeworks , Carbon Engineering and others, is mostly limited by cost, Pacala said.\n\nCarbon Engineering acting chief scientist David Keith, a Harvard University professor, said removing carbon from the air makes sense only once humans have stopped putting so much in the air.\n\n'The idea that humanity might continue huge fossil (fuel) emissions while simultaneously balancing them with removal is nutty - you plug the leaks before bailing the boat.'\n\nThe report addresses concerns that it creates a 'moral hazard' - raising hopes about the promise of these carbon-removal technologies that could give civilization an excuse not to cut emissions from coal, oil and gas now.\n\nPacala said carbon removal technologies aren't a substitute for massive reductions in carbon emissions.\n\nThey are tools to get overall emissions down, he said.\n\n'The fact that we need large-scale negative emissions essentially tells us that we have left it (until) too late to solve the problem,' said Norwegian scientist Glen Peters, who tracks global carbon emissions.", "description": "The report from the National Academy of Sciences says technology to 'suck up' greenhouse gases  has gotten better, and climate change is worsening.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/20/wire-5376934-1540410118-39_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-24"}
