Moreover, in practice, the qubits must be sheltered from the noisy non-quantum world, so the process transpires inside a dilution refrigerator \u2014 a big Thermos bottle \u2014 where the temperature of the chips at the bottom is kept at just above absolute zero, colder than outer space.\n\nAt the other end of a long curving corridor, sitting alone in its own room, was the real, working thing. Called IBM Q System One , it was encased in a 9-foot-wide cube of black glass and accessible only through 700-pound doors a half-inch thick, the better to seal in the cold and seal out the universe of noise and interference. \u201c Q\u201d is for quantum. Designed by an architectural firm to be as modern, intimidating and opaque as the future itself , this machine is the most beautiful computer its users will probably never see.\n\nWhile System One went online in January 20 19, a set of starter computers called IBM Q Experience has been available online for the last three years ; anyone can log on and write and run programs on them. To date, Dr. Gil said, some 130,000 people have used it, running 17 million experiments and publishing some 200 papers. And there were more quantum devices, behind other doors, operated by scientists trying to learn how to speak nature\u2019s exotic subatomic language. \u201cI\u2019m convinced there are more quantum computers working here than the rest of the world combined, in this building,\u201d Dr. Gil said.", "description": "With transmons and entanglement, scientists strive to put subatomic weirdness to work on the human scale.", "authors": ["Dennis Overbye"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/science/21SCI-QUANTUMCOMPUTING1/21SCI-QUANTUMCOMPUTING1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
