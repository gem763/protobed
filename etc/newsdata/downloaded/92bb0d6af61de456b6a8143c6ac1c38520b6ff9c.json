Maybe you would like to see the players playing your ideas? No. You have no ideas; you have to have empathy and understand what the team needs.\u201d\n\nSitting in the drawing room of a London hotel, Jose \u2018Chema\u2019 Busceta exudes passion when talking about his basketball coaching philosophy and team, a mark of a man who cares more about nurturing his players than about results.\n\nThis is perhaps surprising, given the achievements of Chema\u2019s team. With the Spaniard at the helm, the Great Britain Women\u2019s Basketball team have defied expectations in recent years, finishing fourth at the 2019 EuroBasket (a 20 team European tournament with a rigorous qualification process) and second when competing as England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe development of the team is extraordinary, considering they had the worst record of all teams at the last EuroBasket tournament just four years ago. Now, thanks to their remarkable performance earlier this year, the team will unexpectedly have a shot at qualifying for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nChema is assured when talking about his team\u2019s impressive performance and prospects, but in keeping with his character deflects praise on to his players at every opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhat I found here was a very good group of players who wanted to achieve something,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey needed to believe it was possible, but they wanted to do it. Some players refused part of their [club] contracts to go to the Commonwealth Games. That was amazing. This is the main strength of the team \u2013 its attitude.\u201d\n\nChema is keen to highlight the attitude of star player Temi Fagbele \u2013 the centre averaged the most points (20.9) at the 2019 EuroBasket \u2013 who in the past took time off from the WNBA to play for the team. He also speaks highly of Johannah Leedham, who used her off-season from her club in Poland to train with the team, sacrificing time that could have been spent with her husband in America.\n\nHis players have clearly bought into the system, and it is no surprise as to why. Alongside coaching basketball, Chema is a professor of psychology and his understanding of the human psyche is evident in the way he talks about coaching.\n\n\u201cYou need to have some room for the players to input their ideas and participate,\u201d he stresses. \u201cI think this is important for everyone to commit, and commitment is key \u2013 commitment and trust.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the importance of commitment and trust is the difference between being good and being excellent. You have to understand which players you have and what their needs are. After that you have to adapt. The coach has to be the person who adapts to the talent that he has.\u201d\n\nIn their monumental run during the last few years, the GB team have gained a bit of a reputation for playing what is viewed as unattractive basketball, but Chema is unconcerned.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the ideal basketball but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what your needs are as a coach, what is important is what the players need.\u201d\n\nClearly, this style is working for the team. In February, they will play pre-Olympic qualifiers for the chance to feature at an Olympic Games for the first time since 2012. Chema knows the team must stay true to themselves to have a chance at qualification.\n\n\u201cIf we want to fight at this level, we cannot forget what our weapons were. We cannot forget the spirit that we created. This is key,\u201d he emphasises.\n\n\u201cNow we are talking about playing the top teams in the world. That was unbelievable a few months ago. We are the underdogs in this group, but we were also the underdogs at the EuroBasket and we were able to achieve something.\u201d\n\nA Spanish coach revolutionising a sport and getting the absolute best from his players is not an unfamiliar sight to us in England, and a smile breaks out on Chema\u2019s face when comparisons are made between himself and Pep Guardiola.\n\n\u201cI would like to have half of his salary, or at least 10 per cent! I was teaching at a football course for former players getting into coaching and he [Guardiola] was one of the students. He was very clever, and everybody knew he would be a great coach.\u201d\n\nChema recognises some similarities between himself and his compatriot, in at least the philosophical sense rather than the financial. \u201cHe also has this philosophy of empowering the players. I\u2019m not surprised that he\u2019s so successful wherever he goes.\u201d\n\nThe achievements of Chema, through empowering and trusting in his players, are impressive in isolation but carry significance beyond Tokyo 2020 and the next EuroBasket tournament. Basketball England are aiming to vastly expand the women\u2019s game and hope to use the performance of the national team as a springboard to achieve this.\n\nBasketball England are launching their All Girls campaign, an initiative designed at promoting female involvement in basketball and closing the gap between male and female participation. Stewart Kellet, CEO of Basketball England, is confident that now is the time for this campaign to gain real traction.\n\nAlthough he is \u2018just\u2019 the coach of the team, Chema is equally as keen to see the sport develop in the UK. He too recognises the fact that the success of his team is a potential game-changer.\n\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity for not only women\u2019s basketball, but for women\u2019s sport to grow. This is what\u2019s important \u2013 when you are able to show the things that are possible when many young girls are looking.\n\n\u201cThe organisers have to understand; it\u2019s not just funding one team to go to the pre-Olympic, it\u2019s much more than that.\u201d\n\nThe job that people like Kellet and Chema have done is outstanding, especially given the relative lack of funding they receive to do their job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never once criticised the funding, but the one thing that is starting to inhibit our potential is the fact that we do think we\u2019re perhaps not recognised for our achievements,\u201d Stewart attests.\n\n\u201cCompared to other sports with tens or hundreds of millions of pounds, pound for pound we\u2019re really punching above our weight. We are hard earning every lottery pound that we can get a hold of, and it isn\u2019t easy.\u201d\n\nKellet and Chema have lofty ambitions for women\u2019s basketball in the UK, but both appear realistic about how those ambitions might be achieved. Stewart points to the rise of women\u2019s football since the turn of the century as an example of how a sport can grow.\n\n\u201cIf you look at women\u2019s football 15 years ago you wouldn\u2019t see two column inches in a newspaper about women\u2019s football. Now, it was bigger than any other sport for two weeks during the summer.\u201d\n\nBoth men acknowledge that football is far more popular than basketball in general, but the point remains that with the right tools in place, development for women\u2019s sport is certainly possible.\n\nThe team are back in action next month, with a home game in Manchester on 17 November against Belarus following an away match in Poland to start their 2021 EuroBasket qualifying campaign.
