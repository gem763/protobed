We are committed to continuing discussions around the clock to reach a resolution,\u201d the company said.\n\nMore than 46,000 GM UAW workers have remained on strike as the two sides continue to reach an agreement on issues such as pensions and narrowing the pay gap for in-progression workers.", "description": "Talks took a big step backward on Sunday when GM negotiators put forward their latest proposal, union officials said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/01/0c9778_united-auto-workers-on-strike-gm-weeks-prompting-furloughs-facilities-e1570406513517-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
