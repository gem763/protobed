Japan Considers Deeper Negative Rates After ECB Cut", "language": "en", "text": "TOKYO\u2014The Bank of Japan is growing more open to the idea of cutting short-term interest rates deeper into negative territory, responding to global risks that are forcing other central banks to cut rates, said people familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.\n\nIf the bank were to do so, however, it would look for ways to avoid sharp declines at the longer end of the yield curve, the people said. The goal is to keep an upward slope from low short-term rates to higher long-term rates, which makes it easier for life insurers and pension funds to make investment returns.\n\nAmid concerns about a global slowdown and trade tensions, the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its rate target to minus 0.5% and reintroduced a program to buy eurozone debt. The Federal Reserve at its meeting Sept. 18 is poised to cut its key policy rate, currently set at a range between 2% and 2.25%. Investors widely expect a cut of a quarter-percentage point, but President Trump in a recent tweet called for cutting rates to zero or lower.\n\n\u201cIt is good timing for the BOJ to start thinking about easing options in more detail,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the central bank\u2019s strategy.\n\nAny changes may not happen right away. The Bank of Japan\u2019s policy board is leaning toward keeping policy steady at its own meeting next Wednesday and Thursday because the domestic economy looks relatively solid and the markets are stable, said the people familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.\n\nThe central bank also wants to see the impact of a sales tax increase, which will be introduced Oct. 1, and the results of its quarterly corporate sentiment survey, released the same day. The policy board meets again in late October.\n\nGov. Haruhiko Kuroda has said the bank has four easing options: cutting its short-term rate, currently minus 0.1%; lowering the target for the 10-year government bond yield, currently zero; expanding purchases of assets such as stocks; and, expanding the monetary base faster. At its previous meeting in July, the Bank of Japan added a line to its statement saying it wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take additional easing measures if needed.\n\nMr. Kuroda has repeatedly said he is aware of the side effects of the negative-interest-rate policy he first announced in January 2016. That is a nod to criticism from banks, insurance companies and others. But if the global downturn gets worse, the Bank of Japan might have to reconsider its deference to banks.\n\n\u201cConditions are different now compared with a year or two ago when the global economy looked fine,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking. \u201cWhen the economy looks like it is tanking, a central bank should not prioritize banks\u2019 profits over the overall economy.\u201d\n\nIf the yield curve slopes upward\u2014meaning yields on bonds get gradually higher as the term of the bonds gets longer\u2014that is good for banks, which generally take in shorter-term deposits and lend out the money for longer terms such as a 30-year home mortgage. The central bank wants to preserve that kind of yield curve.\n\nTo get a more upward-sloping yield curve, it needs to look closely at lowering short-term interest rates while keeping long-term yields roughly where they are now, said some of the people familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.\n\nMr. Kuroda voiced caution about declines in longer-term yields in an interview this month with the Nikkei business daily. His comments helped lift the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to minus 0.16% Friday from minus 0.295% earlier this month, which was the lowest since July 2016 and near its record low.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities senior market economist Naomi Muguruma said the bank could reduce purchases of superlong Japanese government bonds\u2014a move that doesn\u2019t necessarily require a decision by the policy board. The bank has already reduced overall JGB purchases significantly, buying only \u00a524 trillion ($222 billion) in the most recent 12-month period, compared with its \u00a580 trillion guidance for annual purchases.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "description": "The Bank of Japan is growing more open to the idea of cutting short-term interest rates deeper into negative territory, responding to global risks that are forcing other central banks to cut rates, said people familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa", "Megumi.Fujikawa Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106909/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
