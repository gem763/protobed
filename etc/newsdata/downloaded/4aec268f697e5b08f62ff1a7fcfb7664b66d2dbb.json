Such moves would typically be considered only when the economy faces a substantial downturn.\n\nWednesday's comments are the first time Mr. Trump has called for rates below zero. In response to a reporter's question several weeks ago, Mr. Trump said he didn't want negative rates.\n\nYields in some countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands have fallen below zero already. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said the bank has begun discussing what fees and charges it could introduce if interest rates go to zero or lower. Even during the last recession, the Fed didn't employ negative rates.\n\nPresident Trump and White House officials have said they don't believe the U.S. is headed toward a slowdown, but also have floated other ideas, such as tax cuts, to boost the economy.\n\nA rate cut of the magnitude Mr. Trump is calling for hasn't happened since the global financial crisis in late 2008.\n\nIn comments last week, Mr. Powell said the U.S. economy faced a favorable outlook despite significant risks from weaker global growth and trade uncertainty.\n\n--Paul Kiernan contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 11, 2019 09:18 ET (13:18 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
