The circulator, along with the DC Streetcar and Capital Bike Share, are the only transit options over which the District has sole control.\n\nHowever, the D.C. Council rejected her proposal to allocate $1.3 million for the free ride citing a lack of analysis for the decision, which Mrs. Cheh called a \u201cthoughtless giveaway.\u201d\n\nIn June, council member Brandon Todd, Ward 4 Democrat, introduced the DC Circulator Equity Act of 2019 to make the circulator free again and expand service to all eight wards, as opposed to the five wards it serves now.\n\nMs. Cheh said she isn\u2019t sure when she would hold a hearing on the legislation because her committee is backed up right now.\n\nShe said it is always a consideration for her committee about equity. And when she hosts a hearing about the electric scooters in early November, she wants to make sure they are placed in all eight wards, not just downtown.\n\nMeanwhile, DDOT is planning a circulator route that would go through Ward 7, Mr. Marootian said.\n\n\u201cAt this point we are in the early stages of both procuring the buses and the facility,\u201d the director said.\n\nDespite the change in fare for the DC Circulator, Mr. Marootian said the DC Streetcar will remain free.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
