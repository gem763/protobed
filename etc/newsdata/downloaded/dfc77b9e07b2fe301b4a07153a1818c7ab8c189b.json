(Stephen B. Morton/AP)\n\nThe NFL is considering adding two playoff teams to its existing postseason field as a means of generating additional revenue lost by potentially shortening the preseason. Based on the results of the first Sunday of the 2019 season, perhaps the league should consider only adding NFC teams.\n\nAn AFC that already appeared thin on playoff contenders entering the season got even thinner Sunday. The Jacksonville Jaguars lost quarterback Nick Foles to a broken collarbone after just 10 plays in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Pittsburgh Steelers were blown out, 33-3, by a New England Patriots team that just signed their former star wide receiver Antonio Brown. The Cleveland Browns looked like the 2016-17 version of themselves \u2014 the one that went 1-31 across a two-season stretch \u2014 in a 43-13 home loss to the Tennessee Titans.\n\nAdd it all up and you have a conference that appears much weaker overall than its NFC counterpart \u2014 strengthening even further the Super Bowl paths of defending conference finalists New England and Kansas City. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll start our top takeaways from Week 1 of the NFL season.\n\n[For the Browns and others, Week 1 of the NFL season delivers an unexpected shock to the system]\n\nCould we be reliving the 2017 season in which the AFC had only four legitimate playoff teams? That year, the Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans made the playoffs as wild-card teams even though they produced point differentials more in line with 7-9 teams. The Titans won a playoff game but still fired coach Mike Mularkey.\n\nStarting out in the AFC East, it\u2019s already looking like another cakewalk for the Patriots. The Miami Dolphins look like front-runners for the No. 1 pick in next year\u2019s draft after getting trounced, 59-10, by the Baltimore Ravens. It\u2019s hard to figure out what to say about the Bills, who won, 17-16, or their opponent, the New York Jets. The Bills somehow overcame second-year quarterback Josh Allen\u2019s four first-half turnovers to score 17 unanswered points. New Jets coach Adam Gase called his offense inept.\n\nIn the AFC North, we\u2019ll know more about Baltimore once it plays a team other than Miami, but Lamar Jackson dazzled with five touchdown passes, indicating his progression to becoming more of a pocket passer in his second year is going well. You have to give the Ravens the early leg up in that divisional race, given how poorly the Steelers and Browns played.\n\n['Not bad for a running back': Lamar Jackson answers critics with dominant Week 1]\n\nCleveland was particularly disappointing. The Browns had 18 penalties for 182 yards, and they clearly have issues on the offensive line. Quarterback Baker Mayfield was sacked five times and hit six more times. Left tackle Greg Robinson was ejected. Now it\u2019s up to new coach Freddie Kitchens to respond to the adversity of the first loss and put the team back on the right path.\n\nNo team suffered worse Sunday than the Jaguars, who lost Foles in their 40-26 loss to the Chiefs. He was expected to have surgery Monday and will probably go on injured reserve. That would keep him out at least eight weeks, but it\u2019s not out of the question he could miss the rest of the season. Making matters worse, the defense that led Jacksonville to the AFC championship game two years ago looked completely lost. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for 378 yards. In six of the first 16 plays, the Jaguars\u2019 defense gave up 21 to 68 yards.\n\n\u201cAnytime you give up 40 points, that stuff sucks,\u201d cornerback D.J. Hayden told reporters after the game.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to overreact too much to an opening weekend that followed a preseason with fewer starters playing than in the past. But while we wait to see how Cleveland and Pittsburgh respond and how Baltimore fares against tougher competition, the Patriots and Chiefs are a clear top two in the AFC, with a Los Angeles Chargers team that eked out a win over the Indianapolis Colts not far behind. The AFC South is wide open. The AFC East looks like it\u2019s already won.\n\nMore Week 1 takeaways\n\n\n\nRams running back Todd Gurley breaks free from the Panthers' defense. (Grant Halverson/Getty Images)\n\n\u00adThe Los Angeles Rams\u2019 offense is different. For starters, Sean McVay\u2019s offense ran several four-receiver sets, a departure from last season when Los Angeles used three-receiver formations 91 percent of the time.\n\nBut the much more noticeable, and significant, change has to do with running back Todd Gurley II. McVay split the workload Sunday between Malcolm Brown and Gurley, who doesn\u2019t seem to be the same player of the past two regular seasons with his arthritic knee \u2014 a guy who was an MVP candidate at times and arguably the league\u2019s best running back. Gurley had just six carries for 33 yards through three quarters before he got hot and finished with 97 yards on 14 carries.\n\nL.A.'s Super Bowl opponent last season, the Patriots, changed things up in Week 1 as well, using formations with two backs and three wideouts on 23 plays in its victory \u2014 a new look following the retirement of tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\nA new coach hasn\u2019t changed Jameis Winston. Despite welcoming Bruce Arians as his head coach this offseason, Winston kept up his turnover-producing ways, throwing three interceptions, including two pick-sixes, in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 31-17 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. He has 61 interceptions in his 57 games. If Winston doesn\u2019t figure it out soon, the Bucs could be drafting his replacement next year.\n\nBut the Bengals\u2019 new coach has changed Andy Dalton. The combination of McVay protege Zac Taylor and Dalton was impressive in Week 1, as Dalton got rid of the ball quickly and accurately in a 21-20 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Dalton finished 35 for 51 for 418 yards, and he did so without the injured A.J. Green at wide receiver. Even though the Seahawks\u2019 defense looked pretty bad in their victory, Jadeveon Clowney got off to a good start. He had a sack, a tackle for a loss and a quarterback hit on Dalton, playing 48 snaps even though he had only been with the team for about three practices.\n\nMike Zimmer appears to have gotten his wish. The Minnesota Vikings head coach wants his team to commit to the running game on offense, and that was certainly the case in a 28-12 win over the Atlanta Falcons. The Vikings had 38 rushes for 172 yards, led by Dalvin Cook\u2019s 111 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries. Quarterback Kirk Cousins, meanwhile, threw only 10 passes, completing eight for 98 yards and a score.\n\nDon\u2019t write off Kliff Kingsbury and Kyler Murray just yet. The early returns on the Arizona Cardinals\u2019 new Air Raid offense were pretty bad after three-plus quarters against the Detroit Lions, who led 24-6. But Murray got hot, completing 15 of 19 passes for 154 yards in the fourth quarter in what turned out to be a 27-27 tie. Murray has the skills to be a good quarterback.\n\nThe longer Jerry Jones waits to give Dak Prescott a contract extension, the more expensive it will be. Carson Wentz, who shined in a Week 1 win over the Washington Redskins, got $32 million a year this offseason from the Philadelphia Eagles. Jared Goff got $34 million per year from the Rams. Prescott made his case to get more than both of them in the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 35-17 win over the New York Giants. Prescott completed 25 of 32 passes for 404 yards and four touchdowns. He might not get the $35 million per year that went to Russell Wilson, but Prescott needs to get paid.\n\nRead more:\n\nDak Prescott is next in line for a big contract from the Cowboys.
