I didn't intend to disrespect the director personally, and I'm sorry for the confusion that my statement caused.\u201d\n\nKraninger has faced constant criticism from Democrats since taking over the CFPB in December 2018 from acting Director Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyState Dept. official told to 'lay low' after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker Democrats see John Bolton as potential star witness The Hill's Morning Report - Trump grapples with Turkey controversy MORE, who now serves as acting White House chief of staff.\n\nKraninger had pledged to stabilize the CFPB after Mulvaney\u2019s efforts to gut the agency. But Democrats and consumer advocates have condemned her efforts to loosen CFPB regulations on payday lending and easing oversight of financial institutions.\n\nRepublicans and financial industry advocates who have long been critical of the CFPB\u2019s power have praised Kraninger and her willingness to reign in the bureau. Several suggested that Democrats had suffered from buyer\u2019s remorse by giving the CFPB director immense personal power.\n\n\u201cThey ought to blame themselves,\u201d said Rep. Andy Barr Andy Hale BarrThe Hill's Campaign Report: Impeachment fight to take center stage at Dem debate McGrath raises nearly million in third quarter for bid to unseat McConnell Farm manager doubts story horse bit Pence: report MORE (R-Ky.). \u201cThey deliberately designed an agency to elude congressional oversight or accountability.\u201d\n\nHanging over the hearing was also a larger fight in the courts over the agency.\n\nDemocrats responded with outrage last month after Kraninger filed a joint brief with the Justice Department urging the Supreme Court to take up a case challenging the constitutionality of the bureau.\n\nTop Justice Department and CFPB attorneys argued in a brief that the structure of the powerful financial watchdog infringes on the president\u2019s executive authority.\n\nKraninger also explained in a letter to lawmakers that she supported a ruling that would allow the president to fire the director at will, regardless of the personal consequences.\n\nThe move has angered Democrats, who see it as a serious threat to the agency. Democrats on the committee blasted Kraninger for the move.\n\n\"Congress deliberately created the CFPB as an independent regulator, and for you to second guess Congress's judgment on this constitutionality of the CFPB and to argue against the CFPB structure in court is disrespectful of Congress,\" said Maloney.\n\nKraninger added Wednesday that resolving the issue of the CFPB\u2019s legal structure would allow the bureau to focus its time and efforts on enforcing consumer protection law.\n\n\u201cThe constitutional question has delayed many enforcement actions, it has delayed regulatory actions and has been something that I believe fundamentally the Supreme Court and Congress need to decide and settle, once and for all, so that the bureau can move forward and finish and actually engaged in its mission,\u201d Kraninger said.\n\nUpdated at 3:31 p.m.", "description": "Tensions flared at a House committee hearing Wednesday as Democrats accused a powerful federal watchdog of shirking\u00a0its\u00a0obligation to protect consumers from financial fraud.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/kraningerkathleen_101619gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
