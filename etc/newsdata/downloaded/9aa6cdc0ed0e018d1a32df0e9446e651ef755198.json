Computer simulations show that an explosion of sea ice would block the ocean from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere\n\nThe last major ice age is believed to have ended about 2.5 million years ago during the Pleistocene era.\n\nSince then, glaciers have periodically covered the earth, but then retreated and experts have now set out to understand the process behind an ice age -- how it works and what triggers it.\n\nThe latest study was conducted by a team at the University of Chicago who set out to discover and understand the processes that makeup global climate.\n\nAssistant professor Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago (UChicago) said, 'One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages.'\n\n'We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed, but we don't quite know how or why.'\n\nThis event is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years\n\nJansen and former UChicago postdoctoral researcher Alice Marzocchi developed computer simulations of Antarctica sea ice and found it not only changes ocean circulation but acts as a lid and blocks it from releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere \u2013 the less carbon in the air, the cooler the planet becomes.\n\n'What this suggests is that it's a feedback loop,' said Marzocchi, now a research scientist at the UK's National Oceanography Center.\n\n'As the temperature drops, less carbon is released into the atmosphere, which triggers more cooling.'\n\nThe explanation fits with evidence about the past climate from sources like sediments, coral reefs, and core samples from glaciers.\n\n'What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone, with Antarctic sea-ice cover being the key player,' Marzocchi said.\n\nJust the physical effects, before accounting for changes from biological growth, account for about half the drawdown in carbon dioxide that is thought to have happened.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL SEA LEVELS RISE IN THE NEXT FEW CENTURIES? Global sea levels could rise as much as 1.2 metres (4 feet) by 2300 even if we meet the 2015 Paris climate goals, scientists have warned. The long-term change will be driven by a thaw of ice from Greenland to Antarctica that is set to re-draw global coastlines. Sea level rise threatens cities from Shanghai to London, to low-lying swathes of Florida or Bangladesh, and to entire nations such as the Maldives. It is vital that we curb emissions as soon as possible to avoid an even greater rise, a German-led team of researchers said in a new report. By 2300, the report projected that sea levels would gain by 0.7-1.2 metres, even if almost 200 nations fully meet goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Targets set by the accords include cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of this century. Ocean levels will rise inexorably because heat-trapping industrial gases already emitted will linger in the atmosphere, melting more ice, it said. In addition, water naturally expands as it warms above four degrees Celsius (39.2\u00b0F). The report also found that every five years of delay beyond 2020 in peaking global emissions would mean an extra 20 centimetres (8 inches) of sea level rise by 2300. 'Sea level is often communicated as a really slow process that you can't do much about ... but the next 30 years really matter,' lead author Dr Matthias Mengel, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Potsdam, Germany, told Reuters. None of the nearly 200 governments to sign the Paris Accords are on track to meet its pledges.\n\nAlthough experts warn about the dangerous of increased sea ice, other studies this year have found that the amount in the ocean is dwindling.\n\nIn July, NASA had announced that the ice circling Antarctic had hit an all-time low \u2013 losing an area the size of Mexico\n\nFloating ice off the southern continent steadily increased from 1979 and hit a record high in 2014.\n\nThree years later, the annual average extent of Antarctic sea ice hit its lowest mark, wiping out three-and-a-half decades of gains, a NASA study of satellite data shows.\n\nThat means that, since 2014, Antarctica has lost the same amount of ice as has disappeared from the Arctic in more than three decades.", "description": "Experts warn an increase in sea ice could spark the next ice age, as models show that it blocks the ocean from release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere -- creating a reverse greenhouse effect.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20381022-0-image-a-186_1572449033104.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
