Taylor Jr.\u2019s] testimony, which detailed his interactions with his disturbed counterparts in Kyiv \u2014 have indicated otherwise. One continuing source of anxiety in Kyiv is the military assistance aid Trump allegedly held up in an effort to pressure Zelenksy \u2014 aid that was renewed when Taylor and lawmakers from both parties raised alarms inside the administration.\n\nThis problem is not going to get any easier for Ukraine. Over the past 24 hours, two new stories have emerged suggesting that Ukraine has good reason to worry about the state of the bilateral relationship. NBC News\u2019s Josh Lederman and Dan De Luce report that the Trump White House\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to accommodate Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s requests started earlier than previously reported \u2014 mid-May, before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was even sworn in. According to Lederman and De Luce, after U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was recalled, folks in Zelensky\u2019s office thought: \u201cThe message was clear: \u2018You better listen to us. If we tell you to investigate Biden, you better do it. Look at what happened to [Yovanovitch].\u2019 \u201d Meanwhile, the New York Times\u2019s Danny Hakim reported that \u201cthe top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a \u2018sense of duty.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo sure, the Ukraine portfolio in U.S. foreign policy looks like a complete mess. But there\u2019s a deeper pathology at work here. The current state of the administration suggests that all American foreign policy is as misbegotten as the Ukraine portfolio, and it will not get better anytime soon.\n\nUkraine might seem like a special case because of its prominent role in the impeachment inquiry, but consider two other stories over the past two weeks. The successful killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would seem like a counterexample of a decaying foreign policy \u2014 except that it appears the operation was far more fraught with risk than previously understood. The New York Times\u2019s Eric Schmitt, Helene Cooper and Julian Barnes explain:\n\nFor months, intelligence officials had kept Mr. Trump apprised of what he had set as a top priority, the hunt for Mr. al-Baghdadi, the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist. But Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal order three weeks ago disrupted the meticulous planning underway and forced Pentagon officials to speed up the plan for the risky night raid before their ability to control troops, spies and reconnaissance aircraft disappeared with the pullout, the officials said. Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death in the raid on Saturday, they said, occurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nEven the U.S. military is finding it difficult to do its job with Donald Trump as president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe second item ran a few weeks ago. Buried under an avalanche of Ukraine stories, it did not get the coverage it merited. It involves the grieving parents of Harry Dunn, a 19-year-old motorcyclist British police say was killed by Anne Sacoolas because she was driving on the wrong side of the road in the United Kingdom. The wife of a U.S. diplomat, Sacoolas fled the United Kingdom. The U.S. government has claimed she has diplomatic immunity, which is a rather unorthodox move given the nature of the crime, the state of bilateral ties and the respect for the rule of law in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile the Dunns were visiting the United States to drum up sympathy for their request to have Sacoolas face justice across the Atlantic, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien made an \u201curgent\u201d invitation to them to visit the White House, according to the Daily Beast\u2019s Barbie Latza Nadeau.\n\nI still cannot completely believe what transpired next:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, it seems, thought he could convince the Dunns to meet the woman who killed their son, and would do so by opening a side door through which she would walk. The whole scene would be captured by a pool of photographers who had been summoned for the meeting, a family spokesman charged. But the Dunns would have none of it and refused to meet her. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said that the family felt \u201cambushed\u201d when the \u201cbombshell\u201d was dropped that Sacoolas was next door. They had envisioned meeting her one day, but as Seiger told The Daily Beast, \u201conly on British soil\u201d and \u201conly with mediators, counselors, and their legal team in tow.\u201d \u2026 The Dunn family blames National Security Adviser O\u2019Brien for the misstep. \u201cIt struck us that this meeting was hastily arranged by nincompoops on the run and in particular Mr. O\u2019Brien, who appeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well in this meeting which required careful handling and sensitivity,\u201d Seiger wrote. \u201cThe family remain open to the possibility of meeting Mrs. Sacoolas one day in the future but in a neutral and appropriately controlled environment.\u201d In other words, not in a reality-TV setting.\n\nSo it would seem that the president of the United States, strongly supported by his national security adviser, thought that he could broker a spontaneous reconciliation between two foreign nationals and the woman who is alleged to have killed their son and then fled their jurisdiction. All to be captured by White House photographers.\n\nThere are two reasons that U.S. foreign policy for the next year or so will be awful. The first is that Trump\u2019s foreign policy instincts are appalling. The second is that his staff\u2019s instincts do not appear to be much better. If O\u2019Brien thought this was a good idea, then he\u2019s beclowning American foreign policy more now than in his previous job. It speaks to the low caliber of Trump\u2019s current team.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Ukrainian-American relations. No foreign partner can trust this administration. Former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly noted over the weekend, \u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, [Trump] would not be kind of, all over the place.\u201d Kelly might be exaggerating his ability to constrain Trump a tad, but it is hard to deny that the number of galactically stupid ideas emerging from the White House has increased since his departure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn response to Kelly\u2019s statement, White House press secretary/hagiographer Stephanie Grisham said, \u201cI worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president.\u201d Without accepting Grisham\u2019s statement at face value, it sure seems equally that O\u2019Brien, Pompeo and the rest of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy team cannot handle Trump\u2019s \u201cgenius.\u201d Going forward, the quality of U.S. foreign policy will be on par with that stunt with the Dunns.\n\nWe have moved to the age of cringe foreign policy. It is likely to persist for at least another year.\n\nAD", "description": "What foreign policy looks like with a politically weakened D team.", "authors": ["Daniel W. Drezner", "Daniel W.
