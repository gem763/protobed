It makes no difference if the affected employees are quite happy with what they are paid, don\u2019t feel at all exploited and believe nothing has been stolen from them. They and their employer are not allowed to agree on anything less than the prescribed minimums. It also makes no difference if it was totally unintentional, not unusual given that navigating awards and agreements can require at least two degrees, very strong coffee and an executive assistant.\n\nBeing vilified as a wage thief is not a recipe for more jobs and growth.\n\nOf course, most employees are happy to receive a healthy lump sum in back pay; it\u2019s like winning a prize in Lotto. But most are also well aware that their employer does not have a money tree, that wages are a cost to the business, and that if profits are unacceptably low, jobs will be lost. Further, before jobs are lost, hiring ceases. This can be almost as personal as losing your own job, with employers unwilling to hire friends, relatives or children. Being vilified as a wage thief is not a recipe for more jobs and growth.\n\nWhat this \u201ccrisis\u201d reveals is an industrial relations system stuck in the past, lacking flexibility, and substantially contributing to our stagnant productivity and lack of wages growth. Australia badly needs an industrial relations revolution.\n\nWe need a system in which employees of all kinds can negotiate their salary and benefits, individually or collectively, without interference by the government. A system in which people can easily change employers without penalty, employers can change employees without penalty, and employers can compete for people without restraints such as no-poaching clauses.\n\nWoolworths CEO Brad Banducci apologised this week for underpaying staff. Janie Barrett\n\nLike goods and services generally, labour is differentiated by price and quality. Its price should be determined by its value to prospective buyers, not controlled by the dead hand of government.\n\nSetting a minimum price, rather than allowing it to be determined by the market, simply means some labour is not worth buying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaims that people will be exploited by unscrupulous employers are just as irrational as suggesting it is exploitative to buy discounted goods and services. Nobody believes a cut-price plumber is being exploited but, unless paid at least what the government dictates, we are supposed to believe his employee is.\n\nIf a low wage is a sign of exploitation, doesn\u2019t that indicate those on Newstart are more exploited than anyone with a job?\n\nThere is always an element of absurdity in moral panics. When it comes to wage theft, the absurdity is that the real thief is the government with its excessive taxes. Joining the other villains in jail is just what it deserves.", "description": "Moral panics about employers exploiting underpaid workers are absurd.
