These hopes have been dashed,\" he said.\n\n\"Gains in sterling, mid-cap equities and UK gilt yields look likely to face an early retracement over the coming week.\"\n\nIn London, investment banks were ready to implement special measures to ensure that they and their clients could tackle a potential volatility surge on Sunday evening, with additional staff on trading desks.\n\n\"We will have the resources in place to provide a 24-hour service to our clients across all the key markets to which we usually provide access,\" an HSBC spokesman said.\n\nRussell Lascala, head of foreign exchange trading at Deutsche Bank, said his team wasn't expecting a dramatic session of trading and that plans to call in 20 additional people had been abandoned.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see much when the market opens later on Sunday,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman at Citi said on Friday that the bank would be hosting a conference call with former foreign minister William Hague to help its clients to analyse the country's political situation.\n\nSee also:\n\nBrexit nod from parliament to unleash 4% rally in pound, send UK plc to record high\n\nGRAPHIC-Seismograph: Brexit-sensitive financial prices in critical week\n\nBankers brace for no-deal Brexit markets mayhem 10 days early\n\nBrexit will happen on Oct. 31 despite PM's unsigned delay request, UK says", "description": "Brexit stumble to dent euphoric pound but bulk of gains to hold", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9J0JG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
