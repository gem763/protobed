Nathaniel Jones was removed from his role Tuesday\n\nThe exact people involved in the pre-game ritual are not clear, however the school said it was evident it was from this season due to the players wearing helmets in honor of Coach Wash who passed away recently.\n\nThe school confirmed in a statement that 'a coach lead the team in a chant which included a racial slur'.\n\n'Student-athletes were also encouraged to repeat the offensive and racist term,' the statement from Dr. Kenneth St. Charles, President and CEO of St. Augustine High School, continued.

The words and actions of the coach and the players following his lead do not represent the values that St. Augustine has embodied for more than six decades.'\n\nSt Augustine is the leading secondary school for black males in Louisiana.\n\nIn 1967, St. Augustine won a legal battle, which led to the desegregation of Louisiana high school sports as well as the school's admittance into the Louisiana High School Athletic Association, which sanctioned Friday's game.\n\n'The behavior displayed in the video is indefensible and runs counter to our core values and our commitment to serving young men and their families,' the statement continued before referencing how the school was started by Catholic priests and brothers.\n\n'Not only are these actions hurtful to our community, but they also undermine the work of our founders, the Josephites, who are standard-bearers for equality and civil rights. It is their legacy that includes athletics as part of our educational mission.\n\n'We expect our coaches and students to uphold our views on equality, respect and dignity and reflect these values during athletic competition.\n\nFollowing an investigation with the administration, coaching staff, and others who were present to supervise the game, assistant football coach Kenneth Dorsey Jr. was named interim head football coach on Tuesday.\n\nHe will lead the team for the remainder of the 2019 football season.\n\nInterim Coach Dorsey said: 'I have confidence that I will validate the trust that Dr. St. Charles and Principal DeBose have placed in me'\n\n'Following a review of our football program, we have decided to go in a new direction,' said Dr. Kenneth St. Charles, President and CEO of St. Augustine High School.\n\n'We thank Coach Jones for his contributions and service to St. Augustine and our football team. We are confident that Coach Dorsey and the remaining coaches on staff are committed to serving the scholar-athletes in our football program through this period of transition.'\n\nDorsey commented: 'It is an honor to have the opportunity to be a mentor to our team in this new role. I have confidence that I will validate the trust that Dr. St. Charles and Principal DeBose have placed in me. The staff and I will work to make our students, alumni and fans across the country proud of St. Augustine and Purple Knight football.'", "description": "St Augustine High School's head football coach Nathaniel Jones was removed from his role on Tuesday after videos emerged showing an offensive song from Friday at a Louisiana game.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19497616-0-image-a-34_1570633913221.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
