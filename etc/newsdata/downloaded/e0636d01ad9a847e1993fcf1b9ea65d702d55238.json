(Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nWe must not ignore cultural blind spots that put children at risk of abuse.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article has been adapted from remarks delivered at a Heritage Foundation summit.\n\nI\u2019ve been asked to talk about the origins of transgenderism and how it relates to children and their exploitation. But first, I would like to start with a little story.\n\nYesterday I was wandering around outside the Supreme Court chatting with some people who were there to support what\u2019s known as the LGBTQ+ community. I spoke with a lovely guy who identified as homosexual and then four teenage girls who identified as lesbian and queer. They asked me what I thought of the Human Rights Campaign, so I told them upfront that I think it\u2019s a force for tremendous harm in this country. Then, I asked them what they thought of Martin Luther King\u2019s idea, the one about not defining people by irrelevant characteristics like their skin color, or in this case their sexual desires. They said it sounded like a very good idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, two men who were slightly less open-minded wanted to tell me about some horrible feminists called \u201cterfs\u201d who are apparently in cahoots with an even more horrible right-wing institution I probably hadn\u2019t heard of because I\u2019m Scottish. It\u2019s called the Heritage Foundation. So, if anyone knows anyone from there, just let me know, because I want to make sure I don\u2019t die by association.\n\nThe reason I mention this story, of course, is \u2014 other than the Heritage Foundation being a symbol for all that is evil and far-right in American politics \u2014 my experience with the LGBTQ+ community was that it wasn\u2019t really a community so much as it was a big mishmash of people who feel they belong to a certain cause for very different reasons. Yet they were all there at the end of the rainbow to claim their pot of gold, which they had been promised by the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been asked to get to the origins of this movement, and I\u2019m going to try to do that. Of course, as you know, it\u2019s just one stripe of the rainbow, and I couldn\u2019t possibly do it justice in ten minutes, but I\u2019ll do my absolute best. There are three things that I think have been changing since the mid-20th century. The first is in medicine, the second is what I like to call an ontology of desire, and the third is what I and others call the politicization of everything.\n\nLet\u2019s start with medicine. When sex-change surgeries became surgically possible in the post-war period, it was understood to be something of a euphemism. Of course, a person couldn\u2019t literally change from one sex to the other, it\u2019d be more accurate to call it genital surgery, but people were trying to be euphemistic. These procedures were highly controversial, in part because they weren\u2019t always that successful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might\u2019ve seen the movie The Danish Girl, and you\u2019re familiar with the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Ryan Anderson\u2019s book, in which he talks a lot about Paul McHugh, the psychiatrist who had to put an end to the surgeries in the 1970s at Johns Hopkins University, which he described as \u201ccollaborating with madness.\u201d That\u2019s how he called it. People who wanted to change their sex back then were called transsexuals. That was a term popularized by an endocrinologist, Harry Benjamin. Demand was fairly low; it was mostly males wanting to become females. It\u2019s complicated, but sexologists realized there were two types of male-to-female transsexuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was the homosexual transsexual. That\u2019s the person who feels inconspicuously feminine and uncomfortable as a man and is actually a deeply sympathetic figure, I think. Then there\u2019s the autogynephilic. That\u2019s the person who finds the thought of themselves as a woman to be sexually exciting. Studies of interviews with such individuals, conducted by sexologists like Ray Blanchard or Anne Lawrence, suggest that anything ranging from a man who\u2019s turned on from the check assistant\u2019s calling him \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d to somebody who likes to urinate on sanitary pads and to pretend they\u2019re menstruating, and many other things that I think many of us would find maybe too unpleasant to dwell on so early in the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my friend Douglas Murray\u2019s new book, The Madness of Crowds, he explains that the struggle for defining things turned into this hardware versus software issue. So, intersex for instance, is very much a hardwire issue. You can\u2019t exactly get concerned about somebody who has a hardware issue because that\u2019s not their fault. Of course, the reality with homosexuality is that it\u2019s most likely some kind of combination of the two. People may be predisposed to certain proclivities, then there\u2019s environment and so forth, but in any case, like Martin Luther King\u2019s point, don\u2019t define people by that.\n\nThis brings me to my second point, which was what I\u2019m calling the ontology of desire. That\u2019s basically when in the 1990s, the definition of trans began to change. Transsexualism, specifically as a sexual fetish, as autogynephilia, had been known as a perversion. This was politically incorrect, so they changed it to paraphilia, which became politically incorrect and is now known as an identity. The broader term \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d (formerly gender identity disorder) is actually still listed in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, so it\u2019s still a disorder in the DSM, but that\u2019ll likely change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransgenderism was widened, adopted and celebrated in the academy, in large part thanks to people like Judith Butler, who thought that gender was a performance. This is where it gets really interesting in the contradictions. On the one hand, this is Murray\u2019s point. Transgenderism is a hardware issue for trans people, but for everyone else gender is a software issue. So, if you think about it, the only people who are born women are trans women, which is rather an astonishing claim.\n\nThis is where it\u2019s a \u201cboy\u2019s brain in a girl\u2019s body\u201d stuff, which turns out to be more of a metaphor. A more accurate metaphor might be that of a soul \u2014 a gendered soul, the fundamental essence of a person. It goes back a very long way to the Gnostic heresies in Ancient times. The idea is that matter is less important and that it\u2019s all about your spirit or your essence. The exploitation of language evolved so quickly that basically everybody calling a trans woman \u201cshe,\u201d initially that was meant to be a courtesy to accommodate people not to make somebody who has had a hard life have a harder life. Now it\u2019s meant to signal our absolute uncontested belief in their femaleness, which it doesn\u2019t, because trans women are men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe third point is the massive cultural and political tidal wave. The thing is, in the 1990s people might have been forgiven for thinking, \u201cThis will never catch on. This is so outrageous. This is absurd.\u201d They would obviously be right, but the thing was the internet and all these other things came into play. Society had just gotten used to defining whole sections of the population by their desires with regards to homosexuality, which was trying to correct genuine injustices that gay people faced in this country and still face across the world. They overcorrected and they became obsessed with identity. We moved further and further away from the sort of vision that Martin Luther King set out. We started to lose sight of all these different intricacies with regards to sexuality. Then, trans piggybacked onto gay rights, which had piggybacked onto civil rights.\n\nA whole system of buzzwords popped up, like \u201ctransphobia,\u201d \u201ctransmisogyny,\u201d and \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d and all these buzz words that make people think, \u201cGosh I don\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of history.\u201d I should say though, when I was at this thing yesterday with the LGBT crowd, when the police moved and we were walking down to the Supreme Court, it did kind of feel like it was this big angry mob chasing a bunch of women, which I have to say didn\u2019t really feel like being on the right side of history, but maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong.\n\nThe point about civil rights is very important, which is perhaps why I don\u2019t get it as much, coming from a different country. In America, rightly, people are very sensitive about civil rights and their very embarrassing history in that area. They don\u2019t want to repeat that, and I think that\u2019s a good impulse and we should respect that impulse. But of course, it\u2019s been used by people like the Human Rights Campaign for their own cynical ends.\n\nWhich brings me onto the final point: What has any of this got to do with sexualizing children?\n\nI want to suggest two things. The first is that it\u2019s created a massive cultural blind spot. Psychologists have always understood transsexualism to relate or to potentially relate to adult sexuality. We could have a debate about whether we think urinating on sanitary pads is normal behavior or not, we can have that debate, but it is about sexuality. It\u2019s been masked by an ideology, and because of the politics of it all, there\u2019s a great fear for many people. It\u2019s a legitimate fear because they might get fired, or worse, for signaling some terrible \u201cphobia.\u201d\n\nThis becomes very obvious in the subject of drag. Drag, which means \u201cdressed as girl,\u201d comes from the Elizabethan period when women were forbidden from performing publicly, so they assumed the role of women. For some drag queens \u2014 I was speaking to one yesterday, James Davis, whose stage name is Elaine Lancaster \u2014 it really is about performance. I come from the U.K. where we have this genre of theater called pantomime, and it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s just men dressed up as women called \u201cdames.\u201d But these things are very context dependent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis yesterday was agreeing with me. While he was saying that for him it\u2019s about performance, he recognizes that when he\u2019s in bars and other public places, people come up to him at the end, and it\u2019s all about sex for them. As an adult, who knows that and understands that, he can deal with it. He can say whether he wants to get involved or not \u2014 after all, it\u2019s a free country \u2014 but why would we put children in that situation? Why would we invite salacious interest in children by dressing them up in drag? We shouldn\u2019t do that, and I\u2019m referring here to a whole new phenomenon called \u201cdrag kids.\u201d\n\nThe argument we\u2019re supposed to accept rather unthinkingly is that, \u201cOh you\u2019re just being bigoted, and you\u2019re just prejudiced, because this about self-expression. And I\u2019m thinking well no, because yes children dress up, but again, it\u2019s context dependent.\n\nThe analogy I would invite you to think about here is imagine a little girl in a bikini. She\u2019s 13 years old, in her parent\u2019s private pool. Is it a big problem that she\u2019s wearing a bikini? No, it\u2019s not a big problem. She\u2019s in her parents\u2019 private pool. But if the same girl, in the same bikini, still 13 years old, is walking down a catwalk in a room full of adults, would we all feel uncomfortable? Yes, we all would feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s a completely different thing, and it\u2019s the same when it comes to drag.\n\nThis is not hypothetical. I invite you to look up the case of Desmond is Amazing, who should really be called \u201cDesmond needs saving\u201d because this poor little boy is dressed up gyrating in gay clubs in Brooklyn, and few have said anything because to do so would be \u201chomophobic.\u201d Well, no, sorry. Because this drag queen and other gay people would say the same thing on this \u2014 it\u2019s just not on. It is not, and never should be, acceptable to sexualize children.\n\nOur friends at the Humans Rights Campaign would prefer that none of us knew these intricacies, that people like me didn\u2019t exist to remind you of them, that people like James Davis (the Drag Queen) didn\u2019t exist, or those open minded people at the rally who thought that Martin Luther King had a point didn\u2019t exist. They would prefer that the only people who opposed the sexualization of children were like the horrible, frightening right-wing boogeyman the Heritage Foundation. Everyone who\u2019s too scared to talk about this will just have to get over that because there\u2019s too much at stake, I\u2019m sorry to say. And to be honest, the worst thing they can do is say that you\u2019re the boogeyman, and you just say, \u201cBoo.\u201d And then that\u2019s it, you\u2019re done.", "description": "We must not ignore cultural blind spots that put children at risk of abuse.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Rich Lowry", "Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Andrew C.
