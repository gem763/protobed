Kelly in his sex-abuse case.\n\nKelly didn\u2019t attend the hearing on Wednesday on a defense motion asking for his release on bond. U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly agreed with prosecutors that he\u2019s a flight risk and a potential threat to witnesses.\n\nHe remains detained in Chicago, where he faces related charges. A judge there hasn\u2019t ruled on a request to reconsider releasing him on bond.\n\nKelly, whose full name is Robert Kelly, is accused of using his fame to recruit young women and girls for illegal sexual activity.\n\nThe New York judge set a trial date of May 18.
