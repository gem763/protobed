In response to the crisis, regulators have moved slowly but methodically to make sure they are well capitalised and liquid, while maintaining their sound asset quality.\n\nSince the banks are in healthy shape, central banks are a little less apprehensive about the negative knock-on effects of cutting rates, a move that will squeeze bank margins.\n\nThe banks were the source of systemic risk in 2008, but today they are arguably a source of systemic strength.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the corporate sector.\n\nIn 2008, large industrial corporates had the earnings quality and balance sheet strength to see out the crisis and prosper in the aftermath.\n\nCompanies such as Woolworths, Fosters and Coca-Cola Amatil could raise money at levels cheaper than the banks. But many large companies could not resist the lure of cheap money, and they slowly but methodically geared up, borrowing to buy-back shares and juice up distributions to shareholders.\n\nGiven their cost of funding was below that of the banks, highly-rated companies fronted the public capital markets for debt financing creating a multi-trillion dollar corporate bond market boom.\n\nIn 2008, some $US2 trillion of $US6 trillion worth of US dollar credit outstanding was in the form of bonds versus bank loans. Today the credit market has doubled to $US12 trillion ($17.9 trillion) and is split evenly between loans and bonds, which means the bond market has tripled in size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf more lending has migrated to the bond market, it means that asset managers hired by pension funds are wearing the world's credit risk rather than banks.\n\nThat more credit risk is being done by un-leveraged institutions rather than leveraged banks probably makes the broader financial system safer.\n\nBut it does mean that the general public is more exposed to any problems in corporate credit.\n\nOne statistic that is often cited is the enormous growth of the triple-B rated corporate bond market - which has doubled in ten years to more than $US3 trillion.\n\nTriple-B rated companies tend to be of high quality, but the fear is that if too many are downgraded to double-B, which is 'high yield', the universe of buyers will shrink, and bond prices will fall sharply before they are snapped up.\n\nSo far, the fears of credit bears have yet to play out, although a starting point of low bond rates and tight credit spreads means an economic slowdown could hurt more than it has in the past.\n\nAs interest rates head lower around the world, more investors are turning to the credit asset class in search of additional yield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as they do so, another part of the market is booming: private lending.\n\nMore credit investors are looking to deploy capital outside of the public corporate bond markets because they believe they can not only earn better returns in the private market, but also negotiate better protections by lending directly to corporations.\n\nWhether the growth of private debt is good or bad for the system is uncertain.\n\nFor investors, much will depend on the skill of the managers they hire to select and manage their capital.\n\nFor the rest of the market, the growth of private lending may mean that when the next credit crisis emerges, it might take even longer before we take notice.", "description": "The banks were at the heart of the last credit crisis.
