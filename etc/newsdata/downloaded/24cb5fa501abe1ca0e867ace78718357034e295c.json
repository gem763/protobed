It\u2019s a serious contrast in views about the choice voters face as they decide which Democratic candidate is best equipped to defeat President Trump. Mrs. Clinton already lost to Mr. Trump once. Why would Democrats think a Hillary 2.0 candidate would result in anything different?\n\nWhether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name is on the ballot or not, her foreign policy will be, as many of the Democratic candidates adhere to her doctrine of acting as the world\u2019s police, using the tools of war to overthrow governments we don\u2019t like, wasting taxpayer dollars, costing American lives, causing suffering and destruction abroad, and undermining America\u2019s security.\n\nA Gabbard presidency would mean the end of trying to police the world, no more overthrowing governments, an end to the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and redirecting our resources to urgent needs at home. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an isolationist. I will lead with a robust, positive foreign policy based on diplomacy and cooperation rather than confrontation and conflict. Those who follow the Bush-Clinton doctrine believe the only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tulsi Gabbard", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
