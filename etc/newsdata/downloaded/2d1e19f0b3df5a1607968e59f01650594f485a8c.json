It has long been used to demean African-Americans.\n\nWhile Canada and the United States have close economic and cultural ties, the history and politics of race in the two countries are different.\n\nSlavery existed in Canada but it was on a smaller scale than in the United States. Most discussions of racism in Canada today focus on the treatment of immigrant communities and indigenous people. About one in five Canadians were born overseas, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nHere are some recent instances of reaction to practicing or defending the use of blackface in the United States:\n\n* Virginia Democratic Governor Ralph Northam came under fire for having appeared in blackface after a conservative website released a photograph from his 1984 medical school yearbook page showing one person in blackface and another wearing Ku Klux Klan robes. Northam denied being one of the two people in the picture but admitted to putting on blackface to imitate pop star Michael Jackson in the 1980s. He has stayed in office despite calls for his resignation.\n\n* Florida\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Michael Ertel, resigned on Jan. 24 after the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper published photos from a Halloween party 14 years earlier showing him in blackface wearing a T-shirt reading: \u201cKatrina Victim,\u201d a reference to the hurricane that devastated New Orleans. Ertel apologised in a Facebook post, according to media reports.\n\n* Two University of Oklahoma students withdrew from school in January after a video posted to social media showed one young woman painting her face black and using a racial slur while another student filmed. The Snapchat post set off an eruption online, with many fellow students calling for expulsion. The university condemned the incident in a letter announcing the students\u2019 decision to leave.\n\n* Television anchor Megyn Kelly left her NBC morning show, \u201cMegyn Kelly Today,\u201d in 2018 after making on-air remarks defending blackface as part of Halloween costumes. Kelly apologised the next day, but her show was cancelled and she left the network.\n\n* Edwardsville, Illinois, Mayor Hal Patton, was running for the state Senate in 2018 when the Belleville News-Democrat newspaper published a photo of him in blackface at a Halloween party a decade earlier. Patton, who admitted in a statement to local media that the photo was of him dressed as a rapper, lost the race.\n\n* Actress Julianne Hough angered fans and fellow celebrities in 2013 by painting her face black when she dressed up for Halloween as the character \u2018Crazy Eyes\u2019 from the Netflix series \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d Facing criticism from Twitter users, Hough apologised.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's brownface picture scandal deepened on Thursday as other images of him emerged wearing dark makeup only hours after he had apologised for what he characterized as a racist act at a 2001 costume party.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
