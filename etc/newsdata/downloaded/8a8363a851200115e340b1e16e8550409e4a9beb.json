In recent weeks, the Training and Doctrine Command\u2019s Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate (CADD) has released audiobook versions of a pair of training manuals for the first time as part of an experiment to see if it\u2019s an effective medium to spread information to soldiers across the force.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a wider effort to overhaul and modernize how the Army conceptualizes and trains its forces and, in doing so, catch up to what a large segment of the publishing industry has already realized: audiobooks are increasingly popular.\n\nCADD has a particularly important role within the Army: it\u2019s responsible for developing and distributing Army doctrine \u2014 the documentation and reference for how the military operates, combining military theory, history, and best practices. In June, it announced that it was releasing its first audio training manual, FM 3-0, Operations, and this week, it\u2019s joined by ADP 7-0, Training. You can listen to both of the books (and read them, for that matter) via CADD\u2019s website now.\n\nThe books aren\u2019t exactly page-turners, but they\u2019re important for Army personnel to understand\n\nFM 3-0, Operations describes doctrine for how the Army operates in the field, while ADP 7-0, Training is all about how it undertakes training. The books aren\u2019t exactly page-turners for the general public, but both are important documents internally for Army personnel to understand. As Col. Richard Creed, who heads up the audio project, put it: it\u2019s a common language so that the military, in its vast complexity, can understand itself.\n\nCol. Creed told The Verge that the project began 18 months ago with a brainstorming session about finding new ways to deliver information to soldiers, like interactive text or links to videos online. \u201cWe were looking to branch out a little, and said, \u2018Okay, so where else would people have an opportunity besides the classroom or in their unit, or professional development session to become familiar with doctrine?\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cWe were thinking to ourselves that a lot of people listen to audiobooks while they\u2019re in their cars or while working out.\u201d\n\nCADD had just released the print FM 3-0, Operations manual and decided that it would be a good candidate for audio: it was new, and people would be reading up on it. The goal was to \u201ccompress the time that the doctrine is absorbed by the force,\u201d he said, noting that the times when most officers are exposed to doctrine is in the classroom and that it can take 20 years for a soldier to rise through the ranks before going to the Army War College. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough exposure to drive the doctrine into the culture of the force.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what we were thinking was that this audiobook, [because it\u2019s] easily accessible and uploadable on one\u2019s personal electronic device, would be the kind of thing that would [reinforce the teachings] with the force,\u201d Col. Creed said. \u201cAnd those folks who are interested in doctrine but don\u2019t have time to read.\u201d\n\nanother way the force is modernizing\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why this audio experiment feels important: historically, doctrine has been issued in books. By adopting a new medium, it\u2019s another way the force is modernizing.\n\nThese audio versions aren\u2019t designed to supplant physical books, but they are designed to allow soldiers to remain familiar with the material by listening to specific sections when they might otherwise not be able to pick up a book. \u201cThe way I see this being used is as a kind of reinforcement,\u201d Col. Creed said.\n\nSteve Leonard, a retired strategist known in military circles as the creator of \u201cDoctrine Man,\u201d a social media profile and webcomic that offers up military news and commentary, noted that the military has talked for years about how to better deliver doctrine. \u201cEverything points back to a desire to get people reading and learning our playbook ... because they don\u2019t,\u201d he told The Verge. He pointed out that the most recent system was \u201csupposed to [deliver] shorter, fewer, and better manuals,\u201d but that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWe ended up with more manuals, bifurcated content, and confused more people than we educated.\u201d\n\nAudiobooks are more popular than ever, and the Army hopes that it\u2019ll be an effective tool\n\nDespite those difficulties, Leonard pointed out that audiobooks are more popular than ever, and he hopes that it\u2019ll get back to the core of what the Army hoped to do with its manuals: effectively educate its soldiers.\n\nIn the last decade, mainstream publishers and studios have found a figurative gold mine in audio fiction. The Audio Publishers Association released figures earlier this spring showing that more people are listening to audiobooks. Retailers like Audible have been developing their own original content to take advantage of the trend. The US Army, it seems, isn\u2019t immune to the primary thing that made the audiobook marketplace explode: convenience.", "description": "The US Army\u2019s Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate has released some of its manuals as audiobooks for the first time.
