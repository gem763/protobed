The order will remain in effect \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d A spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said there would be punishment for demonstrators who interfere with work or school.\n\nThe Baghdad curfew was announced by the military, which has deployed forces from the elite Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) in Baghdad and Nasiriya, another city that has seen exceptionally violent demonstrations.\n\nThe CTS acted quickly to surround Tahrir Square in Baghdad, where demonstrators have been meeting up. Complaints of excessive violence were soon lodged against CTS troops.\n\n\u201cOur protests are peaceful, we only have flags and water bottles, but they keep firing bombs at us, firing tear gas at us. What have we done to deserve this? What have we done? The young men who died, what did they do?\u201d one demonstrator asked on Saturday night.\n\nLarge numbers of Iraqi students began joining the demonstrators on Sunday despite warnings from Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi. Several schools and universities reportedly shut down so activists could protest on relatively safe campus grounds.\n\nThe protesters have not been mollified by Abdul Mahdi\u2019s promises of reform and are increasingly vocal about wishing to bring his entire government down. Unflattering comparisons to the bloody tyranny of Saddam Hussein have become common.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t scared of ISIS, so why should we be scared of those thieves?\u201d said a demonstrator who lost his leg fighting against the Islamic State. \u201cThey think when they hit us that they\u2019re scaring us, but no: they are actually increasing our determination.\u201d\n\nFour members of the Iraqi parliament have resigned and one of the largest parliamentary blocs is now holding sit-ins to protest Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government, adding to the sense that the prime minister is beginning to lose the struggle to retain his office.", "description": "The death toll from renewed anti-government protests in Iraq reaches 75 over the weekend, as curfews are imposed and troops are called out.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178661616-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
