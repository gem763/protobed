Lotions, Exfoliants\u2014and Challenging the Gender Binary", "language": "en", "text": "For his New Year\u2019s Resolution, Alex Wade decided to take better care of himself. He set some goals with an \u201cimprovement mentality\u201d in mind: go vegetarian, read more books, and get into skincare.\n\nThe last part proved to be the trickiest. Wade, who is 25 and works as a software engineer in New York, tried googling products to buy online, but search results felt too mystifying. He ultimately decided to shop the old fashioned way: he threw on a coat, left his apartment, and headed to Sephora.\n\nBut perusing the skincare aisle felt like reading an instruction manual written in Mandarin. \u201cI glanced around the skin section before I walked right out,\u201d Wade told The Daily Beast. \u201cTwo to three days in a row, I just kind of stood in front of the facial moisturizers for five minutes before leaving. I finally asked for help and got some exfoliant and moisturizer.\u201d Months later, Wade has stuck with the routine. With one exception: \u201cI mainly buy online.\u201d\n\nWade felt intimidated by Sephora, where shoppers can skew overwhelmingly female (though the institution has long been a haven for trans and non-binary customers). He did not know that there are a host of new self-care brands built specifically for men, each one jonesing to hook a newbie.\n\nJust this week, two men launched Asystem, a self-care subscription service that sells a $45 three-step skincare package, supplements, and a glossy coffee table book that WWD described as \u201can extension of the founders\u2019 mission of addressing men\u2019s wellness and inspiring men to check in with themselves on their busy schedules.\u201d\n\nOli Walsh and Josh Levine prefer the term \u201cbetterment\u201d over \u201cself-care,\u201d with Walsh defining the term as working to improve \u201cboth you and the community around you.\u201d By this measure, owning a face wash of eucalyptus, lavender, and bergamot fruit oils can help make you a citizen of the world.\n\nHims, a direct-to-consumer startup , sells generic versions of prescription drugs like Viagra and Cialis alongside gummy vitamins promising to induce sleep and promote the immune system. This brand also takes a lofty approach to encouraging men to shop its site. \u201cLet\u2019s walk at our full height, honor the forebears, have a smile and for god\u2019s sake, floss,\u201d the Hims homepage reads.\n\nEric Bandholz founded Beardbrand in 2012 as a grooming company. The Austin-based business now sells hair and skincare, plus apparel and accessories. He believes that when men look good, they act accordingly. \u201cGuys are drawn to becoming better versions of themselves and making an impact on the world,\u201d Bandholz told The Daily Beast. \u201cHow can I be a good father, husband, dad, employee? Part of that is your self-care routine.\u201d\n\nThese companies set up shop even as pop culture grapples with how to dismantle\u2014or soften\u2014the gender binary. The mainstream beauty industry, which publicly catered exclusively women for more than a century, has embraced neutral advertising.\n\nHeritage brands like Maybelline, L\u2019Oreal, CoverGirl, and MAC have employed male spokespeople. Up-and-comers like Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty, and the Brooklyn upstart Fluide, which donates profits to LGBTQ-supporting charities, have a similar, cast-whoever approach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly room in the men\u2019s grooming market for men\u2019s specific products,\u201d David Yi, founder and editor of the lifestyle website Very Good Light, told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s important for men to be encouraged to care for themselves. I simply feel that this works for the millennial market and up though. With Gen Z, we\u2019re seeing that products are products are products, and catering to one gender is simply outdated.\u201d\n\nIndeed, one Gen Z high schooler and influencer David Ruff put it bluntly. \u201cI think self-care targeted for men is simply a heteronormative marketing strategy,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cWe still live in a society that is prevalent with fragile masculinity. Men are constantly told not to take care of themselves of express emotion; if it isn\u2019t an Axe commercial surrounded by women, self-care is seemingly not integral.\u201d\n\n\u201c Sure, I\u2019ll use a product geared toward men if I like it, but I go for how the product makes me feel, not what it is supposed to make me feel because I am a certain gender \u201d \u2014 David Ruff\n\n\u201cSelf-care reminds me to slow down,\u201d Ruff added. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to subscribe to a certain gender to feel pressure and want to eradicate that.\u201d Every night, Ruff adds mini-indulgences to his life, such as using the Ren Lavender Pillow Spray on his sheets before bed, a scent which he says reminds him to \u201cwind down.\u201d He\u2019ll use eye patches in the morning from Erno Laszlo or Wander Beauty, both brands that primarily target women.\n\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll use a product geared toward men if I like it, but I go for how the product makes me feel, not what it is supposed to make me feel because I am a certain gender,\u201d Ruff said.\n\nIt's a principled stance, but also one that can be expensive. As Li noted, there is the so-called \u201cpink tax\u201d to deal with, or the fact that women are charged, on average, 13 percent more on products comparable to those in the men\u2019s aisle.\n\nFor instance: Asystem charges $45 for a month-long supply of cleanser, moisturizer, and night cream; just one tube of cleanser from the very popular, female-focused skincare line Sunday Riley will set a shopper back $35.\n\nDermatologists say that, in general, men have thicker skin than women do. They also tend to have more oil glands, which means they produce more sweat. Men\u2019s brands know this information and often use it to differentiate their skincare.\n\nGarrett Munce, the grooming director of Esquire and Men\u2019s Health, is wary of saying that skincare for dudes works \u201charder\u201d than its feminine counterparts.\n\n\u201cJust because a guy is oilier than a woman sitting next to him does not mean that there is a difference in how good his moisturizer is,\u201d Munce said. \u201cAnd just because men tend to have oilier skin, that also doesn\u2019t mean that a man can\u2019t have dry skin, or acne, or sensitive skin.\u201d\n\nStill, Munce doesn\u2019t denounce all male self-care brands. \u201cIf it makes a guy more comfortable to use a skincare product or go to a spa that says, \u2018For men,\u2019 then I\u2019m all for it,\u201d he said.\n\nMunce noted that a lot of men already take care of themselves without taking the time to call it that. \u201cWorking out is self-care and eating well is self-care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about reframing the conversation and less about repackaging it.\u201d\n\nA study published by Beauty Independent in April found that the men\u2019s self-care market could hit $166 billion by 2022. So yes, we will live in a world of sheet masks \u201cfor men.\u201d But it helps to remember that reality has already existed, unpublicized, for many, many years.\n\n\u201cThere have been times in my life where I certainly didn\u2019t feel comfortable with myself, but I felt totally fine walking into the women\u2019s hair aisle and buying hairspray,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone should be like that. Don\u2019t get hung up on whether the packaging is black or pink.\u201d", "description": "Millennial men love their macho-branded sheet masks, while Gen Z wants to dismantle gender boundaries.
