Asked whether that would include the Dongfeng 41, he said: \u201dPlease wait and see.\u201d\n\nThe ability to project power is increasingly urgent for Chinese leaders who want to control shipping lanes and waters also claimed by Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and other governments.\n\n\u201cChina has developed nuclear, space, cyberspace and other capabilities that can reach potential adversaries across the globe,\u201d the US Defence Intelligence Agency said in a report in January.\n\nLast year\u2019s spending on the PLA rose 5 per cent to $250bn (\u00a3228bn), or about 10 times its 1994 level, according to SIPRI. The United States, with a force of 1.3 million, was far ahead at $650 billion, or more than twice China\u2019s level.\n\nBeijing is regarded, along with the United States, as a leader in drone aircraft, which it sells in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIn unpiloted aerial vehicles, China has made a lot of progress in recent years and has a vast array of systems under development,\u201d said Harry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\nNo details of the Dongfeng 41 have been released, but the Centre for Strategic & International Studies in Washington says it may have the world\u2019s longest range at 15,000km.\n\nAnalysts say the DF-41, flying at 25 times the speed of sound, might be able to reach the United States in 30 minutes with up to 10 warheads for separate targets \u2013 a technology known as MIRV, or multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles.\n\nChina\u2019s current mainstay missile, the Dongfeng 31, has a range of more than 11,200 km which puts most of the continental United States within reach.\n\nPhotos circulated on Chinese social media of parade preparations show blurry images of a possible attack drone dubbed \u201cSharp Sword\u201d and another drone, the DR-8 or Wuzhen 8.\n\nThe parade also might give more subtle signs of China\u2019s plans, said Mr Wezeman.\n\nAirborne tankers or marines in amphibious vehicles could \u201cindicate the importance of long-range intervention\u201d, he said. Air defence missiles might show Beijing is preparing for war with the United States or another advanced opponent.", "description": "A parade by China\u2019s secretive military will offer a rare look at its rapidly developing arsenal, including possibly a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the United States in 30 minutes, as Beijing gets closer to matching Washington and other powers in weapons technology.The Dongfeng 41 is one of", "authors": ["Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q1PpyU5cuQJzE4wNoVYVbQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/c209b2731f6db2707419b0575f4b08e2", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
