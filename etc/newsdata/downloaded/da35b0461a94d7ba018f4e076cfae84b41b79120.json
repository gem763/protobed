We\u2019ve now got devices like tablets and smartphones added to the mix, so Adobe has created an AI-powered plugin that can automatically prep a video for any screen while ensuring the most important parts are always in frame.\n\nAdobe Has Taught An AI To Recognise Fake Photos Even if you know what to look for, spotting phoney photos on the internet isn't always the easiest thing to do \u2014 and it's only going to get harder. Fortunately Adobe \u2014 who you could strongly argue is responsible for the whole \"photoshopping\" thing \u2014 is on the front lines, fighting forgeries with an AI it's taught to spot the telltales signs of tampering.

It will analyse the footage, and then create multiple versions in 16:9 widescreen, 1:1 square, and 9:16 vertical aspect ratios so the final result can be played on almost any device.\n\nIn addition, to ensure the video\u2019s subject matter remains properly in frame, the plugin will also shrink and reposition any titling created in Adobe Premiere to fit within the various dimensions. No software tool is infallible however, so if the automatic pan and scan adjustments made by Auto Reframe don\u2019t produce results users are satisfied with, manual adjustments and tweaks can be made.\n\nFor professionals churning out content that could end up online or broadcast to millions, Auto Reframe sounds like it will help alleviate at least a few headaches during post-production. But it\u2019s also a tool that every smartphone should include by default for those times when friends and family send you a video annoyingly filmed in portrait mode and you\u2019d rather enjoy it widescreen without suffering through giant black bars appearing on either side of your screen. Conversely, if the vertical video phenomenon continues its march to prominence, we could see this tool used for evil.", "description": "Adapting videos to various screens has been a challenge ever since movies, shot for wide theatre screens, were first broadcast on square TVs.
