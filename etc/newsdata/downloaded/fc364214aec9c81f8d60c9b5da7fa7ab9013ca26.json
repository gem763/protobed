Customers in China will be able to purchase the phone for \u00a516,999 \u2013 about $2,400 \u2013 starting November 15. There\u2019s no word on when it will hit the international market, let alone the US.\n\nThe device features a Kirin 980 chip, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and 5G connectivity, powered by a 4,500 mAh battery. The folding display covers an 8-inch diagonal, or a 6.6-inch one when folded. Unlike the Galaxy Fold, the bendy panel is exposed when the device is folded. Replacing a broken screen will cost \u00a52,699 (about $380). Not awful, but not exactly cheap either. For comparison, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy fold costs $1,980 includes free screen repairs within the first year of using the device, and one $150 repair thereafter.\n\nThe company did not elaborate on when it will arrive outside China other than saying it\u2019s keeping an eye on how 5G develops in other markets. You might not want to make a purchase quite yet anway. Aside from the fact it\u2019s probably a good idea to wait out any potential kinks, the company teased it plans to release an updated model with the Kirin 990 in March.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F06%2FMate-X.jpg&signature=2dd98f218be00ea314281f0b6c9215a5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
