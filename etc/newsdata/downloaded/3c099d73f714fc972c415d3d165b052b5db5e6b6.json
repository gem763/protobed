The remainder, who paid with cash, cheque, credit card or debit card, were unable to apply for refunds until 7 October \u2013 two weeks after Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse \u2013 and were told that refunds could take up to 60 days.\n\nThe refunds process should therefore finish by early December, but The Independent understands that this target may not be reached \u2013 with some Thomas Cook customers who paid thousands of pounds likely to be waiting until 2020 to get their money back.\n\nThe CAA says: \u201cFor bookings made by payment methods other than direct debit, directly with travel agents or where flights are with another airline, the refund process will take longer owing to the numerous and complex data processing systems Thomas Cook employed across Europe.\u201d\n\nFollowing the collapse of Monarch Airlines in 2017, which involved a much smaller number of refunds, one in five customers had to wait over three months to get their cash back.\n\nFraud has also been a problem for the CAA, with around 15 per cent of the earliest online applications for refunds believed to be fraudulent. The organisation said: \u2018Where we see evidence of fraud, we will seek to prosecute any individuals or organisations involved.\u201d\n\nIn addition, some scam websites have been trying to extract fees or bank details from Thomas Cook customers seeking refunds. Thomascook.caa.co.uk/refunds is the only official site.\n\nThe total bill for refunds is expected to be \u00a3420m. The cost will be met by the Air Travel Trust fund, which is made up of Atol contributions, and the CAA\u2019s insurers. The CAA is not yet able to say how the bill will be split.\n\nMore details have emerged of the scale of Operation Matterhorn. This was the repatriation programme that brought back Thomas Cook customers who were abroad at the time of the collapse.\n\nThe operation cost \u00a3100m, of which around \u00a360m is expected to be met by the Atol fund. The remainder, for passengers with no Atol cover, will be borne by taxpayers.\n\nThe CAA flew 141,197 people back, at an average cost per person of \u00a3704. In the Monarch repatriation, the cost per person was \u00a3623. But Thomas Cook\u2019s schedule included long-haul destinations in the US and Caribbean.", "description": "One month after the collapse of Thomas Cook, hundreds of thousands of grounded travellers face waiting another six weeks for refunds for their cancelled holidays.\u00a0 Around 800,000 people who had packages booked with the failed travel giant are due refunds under the Atol scheme, administered by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
