And a student performance space is being built within the retirement complex.\n\nThe New York Legislature approved the long-term lease of state land for the project in 2011, and Purchase College set up a nonprofit organization to develop it with a private operator, at a projected cost of $320 million. Officials are expecting a base of $2 million in annual rental income, to be used to almost double the college\u2019s $1.8 million scholarship fund and to hire new faculty members.\n\nAt a recent marketing session for the Purchase project, called Broadview Senior Living, Ashley Wade, the project\u2019s marketing director, gave a hard sell to about 25 potential buyers.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to class,\u201d Ms. Wade said. \u201cYou just get to go to class.\u201d\n\nMany of the listeners were in sticker shock. The Purchase College \u201centrance fee\u201d ranges from $595,000 for an apartment to $1,995,000 for a small house; monthly services fees range from $4,300 to $8,700 for one resident and $1,500 more for a second person. When the unit is vacated, 90 percent of the entrance fee is refundable to the residents or their heirs. One-fifth of the units are reserved for people with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for Westchester County; for them, the entrance fees start at $250,000.\n\nPrices at Arizona State\u2019s project, called Mirabella, range from the mid-$300,000s to more than $1 million for a penthouse apartment.\n\nJudy Cohen, 82, a retired English teacher, and her husband, Martin, 84, a cardiologist, wondered whether they would be welcomed by the students.\n\n\u201cThe students have their own life,\u201d Dr. Cohen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many would want to come and sit with. \u2026\u201d As his voice trailed off, his wife picked up the thread: \u201cOld people,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s put the word out there.\u201d", "description": "Universities and colleges are sponsoring retirement communities on their grounds, hoping that young and old can enrich each other\u2019s lives while filling the school\u2019s coffers.", "authors": ["Anemona Hartocollis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/us/10retirementcolleges-cohens/10retirementcolleges-cohens-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
