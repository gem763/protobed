It has printed John 3: 16 on the bottom of its cups. However, like Chick-fil-A before it, the owner and heiress of the burger chain, Lynsi Snyder, is letting everyone know just how much Christ means to her publicly.\n\nSnyder gave an interview with The Christian Post and divulged that her life was on a downward spiral until she came to Christ, leaving behind drug and alcohol addiction, broken marriages, physical abuse, and more. The burger empire heiress said that she \u201cfinally found that the deep need in my heart can only be filled by Jesus and my identity in Him.\u201d\n\nSnyder stressed that, even when you\u2019ve overcome the pains of your past, you still need Christ for the hurdles that are to come according to The Christian Post:\n\n\u201cI have learned so much through my broken relationships along with the ups and downs that come through marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been the one to hurt, and I\u2019ve been hurt. I have gained insight and growth through both sides of the coin.\u201d \u201cPrior to the journey of marriage, it\u2019s so important to seek time and healing with Jesus,\u201d she stressed. \u201cEven if you are blessed to be healed of personal wounds and past relationship baggage, life will still bring hurdles and trials to overcome in your relationship.\u201d\n\nWhile John 3:16 has been printed on their cups for years, Snyder decided the company should have more Bible verses on its products in order to share more of the messages it has to impart. This now includes Proverbs 24:16 and Luke 6:35.\n\n\u201cIt was my uncle Rich who put the Bible verses on the cups and wrappers in the early \u201890s, just before he passed away,\u201d she told the Christian Post. \u201cHe had just accepted the Lord and wanted to put that little touch of his faith on our brand. It\u2019s a family business and will always be, and that\u2019s a family touch. In later years, I added verses to the fry boat, coffee, and hot cocoa cups.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the printing of verses on containers that Snyder is satisfied with. She told The Christian Post that she\u2019s also started an organization called \u201cArmy of Love,\u201d which helps those who are in emotional need just like she was when her third marriage was falling apart:\n\n\u201cI was calling out to God as my third marriage was failing. I was in a place where I felt I couldn\u2019t do ministry because my own heart and home were a mess,\u201d she recounted. \u201cMy husband and I were in constant turmoil. I became desperate for the hope that I could be used by God despite my circumstances.\u201d While driving through New Orleans one day, Snyder heard Isaiah 61 in her head. The passage reads, in part: \u201cHe has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.\u201d \u201cI knew that I would be a part of a ministry that would unify the body of Christ into soldiers who would reach out to one another and to the lost in the last days,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cMany people attend church, but the pool of discipleship is shallow, so I saw training modules online to disciple people and take them deeper than they may have gone attending church or Bible study. I envisioned this Army uniting various ministries and supporting churches and organizations.\u201d\n\nOverall, Snyder said she lives her life by the power of Christ and not just with Christ as a thing she turns to from time to time when needed. She gives a great example of her philosophy:\n\n\u201cPicture our lives being a power strip. We plug so many things into the power strip \u2014 work, family, hobbies, and God,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that is all wrong. God must be the power strip and everything in our life should be plugged into Him as our power source. He gives us life and then we have His power in everything we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be one of the \u2018plug-ins\u2019 in our life, but rather we should live plugged into Him and the calling He has for us,\u201d she added.\n\nIt\u2019s very brave, especially in this day and age, for any CEO to openly come out and proclaim their love of Christ. However, the backlash that typically follows from doing so is made moot in the face of the support from American Christians. Chick-fil-A has also had its share of backlash and continues to fight battles for its open adherence to scripture, but its support is so wide and far that it\u2019s become the third most successful fast food joint in America.\n\nBut the reward isn\u2019t the point. The point is that you feel a wholeness from your reliance and obedience to Christ. Perhaps being wealthy and successful is the plan, but maybe it\u2019s not, but even if it\u2019s not, you\u2019ll feel free of chains as Snyder is trying to point out.", "description": "In-N-Out Burger Joins Chick-fil-A as a Company That Openly Celebrates Its Christian Values", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/93dea44a-a714-4299-a81d-7f4a44f0f3ca@news.ap_.org_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
