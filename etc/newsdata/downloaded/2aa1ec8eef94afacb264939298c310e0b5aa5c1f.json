Granting travellers access from 27 ports onward with proof of a third country destination, which includes Hong Kong and Macau, seeing China is now set to be a breeze.\n\nTo secure the visa, travellers must show a ticket onto their final destination, i.e. either by plane or cruise, have a filled out visa application form, and have affixed passport-sized photos to it.\n\nThe list of cities that one can visit in transit will now include World Heritage Site Xi'an, historical wonders in Ningbo, Chengdu, which is known for its pandas and cultural hub Chongqing, from 1 December 2019, says CNN.\n\nWATCH: Don't look down!

Visitors cannot explore multiple Chinese cities on the G Visa, says Travel and Leisure. You are allowed to spend, for example three days in Xi'an as a stopover before moving onto Hong Kong or another destination.\n\nCGTN says that these prolonged exemptions will greatly benefit foreign tourists and businessmen.

South African has thus simplified visa requirements for China as the market is key.\n\nREAD: China excludes SA from new list of visa-free travel to its island of Hainan\n\nHowever, South Africans still need visas for China and are currently not included in the 53 countries allowed this transit visa. Similarly, in 2018 China unveiled plans to permit visa-free travel to its southern island of Hainan; again SA was excluded from this visa-free list.\n\nWhere is the love China?
