I'm not here for it. If I can't be extra, then I don't want to game. Give me the stupid lights and the cat airs on my headphones. Give me that obnoxious putrid green on everything. Razer is clearly leaning very heavily into my exact demographic, and I'm not too ashamed to admit that I'm a sucker for it.\n\nTake, for example, the brand new Razer Kraken Kitty Edition.\n\nWhile previously, Razer offered cat ears as optional accessories, the Kraken Kittys come with the ears built in. Plus, they light up and glow in tune with your Razer Chroma settings. They're ridiculous! I want them!\n\nUnfortunately, the only pair on display at PAX Australia was on the head of a man streaming from the booth, so I could only gaze longingly at them from a distance, but I think I'm a little bit in love.\n\nBeyond the delightfully silly Kitty-eared headsets, Razer was also showing off the rest of its range at PAX, including the sleek new Razer Blade 15, its 15.6\" gaming laptop.\n\nWhen Razer first entered the market, it would be fair to say its products were, in some ways, gimmicky, but over the last few years, they've evolved to become a leading light of the games industry. I personally have my entire PC set-up decked in Razer gear, from my headset to my keyboard, mouse and mic. They're solid and reliable, and PAX was the perfect chance for the company to show off its goods. Its booth was pumping, too, and it's clear how much love the gaming community has for them.\n\nPart of that is also because they're willing to go off the beaten path. Not only did the booth boast a range of mainstream Razer products, they also had specialist and niche gear too, including an Xbox-compatible Gears of War 5 keyboard, and a Black Widow skinned out as a Star Wars keyboard, complete with a stormtrooper mouse. Razer almost understands its target audience a little too well, and it's why the Kraken Kittys have me feeling so attacked.\n\nRazer's products are hardly essential. But they are extremely fun, gorgeous to look at, and most importantly, extra. And I wouldn't have it any other way.", "description": "Some gamers just want a solid machine to play their games on.
