Richard Nixon\u2019s victory in 1972, Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory in 1980 and George W. Bush\u2019s victory in 2004 (the only presidential election out of the past seven in which the Republican won the popular vote) all depended in part on posing as the candidate more prepared to confront menacing foreigners.\n\nAnd Barack Obama faced constant, scurrilous accusations of being too deferential to foreign rulers. Remember the \u201capology tour,\u201d or the assertions that he had bowed to overseas leaders?\n\nBut now we have a president who really is unpatriotic to the point of betraying American values and interests. We don\u2019t know the full extent of Donald Trump\u2019s malfeasance \u2014 we don\u2019t know, for example, how much his policies have been shaped by the money foreign governments have been lavishing on his businesses. But even what we do know \u2014 his admitted solicitation of foreign help in digging up dirt on political rivals, his praise for brutal autocrats \u2014 would have had Republicans howling about treason if a Democrat had done it.\n\nYet almost all G.O.P. politicians seem perfectly fine with Trump\u2019s behavior. Which means that it\u2019s time to call Republican superpatriotism what it was long before Trump appeared on the scene: a fraud.", "description": "And Democrats need to expose them for what they are.", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/opinion/23krugmanWeb/23krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
