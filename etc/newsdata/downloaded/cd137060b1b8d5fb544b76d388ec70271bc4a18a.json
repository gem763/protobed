Why? Because they do not want accurate information about the number of noncitizens living in the United States. Their latest ploy is an attempt to \u201cimproperly derail\u201d the resolution of this case, the Justice Department wrote in a letter this month. They are relying on the kind of false claim that President Trump would call fake news, arguing government lawyers \u201clied\u201d about the reasons for reinstating the citizenship question on the census.\n\nAt the heart of the motion by the plaintiffs to reopen the evidence and sanction the government is their claim, which the Justice Department itself says \u201cborders on frivolous,\u201d that Thomas Hofeller, a Republican National Committee redistricting expert, had supposedly influenced the decision to reinstate the citizenship question through a 2015 study, and that Trump administration officials failed to reveal his involvement. The circumstances under which lawyers for the plaintiffs got hold of this study and other possibly privileged documents are highly questionable from an ethical perspective. The New York Times wrote the estranged daughter of Hofeller gave lawyers his computer files after he passed away last year.\n\nHis study, which was never published, pointed out the likely effect on redistricting. If citizen population is used to draw district lines rather than total population, Republicans may benefit, as would Hispanics, a majority of whom vote for Democrats. His conclusions are hardly earth shattering. I wrote about this likely effect in 2015, as did others, when the Supreme Court was reviewing the use of citizen population in the redistricting process in Sue Evenwel versus Greg Abbott. It is certainly no big secret.\n\nThe plaintiffs also try to make much about Hofeller pointing out problems with the accuracy of the citizenship data from the American Community Survey sent by the Census Bureau to a limited number of households. Why? Because John Gore, former assistant attorney general for civil rights, listed the same problems when his office sent a letter to the Commerce Department in 2017 asking that a citizenship question be reinstated to assist in enforcing the Voting Rights Act. This, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs, is evidence of some secret official conspiracy.\n\nBut as the Justice Department correctly tells the Supreme Court, the problems with the American Community Survey are publicly known and have been \u201cdiscussed in case law and academic literature for years.\u201dThe Justice Department says the claim by the plaintiffs that Gore relied on the unpublished study is false. It says the plaintiffs provided no evidence that Gore read or \u201cwas even aware of the existence\u201d of the unpublished study. Such evidence \u201cdoes not exist\u201d and there is \u201cno smoking gun\" on this.\n\nThe claim by the plaintiffs is \u201cpure speculation\u201ddue to supposed \u201cstriking similarities\u201d between the study and the letter. But according to the Justice Department, even a \u201ccursory comparison of the two documents\u201d shows that they are \u201cnot strikingly similar.\u201d In fact, the \u201cpattern matching exercise reads more like the product of a conspiracy theorist than a careful legal analysis.\u201dThe letter is actually much more similar to the briefs filed in Sue Evenwel versus Greg Abbott. It is probably no surprise the letter bears what some may consider similarities to, for instance, the brief filed by former Census Bureau directors. Other briefs in the case also used similar language about known problems with the American Community Survey.\n\nThe Justice Department says the plaintiffs showed no evidence to support their claims, other than speculation that the study somehow got to the Justice Department through \u201cmysterious and unidentified channels.\u201d But the Justice Department says the study was never in possession of Gore. The plaintiffs also offered this nonsensical claim about supposedly not knowing that Gore himself had a draft letter from a private expert for the Commerce Department. But the Justice Department turned over that draft to the plaintiffs months ago. They never asked Gore about the draft letter, and their \u201cobliviousness is not a valid basis to sanction the government.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that the challengers have produced no evidence that government officials lied or hid the reasons for adding the citizenship question to the census. The Justice Department says this is a \u201cbaseless attack\u201d on its integrity, based on \u201cnothing more than fevered speculation\u201d and \u201csupposed new evidence\u201d that the plaintiffs had known about for months. This is a last ditch effort to prevent the Supreme Court from ruling in favor of the Trump administration. That may or may not happen, since one cannot predict how the justices will rule. But it is much ado about nothing and must certainly not derail the resolution of the case.", "description": "Some liberals are terrified that the Supreme Court will allow the Trump administration to reinstate a citizenship question on the census.
