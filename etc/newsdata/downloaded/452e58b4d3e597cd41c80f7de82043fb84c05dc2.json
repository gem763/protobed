He is pictured as he was sentenced on Friday afternoon\n\nLewis was supported in court by his wife Amy who asked the judge not to send him to prison for the sake of their children. Lewis also told the court that prison scared him.\n\nBut Solicitor Kevin Brackett said Lewis' misconduct was 'brazen, naked corruption' and his evasive answers and convenient memory lapses about key details that might be harmful or humiliating during his testimony in his four-day misconduct trial shows he remains arrogant and cocky.\n\n'He has no insight into his own personal failings. This wasn't an isolated incident. This is who he is. I don't think he's capable of change,' Brackett said.\n\nAs he sentenced him, Judge G. Thomas Cooper told Lewis if he truly is a changed man, he would take advantage of what looks like a dire situation behind bars.\n\n'My sentence unfortunately for you is going to give you a lot of time to think about this.\n\n'Put into perspective your life with your family, your community, your God. I'd advise you not to squander or waste that time,' Cooper said as Lewis lowered his head.\n\nHe was led away from the courtroom in handcuffs on Friday and did not answer questions from reporters.\n\nLewis testified he did not plan to have sex with his young female assistant at an out-of-town budget conference, but one thing led to another after they went out for drinks and ended up in her hotel room.\n\nProsecutors disagreed and said Lewis, 43, used his power to set up the encounter, first by hiring the then 22-year-old woman at $62,000 a year in an agency where the starting salary for a deputy is around $30,000.\n\nLewis was supported in court by his wife Amy, (pictured), who asked the judge not to send him to prison for the sake of their children, while Lewis told the court that prison scared him\n\nSuspended Greenville Sheriff Will Lewis speaks to his attorney, Rauch Wise, before court resumes on Thursday afternoon. He said he was remorseful for his actions and that he hoped it would make him a better man\n\nThey said he then set up a trip and left a bottle of whisky in her bag so he would have to go to her room and get it late at night.\n\nSavanah Nabors had previously gone public with the details of what she called an unwanted sexual encounter with Lewis in 2017 in a Charlotte, North Carolina, hotel.\n\nShe wrote in a blog and testified that she woke up after drinks and the sheriff was on top of her and having sex.\n\nNo sexual assault charges have been filed against Lewis. Nabors was paid nearly $100,000 from a state insurance fund in May to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against Lewis, Greenville County and the sheriff's office.\n\nAfter the sentencing Gov\\ernor Henry McMaster issued an executive order permanently removing Lewis from the office of sheriff\n\nNabors taped 11 conversations with the sheriff after he followed her around one day. Lewis did not admit to having sex with her until she made those tapes public.\n\nIn one of them, Lewis tries to get Nabors to go to a conference in Reno, Nevada, with him and so they can 'sit around and drink on the beach on company time' and stay in the same room.\n\nHolding her baby daughter in her arms and surrounded by family, Nabors said after sentencing: 'It's not about the time, it's about the fact he will never be in a position of power to do this again and I hope that other women will find the courage to come forward if anything like this has ever happened.\n\n'People may have told you you should have been stronger, should have been smarter but you are strong enough, you're worthy, you are believed.\n\nShe said she was ready to move forward as the effect of the case was 'devastating' during an interview with WYFF4.\n\nAsked about testifying she said: 'It was one of the most difficult things I have ever done.\n\n'That's why I don't want victims to think that it's easy and you're going to be rectified after all this, what he did will never be right and I can't get back what he stole from me.'\n\nLewis, 43, said he did not plan to have sex with his young female assistant at an out-of-town budget conference, but one thing led to another after they went out for drinks and ended up in her hotel room\n\nProsecutors said Lewis, 43, used his power to set up the encounter, first by hiring the then 22-year-old woman at $62,000 a year in an agency where the starting salary for a deputy is around $30,000\n\nI hope this sets the example that you cant just wear a gun and badge and do whatever you want to do with it.'\n\nLewis said the affair humbled him and allowed him to become a better man and a better husband. His wife of 20 years sat at the defense table through the whole trial.\n\nIn court footage obtained by WYFF4: 'If you're asking me if this sexual encounter was something I enjoyed as a man, well, yes, I'm a man,' Lewis said during cross examination Thursday. It seems blissful but it's the ramifications afterward.'\n\n'Sheer remorsefulness, I am truly sorry for what I have done that led me to this position.'\n\nAt the sentencing, Lewis' wife, Amy, told the judge she had seen a transformation in her husband and asked not to send him to prison for his sake and the sake of their teenage children as Lewis dabbed his eyes.\n\nSavanah Nabors wrote in a blog and testified that she woke up after drinks to find the sheriff having sex with her\n\nNabors taped 11 conversations with the sheriff after he followed her around one day. Lewis did not admit to having sex with her until she made those tapes public\n\n'I don't believe incarcerating this man will be in any way as challenging as the way I will challenge him.\n\n'The man has never shown me anything other than the highest respect. He could have run and left, that would have been the easiest thing to do, but he came and he confessed and we stayed up the night.\n\n'He is the love of my life. I am sorry for the behavior he displayed. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, Amy Lewis said.\n\n'But I know who the enemy is. The enemy is not this man standing before the court today. The enemy is much, much greater. And he has the capability residing in any one of us who separate ourselves from the Lord.'\n\nLewis' lawyer Rauch Wise said the power and influence of being sheriff went to Lewis' head. 'Too big for his britches. I think that's a fair representation of what happened,' Wise said.\n\nNabors said she hoped Lewis would ever be able to be 'in a position of power to do this again, and hoped it would give courage to other women in similar circumstances to come forward\n\nA jury found Lewis guilty of one misconduct charge, assuring under the law he will be removed from the job he won in South Carolina's most populous county in 2016.\n\nJurors convicted Lewis of misconduct that involves corruption or fraud, but not guilty of misconduct that involves not doing a public job properly. That other charge carried up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAfter the sentencing Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order permanently removing Lewis from the office of sheriff. Johnny Mack Brown will remain the interim sheriff until a special election is held, the order added.\n\nLewis' lawyer said he is considering an appeal and asking Judge Cooper to let Lewis stay free while it is heard.\n\nLewis is the ninth sheriff in South Carolina to be convicted of crimes while in office in the past decade.\n\nTheir crimes have ranged from using inmates for personal work to running a scheme to create fake police reports to help fix credit problems to protecting drug dealers.\n\nFive of them have now been sentenced to time behind bars. Two other sheriffs are awaiting trials.\n\nIndictments remain in court records on about a half-dozen other charges against Lewis, including allegations he lied about conducting a background check.\n\nOther charges include that gave an unqualified employee a badge and intimidated deputies to try to keep them from talking to investigators. Prosecutors have not said what they plan to do in those cases.", "description": "Will Lewis,a former South Carolina sheriff, was sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison for using his position to have sex with his personal assistant , who was 22-years-old at the time.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/18/20191232-0-image-a-37_1572026090575.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
