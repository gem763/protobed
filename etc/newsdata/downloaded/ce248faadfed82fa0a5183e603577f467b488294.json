Gold has averaged around $1,375 an ounce so far this year.\n\nGold - traditionally seen as a safe place to invest in uncertain times - hit a more than six-year high of $1,557 in September and with gains of about 17% so far is set for its biggest yearly gain since 2010.\n\n\u201cRate cuts by major central banks, a deteriorating global economic outlook and elevated geopolitical tensions are the key tailwinds for gold prices,\u201d ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said.\n\nA U.S.-China trade war has sent a shiver through the global economy.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has meanwhile cut interest rates twice this year to stimulate growth, and other major central banks have followed suit.\n\nLower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, making it more attractive to investors.\n\nCentral banks have also steadily increased their gold reserves and private cash has flooded into gold-backed exchange traded funds (ETFs), boosting physical demand.\n\n\u201cIf central banks and exchange-traded funds keep on buying and the Fed continues with lowering interest rates, we will talk about prices of $1,600 in the near future,\u201d said LBBW analyst Frank Schallenberger.\n\nFor silver, poll respondents forecast average prices of $16.24 an ounce this year and $18.13 in 2020, up from predictions of $15.50 and $16.85 three months ago. In the year to date it has averaged $15.97 an ounce.\n\nSilver will remain cheap relative to gold, with the gold/silver ratio averaging 86 in 2019 and 85 in 2020, not far from a more than two-decade high just above 93 reached in July.\n\nGraphic: Gold and silver prices here\n\nGraphic: Gold-silver ratio here\n\nSilver in September breached the $19 mark for the first time since 2016. It tends to move with gold, but around half of consumption comes from industry, and weaker economic growth would drag on demand and, potentially, prices.\n\nGold and silver prices have dipped in recent weeks as signs of progress in trade talks revived appetite for riskier assets. If reached, a trade deal could boost economic growth and hurt gold and silver, said ETF Securities analyst Nitesh Shah.\n\nSpeculative bets on price rises for gold on the COMEX exchange have eased slightly from record highs in September, while those for silver have also dipped from a near two-year peak in July.\n\nGraphic: Managed net longs in gold and silver here\n\nHigh prices have also dampened demand in Asia, the biggest gold-consuming region.\n\n\u201cThe main negative factors (for gold) are the speculative overhang in the futures market and the lacklustre demand from physical buyers in India, to some extent in China and amongst Western coin and bar purchasers,\u201d said Ross Norman, an independent analyst.\n\n\u201cGold is due a period of consolidation and perhaps even a temporary correction,\u201d he said.", "description": "Fragile global growth and the prospect of interest rates staying lower for longer, boosting gold's appeal for nervous investors, are behind upward revisions to price forecasts for the yellow metal, a Reuters survey showed.", "authors": ["Brijesh Patel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
