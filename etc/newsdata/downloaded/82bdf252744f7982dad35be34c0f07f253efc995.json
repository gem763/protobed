She had borrowed $23,000 while in school and took an administrative job at an arts nonprofit soon after.\n\n\u201cI was making the minimum payment on my debt each month, and I felt good,\u201d Lockert said.\n\nThree years after starting her job at the nonprofit, Lockert decided she wanted to go back to school and pursue further education in theatre. Soon enough, she was accepted into a one-year intensive performance studies program at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of Arts.\n\n\u201cIt was my dream school,\u201d Lockert said.\n\nShe was offered over $80,000 in loans to cover tuition and rent, but she chose to only take on $58,000 for tuition. \u201cThe higher number scared me. I had savings and worked multiple jobs on the side in order to pay rent,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile at NYU, she continued to make payments on her undergraduate loans but graduated in 2011 with $68,000 of debt and no job on the other side.\n\n\u201cI was panicking,\u201d Lockert said. \u201cI had done everything millennials were told to do. I had gotten a master\u2019s degree and gone to a prestigious school.\u201d\n\nThe psychological effect of debt\n\nThe debt soon began to weigh on her mental health. \u201cI\u2019ve had mental-health issues in the past, but this made me feel so low and guilty. I was depressed and cried every single day,\u201d she said.\n\nRealizing she couldn\u2019t pay rent in New York without a stable job, she moved to Portland, Ore. where her partner at the time lived. In Portland, she worked temporary jobs for $10 to $12 an hour and ended up on food stamps.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make a bad decision per se. I went to a good school. But at that point, I felt so aimless,\u201d she said.\n\nThe financial burden of student debt is discussed often. Graduates who do take out loans leave school today with approximately $30,000 of debt. And multiple 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have made canceling this debt a central component of their campaigns.\n\nIndividuals who experience financial challenges in college are more likely to show signs of depression later on in life.\n\nBut student debt\u2019s effect on mental health is often left out of the conversation. And this effect is very real, research suggests. Individuals who experience financial challenges in college are more likely to show signs of depression later on in life, according to a recently released study from the University of Arizona. The study researchers polled 208 University of Arizona students three times, once in 2010 during their fourth year of college, once in 2016 five years after college graduation, and once in between those years. The median age of the participants five years after leaving college was 27.\n\nIndividuals in the study who reported what the researchers defined as \u201cgood financial behaviors,\u201d including \u201ctracking monthly expenses, spending within a budget, responsible borrowing, saving, and investing,\u201d were less likely to experience depression after college.\n\nTo assess depressive symptoms, researchers asked participants to rate how often they felt \u201cunhappy, sad, or depressed,\u201d how often they felt tired, and whether they lost appetite or overate when they felt upset.\n\n\u201cManaging your money well in your fourth year of college leads to lower symptoms of depression later on,\u201d Xiaomin Li of Beijing Normal University, the lead researcher on the study, said.\n\nBut those who \u201cmanage their money well\u201d can often do so because they have less debt, Katherine Keyes, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cFinancial instability is a strong predictor of mental-health problems,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cThese students who are managing their money well in their final year of college and go on to have fewer depressive symptoms may also be students who have less debt or students for whom managing that debt is less of a burden.\u201d\n\nOther studies, including one from the University of South Carolina in 2015, have also found that high levels of student debt or financial instability can take a toll on mental health. And approximately a quarter of millennials say their student loans keep them up at night, according to a Charles Schwab SCHW, +1.96% survey.\n\nMental-health troubles can make life more expensive\n\nTo manage the depression and anxiety surrounding her student debt, Lockert began going to therapy in Portland.\n\n\u201cIt helped, but it didn\u2019t make my problems go away,\u201d she said. Since she lived in Portland, she could see counseling students at Portland State University to save money. \u201cThey weren\u2019t licensed, but they were one semester away from being licensed.\u201d\n\nLockert spent about $5 per session, but that\u2019s not the reality for most people. Therapy sessions generally can cost anywhere from $65 to $250, or more. For those with insurance, part of the cost will be typically be covered \u2014 but rarely all of it. \u201cThe effect can be compounding for those who already have a lot of debt to pay off,\u201d Lockert said.\n\n\u2018I made my last payment in December 2015\u2019\n\nWhile struggling to pay off her debt and working temp jobs seven days a week, Lockert started a blog titled Dear Debt in 2013 to document her journey. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anyone talking about mental health or emotions related to debt, and I felt alone,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same time she started the blog, Lockert was offered a job at a non-profit with $30,000 annual salary. She took the job, but quit one year later.\n\n\u201cI started freelance writing full-time,\u201d she said. \u201cI had been looking for a stable job for so long, so to quit right after I finally got one seemed crazy. But I wanted to focus on writing and the blog.\u201d\n\nHer first year freelancing full-time, she brought in $60,000 and was beginning to pay off her debt.\n\n\u201cI made my last payment in December 2015 and was crying tears of joy,\u201d Lockert said. \u201cA lot of people tell me that paying off their debt was anticlimactic, but I was celebrating.\u201d\n\nLife changing\n\n\u201cI finally had time to see friends again. I wasn\u2019t working seven days a week anymore. I went to Italy with my mom, and I moved to LA,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so exciting.\u201d\n\nNot all of Lockert\u2019s mental-health struggles went away once she had paid off her debt. \u201cI had struggled with anxiety and depression before I had the debt,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my life was so different, and it was significantly improved \u2014 paying the debt was a complete relief.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been six years since she started her blog, and Lockert still doesn\u2019t believe the link between debt and mental health is discussed enough.\n\n\u201cThough mental health itself is getting more attention, the intersection of debt and mental health is still not discussed widely,\u201d she said. \u201cI get many people Googling GOOGL, +1.04% GOOG, +0.97% \u2018I want to kill myself because of debt\u2019 and finding my blog.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a problem the personal-finance community cannot ignore,\u201d Lockert says.", "description": "World Mental Health Day: \u2018We need to make sure college students have access to financial education.\u2019", "authors": ["James Wellemeyer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP659_Melani_MG_20190818180224.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
