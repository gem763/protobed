(The EU has actually provided more than $16.5 billion to Ukraine since 2014.) By saying the U.S. has been \u201cvery, very good\u201d to Ukraine, Trump seems to be setting up a power dynamic and establishing leverage that he uses later in the call to ask Zelensky for a \u201cfavor.\u201d\n\nTanks and Thanks\n\nANALYSIS\n\nZelensky here references the U.S.\u2019 provision of American-made anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine last year. Ukraine had lobbied hard to Western officials for more weapons and non-lethal aid to combat Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine and the weapons were finally delivered in April 2018. Zelensky says Ukraine is ready to buy more Javelins, and was not aware at this point that Trump had ordered $250 million worth of military assistance aid to be withheld from Ukraine just days before this call.\n\nThe Big Ask\n\nANALYSIS\n\nImmediately after Zelensky mentions U.S. defense aid, Trump directly asks Zelensky for a \"favor,\" indicating such aid may be dependent upon Zelensky\u2019s compliance. He launches into a request that Ukraine investigate the cybersecurity firm\u2014CrowdStrike\u2014that determined the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by Russia. This is a recurring obsession for Trump\u2014the fact that the DNC did not provide its server to the FBI to examine independently. Trump told the Associated Press in 2017 that he thought CrowdStrike was \u201cUkraine-based\u201d and \u201cowned by a very rich Ukrainian.\u201d The firm was actually founded by a Russian-American, Dmitri Alperovitch, and is based in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nBringing in Barr\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThis is a new revelation\u2014it hadn\u2019t been previously reported that Trump tried to get Attorney General William Barr involved, which would indicate that the president tried to put the weight of the Justice Department behind an investigation of his biggest political rival. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time\u2014Trump has mused openly about getting the Justice Department to investigate Hillary Clinton, Jim Comey, and various other foes. But it raises more questions about why the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence to withhold from Congress a whistleblower complaint that reportedly centers around a call in which Barr is explicitly named.\n\nIntroducing Rudy\n\nANALYSIS\n\nZelensky acknowledges what has been previously reported\u2014that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani met with a Zelensky aide recently. Giuliani has said the State Department was involved in setting up that backchannel. Zelensky stops short of promising a Biden investigation, but clearly wants to stay on Trump\u2019s good side because the U.S. is one of its most important allies in the fight against Russian aggression, so he does not brush it off altogether.\n\n'Some Very Bad People'\n\nANALYSIS\n\nTrump here is referring to Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was not considered \u201ca very good prosecutor\u201d by Ukraine\u2019s own parliament, which voted to remove him. Indeed, Shokin was widely condemned as soft on corruption and fired in 2016 amid international pressure to remove him. Trump and Giuliani, however, have claimed that Biden alone urged Ukraine to fire Shokin because he was investigating the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, whose board members included Biden\u2019s son Hunter. According to documents obtained by Bloomberg earlier this year, there was no active investigation of Burisma when Shokin was fired\u2014it had been dormant for more than a year by that point. Subsequent prosecutor generals have insisted they\u2019ve found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden or his son.\n\nHere Come the Bidens\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThis appears to be the first indication we\u2019ve gotten that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was in Trump\u2019s crosshairs. Yovanovich, who was appointed by President Obama, was suddenly recalled from her post earlier this year\u2014two months earlier than planned\u2014with no explanation. She is a career diplomat who has been at the forefront of Ukraine\u2019s war on corruption and fight against Russian aggression. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York contended in a letter at the time that her removal stemmed from her anti-corruption work.\n\nThis is also the first instance in the memo where Trump refers to the Bidens by name, and again repeats the false claim that \u201cBiden stopped the prosecution\u201d of his son Hunter. He repeats his request that Zelensky work with Attorney General Barr.\n\nZelensky Responds\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Zelensky seems to dislike Yovanovich, but it could have to do with her falling out earlier this year with Ukraine\u2019s special anti-corruption prosecutor at the time. She called for him to be fired weeks before Ukraine\u2019s March 31 presidential election, fueling accusations that she had inserted herself into Ukraine\u2019s political process. Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko\u2014a Giuliani associate whose dismissal was requested by Zelensky as one of his first acts after being sworn in\u2014claimed that Yovanovich had given him a list of people \u201cnot to prosecute.\u201d That claim prompted a rebuke from the State Department. \u201cThe allegations by the Ukrainian prosecutor-general are not true and are intended to tarnish the reputation of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\" it said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe Flattering Signoff\n\nANALYSIS\n\nTrump reassures Zelensky that Ukraine\u2019s economy \u201cis going to get better and better,\u201d just after urging him to investigate Biden and the Democrats with the help of the Justice Department. While Trump did not directly reference aid during the call\u2014which he ordered to be withheld just days before the conversation\u2014he again mentions money within the context of his asking Zelensky for a \u201cfavor.\u201d Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen testified earlier this year that making direct requests is not Trump\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give you questions, he doesn\u2019t give you orders, he speaks in a code,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd I understand the code, because I\u2019ve been around him for a decade.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/72/85/c1836f004a2c85d64a4e3a9ee987/ukraine-memo-illo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
