Photo: James Gallagher\n\nThis week, a woman having an affair at work to try to heal her marriage: 36, married, straight, Brooklyn.\n\nDAY ONE\n\n7:10 a.m. Our 3-year-old comes into our room and gets into bed with me and my husband. I almost always get up with him and let my husband sleep. We have breakfast and watch a kid show.\n\n9:00 a.m. I drop off our little guy at preschool. I put my earphones on to listen to my favorite podcast \u2014 Where Shall We Begin with Esther Perel \u2014 and get on the train.\n\n12:00 p.m. I\u2019m an administrator at a university. Sometimes it\u2019s very busy and sometimes it\u2019s very slow. When it\u2019s slow, I\u2019m always tempted to email a professor who works here too. He and I have had an on-and-off affair for over a year. I justify it because my husband had an affair when I was pregnant and when we had a newborn, but I still feel kind of weird about it. I email the professor just for the rush and to keep my day interesting.\n\n4:00 p.m. No word back from prof. Typical!\n\n5:30 p.m. I meet my husband and son at home. We play a board game and make dinner. My husband is still extremely hot to me; he\u2019s getting better looking as he gets older. We have a nice night together.\n\n9:30 p.m. I go to bed very early because I need an insane amount of sleep. I read some Sally Rooney and drift off.\n\nDAY TWO\n\n7:00 a.m. Still half-asleep, I check my email and see the professor has written back. Making plans is always hard with him. He\u2019s in a sexless marriage and his wife strikes me as a lesbian. He\u2019s very hard to read but we have a certain closeness, even if the sex isn\u2019t the best. I hope we can hang out soon.\n\n11:00 a.m. Plans with professor are moving forward. Seems like we will meet Thursday for drinks after work. We both know what this means, even though we would never say it out loud.\n\n2:00 p.m. Texting pick-up and dinner logistics with my husband. We are a well-oiled machine and very good at making our lives run smoothly. It makes me feel guilty I\u2019m meeting another guy, but I justify it with \u201che did it first.\u201d\n\nI suspected my husband was cheating for a long time. She was over at our house (and would hold our baby!). They hung out a lot; she was a very sexual person and they seemed to be in constant contact. I\u2019m not a snooper but I finally saw a suspicious text. After I looked at a few, it was clear. I confronted him and he admitted it immediately. He had been dying to end it and I think he was ultimately relieved I found out. It was making him anxious and crazy and she was very high-maintenance and manipulative and was always starting fights. She was also married and we went to their wedding (her third marriage by 30) together during the affair! The whole thing was insane.\n\nIt\u2019s not even the fact that he had an affair that I have an issue with, it\u2019s that he did it when I was vulnerable and needed him most \u2014 through pregnancy and having a baby. I felt so alone and didn\u2019t realize what was going on until I finally saw the texts. They worked together and she made both our lives hell for a couple years after that. I think he broke her heart, honestly. It truly devastated me and changed me as a person, and it\u2019s still a sore subject. I guess I feel like it gives me a free pass to do whatever I want for now.\n\n7:00 p.m. Dinner at home. We make a tofu stir-fry and hear about our son\u2019s day. He makes us laugh a lot.\n\nDAY THREE\n\n11:00 a.m. I have drinks with the professor tomorrow and I\u2019m thinking about my outfit. I want to look casual but sexy. My husband definitely has no idea about any of this. He really trusts me and I\u2019m very good at hiding it. I think he would actually be fine with it because he still feels so badly about what he did, which was undeniably worse. I plan to tell him once it\u2019s officially over with the professor.\n\n3:00 p.m. Work is slow again so I stalk my husband\u2019s old mistress online. She is gross and I hate her still. We blocked each other so I have to use Safari to see her pics. Work being slow is truly dangerous for me!\n\n5:30 p.m. My husband picked up my son so I\u2019m home alone. I\u2019m all riled up about my date tomorrow and use the vibrator my husband got me to make myself come. This was the best gift ever. It takes about 45 seconds.\n\n8:00 p.m. After bedtime, my husband heads out for a night with his friends. We give each other a lot of freedom, but sometimes I think that\u2019s what gets us in trouble. We barely ask about each other\u2019s night except to say if it was fun or not, and maybe mention what we ate. We are almost too similar.\n\n2:15 a.m. My husband comes home quite drunk and falls asleep quickly next to me. Part of me wonders if he was really with \u201cfriends\u201d but also, does it matter? I snuggle up against him and fall back asleep. I love this guy, I can\u2019t help it.\n\nDAY FOUR\n\n7:15 a.m. It\u2019s professor day! Makes me feel young again. I go with tight jeans and an Everlane top. Casual, but hopefully a little hot.\n\n8:15 a.m. My husband stumbles out of bed. He said he had fun last night and then tells me about his friend\u2019s dating drama so I guess he was with the guys? Whatever.\n\n5:30 p.m. We meet in a neighborhood far away from work, where we won\u2019t run into anyone. We go to a gross dark dive bar, as always. I get there first. When he gets there he puts down his credit card and keeps it open.\n\n7:00 p.m. We are getting drunk, talking about our lives, and it\u2019s so much fun. We decide to move to another bar.\n\n7:30 p.m. He puts his hand on my leg mid-drink. This is what I live for: The moment when you realize someone wants you too and that person isn\u2019t your husband \u2014 it\u2019s my drug of choice. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to not want this on some level.\n\n8:30 p.m. We are fully drunk and making out in a booth at the bar. Even though this guy isn\u2019t super cool or even hot, there is something about him that I like. Part of it is that no one would ever think this was going on between us. We\u2019re very different. He\u2019s a very by-the-book guy, child-free, successful, older, kind of boring. I\u2019m younger and a free spirit, a hip Brooklyn mom to a T. But there\u2019s just something between us.\n\n9:30 p.m. I go to the bar bathroom and he follows me in a few minutes later. This is our signature move. We\u2019ve never hooked up in a house, except once when my husband was away. We go kind of wild in the bathroom. If I really think about it, he doesn\u2019t turn me on. I\u2019ve never come with the professor. For me, this is about excitement, control, and empowerment after being cheated on at my lowest point. To anyone who has been hurt badly by a long-term cheating situation, I would recommend \u2014 cheat too! It really makes you feel better and it evens the field.\n\n10:15 p.m. He comes and we go to Vaselka.\n\n11:00 p.m. Professor gets me a Lyft and says to email him when I get home. We deleted each other\u2019s numbers so we can\u2019t text \u2014 too dangerous and intimate for us.\n\n11:45 p.m. At home, I look in the mirror while I\u2019m brushing my teeth and I\u2019m like, WTF am I doing. I get into bed with my husband, who is asleep, but I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m really confused sometimes how this ended up being my life. Ultimately, it would not have been my first choice.\n\nDAY FIVE\n\n6:15 a.m. I\u2019m up first, having barely slept. I snuggle up to my husband until he is half-awake and then I initiate sex. I can\u2019t explain how much he still turns me on, and within minutes, I come. The professor could learn a thing or two from this guy.\n\n7:00 a.m. My husband asks how my night was. I say it was good, just a happy hour with work people (sort of true?). I feel guilty, but ultimately my husband has my heart and this is just temporary and part of our recovery, even if he\u2019s not aware of it.\n\n8:00 a.m. I get an email back from the professor that is like two words (\u201cFun times\u201d). It\u2019s cold and makes me feel bad. Maybe this guy just sucks?\n\n9:00 a.m. I work from home on Fridays so I drop off my little guy and go to the gym. I\u2019m tired and hungover but feel like I need to do something \u201cgood.\u201d\n\n6:00 p.m We go out for an early burger dinner with our friends. I think about how much even our best friends don\u2019t know about us. They would be shocked if they knew what I did last night. Having the secret is fun for me but also stressful.\n\n8:00 p.m. Husband goes out after bedtime again. I can\u2019t remember where he said he was going, I think some art show or something. I\u2019m happy to be alone with my thoughts. I\u2019m so tired and I fall asleep insanely early.\n\nDAY SIX\n\n7:10 a.m. It\u2019s the weekend. I let my son watch a whole movie while I go back to bed.\n\n4:00 p.m. We go to one of our favorite friends\u2019 house in Bed Stuy for a playdate, drinks, weed pen, and dinner. Everyone has fun, we all get along great and laugh a lot. I love this town!\n\n8:00 p.m. Go home. Do bedtime and watch the Aziz Ansari comedy special with my husband. We go to sleep early and I get this rush of feeling lucky.\n\nDAY SEVEN\n\n10:00 a.m. We make breakfast and clean the house. Take turns parenting because neither of us are really in the mood.\n\n4:00 p.m. We go to an early dinner at my husband\u2019s parents\u2019 house with his brother and their kids. I always get nervous going over for dinner because they live near the professor, but it\u2019s never been a problem.\n\n7:15 p.m. We still haven\u2019t even started dinner. The adults are fully drunk, the kids are being wild and running around.\n\n8:00 p.m. We eat and my son starts to lose it because he\u2019s exhausted. We give him ice cream to hold him over while we say our goodbyes and try to leave ASAP before he has a full tantrum.\n\n8:20 p.m. The train is taking forever, and our son is fully and loudly crying on the platform as everyone stares at us in horror. Oh, Lord.\n\n9:15 p.m. Finally home. So tired. Do bedtime and then go to bed. I kiss my husband and tell him I had a great weekend.\n\nGet Sex Diaries delivered every week.
