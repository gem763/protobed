One \"Space Command\" already exists. The Air Force Space Command reports to STRATCOM, which reports to the Pentagon, just as the Pacific Command and the European Command do.\n\nMr. Trump is visibly fascinated by furthering the United States' role in space, emphasizing that doing so is key for national security. This move is an acknowledgment of the importance of space in military operations but is in essence a kind of rewiring of existing command arrangements.\n\nThe U.S. Space Command will be headed by Gen. John Raymond. The Trump administration submitted a proposal for the Space Force to Congress earlier this year.\n\nPresident Trump watches with Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary Mark Esper as the flag for U.S. Space Command is unfurled in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, on Thu., Aug. 29, 2019.
