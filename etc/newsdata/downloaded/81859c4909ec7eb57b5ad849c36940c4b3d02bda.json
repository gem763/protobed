They began preparing adoption papers.\n\nHowever, Indian police claim Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada - who had no children of their own - had other plans.\n\nAuthorities in India say Ms Dhir took out an insurance policy in Gopal's name. The policy was worth approximately \u00a3150,000 and would pay out after 10 years, or in the event of his death.\n\nAccording to the documents, she made two premium payments, each of \u00a315,000.\n\n\"After a few days she took out an insurance policy in his name,\" Superintendent Saurab Singh of Junagadh Police, in Gujarat, told the BBC.\n\n\"It was a huge amount and she paid two premiums, knowing very well that in the event of Gopal's death, she would be paid 10 times the insured amount.\"\n\nImage copyright Hanif Khokhar/BBC Image caption Gopal Sejani was murdered by a gang on motorbikes\n\nThe couple returned home to London but Gopal never made it to the UK. He remained in Gujarat while visa papers were arranged for him.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, he was abducted by two men on motorbikes, stabbed and left by a road in Gujarat.\n\nHis brother-in-law, Mr Kardani, was also attacked as he tried to defend the boy. Both died of their injuries in hospital later that month.\n\nIndian authorities say two previous attempts had been made against the boy's life, but both failed. The insurance policy never paid out.\n\nCourt hearing\n\nOfficers in India arrested a suspect who they said was a friend of the couple and had spent time with them as a student in London.\n\nHe is one of four men who have been arrested in India for alleged involvement in the crime. The investigations are ongoing.\n\nMs Dhir and Mr Raijada, who face six charges in India, including conspiracy to murder and kidnapping, were arrested in the UK in June 2017 after a request from the Indian government.\n\nHowever, on 2 July this year, a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court refused their extradition on human rights grounds.\n\nImage copyright Hanif Khokhar/BBC Image caption Harsukh Kardani was also killed in the attack\n\nIn her judgment, Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot, found there was sufficient evidence to justify their extradition as there was a \"circumstantial prima facie case that Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada acting together and with others committed the offences\".\n\nBut because the penalty for double murder in Gujarat is life in prison without parole, she ruled extradition would have been contrary to the couple's human rights.\n\nShe said if extradited, the pair could be given \"an irreducible sentence\" and a lack of a review would be \"inhuman and degrading\".\n\nThe Indian authorities have been granted an appeal, which is expected to be heard in the new year.\n\nCommenting on the case, Nick Vamos, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service's extradition team, said the decision had been made because there was no prospect of release, even in exceptional compassionate circumstances.\n\nImage copyright Hanif Khokhar/BBC Image caption Superintendent Saurab Singh wants the couple to be extradited to India\n\nOutside the couple's west London home, the BBC tried to question Ms Dhir about the case and why she was refusing to travel to India to stand trial. She refused to respond.\n\nBoth Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada deny the allegations. According to the court papers, they say there is \"no prima facie case against them\".\n\nThe couple remain on bail pending an appeal.\n\nSuperintendent Singh added: \"We are trying our best. This is a very serious offence that has taken place in India.\n\n\"We want the two accused to be brought here to face trial in an Indian court as per the Indian laws, and for this we are trying our best to assist the UK court.\"\n\nIf the appeal fails, the chief magistrate said it was possible the couple could be prosecuted in the UK, if there was evidence that an agreement to murder was made in this country.", "description": "Arti Dhir and Kaval Raijada are fighting extradition over the murder of their adopted son, aged 11.", "authors": ["Poonam Taneja", "Bbc Asian Network"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5A0C/production/_108625032_p07mk1dh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
