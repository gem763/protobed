Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, gave a master class on Saturday in what real leadership looks like. It was a refreshing contrast to what we have seen from President Donald Trump, who thus far has refused to take responsibility for his mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, Harris was campaigning in Londonderry, New Hampshire, when a person in the audience, who identified as being from India, remarked, \"Somehow a racist bigot gets into the White House and then he says if you're not my color you need to go back to your own country.\" He added, \"So I am scared for this country.

At this point, Harris could have responded that she's not responsible for the words of people who ask her questions, or she could have deflected, arguing what Trump has said is far worse.\n\nInstead, when Harris was first asked by the media about the remark, she stated , \"I would never condone anyone using that word in any way, shape or form, even including the guy -- against the guy I'm running against.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Dean Obeidallah writes California Sen.
