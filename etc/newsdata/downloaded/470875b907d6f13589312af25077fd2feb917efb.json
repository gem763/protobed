This year, Russia tried to justify the existence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact by claiming European countries didn't sufficiently stand up to Hitler or offer Germany more favourable alternatives, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRussia's response to the Poland tweet takes on more significance in light of its annexation of Crimea in 2014, a move reminiscent of its invasion of Poland in 1939 - in both cases, Moscow denied or obfuscated the invasion but claimed the lands being invading belonged to it anyway.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was not invited to a commemoration of the invasion of Poland this year because of the annexation of Crimea and his increasingly authoritarian rule.", "description": "Sure, the invasion of Poland happened 80 years ago, but that doesn't mean Russia and Poland can't still fight about it on Twitter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9371/927bae9dfa094d15bb71ee10a472f066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
