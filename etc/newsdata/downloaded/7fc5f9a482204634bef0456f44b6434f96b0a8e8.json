Tesla says charge up, quick.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cA utility company in your area announced they may turn off power in some areas of Northern California beginning October 9 as part of public safety power shut-offs, which may affect power to charging options,\u201d the message read, according to social media posts. \u201cWe recommend charging your Tesla to 100% today to ensure your drive remains uninterrupted.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTesla went on to advise that the on- or offline status of its \u201cSupercharger\u201d stations, where owners can secure a faster battery refill, would be displayed on in-car maps.\n\nZlatko Unger of Redwood City, Calif., said he received the alert on his Tesla Model 3 as he climbed in his car to grab lunch for his family Wednesday. The 35-year-old tech worker immediately looked up the availability of chargers nearby, noticing the one he frequented appeared \u201ca little busier than usual.\u201d Unger, who still had power Wednesday, said he would plan to arrive early and charge up to early Thursday.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request seeking additional information on how many customers received the warnings, how its Supercharging network was expected to be affected, and whether the company is advising customers not to charge once the outages are in effect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe advisory is significant for customers in the Bay Area, where Tesla\u2019s premium electric luxury cars are a common sight. California is the country\u2019s largest electric vehicle market, according to EVAdoption.com, which tracks the figures on electric market share, and the sales are largely driven by Tesla, which made up more than half of the country\u2019s overall EV sales. The International Council on Clean Transportation reported this year that the San Jose area \u2014 in the heart of Silicon Valley \u2014 had the country\u2019s highest share of electric vehicles by population, followed by San Francisco, along with San Diego and Los Angeles.\n\nPG&E said the outages would affect nearly 1 million customers in California across more than half of the state\u2019s 58 counties, the most extensive planned blackout ever for the state.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all rosy for traditional internal combustion vehicles either, however. Gas pumps could also be affected, both by a rush to secure fuel amid the outages and the fact that many gas stations rely on electricity to power their pumps.\n\nFor Unger, the alert was helpful in more than one way. It reminded him what his family would do in a catastrophe: use his Kia Niro plug-in hybrid, which can turn to gasoline once the battery depletes.\n\n\u201cIf everything went haywire, we would opt to use the hybrid instead \u2014 just because of the practicality,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "A San Francisco Bay Area power utility shut off power to more than half a million customers amid a wildfire threat, and Tesla vehicles flashed a warning to charge up beforehand.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eNbdaKJM1kwyAF1Xj1svUPULlRo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q2FNAGHFDQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
