Amazon's review team has in some cases assessed up to 150 video clips per day that are usually 20 to 30 seconds long, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAmazon only reviews clips that are submitted by Cloud Cam owners for troubleshooting purposes, as well as those from employee testers, according to Bloomberg. However, two of the people Bloomberg spoke with said that footage submitted for review in rare cases included private interactions, such as recordings of sexual activity.\n\nSuch clips are flagged and discarded, and Amazon implements tight security protocols for workers that are tasked with reviewing Cloud Cam clips, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"We take privacy seriously and put Cloud Cam customers in control of their video clips,\" Amazon said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Only customers can view their clips, and they can delete them at any time by visiting the Manage My Content and Devices page.\"\n\nRead more: Amazon doesn't see Apple's AirPods as a threat to its new Echo Buds, says company executive\n\nCustomers can share a specific clip with Amazon to improve the device's performance through the Cloud Cam's feedback option, the company says. When a clip is shared, Amazon says it \"may get annotated and used for supervised learning to improve the accuracy of Cloud Cam's computer vision systems.\"\n\nAmazon's terms of service agreement for the Cloud Cam doesn't explicitly say that the company's workers may view footage recorded by the camera. It does, however, say that the customer grants Amazon permission to \"review your Cloud Cam recordings to provide technical support.\"\n\nThe report sheds further light on the role that human reviewers play when it comes to assessing the performance of internet-connected smart home products and AI assistants amid growing privacy concerns. Apple issued a rare apology in August over its methods for improving the performance of its Siri virtual assistant after a report from The Guardian revealed that company contractors overhear private conversations. Following the report, the company suspended the process and said it will make changes to how it reviews Siri's performance.\n\nAmazon has introduced new privacy features following the initial report from Bloomberg revealing that its contractors listen to Alexa interactions. The company has, for example, launched a new voice command that makes it possible for users to erase recordings from their Echo by saying \"Alexa, delete everything I said today.\"\n\nPrivacy was also a key theme at the company's big fall event on September 25. \"Privacy is foundational to everything we do,\" Amazon's Dave Limp said on stage before unveiling a slew of new Alexa-enabled devices, like earbuds and smart glasses.", "description": "Amazon has dozens of people reviewing footage recorded by its Cloud Cam, according to a new report, possibly further fueling privacy concerns.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f39d2122bd50e7a2da476?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
