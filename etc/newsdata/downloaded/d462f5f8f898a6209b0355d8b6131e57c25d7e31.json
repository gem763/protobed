Week 7 offers up juicy matchups and we are here to help you make money off of them. USA TODAY\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes can breathe a sigh of relief \u2014 sort of.\n\nMahomes nearly had to be carted off during Thursday night's game against the Denver Broncos with a right knee injury. He suffered a kneecap dislocation, an MRI confirmed Friday, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe timetable for Mahomes' return, per the reports, indicated he should miss only a few weeks and that surgery may not be necessary. However, additional medical opinions are being sought, the NFL Network said. The expectation is that he will return at some point this season. ESPN reported that the team received \"best-case scenario\" results.\n\nOn a fourth and 1 deep in Broncos territory, Mahomes injured his knee following a quarterback sneak in the second quarter of the Chiefs' eventual 30-6 victory. He waved away the cart that arrived to carry him off the field and instead walked to the locker room with the help of trainers.\n\nAn ankle injury has hobbled Mahomes since Week 1 at Jacksonville.", "description": "According to multiple reports, an MRI has confirmed that Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes suffered a dislocated right kneecap against Broncos.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
