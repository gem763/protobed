I know everyone in our room believes we will, and we\u2019ll have a lot of battle scars when we do finally get to the top of that mountain.\u201d\n\nBoone memorably called his team Savages in the Box during a midsummer tirade at an umpire. While that may be true, he lacked Marauders on the Mound.\n\nSpecifically in his rotation.\n\nNew York starters had a 4.51 ERA, 15th in the major leagues, well behind the elite staffs of Los Angeles Dodgers (3.11) and pennant-winning Washington (3.53) and Houston (3.61). Yankees starters were just 26th among the 30 teams in innings, more than 160 fewer than the Nationals and nearly 130 less than the Astros.\n\nCole will be the top available starter on the free-agent market, and the 29-year-old right-hander is likely to top the record contract for a pitcher, David Price\u2019s $217 million, seven-year deal with Boston signed ahead of the 2016 season.\n\nLower-priced options include Zack Wheeler and Rick Porcello. Washington\u2019s Stephen Strasburg could become available if he opts out of the remaining four seasons and $100 million left in his $175 million, seven-year deal.\n\nSpending on starting pitching has repercussions on all other decisions for a team that went back above the luxury tax threshold this year after dropping below for the first time in 2018. Shortstop Didi Gregorius, outfielder Brett Gardner and injured reliever Dellin Betances are eligible for free agency, and closer Aroldis Chapman can opt of the final two seasons and $30 million of his contract and go free.\n\nWinning their first AL East title since 2012 and finishing the regular season with 103 wins despite 30 players going on the injured list left little satisfaction to a team that finished a full calendar decade without a World Series appearance for the first time since the 1910s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a successful season because we\u2019re not just playing to get 103 wins and then just sleep,\u201d Gregorius said. \u201cWe want to play to get to the World Series and win it, and that\u2019s what we played the whole year for.\u201d\n\nGregorius said his preference is to remain in the Bronx, but the Yankees might not be able to afford him. Their payroll was baseball\u2019s second-highest this year behind Boston, and New York might prefer to reallocate Gregorius\u2019 salary for pitching rather than make a long-term commitment to a shortstop who turns 30 in February. Gleyber Torres could be shifted to shortstop and DJ LeMahieu, New York\u2019s best all-around player in his first season with the Yankees, could take over at second, where he won three Gold Gloves with Colorado.\n\nNew York navigated through this year despite losing ace Luis Severino to a spring training lat muscle injury that sidelined him until September,\n\nDomingo Germ\u00e1n emerged to go 18-4 until a late-season domestic violence incident led Major League Baseball to put him on administrative leave. James Paxton struggled in the first half, rediscovered his breaking ball in the second half and went 15-6, and Masahiro Tanaka (11-9) had a puzzling loss of effectiveness with his splitter.\n\nJ.A. Happ (12-8) was mostly disappointing and CC Sabathia (5-8) spent four stints on the injured list in his final season. With no other good options, the Yankees used Chad Green as an opener 15 times.\n\nMuch like Sabathia and A.J. Burnett were added to Andy Pettitte and Joba Chamberlain in 2009, the Yankees could use a front-end injection to lessen the load of a bullpen that despite rest in September tired against the Astros. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Green and Chapman all faltered just enough that New York could not overcome an offense outscored 22-21 over the six games.\n\nWhile the Yankees led the major leagues with 943 runs during the regular season, were second in homers with 306 and topped batting with runners in scoring position at .294, they were .171 (6 for 35) RISP against the Astros, stranded 42 runners, scored 15 of their runs on homers and struck out 64 times.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a better team this year than we were last year,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll work very hard in the winter in every phase, from the front office and the decisions we make with what players we bring in, what players we lose.\u201d\n\nGiancarlo Stanton was limited to 18 games in the season and five in the playoffs by enough orthopedic injuries to fill a few screens of WebMD. Aaron Judge strained an oblique that sidelined him for two months, then needed two more months to regain his stroke.\n\nAaron Hicks played in just 59 games during the season due to a spring training back injury and an August elbow injury before making a surprise return against the Astros. Hicks had thought he was headed to Tommy John surgery.\n\n\u201cRight now it feels all right,\u201d Hicks said Saturday night. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nGardner had his best season at the plate at age 36 and could be brought back for another year as insurance to more injuries in the outfield.\n\nHis wore a shirt under his jersey Saturday that told the story of the Yankees season: \u201cNext man up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what was thrown at us,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWe were able to find a way to push it to side and continue move forward and focus on the task at hand.\u201d\n\nUntil the Astros proved too much and eliminated the Yankees for the third time in five years.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gerrit Cole could be seeing a lot more of the New York Yankees real soon.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_77719_c0-147-3542-2213_s1200x700.jpg?15b717adc5065cc8d31788dbae65bc4ff9ea5f7f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
