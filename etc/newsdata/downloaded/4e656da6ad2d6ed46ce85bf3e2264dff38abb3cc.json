That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook | Oliver Burkeman", "language": "en", "text": "Back in 1964, in his book Games People Play, the psychiatrist Eric Berne described a pattern of conversation he called \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You \u2013 Yes But\u201d, which remains one of the most teeth-grindingly irritating aspects of everyday social life. The person adopting the strategy is usually a chronic complainer. Something is terrible about their relationship, job, extended family or other situation, and they moan about it incessantly, but find some excuse to dismiss any solution that\u2019s proposed. The reason, of course, is that on some level they don\u2019t want a solution; they want to be validated in their position that the world is out to get them. If they can \u201cwin\u201d the game \u2013 dismissing every suggestion until their interlocutor gives up in exasperation \u2013 they get to feel pleasurably righteous in their resentments and excused from any obligation to change. We all know someone like this. To be honest, sometimes I worry I know one so well that I share a toothbrush with him.\n\nPart of the trouble here is what the writer Mark Manson calls the \u201cresponsibility/fault fallacy\u201d. When you\u2019re feeling hard done by \u2013 taken for granted by your partner, say, or obliged to work for a knucklehead boss \u2013 it\u2019s easy to become vehemently attached to the position that it\u2019s not your job to address the matter, and that doing so would be an admission of fault. But there\u2019s a confusion here. To use Manson\u2019s example, if I were to discover a newborn at my front door, it wouldn\u2019t be my fault, but it most certainly would be my responsibility. There would be choices to make, and no possibility of avoiding them, since trying to ignore the matter would be a choice. The point is that what goes for the baby on the doorstep is true in all cases: even if the other person is 100% in the wrong (and even if quitting the job or relationship is your only option), there\u2019s nothing to be gained, long-term, from using this as a justification to evade responsibility.\n\nShould you find yourself on the receiving end of this kind of complaining, there\u2019s an ingenious way to shut it down \u2013 which is to agree with it, fervently. The psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb describes this as \u201cover-validation\u201d. (\u201cYour boss should be fired\u201a it\u2019s terrible that there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do to make things better at work.\u201d) For one thing, you\u2019ll be spared further moaning, since the other person\u2019s motivation was to vindicate her beliefs, and now you\u2019re vindicating them. But for another, as Gottlieb notes, people confronted with over-validation often hear their complaints afresh and start arguing back. The notion that they\u2019re utterly powerless suddenly seems unrealistic \u2013 not to mention rather annoying \u2013 so they\u2019re prompted instead to generate ideas about how they might change things.\n\nDoes overconsumption of bad TV lead to populism? | Oliver Burkeman Read more\n\n\u201cAnd then, sometimes, something magical might happen,\u201d Gottlieb writes. The other person \u201cmight realise she\u2019s not as trapped as you are saying she is, or as she feels.\u201d Which illustrates the irony of the responsibility/fault fallacy: evading responsibility feels comfortable, but turns out to be a prison; whereas assuming responsibility feels unpleasant, but ends up being freeing.\n\nRead this\n\n\n\nPsychiatrist Eric Berne\u2019s book Games People Play was a 60s bestseller, but its analysis of our everyday agendas is as relevant as ever", "description": "Evading liability feels comfortable, but turns out to be a prison, while stepping up feels unpleasant, but ends up being freeing", "authors": ["Oliver Burkeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/474f60e4a2736f01c26bfcd4ece44f92f58379a4/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2ed10afdeaf67b44be8261f855be09f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
