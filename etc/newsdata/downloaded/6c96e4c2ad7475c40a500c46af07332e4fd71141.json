On the rare occasions he has ventured out socially, it has been with welcoming audiences who insist on comity regardless of ideological or political differences.\n\nBut he is also persona non grata in parts of the nation\u2019s capital, where the veneer of politesse was stripped away by the nature of Ford\u2019s allegations, Kavanaugh\u2019s treatment of female senators during the hearings, and the belief that civility \u2014 one of the cardinal virtues of Establishment Washington \u2014 should not be co-opted to excuse intolerable behavior. There are women who refuse to be in the same room as Kavanaugh, much less at the same dinner table.\n\nFord\u2019s world has changed more dramatically: She relocated four times out of fear for her family\u2019s safety and continued to receive death threats. She has not returned to teaching, according to \u201cShe Said\u201d by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, and is still wary of appearing anywhere in public \u2014 much less enjoying a nice dinner out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe discreet discomfort around Kavanaugh is distinct from the treatment of most other justices, who are honored guests regardless of politics. Last week, Sonia Sotomayor threw out the first pitch at a Nationals game. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a movie star, thanks to two glowing films. and received an enthusiastic standing ovation from the audience at Saturday\u2019s National Symphony Orchestra concert. Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito Jr. are VIP guests at Washington\u2019s most prestigious galas. Kavanaugh, on the other hand, is a walking controversy.\n\nAnd the headlines keep coming, nearly all damaging. Senate Democrats have asked the FBI to reopen the Kavanaugh investigation. In the book \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d two New York Times reporters dig further into his alleged inappropriate behavior when he was at Yale. Democratic presidential hopefuls have called for his impeachment \u2014 a legal improbability but potent talking point.\n\nThrough it all, President Trump keeps tweeting: \u201cThe one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecades from now, legal scholars will evaluate Kavanaugh\u2019s career based on his opinions and dissents. But his reputation is being forged now, with every tweet and impassioned defense or indictment, as a main character in #MeToo.\n\n\u201cA justice\u2019s place in history is often shaped by a combination of biography and actual judicial legacy,\u201d said historian Jon Meacham. \u201cAnd because so few justices loom large in the popular memory, biography is especially important. So Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor endure as \u2018firsts,\u2019 and Clarence Thomas and Kavanaugh will likely always be associated with the dramas of their confirmations.\u201d\n\nThere are some justices who do not care what Washington insiders \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter \u2014 think about them. Kavanaugh, a favorite son groomed for greatness and unaccustomed to indignity, cares.\n\nPerspective: Brett Kavanaugh and the terrible, lingering price of his denials\n\nKavanaugh declined to be interviewed for this article, as did many friends and colleagues close to him. They have drawn a velvet curtain around his life, creating safe spaces where he is protected, respected and free to drink a beer without anyone making a federal case out if it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome, however, agreed to speak on condition of anonymity about Kavanaugh and elements of his private life that they\u2019ve witnessed. For the most part, he limits himself to a self-contained world where people are not confrontational or disrespectful, much in the same way that Trump sticks to his rallies, his golf clubs and the Trump International Hotel.\n\nThat bubble begins, of course, at the Supreme Court. The justices have always put a premium on respect and a close working relationship, regardless of the confirmation battles before they arrived or their legal opinions afterward.\n\n\u201cThe nine of us are now a family, and we\u2019re a family with each of us our own burdens and our own obligations to others, but this is our work family, and it\u2019s just as important as our personal family,\u201d Sotomayor told CNN in November. Elena Kagan threw a dinner for Kavanaugh at her home, and Ginsburg praised him as \u201cvery decent, very smart\u201d and praised his decision to hire four female law clerks this year \u2014 the first justice to ever select an all-female team. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who has reportedly taken Kavanaugh under his wing, was spotted with him on July 4 at the private Chevy Chase Club, where they are both members.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike any rookie justice, Kavanaugh has been careful to conform to the norms of the institution: Because he was out of the country when Justice John Paul Stevens died this summer, Kavanaugh sent his wife, Ashley, to represent him at the memorial ceremony \u2014 despite the fact that Stevens, after watching the confirmation hearings, said that Kavanaugh lacked the temperament to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nA small number of visitors have come through Kavanaugh\u2019s chambers: friends, students and legal groups. In February, he hosted a thank-you lunch in the court building for 35 women who defended him during the confirmation fight. On a more personal note, he welcomed players and their parents from the basketball teams he coaches at Blessed Sacrament School: They heard oral arguments, then played a game on the court\u2019s court on the fifth floor.\n\nCoaching, as he emotionally told the Senate last year, is a very big deal to him. \u201cI love coaching more than anything I have ever done in my whole life,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI may never be able to coach again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis fears were unfounded: Kavanaugh served as head coach for his younger daughter\u2019s fifth- and sixth-grade team and as assistant coach for his older daughter\u2019s seventh- and eighth-grade squad, both for the entire season. His newfound fame had refs lining up for selfies while vowing not to give his teams preferential treatment.\n\nKavanaugh, according to someone who spoke on the condition of anonymity, has been moved by the empathetic reception he has received from supporters. Friends have broken into tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying for you\u201d is a frequent refrain.\n\nThe 54-year-old was warmly greeted by fellow alumni at Georgetown Prep\u2019s Stag Night last October and at the homecoming game the following day, where he posed for pictures (but asked people to put down their beers, according to news reports). He received a standing ovation at the conservative Federalist Society\u2019s annual dinner in November, although he did not address the crowd as is customary for a newly appointed justice blessed by the group. (He is scheduled to speak there this year. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society and a leading champion for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, declined to comment for this article.) Kavanaugh was an honored guest at the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick dinner in March and introduced as \u201cthe most famous middle-school basketball coach in America\u201d by billionaire David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. in May.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis only public remarks came in May at a conference in Milwaukee for the judges of the 7th Circuit. With his mentor, retired justice Anthony M. Kennedy, at his side, Kavanaugh said that he believed judges must always be above politics and that he tried to stand in the other person\u2019s shoes when considering a case. \u201cIt\u2019s important for judges not [to] be in a bubble,\u201d he told the audience, according to CNN.\n\nKavanaugh, who loves to cite Matthew 25 \u2014 where Jesus said: \u201cFor I was hungry, and you gave me something eat\u201d \u2014 as a guiding principle, continues to worship at Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, where he serves as a lector. The congregation was privately torn by the allegations against Kavanaugh, but none of his fellow worshippers have confronted the justice in a public manner, according to one congregant. He has also been spotted having dinner with his wife occasionally at the Chevy Chase Club, where politics and titles \u201care left at the door,\u201d a member said.\n\nKavanaugh has continued his volunteer work with Catholic Charities; he shows up at its downtown headquarters every few weeks, primarily serving meals to the homeless. Last month,he spent two hours preparing dinner plates but remained in a courtyard, out of sight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Kavanaugh does go out in public, he usually wears a baseball cap, which allows him to move around unrecognized by most people. The relative anonymity has enabled him to attend a few Nationals games and the Women\u2019s NCAA Final Four in Tampa and vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where the family rents a house every August.\n\nNot a life destroyed, by any objective standard. But not the deference, let alone the acclaim, enjoyed by most of the justices in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAnalysis: A key witness in the Brett Kavanaugh saga comes down on his side\n\nIn their new book \"Justice on Trial,\" conservative authors Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino write that Kavanaugh's wife hoped that her husband, shortlisted as a likely Supreme Court pick under a Republican president, wouldn't get the nod. Kavanaugh was nominated by President George W. Bush for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2003 but not confirmed until 2006 because Democrats questioned his work for independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Bill Clinton and on Bush's legal team during the 2000 Florida ballot recount.\n\n\u201cPerhaps because the earlier confirmation battle had been so brutal,\u201d they write, \u201cAshley prayed that God would deliver them from another.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s advocates expected a political battle but not the explosive allegations from Ford that divided the nation.\n\nThis spring, Ford\u2019s attorney said her client\u2019s testimony exposed Kavanaugh\u2019s character to the world: \u201cHe will always have an asterisk next to his name,\u201d Debra Katz said in April at the University of Baltimore. During the same speech, she accused the Republican senators who voted for Kavanaugh of misogyny.\n\nFor most Americans, their first and only impression of Kavanaugh comes from his confirmation hearings. In popular culture, he has become a punchline: Matt Damon\u2019s unforgettable impression on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Julia Louis-Dreyfus took jabs at him when she accepted the Mark Twain Prize at the Kennedy Center. He was the subject of a reality-TV debate on \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\u201d But perhaps nothing captured the divisiveness better than Time\u2019s annual \u201c100 Most Influential People\u201d list in April. Kavanaugh was described by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as \u201cone of the most qualified Supreme Court nominees in modern history.\u201d Ford was lauded by Sen. Kamala D. Harris as a woman who \u201crisked everything to send a warning in a moment of grave consequence.\u201d\n\nNone of this is surprising to Ryan Lovelace, a legal business reporter for the National Law Journal and author of \u201cSearch and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an increasingly vitriolic political climate around the Supreme Court for some time,\u201d he said. The political left is finally organizing and campaigning around the courts in the same way the right has done, successfully, for years, he added.\n\nThe question now: How will this ultimate Washington insider \u2014 Republican loyalist, Bush White House staffer, appellate judge \u2014 respond to the ongoing questions about his character and behavior? Will he, like Justice Clarence Thomas, retreat into the arms of conservative ideology and supporters? Or will Kavanaugh try, as he\u2019s done all his life, to emulate his mentor, Justice Kennedy?\n\n\u201cJustice Thomas was embittered by his bruising confirmation battle and in some ways radicalized in terms of his jurisprudence,\u201d said legal scholar David Lat, founder of Above the Law blog. \u201cI think Justice Kavanaugh is a contrast. He seems very much like the judge we knew on the D.C. Circuit. He is carrying himself as if nothing from the confirmation battle happened. . . He\u2019s hoping to put this all behind him.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely to happen any time soon. Last fall, hundreds of alumni at Harvard Law wrote an open letter urging the dean to drop Kavanaugh, who taught there for 10 years. \u201cWe believe that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment as an HLS lecturer sends a message to law students, and in particular female students, that powerful men are above the law, and that obstructive, inappropriate behavior will be rewarded,\u201d they said. Harvard quickly announced Kavanaugh\u2019s schedule would not allow him to continue teaching at the school.\n\nThen George Mason\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School offered him a three-year contract to teach an off-campus course in England during the court\u2019s summer break. GMU law students did not object, but undergraduates demanded that the university\u2019s president, \u00c1ngel Cabrera, fire Kavanaugh. He refused, writing that having a justice\u2019s contribution was \u201cuniquely valuable\u201d for law students and that the \u201cdecision, controversial as it may be, in no way affects the university\u2019s ongoing efforts to eradicate sexual violence from our campuses.\u201d Kavanaugh taught the three-week course without incident and took his family to see \u201cHamilton\u201d in London.\n\nPerhaps Kavanaugh will come to decide he doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks of him. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Lat said, \u201che\u2019s still a Supreme Court justice.\u201d", "description": "As the anniversary of his confirmation approaches, Kavanaugh is a walking controversy.", "authors": ["Roxanne Roberts", "Feature Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/R4ibarMPv8lIejdar8pDZwikVKo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7YQWHHDVQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
