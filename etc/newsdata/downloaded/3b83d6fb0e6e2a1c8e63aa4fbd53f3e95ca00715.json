Prices for this high-performance version start from \u00a3138,826 before a green government grant of \u00a33,500 is applied. Cheaper variants, costing from around \u00a380,000, are expected to follow, though.\n\nElectric era for Porsche: The German sports car-maker has revealed its first zero-emissions vehicle, with prices starting from \u00a3115,000 from launch\n\nOrder books for first UK deliveries in January opened as the new Taycan had its global launch simultaneously on three Continents \u2013in Berlin in Germany, Fuzhou in China and Niagara Falls in Canada, which Porsche says are the three most important sales markets for the vehicle.\n\nPowered by two electric motors \u2013 one on each axle \u2013 the range-topping all-wheel drive Turbo S will accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 2.8 seconds, which is the same as Lamborghini's first hybrid vehicle, the Sian, also revealed today.\n\nThe Turbo S model - which obviously has no turbo as there's no engine, but Porsche wants to stick to the brand's existing model naming structure - has a top speed that's limited to 161mph.\n\nThe combined potency of the motors totals 761 horsepower - the equivalent to more than seven Ford Fiestas - and requires a high-performance 93.4kWh battery to power them.\n\nUnlike many electric models already on the market, the Taycan boasts a two-speed automatic gearbox to aid fast but smooth acceleration.\n\nThe range-topping Porsche Taycan Turbo S - seen here at the launch at Niagara Falls - model can hit 62mph in 2.8 seconds and has a top speed that's limited to 161mph\n\nThe less potent Turbo model (pictured) doesn't have the same acceleration or top speed, but does have a longer range and cheaper start price close to \u00a3115,000\n\nNo exhausts: This is the first ever Porsche to hit showrooms without exhaust pipes. UK customers should expect to see models arriving in January next year\n\nThe two-speed transmission installed on the rear axle has been developed especially by Porsche which explained: 'First gear gives the Taycan even more acceleration from a standing start, while second gear with a long gear ratio ensures high efficiency and equally high power reserves. This also applies at very high speeds.'\n\nThe new Taycan - officially pronounced tie-can \u2013 has the lowest centre of gravity of any Porsche road car which allows for exceptionally sporty dynamics and handling.\n\nThis pure-electric drivetrain increases weight quite substantially, though.\n\nIt tips the scales at around 2.3 tonnes, which is half a ton more than the latest 911 though on par with the firm's current Panamera luxury family saloon.\n\nEven with all this performance on tap, Porsche promises the Taycan Turbo S will still have a range of up to 257 miles with a full battery, and claims that it can be charged up to 80 per cent capacity in less than 23 minutes.\n\nTo prove that the brand is moving with the times, it offers a leather free interior option for vegans and those who would prefer to not touch animal materials\n\nCustomers have the option of choosing a Taycan with either a four (as pictured) or five-seat layout, depending on needs\n\nWith no conventional engine to worry about, it also aims to be practical and can be ordered with a layout to seat either four of five people with two luggage compartments totalling 447 litres of storage space - 81 litres in the front and 366 litres in the back.\n\nAnd to show that the brand is moving with the times, there's also an optional leather-free interior ideal for vegans or potential customers with an ethical objection to animal products.\n\nPorsche notes: 'With the Taycan, Porsche offers an entirely leather-free interior for the first time.\n\n'Interiors made from innovative recycled materials underscore the sustainable concept of the electric sports car.'\n\nPorsche plans to add more all-electric Taycans to the range, with prices from around \u00a380,000 to \u00a390,000 and with a longer driving distances between charges\n\nThe high definition instrument cluster shows all relevant information, including the remaining battery range depending on the mode you're driving in\n\nLaunched simultaneously is a a slightly less powerful and cheaper Taycan Turbo model priced from \u00a3115,858 (excluding government's plug-in vehicle grant of \u00a33,500).\n\nIt has the same top speed of 161mph, but its lower power output of 680 horses means acceleration to 62mph is fractionally slower at 3.2 seconds - though it does have a longer range of up to 279 miles.\n\nPorsche plans to add more all-electric Taycans to the range, with prices from around \u00a380,000 to \u00a390,000 and with a longer driving distances between charges.\n\nThe manufacturer said: 'A less powerful version of these all-wheel drive vehicles will follow later this year, and the Taycan Cross Turismo will introduce a new body style at the end of next year.'\n\nEven with all this performance on tap, Porsche promises the Taycan Turbo S will still have a range of up to 257 miles with a full battery, and claims that it can be charged up to 80 per cent capacity in less than 23 minutes\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The Taycan has a charging port hidden under a flap that slides up to reveal the seven-pin socket\n\nhe new Taycan - officially pronounced tie-can \u2013 has the lowest centre of gravity of any Porsche road car which allows for exceptionally sporty dynamics and handling\n\nPorsche Taycan Turbo S: Will it fit in my garage?
