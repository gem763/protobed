Today, it\u2019s the knowledge that my boyfriends John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds are working on, and co-starring in, an upcoming film together.\n\nAs per The Hollywood Reporter, the pair are working on a comedy-fantasy flick called \u2018Imaginary Friends\u2019, and tbh \u2018fantasy\u2019 is very much the right word for it because I\u2019m about 90% sure this is a dream I\u2019ve had.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that John Krasinski is writing and directing the film, which apparently follows the story of a guy who can see and speak with the forgotten imaginary friends of other people, and is being pinned as similar to the whole \u201conly you can talk to me\u201d comedy seen in Dr Dolittle.\n\nReports are looking like Ryan Reynolds will play the lead here, and has to make efforts to save the world when some of the imaginary friends turn evil after being neglected by their IRL friends for so long.\n\nLook this is going to be great and it\u2019ll be fab to see John Krasinski getting back into a comedy role after he showed his range with directing and starring in A Quiet Place, the Very Serious Films, but I\u2019m also going to be sitting in the cinema very distracted by both of my husbands on the screen at the same time, as co-stars of the film, and also my heart.\n\nBoth actors are big on the ol\u2019 breaking-the-fourth-wall in the name of comedy, so this is going to be some beautiful Deadpool-cross-Jim-Halpert shit, isn\u2019t it. Here for that, my good bitches. Here. For. That.\n\nImaginary Friends is being shopped out to production companies at the moment, it\u2019s reported, so as soon as this one gets some more information on like, when the fuck I can throw all my money at the local cinema to watch every screening forever, I\u2019ll let you know.", "description": "Reports have surfaced that John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds are set to co-star in a fantasy-comedy where a man can speak to forgotten imaginary friends.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/krasinski-reynolds-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
