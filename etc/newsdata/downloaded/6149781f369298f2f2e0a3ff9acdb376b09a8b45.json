It is believed that Lakshmi showers her blessings upon those homes that are clean and well-lit.\n\nThe festival of lights is traditionally ushered in by setting off firecrackers and cleaning, decorating, and illuminating houses.\n\nOn this occasion, people dress up in traditional clothes and exchange gifts. The prayers are usually followed by a lavish feast and bursting firecrackers.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated with the soldiers posted in Indian Kashmir, feeding sweets to his countrymen.\n\nThe festival marks the return of Hindu God Prince, Rama, his wife Sita, and brother Laxman, to his hometown of Ayodhya after 14-years of exile, defeating demon king Ravana.
