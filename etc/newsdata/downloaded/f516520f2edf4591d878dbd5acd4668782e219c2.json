(Ruben Sprich/Reuters)\n\nThe line connecting Donald Trump with Marc Benioff\n\nOne enduring thing of value that ought to come out of the Trump administration \u2014 ought, but apparently won\u2019t \u2014 would be to finally drive a stake into the heart of these deathless twin superstitions: that the skills and talents that enable success in a particular kind of business are infinitely transferable to other profit-seeking and nonprofit enterprises alike, and that the formula for success in governing a democratic republic is to \u201crun the country like a business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur political lexicon does not have a precise term for this theory of benevolent plutarchy.\n\nCall it CEO-cracy.\n\nCeocracy is mostly a stupid rhetorical tic. No one, including successful businessman-politicians such as former Florida governor Rick Scott (who has a real weakness for that kind of rhetoric) actually tries to run a government as though it were a business \u2014 because that\u2019s nuts. Rick Scott didn\u2019t run Florida\u2019s government like he was a CEO \u2014 he ran it like he was Rick Perry.\n\nBusinesses measure their success in profit. Governments don\u2019t. Businesses offer products and services in exchange for money in voluntary transactions. Governments don\u2019t. Businesses that fail go bankrupt and are disbanded (except for politically sensitive banks, automobile companies, steel producers, farmers . . .) while failed governments keep right on misgoverning in the city and state of New York, in Illinois, in New Jersey, in California, in Connecticut, in the District of Columbia, in Austin, and abroad. Businesses have customers. Governments don\u2019t. Those who profess their desire to \u201crun government like a business\u201d most often mean that they seek to achieve a higher degree of administrative excellence and bureaucratic accountability than Americans are used to seeing from their governments. But that isn\u2019t running government like a business \u2014 that\u2019s running government like . . . Swiss government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican Airlines is a business, too. Does anybody take that dysfunctional organization as a metric of success?\n\nOther people mean other things. Some of them conflate the bottom-line approach to business management with the need for fiscal responsibility in government. Jerry Falwell Jr., the craven political opportunist who somehow has managed to besmirch the name \u201cJerry Falwell,\u201d said this about Donald Trump: \u201cWhat earns him my support is his business acumen. Our country was so deep in debt and so mismanaged by career politicians that we needed someone who was not a career politician, but someone who\u2019d been successful in business to run the country like a business.\u201d Deep in debt, indeed: The United States has added nearly $1 trillion in public debt since Falwell spoke those words . . . ten months ago. Trump is running the country like a business \u2014 unfortunately, the business he is running it like is one of those debt-ridden casinos he mismanaged.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign may have been the apex of American ceocracy so far \u2014 keep an eye on Michael Bloomberg, though, along with Howard Schultz and a few others. Marc Benioff, the billionaire founder of Salesforce, has been testing the political waters for a while now, most recently with an Elizabeth Warren\u2013esque indictment of capitalism in the New York Times in which he calls for a \u201cnew capitalism,\u201d as though the collective economic behavior of human beings in the free world were something that a guy in an office somewhere could just reorganize after a couple of lunches with top-shelf consultants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut ceocracy is an ancient American superstition. Donald Trump\u2019s great stroke of political genius was running Ross Perot\u2019s ceocratic 1992 independent campaign inside the Republican party rather than as a third-party alternative. Perot, too, promised to run the affairs of the country \u201clike a business.\u201d\n\nIn the Nineties, when the cult of the executive was riding high, both Republicans and Democrats made noises about attempting to recruit Microsoft founder Bill Gates as a presidential candidate. Gates, to his credit, preferred philanthropy with his own money to the excitement of bribing people with their own money and then acting as though he had done them a favor.\n\nThe self-professed American \u201cnationalists\u201d of our own daffy political moment echo those of an earlier generation who hoped to move Henry Ford into the White House. Ford was briefly a candidate, and his rhetoric foreshadowed Trump\u2019s with occasionally startling exactness: He called himself \u201ca builder\u201d and boasted that he\u2019d defend the \u201caverage man\u201d against the corrupt elites in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the country is not a vast assembly line, and neither is its government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, as it turns out, the war in Syria is only tangentially about real estate.\n\n\u201cRun the government like a business\u201d means different things to different people. Donald Trump has one idea of it, Marc Benioff has another, and Michael Bloomberg no doubt has another still. American businessmen are not a philosophically homogeneous lot. And the best of them understand the severe limitation of the notion of running the government as though it were a business.\n\nWhat this is really about is bureaucracy and its troubles.\n\nAmericans do not care much for bureaucracy, to the extent that the word bureaucracy itself functions as a pejorative. But an excellent bureaucracy is a wonder to behold. It was a first-rate bureaucracy that put a man on the moon and brought him back safely. Dwight Eisenhower was one of the outstanding bureaucrats of his generation, a man who did a long and dreary apprenticeship as an administrative functionary before being anointed \u201csupreme commander.\u201d Bureaucracy matters in the business world, too: Administrative excellence and not technological innovation is what distinguishes Amazon from its would-be competitors, whereas dealing with your health-insurance company or your mobile-phone provider is in most cases a lot like a trip to the department of motor vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmericans, with our heroic self-conception, valorize swashbuckling entrepreneurs, and we take that as our presumptive model of leadership. Satya Nadella is deeply admired within Microsoft, but he will never be the object of adoration that Bill Gates once was \u2014 and even if the Indian-born Nadella were eligible for the presidency, his is not a name to conjure with. Microsoft was a mature company when Nadella took over in 2014, and the value of the firm has more than trebled on his watch. That is a remarkable achievement, but not one that inspires the kind of hero-worship that accompanies larger-than-life founders and agonists on the model of Steve Jobs.\n\nBut if we are, for the sake of the example only, to take business as our template, then there would be much to recommend a Nadella-style presidency in which a going concern and market leader builds on its real strengths and enjoys remarkable growth and prosperity under management so intelligent and capable that nobody would ever even think of writing an epic poem about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are many admirable figures in American business, and some of them no doubt would have much to offer American government, including at sub-presidential levels: Rex Tillerson did not have a very successful run as secretary of state, but he wasn\u2019t obviously unsuited to the job, and his main problem seems to have been his inferior superiors. Republicans criminally underused Carly Fiorina. Bloomberg was a pretty good mayor, and New York City has suffered under less capable leadership. Mark Zuckerberg might make an excellent spy chief.\n\nBut the argument that a billionaire\u2019s billions are a self-evident credential for national leadership is modern primitivism at its purest.
