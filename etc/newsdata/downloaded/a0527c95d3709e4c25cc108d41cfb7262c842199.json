The mogul is evidently embracing her newfound meme status, having changed her Instagram bio to read \u201crise and shine.\u201d\n\nThe internet, as usual, did its thing, and Stormi\u2019s reaction has birthed... new memes:\n\nkylie jenner: I'm not good enough?\n\nstormi webster: daddy sing pic.twitter.com/3BL1LwQ2op \u2014 thamy (@stormiwebstr) October 17, 2019\n\nRelated coverage\n\nKylie Jenner And Travis Scott Reportedly Split After 2 Years\n\nKylie Jenner Hangs Out With Tyga Amid Travis Scott Break.
