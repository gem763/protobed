It would be called, appropriately enough, \u201cAlien Stock,\u201d according to Las Vegas TV station KSNV TV.\n\nRoberts hoped Alien Stock would turn his jokey and potentially dangerous idea of raiding a military facility into something positive. But the festival received UFOs \u2015 unusually fiery objections \u2015 from residents of Rachel, who feared the town wouldn\u2019t be able to handle hordes of alien seekers.\n\nOn Monday, Roberts said he is pulling out of Alien Stock, citing a \u201clack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement given to KSHV, Roberts said Connie West, the owner of the festival permit, refused to provide him and his partners with \u201cthe proof that things expected at this festival were in place. In fact, she refused to provide to us, as agreed upon, contracts, proof of deposits or any paper proof of anything.\u201d\n\nRoberts said Alien Stock is moving to a safe, clean, secure area in downtown Las Vegas because he foresees \u201ca possible humanitarian disaster in the works.\u201d\n\nHe said he is not interested in creating \u201ca FyreFest 2.0,\u201d a reference to the much-maligned 2017 music festival that left attendees stranded and provided enough heinous and hilarious material for a documentary on Hulu and another one on Netflix.\n\nHuffPost reached out to West at her business, the E.T.-themed Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn hotel, but she did not immediately respond. The person who answered the phone said Alien Stock is going ahead even without Roberts.\n\nWest told Las Vegas station KVVU she will \u201cdo [the festival] the way I know how and what I\u2019ve been planning for because I know no other way to do it. But it\u2019s still happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad and I\u2019m brokenhearted, but at the same time, it is what it is,\u201d she went on. \u201cIf he chooses to go somewhere else, that\u2019s his choice. I\u2019m still having a party because people are still coming to Rachel.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a post on the town page for Rachel also mentions Fyre Festival and says it\u2019s probably for the best if Alien Stock doesn\u2019t end up happening.\n\nThe website also not-so-subtly suggests that visitors avoid their fair town:\n\nIf any event still happens it is going to be a pretty sad affair with no bands, very little infrastructure and a lot of unhappy campers. Instead of coming out to Rachel to storm Area 51 why not enjoy the party at one of the Area 51 Events in Las Vegas?\n\nThe \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d event had been planned for Sept. 20. Roberts did not immediately respond to a question from HuffPost about whether the actual raid is still happening.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nArea 51 Warning Sign\n\nArea 51 (Groom Lake, Dreamland).
