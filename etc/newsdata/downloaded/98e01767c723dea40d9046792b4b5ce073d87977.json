The backbench committee also signed off the package based on a briefing from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, rather than sighting the legislation, and some reservations were expressed.\n\nMPs are concerned that too often amendments are added because of negotiations with the crossbench by the government Senate leadership, and the changes are never referred back to the backbench committee for approval.\n\nGuardian Australia understands that to address the anxiety, Frydenberg gave an undertaking to bring the package back to the committee for a second approval if there were substantial amendments added during parliamentary debate.\n\nCentre Alliance has been signalling for months it will attempt to amend the proposal once it reaches the Senate to extend the divestiture power, which is limited to the energy sector, to an economy-wide power.\n\nThe Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia on Monday the proposed divestiture power \u201cneeds to be broadened\u201d and should apply across the economy to prevent consistent, egregious misuse of market power by big companies, and he singled out the supermarket giants as potential examples.\n\nPatrick said such powers existed in the United States, and should be implemented \u201cas a deterrent\u201d.\n\nBecause the National party has long championed powers to break up the big supermarkets, Liberals are concerned about the potential for the Centre Alliance amendments to succeed, assuming Labor continues to oppose the package.\n\nLabor opposed the proposal during the last parliament, but is currently reviewing its position. On Sunday the shadow energy minister, Mark Butler, said Labor would consider changes introduced by the government, but still harboured \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Energy Users Association representing the biggest users of electricity in this country also said they were concerned this bill would simply smash investor confidence and force power prices up,\u201d Butler told the ABC.", "description": "Some Liberals are concerned about the power to break up big companies being extended economy-wide", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5fd0e5f9e82c9598aeaf22cf8b78bb4e71d87f4/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a378f2b11088874c3b317a7b235f798", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
