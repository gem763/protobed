Make the case.\u201d\n\nHoyer said, \u201cThey\u2019re correct. We don\u2019t need the vote tomorrow. The court has indicated that we can proceed as we have been proceeding. However, what Jerry didn\u2019t mention is we are contemplating changing from what is essentially the investigatory phase of this matter into the open hearing\u2014public hearing\u2014phase of the consideration of whether or not there is evidence to believe that the president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in that public hearing, we want to make sure that everybody understands this is going to be due process,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is going to be fair. It\u2019s not going to be like the trial in the Senate, but it will be a forum in which the president is given the opportunity to call witnesses, to cross-examine, to have his representatives present. And for the president himself to be present. So this is \u2026 in the fact that this is a procedural matter, it\u2019s not necessary to carry out our constitutional duties, but we think appropriate.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he expected all House Democrats to vote for the impeachment inquiry, Hoyer said, \u201cI hope we don\u2019t lose any Democrats.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cJim Clyburn and I have talked, and I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get every Democrat.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "Wednesday on MSNBC's \"MTP Daily,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said he was not sure if every House Democrat will vote for the impeachment inquiry resolution scheduled for Thursday. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Steny-Hoyer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
