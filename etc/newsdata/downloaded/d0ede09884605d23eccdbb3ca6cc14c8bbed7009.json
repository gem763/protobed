But only in the final months before kickoff did the city of Kobe grasp what it was in for. Some 36,000 fans from Ireland, England, Scotland and South Africa were on their way. And\u2014these being rugby fans\u2014they would be dangerously thirsty.\n\nThe Kobe tourist board needed to get the word out. At a seminar in May, it told restaurants, bars, and hotel operators to brace themselves for a run on all liquids hoppy, malty and cold. As it wrote on one fact sheet: \u201cThe world\u2019s powerhouses of beer drinking to gather in Kobe?!\u201d\n\nPresenters at the seminar explained how Irish people drink more than twice as much beer than the average Japanese. And they warned that English, Scots, and South Africans weren\u2019t far behind. For anyone in the business of pouring pints, the board had one rule of thumb: Prepare four to five times as much beer as usual.\n\n\u201cI stressed in the seminar that rugby fans drink all day long,\u201d said Naofumi Machidori, one of the Kobe officials.\n\nIn a country that prides itself on preparedness for all kinds of natural disasters, a rugby-induced beer drought is no idle fear. Just two years ago, the beer taps at Yokohama International Stadium ran dry midway through a match. Not by coincidence, Japan was playing Australia.\n\nVendors sell beer to rugby fans outside the Sapporo Dome.

Bars around the country are extending their hours on match days. Cities are throwing up emergency bars to keep supporters lubricated on their way to stadiums. And Kirin Brewery Co. has more than tripled production of Heineken, the official beer of the World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe have talked a lot about beer,\u201d said Brett Gosper, the chief operating officer of World Rugby. \u201cFor us, it was about educating the venues and the cites about what an international rugby event is all about. We have a great traveling audience and they drink a lot of beer.\u201d\n\nBeer is as much a part of the rugby culture as mud, bruises and cauliflower ears. There\u2019s no getting around it. It flows freely in the stands during matches and the smell hangs thick in the air. At Twickenham Stadium in London, one of the game\u2019s spiritual homes, the bars in the concourses stay full and rowdy long after the final whistle. Even opposing players traditionally gather for pints once they\u2019re done bashing each other\u2019s heads in.\n\nMasaki Fujiu, a longtime supporter of the Japanese national team, experienced it up close during his team\u2019s opener against Russia last Friday. After sipping a pair of pregame beers to unwind, he installed himself in the stadium and focused on the game. There was just one distraction. Hard-drinking Russia fans in his row were recycling beer at such alarming rates that they kept barging past him to get to the bathroom.\n\n\u201cWe Japanese just can\u2019t drink that much,\u201d Fujiu said.\n\nIreland fans celebrate the first try during a match against Scotland at International Stadium Yokohama.

Inside Yokohama International Stadium during the World Cup\u2019s opening weekend, Steve Evans and his two adult sons each carried six pints of beer to their seats in cardboard holders for the Springboks\u2019 match against New Zealand\u2014just to be on the safe side. They didn\u2019t want to risk repeating the calamity of their flight over, which ran out of suds in midair. Especially, Evans said, when beer is so \u201ccrucial\u201d to enjoying this sport.\n\n\u201cWe all probably do eight during a game, and then take it from there,\u201d he added.\n\nRugby fans don\u2019t merely drink a lot. They also drink fast. Which is far from ideal in a country that often serves beer in small glasses. So to buy pubs and restaurants some time between refills, Japanese beer makers Asahi and Suntory have urged them to deploy bigger mugs for foreign visitors.\n\nNot everyone will be able to cope. Yasunori Kanemura, who runs a rugby-themed bar in Kobe, knows he could be in trouble. His establishment only seats around 15 and has no room to stash extra kegs.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What are your predictions for the Rugby World Cup?

Having heard all about the potential beer drought, employees stacked kegs high around the bar area for the foreign and local fans watching Australia take on Fiji. Bar manager Hiroki Watanabe said he had 10 times the usual amount of beer supplies ready to avoid running dry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making sure there\u2019s no chance that will happen,\u201d he said.\n\nWatanabe said that over the first two days of the tournament, British fans seemed to be the most enthusiastic drinkers, with some knocking back as many as 10 pints apiece\u2014a typical Japanese customer would only order one or two. Not that he was complaining.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d Watanabe added, \u201cthat the World Cup only runs until early November.\u201d\n\n\u2014Alastair Gale contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com and Miho Inada at miho.inada@wsj.com", "description": "Japan has taken serious measures wherever it can to make sure the six-week Rugby World Cup meets the demands of the hardest-drinking fans in sports.", "authors": ["Joshua Robinson", "Miho Inada", "Joshua.Robinson Wsj.Com", "Miho.Inada Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109757/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
