Everyone knows he thinks the media is crooked and corrupt, we know he thinks Democrats are up to no good and don\u2019t operate on the level, and he\u2019s said before the government is rising up against him. Everything he doesn\u2019t like is a \u201choax\u201d or a \u201cscam\u201d or \u201cphony.\u201d AP\u2019s Kevin Freking and Jonathan Lemire: \u201c\u2018Are you talking to me?\u2019 Trump\u2019s anger on impeachment erupts\u201d\n\nTO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT\u2019S SPIN at this point is to believe that every single news story printed is wrong.\n\n-- REPORTERS ARE GETTING MORE ADEPT at sidestepping his strong-arming. See JEFF MASON\u2019S interaction with him Wednesday. The president tried to redirect Mason\u2019s inquiries, and the Reuters correspondent calmly stood his ground. NYT\u2019s Mike Grynbaum on Mason\u2019s exchange with Trump \u2026 Video\n\n-- QUITE CURIOUSLY, TRUMP NO LONGER uses his White House press secretary to drive daily messaging. Ever. Think of how useful it might be to the White House for reporters to hear from the administration periodically, not just a president who is tweeting angrily from the residence or teeing off during pool sprays.\n\n-- PEOPLE AROUND HIM ARE LEAKING LIKE CRAZY. Today, The Washington Post has a story with details about VP MIKE PENCE\u2019S involvement in all the comings and goings with the Ukraine matter. When the people you hire want to knife you, you have a problem.\n\n-- MOST ELECTED REPUBLICANS are unwilling to go on television to defend the president, because they don\u2019t know where this story ends. THE SURROGATES who go on television are not to be believed, because it\u2019s been proven time and time again that the only word that matters is the president\u2019s.\n\nNYT\u2019S MAGGIE HABERMAN and ANNIE KARNI: \u201cImpeachment War Room? Trump Does It All Himself, and That Worries Republicans\u201d\n\nNEW \u2026 THE NRCC is going to release a new polling memo today that, in their view, backs up the contention that impeachment is harmful for some Democrats.\n\n-- THE MEMO says this: \u201cTwo-thirds (63%) of voters in NRCC target seats and 66% of voters in Republican-held battleground seats agree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the president and should be working on issues they campaign on such as funding our military, improving the nation\u2019s infrastructure, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and caring for our nation\u2019s veterans.\u201d\n\n-- REPUBLICANS TOLD US THIS is how they asked the question: \u201cBelow is a statement on the impeachment inquiry. After you\u2019ve read it, please select whether you generally agree or disagree with that particular viewpoint: Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with President Trump and instead should be working on the issues they were elected to do like funding our military, improving the nation\u2019s infrastructure, lowering cost of prescription drugs, or caring for our nation\u2019s veterans.\u201d\n\n-- DETAILS: This is a poll of 800 respondents across 253 House districts -- all GOP-held seats and 55 target seats. The polling memo\n\nCOOL TOOL: FiveThirtyEight has a new tracker for impeachment polls. The current breakdown: An average of 46.7% of Americans support impeachment, while 45.1% oppose it.\n\nNOT BACKING DOWN -- SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI on a call Wednesday afternoon with House Democrats: \u201cI do think that this is a moment beyond Donald Trump. He\u2019s almost not worth it, to do an impeachment, because he is so what he is, but the Constitution is worth it, and our democracy is worth it, and our \u2018Republic, if we can keep it\u2019 is worth it.\u201d\n\n-- MUCH OF THIS CALL was about H.R. 3, the Democrats\u2019 drug pricing bill.\n\nGood Thursday morning.

At that time \u2014 following Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy \u2014 the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cGiuliani consulted on Ukraine with imprisoned Paul Manafort via a lawyer,\u201d by Josh Dawsey, Tom Hamburger, Paul Sonne and Ros Helderman: \u201cIn his quest to rewrite the history of the 2016 election, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney has turned to an unusual source of information: Trump\u2019s imprisoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\n\u201cRudolph W. Giuliani in recent months has consulted several times with Manafort through the federal prisoner\u2019s lawyer in pursuit of information about a disputed ledger that would bolster his theory that the real story of 2016 is not Russian interference to elect Trump, but Ukrainian efforts to support Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe relationship, which Giuliani acknowledged in an interview this week with The Washington Post, stems from a shared interest in a narrative that undermines the rationale for the special counsel investigation. That inquiry led to Manafort\u2019s imprisonment on tax and financial fraud allegations related to his work in Kiev for the political party of former president Viktor Yanukovych.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- BEN SCHRECKINGER: \u201cUkraine scandal ropes in the usual suspects\u201d: \u201cThe Ukraine scandal engulfing Donald Trump\u2019s presidency goes well beyond the core cast of characters at the heart of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s now drawing in a duo familiar to anyone who has followed past Washington imbroglios: conservative lawyers and GOP operatives Joe diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing. And the scandal is beginning to reveal the opaque agendas of a pair of Ukrainian oligarchs whose legal troubles have led them to seek favors in Washington.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- HMM \u2026 WAPO: \u201cOdd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the \u2018rough transcript\u2019 of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call,\u201d by Carol Leonnig, Craig Timberg and Drew Harwell\n\n-- CNN: \u201cState Department inspector general gives Congress documents that Giuliani provided\u201d\n\n-- MARIANNE LEVINE: \u201cGraham urges foreign leaders to assist Barr with investigation into 2016 election\u201d: \u201cSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham on Wednesday asked several foreign leaders to continue to assist Attorney General William Barr with his investigation into the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cIn a letter to the prime ministers of Australia, Italy and Britain, the South Carolina Republican requested their \u2018continued cooperation with Attorney General Barr as the Department of Justice continues to investigate the origins and extent of foreign influence in the 2016 election.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- BURGESS EVERETT: \u201cSchumer to Dems: Press McConnell on impeachment but don\u2019t forget \u2018legislative graveyard\u2019\u201d\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

They sigh and call this latest controversy just another sign of partisanship and dysfunction in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 a far cry from the outrage heard from Democrats over the Ukraine whistle-blower complaint or the Civil War-type backlash that Trump has predicted from his supporters. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018People are just burnt out on it,\u2019 said U.S. Representative Tim Burchett, a first-term Republican who represents the area.\u201d Boston Globe\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026 NATASHA KORECKI: \u201cWith Warren gaining, Biden builds a Super Tuesday fortress\u201d: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s campaign is ramping up its investment in the Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March.\n\n\u201cThe increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden\u2019s polling numbers have declined and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she\u2019s heavily invested in field organization.\n\n\u201cThe former vice president\u2019s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Explore the stories of our 10,000 Women graduates and find out how they're generating revenue and creating jobs in their communities.\n\nTHE JUICE \u2026\n\n-- NEW \u2026 CONVENTION 2020 WATCH: Veteran Republican operatives JEFF KIMBELL and JOHN GREEN have secured the Fillmore in Charlotte for the RNC Convention from Aug. 24-27.

The Italian government has so far refused to say a word about a trip to the capital last week by Attorney General William P. Barr to meet with Italian intelligence officers as part of President Trump\u2019s efforts to discredit the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 United States election.\n\n\u201cThe Italian prime minister is Giuseppe Conte, whom Mr. Trump has called \u2018my friend Giuseppe.\u2019 In August, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Conte in a Tweet, albeit one that misspelled his name, amid an Italian government crisis. \u2026 While the Italian government has gone officially silent on the issue, Mr. Conte seemed to be helping out, according to reports in the Italian news media.\u201d NYT\n\nHISTORY LESSON -- \u201cGOP veterans of Clinton\u2019s impeachment urge caution on Trump,\u201d by AP\u2019s Andrew Taylor: \u201cThen there\u2019s former Rep.

He seemed almost sheepish when encountered in the Capitol recently.\n\n\u201c\u2018We made a mistake\u2019 impeaching Clinton, Inglis said, adding that the substance of the matter \u2018wasn\u2019t so very consequential.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I can say that now, in retrospect \u2014 I didn\u2019t think that at the time \u2014 but I think that was because I was probably sort of blinded by my dislike of President Clinton, you know, and wanting to stop him,\u2019 Inglis said. \u2018So there may be some similarities there in this scenario.\u2019\u201d AP\n\nALL NEWS IS LOCAL -- \u201cWho is Gordon Sondland?
