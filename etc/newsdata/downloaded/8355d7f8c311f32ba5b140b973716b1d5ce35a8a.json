While there was \u201cno appetite for no-deal Brexit\", he said, \"if you are going to face something as disruptive as they at least they are doing it the point where its close to the top of the economic cycle\u201d.\n\nBrexit was likely to hit rural areas most, he stressed, as some financial services firms are moving to Ireland from the UK.", "description": "All the latest business, economics and companies news.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.0/bbc_news_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
