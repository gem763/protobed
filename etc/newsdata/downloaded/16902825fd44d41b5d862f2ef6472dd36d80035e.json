So nice to see!\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had measured criticism for Ms Thunberg's \"very radical\" approach, suggesting that anger at his government was misplaced.\n\nFrance, along with Germany, were among the five countries included in the complaint filed to the UN on Monday by Ms Thunberg.\n\n\"Everything that our young people are doing to fight this is useful - and the not so young too,\" he told Europe 1.\n\n\"But now they have to focus on those who have most to do, those trying to get in the way of change. I don't feel the French or German government are the ones getting in the way today.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel posted a photo of her speaking with the young activist.\n\nHowever, Ms Merkel received criticism from some complaining that Germany is not phasing out coal fast enough.\n\nHarjeet Singh, from the charity ActionAid, said: \"This summit was supposed to be a turning point. But we have seen an exceptional lack of commitment from the biggest and richest polluting countries that continue to take trivial measures toward solving a life-or-death crisis.\"\n\nKate Hampton, from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, asked: \"If we can\u2019t massively accelerate the many solutions available to us now... then what are we doing, really?\"\n\nJennifer Morgan, the head of Greenpeace International, said that \"for the most part, world leaders did not deliver what was needed in New York today.\"\n\nAttention will now shift to Monaco where the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will warn that global heating is causing an ocean emergency.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "description": "Over 60 countries promise tougher action to curb emissions - but Greta Thunberg says it's a failure.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A0B6/production/_108924114_056650685-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
