In early September, discount retailer Fred\u2019s (NASDAQ:FRED) announced that it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and shuttering all of its stores. Fred\u2019s joins a long list of retailers that have declared bankruptcy over the past several years as technology has dramatically and irreversibly altered the retail landscape. That list includes once loved retailers like Barneys, Sears and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, among many, many more.\n\nOver the next several years, this list will only get longer. Looking at the retail scene, while the broad outlook for physical and digital retailers remains positive, there are a handful of retailers out there that are only a few quarters away from shuttering their doors.\n\nThese are retailers that were: 1) slow to adapt to the e-commerce shift, 2) have been losing share and relevance for the past few years, 3) are now operating with depleted resources and simply don\u2019t have the financial firepower to make the necessary changes and enhancements to their business to survive, and 4) are holding a huge pile of debt.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUltimately, if a retailer checks off those four boxes, then that\u2019s probably a retail stock heading for the graveyard \u2014 meaning it\u2019s a retail stock you want to sell.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at six retail stocks to sell on their way to bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Stocks to Sell: J.C. Penney (JCP)\n\nSource: Supannee_Hickman / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up, we have forgotten mall retail giant J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP).\n\nAt one point in time, J.C. Penney was at the heart of the American retail landscape, back when consumers did all of their shopping at malls. Times have changed since then. Namely, consumers have migrated to off-mall and online retail channels. J.C. Penney has been slow to adapt to those changes. They didn\u2019t build out an e-commerce business as quickly as they needed to. They didn\u2019t develop omni-channel capabilities as quickly as they needed to. And, they didn\u2019t update their stores or offerings in a way that they needed to.\n\nAs such, the once all-important mall retail giant has become largely irrelevant with negative comps and falling margins. J.C. Penney will remain irrelevant for the foreseeable future because this company doesn\u2019t have enough cash (only $175 million in cash on the balance sheet) nor does the business produce enough cash (negative free cash flow year-to-date) to allow management to invest that much \u2014 if anything \u2014 back into the business.\n\nFurther complicating things, there\u2019s over $5 billion in total debt sitting on the balance sheet. Thus, any cash this company does produce is going to have to go towards paying off debt.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to like about JCP here. You have a depressed and forgotten retailer with rapidly depleting resources and a bunch of debt \u2014 that combination ultimately implies that bankruptcy is coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nAscena Retail (ASNA)\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLesser known than J.C. Penney but in just as much financial trouble, women\u2019s apparel retailer Ascena Retail (NASDAQ:ASNA) could easily wind up bankrupt within the next few quarters.\n\nAscena is the parent company behind women\u2019s apparel brands like Ann Taylor, LOFT, Lou & Grey, Lane Bryant, Catherines and Justice. Those brands simply aren\u2019t all that important in the modern women\u2019s apparel retail landscape. They aren\u2019t very differentiated and they have a ton of competition. As such, it should be no surprise that over the past several years, Ascena\u2019s comparable sales and margin trends have been sharply negative.", "description": "Another one bites the dust.
