Congrats to the NBA for pulling it off with their fulsome Chinese bootlicking.\n\nI encourage you to read the full letter, which is righteous. And just two pages long.\n\nTheir core argument, repeated often here and elsewhere over the past three days, is that American citizens can\u2019t be subjected to de facto Chinese censorship at work because the almighty dollar demands it. But there are other arguments:\n\nThey list four demands, the most notable of which is for the NBA to pull out of China until the Chinese government stops punishing the league for refusing to sanction Daryl Morey. Adam Silver obviously doesn\u2019t want to do that for fear of deepening the dispute. Right now, as far as I know, China has limited its actions against the NBA to preseason games \u2014 the Rockets have been banned from the airwaves, NBA charitable events have been canceled, and the exhibition games this week between the Lakers and Nets look like they\u2019ll end up being scrapped. Silver may be thinking that once China has proven its point, it\u2019ll relent and allow coverage of the start of the regular season in the belief that the league and its personnel will have learned their lesson. They\u2019ll never again mention Hong Kong.\n\nWhich, I bet, is correct. Steph Curry didn\u2019t get within a country mile of saying something controversial when he was asked about this today.\n\nSteph Curry: \u201cThis situation, there\u2019s a huge weight and gravity to it. There\u2019s going to need to be some things to be sorted out. But I just don\u2019t know enough about Chinese history and how that\u2019s influenced modern society\u2026This is not going away. So we\u2019ll come back to it.\u201d pic.twitter.com/6h6ZGWHQtq \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 9, 2019\n\nLike his coach, he just doesn\u2019t know enough to comment about complicated issues like whether people should be sent to concentration camps because of their religion, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, whether they should not. The \u201cgravity\u201d and complexity of certain domestic issues hasn\u2019t deterred Curry from commenting on those, either. But go figure that he\u2019s stumped about China.\n\nStephen \u201credsteeze\u201d Miller dug this up out of Steph\u2019s Twitter feed:\n\nCan't wait to launch the #CurryTwo! We're dropping limited pairs in China on Sept 6 for the #UARoadshow. pic.twitter.com/FYf6y4BAeJ \u2014 Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) September 2, 2015\n\nNo one\u2019s going to say a word about Hong Kong going forward. Not him, not LeBron, not Zion, not \u201coutspoken\u201d frauds like Kerr and Gregg Popovich, certainly not Silver. China will win. The Sasse letter is nice and all but no one at the NBA wants to be the guy who closed off a billion-dollar market for all their friends because he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut despite knowing the consequences. At best, the letter might convince China to end its boycott of the NBA a bit earlier than expected now that the issue has attracted the attention of the U.S. Congress. Amid a trade war with Trump, Beijing needs to be careful about how much it wants to antagonize Americans for other reasons and deepen hostility between the two countries. If nothing else, trying to strongarm the NBA might irritate American fans to the point that they\u2019re more willing to support an extended tariff campaign against China. Maybe this is the point where China tells Silver, \u201cFine, let\u2019s drop it, just stay out of our politics.\u201d They\u2019ll comply!\n\nBut here\u2019s your consolation prize: Every time one of these holier-than-thou A-holes opens his mouth about domestic politics going forward, you get to remind him that he wouldn\u2019t say a word if his bottom line was at stake. We know it for a fact now. We have the receipts, thanks to Daryl Morey.\n\nMeanwhile, hopefully this will become a recurring feature at NBA games this year. We can\u2019t make Kerr and Curry pretend to care, but we can at least keep giving the media reason to ask them uncomfortable questions:\n\nProtesters outside of the Washington Wizards preseason game against the Guangzhou Long-Lions.

His point about hypocrisy by the likes of Kerr and Popovich is right on, and is echoed in Sasse\u2019s letter. But, unlike in the letter, when he\u2019s offered the chance to rip China for bullying the NBA over Morey\u2019s right to free speech, he passes. That\u2019s between the league and China, he says.
