It features a $6.475 million two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bedroom model apartment on the 36th floor from design studio AFSO, which was founded by Andre Fu.\n\n\n\nMr. Fu has worked on the St. Regis Hotel in Hong Kong, the Waldorf Astoria Bangkok, the Berkeley Hotel in London and Villa la Coste in Aix-en-Provence.\n\nBorn and based in Hong Kong and educated at Cambridge, his first big break was designing the Upper House in Hong Kong. He was named Designer of the Year by Maison & Objet Asia in 2016.\n\nMore: Holistic Wellness is the Perk Buyers Really Want, Says NYC Brokerage Chief\n\nHis 53rd Street apartment, which boasts southern and eastern exposures, and spans 2,039 square feet of living space, is his first foray into the North American market.\n\nRecently, Mr. Fu also launched the Andr\u00e9 Fu Living (AFL) lifestyle brand, a collection that features homewares and decorative accessories. The model apartment features furniture designed by him.\n\nHe spoke to us from his home in Hong Kong, covering topics such as culture\u2019s gravitational pull around the world, the increased value of design as a building\u2019s asset, and more.\n\nMore: Toronto Real Estate Investor Says Buyers Want Security\u2014Physical and Financial\u2014Above All Else\n\nMansion Global: Describe your dream property.\n\nAndre Fu: It depends on how macro we go, but you generally look for something that represents your personality, and reflects the lifestyle you lead. I like to take advantage of the lifestyle of the city and want my home to reflect the neighborhood. That\u2019s what I consider in the first place. Also, the quality of the space.\n\n\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nAF: It\u2019s actually a studio space that I\u2019m currently in right now. I was looking at buying it about five years ago, and I knew the purchaser who did. I\u2019ve ended up renting it for the last five years.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s in Central District in Hong Kong. It has a unique setting, because it\u2019s actually in a central area, but it\u2019s got a private garden.\n\nMore: London Real Estate Expert Says Multimillionaires Know to Make Moves Even in a Downturn\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nAF: With 53 West 53, I had been in discussion for a few years with Corcoran Sunshine to explore a means to collaborate, and the property came about. I find it very unique. There\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s at MoMa, and there\u2019s an art context to it. And the very unique architecture, and the diagrid inside the units itself. The architecture has a bold feel to it.\n\n\n\nBut when it comes to what luxury is, more broadly, I tend to go for the more intangible. It\u2019s the feeling you get when you walk into a home. It evokes an emotional connection with the person who\u2019s living it.\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nAF: For international buyers, there\u2019s a growing interest in art, and in modern art specifically, so whichever city or whichever location has prominent architecture or art. People gravitate toward culture.\n\nMore: Even Agents Are Surprised at the Deals They\u2019re Seeing in the Luxury Market, Says NYC Broker\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nAF: The role design plays in a luxury property tends to surprise me. It\u2019s not just in Manhattan, it\u2019s in other key cities as well. There are unique buildings going up by prominent architects and designers that can escalate and double what the building next to it fetches. That\u2019s purely because of the aspirational aspect of what design can bring to a property. It used to be just about the developer and the square meters. It\u2019s a really interesting fact, that design is being valued as an asset.\n\n\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nAF: I\u2019ve gotten to visit a lot of high-end buildings, and New York has some of the most high quality.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nAF: I live in a duplex, and it has a unique double-height ceiling. I live on the south side of the island; it has an incredible view of three beaches and bays, with a line of yachts outside.\n\nMore: Italian Architect Says a Building Should Be \u2018Timeless,\u2019 and an Apartment Should be Comfortable\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nAF: It exemplifies my personal taste, but if I have to put a few words to my design style, I\u2019d say my aesthetic embraces relaxed luxury. The main focus is the space and the views. I also have a small collection of artwork, proper lighting, beautiful parquet wood floors, and a fairly open plan.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nAF: Probably the art I\u2019ve collected, or some furniture prototypes I\u2019ve kept, which are sometimes very early projects. They remind me of what I\u2019ve done right and not so right.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in your home right now?\n\nAF: Probably health and fitness. A decent-sized pool, especially.\n\n\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a brand-new property versus a prime resale, which would you choose and why?\n\nAF: It depends on what it is and what it provokes in me, that\u2019s more important than whether it\u2019s first-hand or not.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-102605?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280"}
