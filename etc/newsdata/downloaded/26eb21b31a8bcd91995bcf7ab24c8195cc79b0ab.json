Vietnam and the Philippines also have competing claims on the reef.\n\n\"It's very likely that China will send an oil rig to drill in the area where the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had conducted seismic surveys in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone,\" Hop said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Khanh Vu; Editing by Paul Tait)", "description": "A Chinese oil survey vessel that has been embroiled in a tense standoff with Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea left Vietnamese-controlled waters on Thursday after more than three months, marine data showed.
