We are reaching out across religions and locations,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nOver the border in Syria, Whatsapp can be the difference between life and death.\n\nMustafa al-Hajj Younes, who heads a group of first responders in Idlib province, said civilians use group chats to appeal for help from rescue teams.\n\n\u201cWe coordinate on these groups whenever there is a need for our services,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatsApp is especially useful because of weak telecommunications infrastructure in areas under opposition control. \u201cPeople can only contact us through WhatsApp or cell phones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Most dangerous app\u2019 \u2013\n\nAcross the region, digital authoritarianism is increasing, with some governments regularly blocking popular social media applications including WhatsApp, especially its free calls feature.\n\nUsers in Gulf countries such as the United Arab Emirates cannot make internet calls without a proxy server. Messages deemed offensive in court have even landed some users in jail in the UAE.\n\nIt is a similar story in Morocco, where the government banned free voice over internet protocol (VoIP) calls in 2016.\n\nA 26-year-old Moroccan journalist who relies on the app to liaise with officials and sources told AFP it was a \u201cnational drama\u201d when the decision came into effect, provoking a swift public backlash.\n\nIn the wake of small-scale protests in Egypt, police have randomly stopped and frisked people to examine social media content on their phones.\n\nPolice arrested many on the spot after inspecting their mobiles, AFP witnessed in September.\n\nThat month, the attorney-general\u2019s office said prosecutors had orders to \u201cinspect the social media accounts and pages of those detained\u201d.\n\nIn Iraq, where nearly 200 people have died in protests during October, another battle is being waged online.\n\nWhen anti-corruption demonstrations broke out in many cities early this month, authorities cut internet services in an attempt to quell unrest \u2014 a tactic they have used in the past.\n\n\u201cWe consider Whatsapp to be the most dangerous application at this stage,\u201d a well-placed security source who preferred to remain anonymous told AFP.\n\n\u201cCutting the connection to WhatsApp was meant to prevent these gatherings from happening\u201d, he bluntly admitted.\n\nYasser al-Joubouri, an Iraqi activist who participated in the protests in Baghdad, said the app was crucial for forming activist groups to disseminate details about protests.\n\n\u201cWe created (WhatsApp) groups specifically to share information quickly and distribute it on social networks like Facebook and Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nThis sharing of information provokes an \u201cexistential fear\u201d for governments that were caught off-guard by the Arab Spring uprisings, said Adel Iskandar, a media studies professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada.\n\nBut governments also see that such apps could be beneficial, he added.\n\n\u201cThe state sees these platforms not merely as a threat but rather as an opportunity to supplant critical messages with supportive ones,\u201d Iskandar told AFP.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Making things easier\u2019 \u2013\n\nWith over 1.5 billion users worldwide, WhatsApp remains the most popular social media programme in terms of usage in the youthful, tech-savvy region, according to a recent survey by Northwestern University in Qatar.\n\nAside from sharing harrowing content and connecting protesters from turbulent hotspots via in-built encrypted messages, the app is also used for everyday conversations, like elsewhere in the world.\n\nJordanian officials, as well as other policymakers across the region, regularly communicate with journalists in groups broadcasting statements; they even give sensitive interviews on the freely available instant messaging service.\n\nJamila Sharaf, a mother-of-two from east Jerusalem, keeps up with activities for her children with the school\u2019s administration informing her and other parents in a group.\n\n\u201cThe application makes things easier and helps to spread information very quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Iran, officials banned the more secure app Telegram, saying it was used to fuel unrest during a wave of protests in January 2018.\n\nThis has driven many young people to Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Telegram has made me use WhatsApp more,\u201d said Ramin, a 26-year-old from Tehran.\n\nShe described the idea of taxing social media to plug budget shortfalls as \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would (be prepared to) help my government in that situation, but not by paying for something which is meant to be free.\u201d", "description": "Nicosia (AFP) \u2013 From organising mass protests in Baghdad and Beirut to coordinating rescue missions amid grinding conflict in Syria, WhatsApp has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/9b4a33_protesters-in-lebanon-are-whatsapp-organise-demonstrations-began-proposed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
