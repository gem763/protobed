That emergency House of Commons sitting, called by Johnson, will be held after a critical EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. It will coincide with a pro-referendum march through London, which organisers say a million people could join.\n\nOn Saturday the chances of Johnson securing a deal that will win the crucial support of the 10 DUP MPs appeared to be in growing doubt as Nigel Dodds, the party\u2019s leader in Westminster, questioned key elements of the proposed deal \u2013 including the idea of Northern Ireland being in some form of post-Brexit customs partnership with the EU.\n\n\u201cNorthern Ireland must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop,\u201d Dodds said. Asked if the ideas that are reportedly being discussed behind closed doors by the UK government and the EU could work, he added: \u201cNo, it cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union.\u201d\n\nFor Johnson to stand any chance of getting a deal through parliament, he will need the DUP to be firmly behind it. Many Tory MPs in the hardline pro-Brexit European Reform Group say they will take their lead from the DUP.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster\u2019s support for any Brexit deal will be crucial to the prime minister.

I have no doubt from soundings I have taken that an amendment to secure a confirmatory vote would be successful.\u201d\n\nPro-referendum MPs are also examining other possibilities including reviving May\u2019s deal and making that subject to a second referendum.\n\nNick Boles, the former Tory MP who quit over Brexit, said he would back any deal that the EU accepted but made clear that should no deal emerge from the EU council, a second referendum would be needed. \u201cI have been very reluctant to accept that a referendum might be necessary to break the logjam,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if Johnson is unable or unwilling to agree a deal with the EU next week, we will be left with no alternative. A snap election will resolve nothing and could prolong the agony.\n\n\u201cInstead we should hold a referendum which offers people the choice between a soft Brexit deal and remaining in the EU. Parliament should pass all the necessary legislation to implement the deal so, if people vote again to Leave, Brexit would happen immediately and require no further votes in parliament.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Keir Starmer says he will insist on a confirmatory vote. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian\n\nPaul Masterton, a Scottish Tory MP, said: \u201cMy instinct on this is the numbers are there for a second referendum if [Johnson] doesn\u2019t bring back a deal, but they aren\u2019t if he does.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told a conference on Saturday: \u201cIf Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal\u2026 then we will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote. If he can\u2019t \u2013 or I should say won\u2019t \u2013 get a deal \u2026 we will take whatever steps are necessary to prevent our country crashing out of the EU without a deal.\u201d\n\nIf Johnson has not secured a deal by 19 October, he is obliged under the Benn act to ask the EU for an extension to UK membership until 31 January. Starmer said Labour would ensure he complied with the law. \u201cI have heard some cabinet ministers suggest that Johnson could send a second letter to the EU saying he doesn\u2019t want an extension. That\u2019s the equivalent of attaching a Post-it note to divorce papers saying \u2018only kidding\u2019! It\u2019s a ridiculous idea. So, let me be clear: if no deal is secured by this time next week, Boris Johnson must seek and accept an extension.\u201d\n\nJohnson is expected to update the cabinet on Sunday afternoon. A Downing Street source said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted a deal. It is good to see progress but we will wait to see if this is a genuine breakthrough. We are a long way from a final deal. The weekend and next week remain critical to leaving with a deal on 31 October. We remain prepared to leave without a deal on 31 October.\u201d", "description": "DUP raises doubts on customs union, while Labour says it will whip MPs to support a second referendum", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3503636598014216857ffc94c23fc3fc4dd5a2f/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cfc3b580444e261fe1ca23b1f83fd97c", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
