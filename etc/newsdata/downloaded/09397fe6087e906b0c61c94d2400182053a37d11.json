Now, they\u2019re barred from the league for six months.\n\nThe students were expressing their support for Chung Ng Wai, who goes by Blitzchung in-game, for speaking out in support of Hong Kong protesters during an official tournament broadcast from Taiwan. Blizzard initially banned Chung from the league for a year but later reduced his sentence to six months, a decision many saw as too harsh and bowing to censorship pressure from Beijing.\n\nIn making the determination, Blizzard said the broadcasts need to be free from politics.\n\n\u201cOur official broadcast needs to be about the game and the competition, and to be a place where all are welcome,\u201d Blizzard spokesman Dustin Blackwell said in an email to the Daily Beast. \u201cIf we allow the introduction of personal views about sensitive issues into the channel, it ceases to be what it\u2019s meant for\u2014esports.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlitzchung\u2019s initial punishment was insane,\u201d Chambers told the Daily Beast. \u201cBoth of us getting punished is largely more equitable, though. I would say that us calling for a boycott of the company deserved more severe punishment than his because his was entirely human-rights-focused.\u201d\n\nBlizzard has been mired in controversy since banning Chung, which added fuel to the fire of the NBA\u2019s own imbroglio involving China. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns a stake in Blizzard, and the company generates a 12 percent of its revenue in the Chinese video game market.\n\nBlizzard issued a statement Friday saying that its relationship with China was \u201cnot a factor\u201d in its decision to ban Chung. The company\u2019s own employees had walked out of work October 9th to protest its treatment of the player.\n\nChambers told the Beast he\u2019d never play Hearthstone again.\n\n\u201c[Blizzard\u2019s] messaging Friday didn\u2019t apologize for the initial ban, which was far beyond the pale of what could be considered reasonable. There was no apology for that,\u201d he said.", "description": "One of the players told the Beast he\u2019d never play Blizzard's game again.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571258217/GettyImages-453599846_1_yibhqy", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
