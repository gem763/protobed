He reportedly had some money problems, which he kept from the family. He said his brother was probably just \"stressed\".\n\nMarius du Plessis, national spokesperson of Avbob, sympathised with Van Rooyen's family. Avbob employees were reportedly receiving counselling.\n\nTselanyane said the incident was being investigated.\n\nVan Rooyen was reportedly buried on Saturday.\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler\n\n*If you or anyone you know is suicidal, call the South African Depression and Anxiety Group's suicide crisis line on 0800 567 567.", "description": "A 38-year-old farmer took his own life in the parking lot of the Avbob funeral service in Schweizer-Reneke.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/9f9a91982ffc4e14ac6163a01c736703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
