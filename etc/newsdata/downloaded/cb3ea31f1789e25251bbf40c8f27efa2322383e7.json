Back in 1998, the Justice Department and 20 attorneys general targeted Microsoft in an antitrust suit that eventually settled in 2001.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know at the end of the day whether it matters whether (the scrutiny) is warranted. It\u2019s there,\u201d Smith said, in an interview this week with Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker. \u201cWhat we learned from our experience in the \u201890s was...we had to look in the mirror and get to the point where we could see what other people saw in us and begin to understand why they thought the concerns were justified.\u201d\n\nBrad Smith, Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer attends the 'Artificial Intelligence And Digital Skills' conference at Politecnico University on February 13, 2019 in Milan, Italy.

And we just have to come to terms with it.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got to be transparent about our principles\u2019\n\nSmith\u2019s book comes as tech companies that emerged on the back of Microsoft\u2019s antitrust case face a regulatory reckoning. Just this week, state attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia joined forces to launch an antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s dominance in advertising. That followed a separate antitrust investigation into Facebook, launched by New York Attorney General Letitia James and her counterparts in seven other states and the District of Columbia.\n\nWhile Microsoft has remained relatively unscathed from the backlash against tech so far, it hasn\u2019t been immune from criticism \u2014 especially from its own employees. Last year, the company was forced to respond to outrage over its contract with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after allegations the agency was using Microsoft\u2019s facial recognition technology to separate families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Smith says while the company provided email and Microsoft Office to ICE, it never green lighted the use of facial recognition technology, and chose not to terminate the contract out of concern \u201csome other company might step in\u201d and facilitate the \u201charmful use\u201d of the technology.\n\n\u201cWe think as a principle, it makes more sense for companies to be accountable to governments than for governments to be subject to the decisions of unelected companies,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Smith says the company has refused to provide facial recognition for use by a police force in California and a government overseas out of concern the technology would lead to bias, discrimination, and mass surveillance.\n\n\u201cI do fundamentally believe that we have to have a broader set of principles than just seeking every opportunity to make money. We\u2019ve got to be transparent about our principles,\u201d he said.\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
