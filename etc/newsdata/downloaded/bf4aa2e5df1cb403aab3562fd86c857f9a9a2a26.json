Todd Henry, a professor of modern Korean history at the University of San Diego\n\nDrag may still be a fringe subculture in South Korea, but the scene appears to be growing. The first Seoul Drag Parade, held last year, attracted over 1,000 participants, far surpassing the initial estimate of 100 people, according to the parade's co-organizer Ali Zahoor. Participation in pride events is also expanding, said Eun-oh Yang of the Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center.\n\nover \"Compared to the past, drag culture exists in more diverse forms for both men and women, and now we have drag queens performing on stage at (the annual) Queer Culture Festival,\" she said, referring to Korea's largest LGBTQ festival, which attractedover 150,000 participants this year. \"I think it's being established as (part of) popular culture.\"\n\nDrag as a release\n\nLike drag queens around the world, Hurricane Kimchi uses performance to express himself and to break \"the stereotypes and get rid of toxic masculinity,\" he said.\n\nCo-organizer of the Seoul Drag Parade, Ali Zahoor, said there are also uniquely Korean reasons for the growth of Seoul's drag scene -- including the \"anxiety\" caused by the threat of war.\n\n\"North Korea's right there ... We are not scared, or we're not thinking about it too much, but it is in the back (of our minds),\" he said. \"Everyone's a little bit anxious all the time (and) I think that's where subcultures emerge.\"\n\n\"Korean society, as you can imagine, is crazy stressful,\" Zahoor added. \"Working hours are so long, kids have to study until really late at night and there's a need for an escape. (Drag) is a way of getting away from what you usually do, having fun and showing off what you are good at.\"\n\nGender-fluid drag queen and YouTuber, Serena 303 , uses K-pop and '70s fashion models as inspiration for her looks, which includes a transparent plastic dress paired with a pink visor. Her videos, in which she offers makeup tutorials and shares what it's like to be in drag, are designed to empower those still figuring out their identities.\n\n\"I want to tell them that it's OK to be who you are, and show them that someone like me can do drag,\" she said. \"The most important thing is that people are going to love you.\"\n\nFor Seoul-based \"drag king\" and English teacher, Jaxter the Taco Master, drag is both an anti-depressant and a play on gender. She is virtually unrecognizable on stage, with smoky eyes and her face entirely covered in gold glitter.\n\n\"Gender is a social construct (and) I can be both masculine and feminine whenever I want,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not just what other people want me to be.\"\n\n'Don't ask, don't tell'\n\nThere remains a pervasive \"don't ask, don't tell\" attitude towards gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ communities in South Korea. Hurricane Kimchi, who uses public transport to travel to his weekly show, said that no one dares look at him during the 30-minute journey.\n\n\"People might think and judge, but they wouldn't say anything out loud,\" he said. \"Even when I walk around with my drag makeup, people don't even look at you, they don't really do or say anything.\"\n\nHurricane Kimchi putting on makeup before a drag show at Alley Bunker in the Itaewon district of Seoul.

Homosexuality remains illegal in the military where it is punishable by up to two years in prison.In 2014, South Korea's National Institute of Korean language reverted its 2012 decision to make the word 'love' gender-neutral after complaints from religious groups. It now defines love as a feeling of affection \"between man and woman.\"\n\nWhether you are gay, lesbian or transgender, living as a sexual minority in Korea is very difficult. Eun-oh Yang, Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center\n\n\"(The) LGBT population will be labeled as going against the Bible (or) going against Confucian tradition and parental values,\" said Henry, the history professor. \"There are even arguments made that gay and lesbian (people) are pro-North Koreans, that they are kind of traitors to their nation.\"\n\nSerena 303 said she faced protests from conservative Christians during the Seoul pride parade last year. \"They would say 'You're gay, you're going to die,' and 'Think of your parents,'\" she recalled.\n\nAnti same-sex marriage activists attend a rally next to the Seoul Queer Culture Festival in June 2019.

Hurricane Kimchi said the arrival of Netflix in South Korea in 2016, which brought shows like \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" exposed many people to drag culture for the first time.\n\nThe internet is also taking drag culture out of the clubs and into the bedrooms of young South Koreans.\n\n\"Before the internet, the drag world would have been confined to the physical space of the club,\" Henry said. \"Now with the internet and Youtube, you can kind of fashion yourself and your style and persona, and you can communicate with other people virtually. That's a really interesting phenomenon.\"\n\nAnd it's having a wider impact on South Korea's LGBTQ community. Parades, events and shows all help to bring drag to a broader audience, Hurricane Kimchi said.\n\nParticipants attend the Seoul Queer Culture Festival on June 1, 2019.
