a rare medical condition where a fallopian tube is blocked with a watery fluid.\n\nIn Callie's case, her damaged left fallopian tube was leaking fluid into her uterus, preventing any embryos from implanting properly and ending the pregnancy.\n\nThe care assistant from Sheerness, Kent, chose to have her damaged tube removed in the hopes of improving her fertility, and amazingly, she fell pregnant just two weeks later.\n\n(Image: Callie Hayes /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Callie Hayes /SWNS.COM)\n\nNow a happy mum to cheeky little Teddy, Callie is speaking out about her experience to raise awareness of her condition.\n\nCallie said: \"Hearing that I had this condition that I'd never heard of before was absolutely terrifying.\n\n\"After two miscarriages and a failed round of IVF, it was also a bit of a relief to finally have an answer for why I'd been struggling to fall pregnant for three years.\n\n\"Doctors described it to me as if the liquid had been giving my uterus an acid bath every month, so I'd been essentially poisoning my unborn babies by accident.\n\n\"I was heartbroken, and although there was no guarantee I'd be able to fall pregnant after the tube was removed, I had to give anything possible a try.\n\n\"I had the surgery, and within just two weeks, I was pregnant, and now I'm finally a mum to a gorgeous and healthy little boy.\"\n\nCallie first started trying for a baby back in February 2015 after falling in love with her partner Ben Hayes, 28, when they met at a nightclub.\n\nWithin three months of meeting, the young couple were engaged and yet their baby dreams were not coming true.\n\n(Image: Callie Hayes /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Callie Hayes /SWNS.COM)\n\nFinally in June 2017, Callie discovered she was pregnant, but their joy was short-lived when she miscarried five weeks later.\n\nShe soon found out she was pregnant again in August 2017 but had a second miscarriage at five weeks, just six weeks before her wedding day.\n\nShe said: \"I've always wanted to become a mum, and when I met Ben, we both decided to start trying straight away.\n\n\"We were over the moon when I fell pregnant, but then to go through two miscarriages in three months was absolutely devastating, and especially just before our wedding.\n\n\"It was so hard to prepare everything that needed to be done when all I wanted to do was lay in bed and not face anyone or anything.\n\n\"I thought about my second miscarriage constantly on my wedding day as we had actually planned to announce the pregnancy at our wedding.\n\n\"It was so difficult to make it through the day without getting upset, and without constantly thinking about how I should be pregnant.\"\n\n(Image: Callie Hayes /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Callie Hayes /SWNS.COM)\n\nAfter three years of struggle, Callie and husband Ben decided to try IVF in August 2018 but the treatment was unsuccessful.\n\nMost sufferers of hydrosalpinx have no symptoms and only discover they have the condition after several unsuccessful pregnancies.\n\nWith Callie still hoping to fall pregnant, she was offered two treatment options - clipping the damaged tube, or having it removed altogether.\n\nCallie said: \"I could have had my left fallopian tube clipped, but it wasn't definite that it would work and the poisonous liquid could still leak into my uterus.\n\n\"The only way to stop the liquid completely was to remove the damaged tube altogether, which would obviously reduce my chances of falling pregnant.\n\n\"I was terrified I might never get my dream baby, but there was a glimmer of hope and I just had to grab it and pray.\"\n\nCallie underwent a gynaecological laparoscopy and left salpingectomy in August 2018.\n\nSurgeons found her tube had swollen to almost 10 times its normal size.\n\nTerrified of another miscarriage, Callie had extra scans throughout her pregnancy but slowly the nine months passed by and she eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy on May 27.\n\nShe said: \"I'm so glad I had surgery to remove the tube, because within two weeks, I was pregnant with our gorgeous little boy.\n\n\"Teddy is our miracle baby, and he's just the most wonderful little man, and always making us laugh with his cheeky smile.\n\n\"Ben was my rock throughout it all, and I'm just so happy that we finally have our little family that we've been fighting for for so long.\n\n\"I thought my diagnosis meant my dreams of becoming a mum were over, but now Teddy is here and Ben and I are the happiest we've ever been.\"", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES Callie Hayes' fallopian tube had swollen to 10 times its normal size", "authors": ["Charlotte Penketh-King", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Callie Hayes", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590434.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_TUBE_LEAK_008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
