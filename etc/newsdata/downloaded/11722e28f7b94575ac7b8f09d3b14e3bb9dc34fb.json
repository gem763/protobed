There were more Republican holdouts on these two votes than there were Democratic ones, after all, including a very notable \u201cnay\u201d on each from Greg Pence, brother of Mike. You can see the full roll on the Armenian genocide resolution here and the roll on the bill sanctioning Turkey for invading northern Syria here. The only Republicans besides Pence to vote no on both were Jim Baird and Tom Cole. I won\u2019t pretend to know why Cole did it, but Baird, like Pence, is from Indiana. Maybe he chose to do the VP, a fellow Hoosier, a favor after his big diplomatic trip to Ankara earlier this month by opposing accountability for Turkey.\n\nOmar is the most interesting case, though, since you\u2019d expect support from Democratic members for Democratic resolutions, particularly when the rest of the caucus overwhelmingly backs those resolutions. The only Democrat besides Omar not to vote yes on one of these two bills was Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who voted present on the Armenian genocide resolution but voted with nearly everyone else on sanctioning Turkey over the Kurds. AOC voted yes on both. So did Rashida Tlaib. So did Ayanna Pressley, the fourth member of \u201cthe Squad.\u201d Only Ilhan Omar, curiously, balked at both.\n\nHow come?\n\nOmar\u2019s office has sent this statement to CNN explaining her present vote: pic.twitter.com/Gpj198jx0p \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 29, 2019\n\nWe can\u2019t condemn Turkey until we apologize to Native Americans?\n\n\u201cIlhan Omar all-lives-mattered the Armenian genocide,\u201d tweeted Illinois prof Nicholas Grossman after reading her statement.\n\nAnd what\u2019s that bit about \u201cacademic consensus\u201d? Which notable genocides does Ilhan Omar believe the jury is still out on? She\u2019s been outspoken in the past in denouncing American genocide. Suddenly, today, she\u2019s much more circumspect.\n\nRemember too that Omar is a champion of the BDS movement. If she\u2019s serious in her belief that we shouldn\u2019t single out a particular example of alleged oppression when there are so many other examples we\u2019ve yet to condemn, it\u2019s strange to find her eager to punish Israel while overlooking far worse human-rights offenders. That\u2019s been a core conservative criticism of her on foreign policy, in fact: Why Israel instead of China, say? Or North Korea? Omar\u2019s inconsistency on when it it and isn\u2019t okay to name and shame particular bad guys is \u2026 curious.\n\nAnyway. Today\u2019s resolutions will complicate life for both Erdogan and for Trump, which of course was very much the point on the Democratic side:\n\nWith [their attack on the Kurds], Turkey lost its already wavering support on Capitol Hill, and the dam burst with a flow of proposed sanctions, which also were approved by the House on Tuesday, and new momentum behind the long-stalled effort to officially recognize the Armenian genocide. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) smiled, pausing for five seconds and shrugging her shoulders, when asked if Trump\u2019s move had eased the way toward recognizing the genocide. \u201cThere was just an aura of what the Turks could be doing, is engaged again in genocide, by the greenlight that the president gave them. So that was sort of a callback,\u201d Pelosi said Tuesday\u2026 The diplomats from Foggy Bottom did not bother to register their traditional strong opposition with [Foreign Affairs chairman Eliot] Engel. \u201cNo one\u2019s called me, no one\u2019s called me. I think maybe they knew that I wouldn\u2019t be influenced by it,\u201d he said.\n\nExit question: Is the Senate going to pass the Armenian genocide resolution? The WSJ remembers that Turkey recalled its ambassador to the U.S. in both 2007 and 2010 simply because Congress had passed similar resolutions *at the committee level.* Imagine if this one makes it through the Senate too and suddenly lands on Trump\u2019s desk, with Erdogan screaming God knows what at him on the phone to convince him not to do it. Watching POTUS figure out whether to sign it will make for a very special episode of \u201cPresident Trump.\u201d", "description": "All genocides matter.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/o-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
