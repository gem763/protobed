Just hours later, Democratic leaders announced they will vote Thursday on legislation outlining the next phases of the process, to consist of public hearings as they weigh whether to introduce articles of impeachment.\n\nYet Kupperman\u2019s strategy to seek court authorization before participating in the probe could prove to be a model for future witnesses, both public and private, stirring new doubts about which Trump officials will appear on Capitol Hill as the proceedings evolve.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe wish list for Democrats features a number of other political figures \u2014 including Bolton \u2014 who may opt for Kupperman\u2019s tactic of refusing to cooperate pending court action. Both Kupperman and Bolton share the same counsel, Charles Cooper, who declined to comment on whether Bolton will adopt the same strategy when asked to testify.\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies, who have long accused Democrats of conducting a closed-door \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d cheered Kupperman\u2019s strategy, framing it as the proper way to resolve the standoff between Democrats issuing witness subpoenas and a White House trying to block testimony, citing executive privilege.\n\n\u201cIf the court says he has to come, he\u2019s more than willing to come,\u201d Rep.

Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff: Barr 'weaponizing' DOJ 'to go after the president's enemies' Top Trump administration officials hail al-Baghdadi raid but stress need for resolve in fighting ISIS Schiff: 'Bolton is a very important witness' MORE (D-Calif.), who is leading the impeachment inquiry as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he\u2019s hopeful that invited witnesses will follow in the mold of the nine officials who have already testified \u2014 most of them under subpoena \u2014 in the five-week-old probe.\n\n\u201cI have more confidence in the witnesses that we\u2019ve invited to appear, and were subpoenaed to appear, that they will perform as the nine witnesses that have gone before have,\u201d Schiff told reporters in the Capitol.\n\nStill, he threatened to charge Kupperman with contempt for defying the subpoena \u2014 an unsubtle warning shot to others who don\u2019t comply \u2014 and acknowledged that future witnesses will be under pressure from the White House not to participate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what other senior officials will do. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get like instructions from the White House,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nDemocrats have made clear they\u2019ll consider any stonewalling to be a tacit admission of presidential wrongdoing. But they\u2019re also facing the difficult task of producing evidence damning enough to convince Trump\u2019s GOP allies in the Senate that he\u2019s committed impeachable offenses, an undertaking made only more difficult if witnesses \u2014 particularly political appointees close to key Ukraine events \u2014 refuse to cooperate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere are other witnesses that are scheduled to come this week before us, who are going to provide hopefully even more testimony to flesh out the full extent of what happened with regard to the Ukraine, as well as who was involved and who directed it,\u201d Rep.

That list includes career officials like Tim Morrison, who took over Fiona Hill\u2019s role as the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council; Kathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs; and State Department Ukraine experts Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson.\n\n\u201cI believe they are all scheduled to appear. And obviously, we\u2019ll be here to ask questions and get answers,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nAs the parties sparred over the merits of Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit, Kupperman himself weighed in, arguing it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d to want legal clarity.\n\n\u201cGiven the issue of separation of powers in this matter, it would be reasonable and appropriate to expect that all parties would want judicial clarity,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nStill, it\u2019s unclear how quickly the court will rule on Kupperman\u2019s case \u2014 an uncertainty that comes as Democrats are hoping to soon begin the public phase of their impeachment inquiry. With that in mind, Democrats said they won\u2019t allow any legal battles to hinder their investigative efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts, so we press forward,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nKupperman\u2019s lawsuit last week came shortly after Democrats won a resounding victory in a separate legal battle, in which a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are justified in seeking to obtain grand jury materials related to former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerGowdy: I '100 percent' still believe public congressional hearings are 'a circus' Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' Fox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' MORE\u2019s 448-page report into Russia\u2019s election interference and possible obstruction by Trump.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, pointed to Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as the justifiable reason, a ruling that further legitimized the probe into Trump\u2019s actions amid GOP claims that the investigation was a political charade rather than a legitimate inquiry.\n\nAnd Howell\u2019s ruling, which the Justice Department says it plans to appeal, comes as Democrats are primarily focused on efforts by Trump and his associates to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into opening a corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nDemocrats say other witnesses \u2014 primarily career civil servants \u2014 have backed up a government whistleblower\u2019s charge that Trump also threatened to withhold nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine if Zelensky failed to comply.\n\nIn their next phase, which will feature open hearings in lieu of closed-door depositions, they hope to convince the public that was the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural next step in the investigation,\u201d Rep.
