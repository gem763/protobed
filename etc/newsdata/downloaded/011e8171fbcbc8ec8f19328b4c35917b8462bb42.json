(Stringer/Reuters)\n\nThe league says it won\u2019t compromise on its values, even as it makes clear that it has none.\n\nThe NBA says it won\u2019t compromise on its values, even as the league makes it clear it has none.\n\nAs you\u2019ve no doubt heard, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for the protesters in Hong Kong. Almost instantly, the Chinese government and Chinese businesses erupted in outrage. The NBA, the Rockets, Morey, and various players rushed to apologize or express regret for offending millions of Chinese basketball fans. The NBA\u2019s statement, particularly the Chinese version, was loathsome in its obsequious groveling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few days later, NBA commissioner Adam Silver held a press conference in Tokyo, hoping to put out the firestorm. Responding to China\u2019s cancellation of some NBA exhibition games in protest, Silver seemed like he was standing his ground.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Silver said of the canceled games. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important we adhere to those values. . . . We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nSilver did express regret, however, that so many in China, including \u201cmillions and millions of our fans\u201d were \u201cupset.\u201d He said that while he wasn\u2019t endorsing what Morey tweeted, he would defend Morey\u2019s right to tweet it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the tweet remains deleted.\n\nDays later, fans carrying pro\u2013Hong Kong signs were ejected from an NBA exhibition game in Philadelphia. At a Washington Wizards game, pro\u2013Hong Kong signs were confiscated by security. American reporters have been told they couldn\u2019t ask players about the China controversy. A CNN reporter was instructed: \u201cBasketball questions only\u201d when she tried to talk to two Rockets players. The league later apologized, which it seems to be getting good at.\n\nIn other words, the NBA is eager to seem as if it\u2019s in favor of free expression while curtailing expression as much as possible. The strategy has had some success. A CNN headline declared, \u201cNBA chief Adam Silver says profit can\u2019t come before the league\u2019s principles,\u201d and was accurate to the extent that it\u2019s sort of what Silver said. It\u2019s not clear it\u2019s what he believes.\n\nThe mere fact that this controversy has become about free expression is a victory for the NBA. Saying, in effect, \u201cI disagree with what you say, but I\u2019ll defend to the death your right to say it,\u201d has always been a popular way for cowards to seem brave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that free expression is just one of the values the NBA claims to stand for. In Silver\u2019s statement, he waxed poetic about the principle the league is famous for marketing to the world: diversity. \u201cOne of the enduring strengths of the NBA is our diversity \u2014 of views, backgrounds, ethnicities, genders and religions,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s great. But the Chinese government has herded more than a million Muslim Uyghurs into \u201cre-education camps\u201d while paving over their cemeteries and tearing down their mosques. The same league that pulled its all-star game out of Charlotte, N.C., over a contentious transgender bathroom law has no problem partnering with a country that fights diversity at the point of a gun.\n\nAs first reported in Slate, the NBA even has a training facility in Urumqi, the capital of Xianjing, the epicenter of China\u2019s cultural genocide project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina\u2019s lack of commitment to diversity and equality doesn\u2019t end there. The country essentially practices Jim Crow with Chinese characteristics, as Chairman Mao might have said. If you aren\u2019t ethnic Han, or if you don\u2019t speak Mandarin, you\u2019re a second-class citizen with little to no access to certain jobs and universities.\n\nWhat Silver doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 or deliberately ignores \u2014 is that free expression isn\u2019t a standalone value. It\u2019s part of a larger whole, which includes democracy, the rule of law, and the full suite of human rights. China opposes the whole package. Or, to be more accurate, the Chinese government does. Which is why it\u2019s against freedom in Hong Kong.\n\nIt\u2019s clever for Silver to talk about not wanting to offend \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of Chinese fans. That plays well to the ears of woke Americans who think offending people tests the limits of free speech. But Twitter is blocked in China, which means none of those fans saw the tweet in the first place.\n\nWhat they did see was the orchestrated propaganda campaign from the Chinese government and its rich clients \u2014 a group that includes the NBA.", "description": "What NBA commissioner Adam Silver doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 or deliberately ignores \u2014 is that free expression isn\u2019t a standalone value.
