The New York Times reported Thursday that the administration is also considering ways to increase financial scrutiny of Chinese companies on various fronts.\n\nThat could happen through shifts toward increasingly severe \u2014 or even criminal \u2014 punishments for financial disclosure violations and broader criteria for a company to be blacklisted, according to the Times. Other proposals outlined in a circulated memo on the plan, which was drafted by informal White House adviser Michael Pillsbury, aim to restrict capital flows within and outside of mainland China.\n\nPillsbury and the White House press office did not offer comment on the matter Thursday. When asked about the plan to broaden and tighten financial rules for Chinese companies, a Commerce Department spokesperson said there were \"no announcements to make at this time.\"\n\nSuch measures would be seen as a significant economic escalation from the US, which has so far used tariffs as its main source of leverage in its dispute with China. The two sides have levied tariffs on thousands of each other's products and vowed to raise them further next week and in December.\n\nRead more: China is reportedly open to a partial trade deal with the US \u2014 but only if Trump scales back planned tariffs\n\nBloomberg first reported on the potential US proposal to restrict portfolio flows into China, which was publicly disputed by the Trump administration but has been confirmed by several news outlets including Business Insider.\n\nEarly on Thursday, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin began a thirteenth round of economic negotiations with a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He. The two sides have struggled since early 2018 to forge any concrete compromises on structural issues, such as technology and intellectual property rules.\n\nTrump announced that he would also meet with Liu on Friday, lifting optimism toward the discussions after a disputed report that China could leave earlier than planned. In public statements, the president has regularly shifted between a willingness to reach a deal with China and the possibility of a prolonged dispute.\n\n\"Big day of negotiations with China,\" the president wrote on Twitter. \"They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.\"\n\nNow read: The world's most accurate economic forecaster sees a 'prolonged global slowdown' on the horizon \u2014 and warns it can only be narrowly avoided", "description": "The Trump administration has continued to weigh a range of additional punitive measures it could take against the Chinese economy.
