There are fortunes to be made, but also scammers and thieves ready to take advantage of the unprepared.\n\nBut as the world enters its second decade with crypto, traditional financial services and mainstream businesses have been examining how they can get in on it, and regulators have also taken note. As the market continues to evolve, here are five things to know about cryptocurrency:\n\nHow it works\n\nCryptocurrencies rely on a technology called blockchain, which is an open database of every transaction that verifies the security of transactions.\n\nFor Bitcoin, each \u201cblock\u201d contains numerous transactions, and they are added to the blockchain by computers doing complex mathematical equations, a process called \u201cmining.\u201d The miners are then provided Bitcoin as transaction fees for the service.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin rewarded to miners decreases by half for every 210,000 blocks confirmed, and there\u2019s a maximum amount of potential Bitcoin: 21 million. The ability to create Bitcoin will stop in the year 2140, when the supply reaches that limit.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are tied to other systems. Some are even connected to physical assets like gold. Popular cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin include Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and XRP.\n\nPeople store their cryptocurrencies in a \u201cwallet,\u201d an app that contains the mathematical signature proving ownership of the currency.\n\nCryptocurrencies can be bought and sold on exchanges. Popular ones include Coinbase, Binance and Gemini. Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, has announced plans to launch a crypto exchange called Bakkt.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first - and to date - most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, went live on Jan. 3, 2009. It was created by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto, who may actually be several people using a pseudonym. The first 50 Bitcoin were mined that day.\n\nBitcoinmarket.com, the first Bitcoin exchange, opened in March of 2010. Others soon followed.\n\nOn May 22, 2010, a man paid 10,000 Bitcoin to someone who ordered two pizzas for him from Papa John\u2019s. As the market value of Bitcoin later skyrocketed, that Bitcoin would be worth millions of dollars.\n\nNamecoin, the first alternative cryptocurrency \u2014 called an \u201caltcoin\u201d \u2014 was launched on April 18, 2011.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market price hit $10,000 per coin for the first time on Nov. 28, 2017. It peaked less than a month later at its all-time high price of $19,783.21.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIn June of 2019, Facebook announced that it planned to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra.\n\nWhat\u2019s it worth?\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate widely. Bitcoin\u2019s price has previously dropped about $1,000 in a single day.\n\nBitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency and has the highest market capitalization \u2014 calculated by the number of currently available currency and the price. Other cryptocurrencies range in price from a few hundred dollars per \u201ccoin\u201d to a fraction of a cent.\n\nExchanges like Coinbase keep track of the prices of various cryptocurrencies and provide a platform for trading them.\n\nIs it legal?\n\nThe short answer is, \u201cYes.\u201d But illegal activity can still be tied to crypto.\n\nThe IRS has treated cryptocurrencies as property for tax purposes since 2014. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission defines virtual currencies as commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission says offers and sales of digital assets were subject to federal law.\n\nIn April of 2019, the SEC issued its framework on digital currencies that fall under the category of a \u201csecurity.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has recently announced several cases of litigation related to cryptocurrencies:\n\nIn May, authorities filed civil action against a California man who they said disguised a pyramid scheme behind digital assets.\n\nProsecutors charged the CEO of a cryptocurrency company with fraudulently distributing shares in order to meet Nasdaq listing criteria.\n\nA Russia-based website that had claimed to provide independent ratings of initial coin offerings settled with the SEC after officials said the site had actually been taking payments from the groups whose coins it was rating.\n\nThe SEC filed charges in August against a Dallas-based company and its founders who it accused of defrauding investors out of millions with unregistered offerings on an unregistered exchange.\n\nIn September, officials sued another company and its founder for allegedly selling millions of dollars\u2019 worth of coins in an unregistered offering.\n\nHot issues\n\nCryptocurrencies are a rapidly evolving field.\n\nOne exchange, Mt. Gox, was shuttered after it \u201clost\u201d hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin and went bankrupt. In May, the exchange Binance said hackers stole thousands of Bitcoin worth millions of dollars.\n\nSome lawmakers are eager to add additional regulations, just as more traditional businesses \u2014 like Facebook with its Libra \u2014 are looking to get into the market.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in early September that Libra will need to be held to a high standard.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cLibra would have to be held to the highest regulatory standards and supervisory expectations,\u201d he said.", "description": "Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, launched just over a decade ago.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/3d3b5861-bitcoin-venezuela.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
