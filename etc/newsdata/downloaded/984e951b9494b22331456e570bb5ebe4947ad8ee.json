The car's reverse gear didn't work, but no one seemed to mind. (Gerald Baughman)\n\nColumnist\n\nWhat is a \u201ccar guy\u201d? Well, for starters, he needn\u2019t be a guy, so let\u2019s modify the term to \u201ccar lover.\u201d A car lover is someone who believes a car can be more than a mere collection of parts, that a car can be imbued with something like a soul and that the bond we create with a car can be sacred.\n\nA car lover has a car they\u2019d never sell, or had a car they still regret selling, or had a car they sold because they knew it deserved an owner who would drive it more.\n\nFor the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been sharing stories from car lovers. Here are a few more.\n\nIn 1960, Gerald Baughman worked as a \u201cgofer\u201d at an appliance store in West Virginia. He scrimped and saved his meager salary until he had enough to buy a two-year-old Chevy Impala.\n\n\u201cI had so little money left for repairs that I once had to drive for six months without the reverse gear I broke during a moonshine-fueled incident,\u201d wrote Gerald, of Fairfax, Va. \u201cThe experience taught me to plan ahead but also required me to humbly ask my girlfriend, Norma, and her mother and father to help me push the car backward whenever I needed to turn around at her house.\u201d\n\nYou might think that would sour Norma\u2019s family on the young man with the busted Chevy, but \u201cthey accepted me into the family anyway and it led to our happy marriage through many cars and 55 years so far.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn college, Bob Calo drove a 1976 Toyota Celica GT. His wife, Mary, bought a similar model on eBay in 2017. The flames are staying. (Bob Calo)\n\nWhen Bob Calo met his future wife, Mary, at Mount St. Mary\u2019s College in the early 1980s, his ride was a lurid green family hand-me-down 1976 Toyota Celica GT.\n\nWrote Bob, of Frederick, Md.: \u201cIt never let me down, from parking on M Street on a Friday night in a space exactly the length of the car \u2014 with the help of another healthy male you could slide the rear of the car into the spot \u2014 or making it from Wildwood, N.J., to Rockville on half-a-tank of gas, with just enough change for tolls. I loved that car.\u201d\n\nIn 1994, Bob sold the car to a friend who promised to take care of it. Years later, the confession came that it was wrecked barely a month later, but no one had the heart to tell Bob.\n\nFast forward 23 years and Mary was absent-mindedly skimming eBay for 1976 Celicas. One popped up in Choctaw, Okla., its hood and fenders adorned with flames. Just for fun, Bob and Mary put it on their watch list.\n\nOn the last day of the sale, the car was at $3,200. Bob coaxed Mary into trying to get the mystery bidder to up his ante.\n\n\u201cShe bid $3,300 from her iPad with wine in hand,\u201d Bob wrote.\n\nWithin a minute, the mystery bidder upped it to $3,400.\n\n\u201cWith bidding ending in 30 minutes, she was sure we could get him to pay more, so $3,500 it went.\u201d\n\nThe mystery bidder dropped out. As the clock ticked down, Mary frantically jabbed at the backspace/undo/delete keys.\n\n\u201cIn my best Johnny Gilbert game show voice I proclaimed \u2018Congratulations, you won a CAAARRRR!!!!\u201d wrote Bob.\n\nWhen the Toyota arrived, Bob was amazed at how little rust it had.\n\n\u201cI could not be happier with my \u2018new\u2019 Celica,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, yes, the flames are staying.\u201d\n\nThey gave the Celica a nickname: El Fuego, the fire.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Eric Briggs was a Navy pilot flying photo reconnaissance missions over Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nWhen safely back aboard his aircraft carrier, Eric would peruse catalogues from Nemet Auto International, which advertised mail-order cars to servicemen. He\u2019d ponder how to spend his flight and combat pay. Eric\u2019s internal debate came down to German or Italian: a BMW 3.0 CS coupe or a Ferrari 246 Dino.\n\nAt the time, the Ferrari was barely $1,000 more expensive than the BMW. In the end, the BMW is what Eric chose, a decision based entirely on pictures and articles in magazines. He\u2019d never seen or driven either car.\n\nEric collected his BMW in Florida. The reaction among his squadron mates at Naval Air Station Albany in Georgia was underwhelming. Most couldn\u2019t believe Eric hadn\u2019t picked a less-expensive American equivalent, like a Mustang, Camaro or Challenger. A favorite put-down was: \u201cFor the money you paid, you could have bought a Corvette.\u201d\n\nEric, of Arlington, Va., never regretted his decision. He still has the 3.0 CS, used almost daily with 286,000 miles on it. It\u2019s a pricey, desirable classic today, though the Ferrari that Eric passed on has appreciated many tens of thousands of dollars more.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Eric spotted a red Ferrari 246 Dino in the Southern California auto museum he was touring with his daughter. He told her of the debate he\u2019d had long ago about which car to choose.\n\nHer reaction? \u201cWere you crazy?\u201d\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Who needs reverse gear when your girlfriend will help you push your Impala around?", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/orfais9RXt-W4oi5PJe_bI5Djz8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VAQRFDGNSMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
