The legislation has since been scrapped, but the protests have morphed into pro-democracy demonstrations opposing encroachment by China.", "description": "Charles Barkley didn't hold back in his criticism of Mike Pence.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db30af4dee0192194657d3f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
