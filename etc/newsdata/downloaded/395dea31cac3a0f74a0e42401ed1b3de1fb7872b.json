It was swollen.\n\nThat was just the beginning of the injuries Ross says she surveyed in horror last Friday at the VA hospital in Georgia. A photo shows 74-year-old Joel Marrable\u2019s shirt pulled up to reveal the red bumps clustered on his stomach \u2014 evidence of more than 100 bites from the ants that filled his room in a veterans\u2019 nursing home, his daughter told local news station WSB-TV.\n\n\u201cThe ceiling, the walls, the beds. They were everywhere,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRoss claimed that hospital staff told her they thought their patient died when they found him covered in the insects days earlier, according to WSB-TV.\n\nWithin a day of Ross\u2019s visit \u2014 she had just gotten back from a trip, she says \u2014 he had.\n\nRoss, who says her father served in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, told WSB-TV that Marrable \u201cdeserved better\u201d than what he got in his final days at Eagle\u2019s Nest Community Living Center, part of Atlanta VA Medical Center in Decatur, Ga.\n\n\u201cI understand mistakes happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had ants. But he was bit by ants two days in row. They feasted on him.\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta VA Health Care System, which did not respond to questions from The Washington Post on Thursday, said in a statement to news outlets that leadership is aware of the ant issue and that the staff \u201cimmediately cared for the Veterans and took action to ensure no other CLC residents were impacted.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, a pest control company assessed the problem Sept. 9, two days after Ross says Marrable died. Pest control staff are monitoring rooms daily, and a regional VA expert will visit by Friday.\n\nAll bedrooms have been stripped, inspected and cleaned, VA said, and open containers and food have been removed.\n\n\u201cWe would like to express our heartfelt remorse and apology to the Veterans\u2019 families and have reached out to them to offer appropriate assistance,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe Post was not immediately able to reach Ross, who told the New York Daily News that hospital staff said they \u201cjumped into action\u201d after discovering ants on Marrable, showering him while covering his nose so he could breathe. But the ant problem apparently was not resolved, Ross claims, and she pressed hospital administrators last week to put her father in a new room.\n\nHe died hours after the overnight move at the VA facility where he had spent 14 months, she said.\n\n[Officials are investigating 11 suspicious deaths at a VA hospital. Two have been ruled homicides.]\n\nMarrable\u2019s health had long been fragile, she said, adding that he was \u201cat peace with dying,\u201d the Daily News reported.\n\n\u201cWe made a bucket list and went to the Bahamas and laughed and joked up until the end,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the episode left Ross questioning VA health facilities\u2019 ability to handle their many patients, the Daily News reported. Her concerns follow years of scandals that have raised alarms about VA\u2019s standards. A 2016 report found hundreds of patients died waiting for care at a VA hospital in Phoenix that tried to cover up the delays. More recently, Veterans Affairs has come under fire for widespread staffing vacancies and suspect deaths prompting a federal probe in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cI know the staff, without a shadow of doubt, respected my dad and even loved him,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut what\u2019s their ability to assess situations and fix things?\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat we know about the mysterious vaping-linked illness and deaths\n\nAll crew members were asleep when deadly California boat fire erupted, government report says\n\nWatched by millions, \u2018vape influencers\u2019 worry they will become collateral damage in Trump\u2019s new ban", "description": "\u201cThe ceiling, the walls, the beds.
