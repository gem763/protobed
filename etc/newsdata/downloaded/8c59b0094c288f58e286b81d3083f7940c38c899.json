It was co-written by the retired University of Minnesota Duluth professor James Fetzer and Mike Palacek. In it, the authors claim that the Sandy Hook massacre never actually happened and that the event was actually an elaborate ruse spearheaded by the federal government under President Obama in order to justify rolling in strict new gun control legislation.\n\nIn a statement provided to Insider, Pozner said he believed the court's decision could set an example and dissuade other hoaxers from harassing families.\n\n\"This sends a message to hoaxers and conspiracy theorists and others who seek to use the internet to victimize and terrorize vulnerable people, that their actions have consequences,\" Pozner said. \"When you defame people online, that has consequences.\"\n\nThe author falsely claimed Pozner had created a fake death certificate for his son\n\nOne of the children singled out in the book was Noah Pozner, a 6-year-old who was killed during the massacre. The book falsely claimed that Noah hadn't actually died and that his father, Leonard Pozner \u2014 who has become a leading voice supporting the families of mass shooting victims from harassment \u2014 wasn't actually his dad.\n\nPozner filed a defamation lawsuit against Fetzer late last year, and the Wisconsin courts ruled in his favor in June. A summary judgment, viewed by the Washington Post, sided with Pozner and confirmed he had been defamed, specifically because of statements in the book claiming he had created a fake death certificate for his son.\n\nNoah Pozner's funeral, in 2012.

Dave Gahary, the principal officer at publisher Moon Rock Books, explained how a conversation with Pozner had helped sway him towards pulling the book from shelves in June.\n\n\"My face-to-face interactions with Mr. Pozner have led me to believe that Mr. Pozner is telling the truth about the death of his son,\" Gahary told the Associated Press. \"I extend my most heartfelt and sincere apology to the Pozner family.\"\n\nWisconsin Jury draws a line between freedom of speech and defamatory harassment\n\nFetzer had tried to argue that his false claims were protected under his first amendment freedom of speech but Pozner, and ultimately the Wisconsin jury, disagreed.\n\n\"As I have said before, this is not a First Amendment issue,\" Pozner told the jury, according to the Wall Street Journal. \"Mr. Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened. He has the right to express his ignorance.\"\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012. Seth Wenig/AP\n\nPozner told Insider that he toiled through the legal system for years trying to help other families but faced roadblocks because a legal precedent hadn't been set. This case, Pozner said, may serve as that precedent for other legal claims.\n\n\"Without legal precedent, courts didn't want to wade into the unknown waters of online defamation and harassment,\" Pozner said. \"Today, I believe that hesitation ends and the countless other victims of Mr. Fetzer and other conspiracy theorists like him who use the internet to harass and defame will now have the ability to pursue legal action against their abusers.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post following the decision, Pozner's attorney, Jake Zimmerman, said the nearly half a million-dollar payout should send a message to future harassers of mass shooting victims,\n\n\"Anyone else who's in the business of harassing families of victims of mass-casualty events \u2014 which unfortunately has become a cottage industry, it seems \u2014 has to look at this and say there is a cost to making these statements,\" Zimmerman said.", "description": "The court's judgment and the hefty payout are the latest in a string of lawsuit victories for the families of mass shooting victims suing harassers.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8816be94e8608b7737c7a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
