And it looks like Harry Styles the popstar could be about to return. Hallelujah.\n\nBeady eyed Harold fan account HSDaily have shared a couple of snaps taken by fans that have all the hallmarks of a big pop comeback, sending stans into a frenzy all across Twitter. The pictures in question are of mysterious billboards spotted in Australia, each with the words \u201cDO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE?\u201d written on them.\n\nThe posters, HSDaily note, have the the Columbia Records logo on them (Harry\u2019s record label) and \u201cTPWK\u201d, shorthand for \u201cTreat People With Kindness\u201d, a mantra of Harry\u2019s and a phrase often found on his merch collection.\n\nThe posters come after Harry, notoriously quiet on Twitter, tweeted the word \u201cDo\u201d, which lead fans into a speculative tailspin. The word, it seems is just a taste of the single title. It looks like HS2 is coming.\n\nInformation about Harry\u2019s upcoming music is scant, but during a recent profile with Rolling Stone, he did reveal some titbits about what he had been beavering away on. We know that he spent six weeks in a studio in Malibu at Rick Rubin\u2019s Shangri-La studios with a whole host of amazing people, including Jeff Bhasker and Kid Harpoon. The album is also said to be \u201call about having sex and feeling sad\u201d, which is a total mood, and written and recorded while Harry was on psychedelics (another mood).\n\nGiven that his self-titled debut was a bit of a curveball, with lead single \u201cSign of the Times\u201d being a near-six-minute epic, it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re leaving all expectations at the door with this one. We just hope that whatever it is that it comes ASAP.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.\n\n", "description": "HS2 IS COMING!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9daf9ba72477000ac6ed7f/lede/1570616423341-33372203_2038345249540941_355360.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.5617xh;0xw,0.1887xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
