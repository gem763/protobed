It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register\u2019s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%.\n\nThe list: Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nNo other candidate reaches double digits.\n\n\u201cThis is the first major shakeup\u201d in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%.\n\nPolling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nEight others are polling at 1% or less.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., waves to supporters after speaking during a campaign event, Thursday, Sept., 19, 2019, along the Iowa River behind the Iowa Memorial Union at an amphitheater on the University of Iowa campus in Iowa City, Iowa. More\n\nBut the race is far from settled: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers say their minds are made up, while 63% say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.\n\n\u201cThe data in this poll seem to suggest the field is narrowing, but my sense is there\u2019s still opportunity aplenty,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThe leaders aren\u2019t all that strong. The universe is not locked in.\u201d\n\nThe poll of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Sept. 14-18, and the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nWarren\u2019s steady rise in Iowa\n\nOther candidates have seen their Iowa Poll numbers briefly spike \u2014 O\u2019Rourke hit double digits early after running in a competitive U.S. Senate race in Texas, then fell back. Buttigieg surged after a well-received CNN town hall performance, then drops in the new poll. But no one in Iowa so far this cycle has seen Warren's steady and sustained momentum.\n\nThe Register\u2019s first 2020 caucus poll, in December 2018, pegged Warren's support at 8%. In March, about two months after she first visited the state and formally announced she would run, that rose to 9%. In June, as Iowa Democrats began to marvel at her organizational strength, she rose to 15% \u2014 though that poll\u2019s methodology differed somewhat from the others.\n\nToday, the universe of people who say they are considering Warren in some way \u2014 71% of likely Democratic caucusgoers \u2014 is larger than it is for any other candidate.\n\nThat includes 22% who say she is their first choice for president, 20% who say she is their second choice and another 29% who say they are actively considering her.\n\nTrailing her are: Biden (60%), Buttigieg (55%), Harris (55%), Sanders (50%), Booker (42%), O\u2019Rourke (38%) and Klobuchar (37%).\n\nIt\u2019s also higher than where Warren was polling in June. Then, 61% of respondents were considering her in some way.\n\n\u201cThat appears to be a powerful leap forward and suggests that she can improve further, because she\u2019s got these people actively considering her and thinking of her as a second choice,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a huge number there. Those people can be converted.\u201d", "description": "Elizabeth Warren now holds a 2-point lead over former vice president Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Brianne Pfannenstiel", "Des Moines Register"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b9iUG2WaI5RV.eV7FvzvJQ--~B/aD0zMzgzO3c9NTA3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/bcfed75e8aa52275c5420d586195d1ef", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
