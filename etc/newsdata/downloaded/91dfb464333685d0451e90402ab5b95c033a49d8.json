(Next Avenue published an earlier article with detailed findings from the freelancers survey.)\n\nMost 50+ freelancers do so by choice. That was the case for 60% of people ages 50 to 64 surveyed who freelance and 73% of those age 65 and older.\n\nSee: The realities of freelancing for Americans over 50\n\nHere are four ways to maximize your freelance earning potential by taking advantage of current freelance trends:\n\n1. Use your existing skills\n\nThe most common type of work done by freelancers of all ages, according to the survey, is providing skilled services \u2014 things such as consulting, marketing or programming. And skilled freelance work pays more than unskilled freelance work. The survey found freelancers providing skilled services earn an average of $28 an hour, compared with $20 an hour for unskilled work.\n\nSome skilled freelancers make a lot more. Some of the highest-paid work on Upwork, for example, is in accounting and finance. People with experience in corporate restructuring, bitcoin or international accounting bill more than $200 an hour.\n\nSo, if you spent a career honing your skills in a specific field, it\u2019s worth considering using them as a springboard to freelancing.\n\n2. Network, network, network\n\nThere\u2019s another reason to do what you know when you\u2019re a freelancer. The Freelancing in America report noted that personal networks are the top source of assignments for freelancers who do skilled work. Personal networks include previous freelance clients, friends and family, and professional contacts.\n\nOlder freelancers have a leg up here, since they\u2019ve been in the workforce longer than people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Meeting and working with more people over a longer span of time creates a larger network, and those connections can pay off, said Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel.\n\nSocial networks like Facebook FB, -0.05% , Twitter TWTR, -0.70% and LinkedIn are the second most important sources of freelance work. But it\u2019s not enough just to have an account, especially on LinkedIn, which is focused on business.\n\nAlso see: Want to delete Facebook? Read what happened to these people first\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between being on LinkedIn and knowing how to master it. You have to be in the groups and communities\u201d pertaining to your field, said Jeri Sedlar, author of \u201cDon\u2019t Retire, Rewire.\u201d\n\nFreelance websites are another source of work. If you\u2019re consider creating profiles on freelance platforms to put the word out that you\u2019re available, try generalist sites like Upwork, Fiverr, PeoplePerHour, and Freelancer.com.\n\nBut don\u2019t overlook freelance sites for a specific industry, such as Axiom, for the legal profession, or sites run by staffing company TrueBlue for people seeking on-demand, temporary or freelance work in manufacturing, construction, transportation, hospitality and other industries.\n\n3. Invest in training\n\nIt\u2019s especially important for older freelancers not to get complacent about what they know. \u201cIf you\u2019re a freelancer in marketing, you need to train yourself on digital marketing and social media. You have to show potential clients you\u2019re competitive,\u201d Sedlar said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t establish yourself as a moneymaking freelancer.\u201d\n\nAccording to Freelancing in America: 2019, 73% of skilled freelancers believe that skills training is essential to their work and 71% update their skills to ensure they stay marketable as ways of working evolve. What\u2019s more, 65% of skilled freelancers have done some kind of skills training in the last six months.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The No. 1 highest paid, most in-demand job in every U.S. state\n\nFreelancers can keep their digital skills current through free online training from vendors of office software. Or they can sign up for paid classes online through sites such as LinkedIn Learning and Udemy or from local community colleges.\n\nDon\u2019t neglect soft skills, such as being able to communicate or connect with other people, work on a team, or negotiate. In fact, the percentage of freelancers who feel it\u2019s very important to have soft skills is almost equal to those who feel that way about hard skills, according to the report\n\nSoft skills are a big part of working as a freelancer because you need to know things like when it\u2019s OK to push back during a negotiation and when it\u2019s not, said Kasriel.\n\n4. If you\u2019re thinking of becoming a freelancer, ease into it\n\nKasriel recommends people considering working for themselves do so slowly and gradually. That\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot to learn when you\u2019re becoming a freelancer. In addition to finding work, you need to learn how to negotiate fees, budget for unpredictable income, find health insurance and pay estimated taxes.\n\nStart by moonlighting or work on a project or two on a freelance basis outside your day job to see how it goes.\n\nAccording to the report, freelancers spend 53% of their time on billable work and the remainder on things that can\u2019t be billed to a client, like marketing. So, if your sideline freelancing work grows to the point where you\u2019re billing 20 to 25 hours a week \u2014 the rough equivalent of a 40- to 50-hour workweek \u2014 that\u2019s an indication you\u2019re making enough to go freelance all the time, Kasriel said.", "description": "Whether you\u2019re planning to freelance or already doing it, here's how to maximize your earning potential.", "authors": ["Michelle V.
