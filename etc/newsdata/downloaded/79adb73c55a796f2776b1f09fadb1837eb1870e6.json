Deep beneath Bank of America Stadium, the Carolina Panthers\u2019 starting quarterback \u2014 a guy by the name of Colin Kaepernick \u2014 steps to the podium to answer questions about the game that\u2019s just concluded.\n\nThe Panthers have lost the game, to the Redskins on their home turf, and Carolina\u2019s season is officially dead. Kaepernick was barely serviceable \u2014 220 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions. He still knelt during the national anthem before the game, the way he\u2019s knelt every game since being signed as Cam Newton\u2019s insurance policy back in September. But the questions about his protest have dwindled every week. And this week, he gets exactly zero.\n\nKaepernick answers a few questions about open receivers and strategy and next week\u2019s game against Arizona. And then he\u2019s done. No politics, no protest talk, just a middling quarterback on a flailing team in a league that\u2019s got plenty of both.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNow, back to reality. In just the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen an entire Pro Bowl\u2019s worth of quarterbacks \u2014 Luck, Brees, Roethlisberger, Newton, even Sam Darnold if you\u2019re feeling generous \u2014 leave the field for weeks, months, forever. Each time another quarterback goes down, each time a team picks a retread off the QB scrap heap, the call resounds across Twitter: sign Colin Kaepernick!\n\nColin Kaepernick recently attended the U.S. Open to watch Naomi Osaka. (AP)\n\nI\u2019m going to sidestep entirely the question of whether Kaepernick is in game shape right now. You\u2019ll have a tough time making a convincing argument that a guy who hasn\u2019t taken a live snap in two-plus years is in anything close to game shape. You\u2019ll also have a difficult time making the case that Kaepernick would be any worse than, say, Paxton Lynch, who\u2019s played exactly five NFL games, zero since 2017, and yet still snagged a spot on the Pittsburgh Steelers roster.\n\nStory continues\n\nKaepernick\u2019s people insist that he\u2019s not only ready to play, he\u2019s in the best damn shape of his life:\n\nSource close to @Kaepernick7 in light of all the QB injuries: \u201cColin is literally in the best shape of his life. He\u2019s been working out 5 days a week at 5 am for 3 years. He wants to play and his agent has been contacting teams in need of a QB.\u201d \u2014 Chris Williamson (@CWilliamson44) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cColin is literally in the best shape of his life,\u201d a Kap source told SNY\u2019s Chris Williamson. \u201cHe\u2019s been working out 5 days a week at 5 am for 3 years. He wants to play and his agent has been contacting teams in need of a QB.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s awesome, and good for him, and all the best luck in the world \u2026 as long as he wants to be a quarterback.\n\nIf he wants to keep holding onto his place as a civil rights icon \u2014 and make no mistake, that\u2019s exactly what he is \u2014 he shouldn\u2019t get anywhere near a locker room or sideline ever again.\n\nKaepernick\u2019s power comes from his marginalized status, from the fact that he walked away from the greatest job in sports because of his beliefs. (Yes, he may have had offers to come back. That\u2019s not the point. Stick with the bigger picture here.)\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here]\n\nAs an unknown quantity \u2014 as the great What-If? \u2014 Kaepernick enjoys a far greater potential platform than he would if he were, say, backing up Teddy Bridgewater in New Orleans or coming in for garbage time in Jets games. All he\u2019s got to do is speak up \u2014 why he hasn\u2019t done so more often is a mystery \u2014 and he\u2019d have the national media lining up to broadcast his message.\n\nSure, it\u2019s entirely possible that Kap does want to play quarterback and be a symbol for progressive change. That\u2019s one hell of a fine aim. But even at his very best, Kaepernick wasn\u2019t an elite quarterback. Now, half a decade removed from his Super Bowl moment? If that door\u2019s not already closed, it\u2019s barely cracked wide enough to let light through.\n\nKaepernick still has legions of fans willing to follow him, and major companies willing to back his play. Nike won an Emmy for its Kaepernick commercial from earlier this year. In crass commercial terms, protest in 2019 can pay off big.\n\nEven though Kaepernick got aced out of the NFL-sanctioned social media space by Jay-Z, there\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t be the face of a social change movement, one that reaches far beyond his original aims of protesting police brutality. He\u2019s got the name recognition, the bona fides and the scars \u2014 financial, if not literal \u2014 necessary to rally people to his cause. But that\u2019s not happening if he\u2019s spending his Sundays answering questions about why he threw that third interception.\n\nKaepernick the protester is a symbol of a new progressivism in America. Kaepernick the quarterback is \u2026 just one of 32 guys.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "As an unknown quantity, Colin Kaepernick enjoys a far greater potential platform than he would if he were standing on an NFL sideline.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O_EMezE35ER.6KzegZD3ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMDE2LjUzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FzG2D4tfipeeW8aAKiqzMA--~B/aD0yMjMxO3c9MjgwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/6fb76010-ca94-11e9-bffc-57a76f874a55", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
