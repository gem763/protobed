The president\u2019s tweet, however, marked the most dramatic escalation in the new feud with Frey\u2019s government and came as a surprise to the mayor himself.\n\n\u201cTo say the least, it\u2019s a strange feeling to wake up in the morning to the president of the United States tweeting about our city and me as the mayor,\u201d Frey, a Democrat, told POLITICO in an interview.\n\nThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again! https://t.co/ibTqvSbsbn \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nScores of other public figures have experienced similar sensations since Trump assumed office almost three years ago, bringing with him to the White House a propensity for ambushing unsuspecting celebrities, journalists and politicians on Twitter.\n\nHis decision this week to single out Frey, though, initiates the Minneapolis mayor into a separate class of online adversary \u2014 lesser-known government officials who are thrust toward the forefront of news cycles and vaulted onto the national stage after being hounded online by Trump.\n\nThat spotlight is a \u201cside benefit\u201d of the president\u2019s scornful missives on social media, said Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party, which is affiliated with the U.S. Democratic Party and of which Frey is a member.\n\n\u201cProbably no one outside of Minnesota knew who Mayor Jacob Frey was before this week, and Donald Trump just elevated his profile in a major way,\u201d Martin told POLITICO.\n\nAmong Frey\u2019s ranks are local leaders like Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who drew plaudits for her fury over the administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in 2017, prompting Trump to memorably deride her as \u201cnasty.\u201d\n\nMayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, was similarly praised for guiding her city through the aftermath of a mass shooting in August, though Trump swatted at her in a tweet, accusing her of \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d his visit with first responders and victims.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, through his attacks, doesn\u2019t realize that he is actually probably in some ways elevating the profile of these elected officials who work tirelessly in obscurity,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAnd now these elected officials \u2026 have developed a huge following and have become rising stars in the party.\u201d\n\nFrey, 38, certainly appears equipped with the political trappings of a Democratic up-and-comer straight out of \u201ccentral casting,\u201d as the president might say.\n\nHe moved to Minneapolis in 2009 after competing in the Twin Cities Marathon and graduating law school at Villanova University, going on to practice as an attorney and engaging in advocacy efforts and community organizing.\n\nElected to the city council in 2013, Frey became mayor four years later. He now serves as the progressive leader of the state\u2019s largest city, a bastion of liberal voters, championing access to affordable housing, improved police and community relations, and economic inclusion.\n\nApart from a brief profile in Men's Health, Frey hasn\u2019t garnered significant attention from national media \u2014 making Trump\u2019s Twitter drive-by all the more confounding, especially as the White House combats a rapidly expanding impeachment inquiry and fallout over its Syria foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIf I was the president of the United States, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be focused on me right now,\u201d Frey said.\n\nAlthough the president\u2019s criticisms of Mayors Cruz and Whaley came amid episodes of domestic crisis, his latest beef with Minneapolis\u2019 chief executive seems for now to be a purely political matter.\n\nFrey first spoke out against Trump\u2019s planned rally late last month, acknowledging that while there exists \u201cno legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump\u2019s campaign raged against the cost estimate provided by Frey\u2019s city government, claiming that the invoice of more than half a million dollars was 26 times greater than the security charges related to a 2009 event in the same arena headlined by former President Barack Obama.\n\nAfter Trump began weighing in Tuesday on Twitter, Frey replied only twice to his nine posts invoking the mayor or the rally \u2014 which is now scheduled to proceed as planned after campaign manager Brad Parscale announced the Target Center had \u201cbacked off cancelling the contract.\u201d\n\nYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nFrey said in a statement later Tuesday that his \u201cposition with respect to the operating costs remains unchanged,\u201d and rejected the campaign\u2019s assertion that the price projection was politically skewed against Trump.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything about the president\u2019s life and personality [and] political views is subject to quite a bit of fluctuation, with the exception of paying his bills: He never does, and he remains consistent on that item,\u201d Frey said in the interview, citing the Trump campaign\u2019s failure to reimburse several cities that have hosted rallies for public safety expenses associated with those events.\n\nThe scuffle between the president\u2019s campaign and the mayor\u2019s office regarding the rally costs coincides with another local controversy Frey is weathering, which Trump has also sought to exploit.\n\nSome law enforcement officers have complained about a newly introduced policy by the Minneapolis Police Department banning them from appearing in uniform in support of candidates at political events or in advertisements.\n\nThe new directive, which detractors argue represents another example of left-leaning bias by Frey and city officials, inspired the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis to produce \u201cCops for Trump\u201d t-shirts for officers to wear at the rally. Trump began promoting the apparel on his Twitter feed after Lt. Bob Kroll, the police union president, appeared Tuesday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nKroll told POLITICO he enjoys a \u201cdecent working relationship\u201d with Frey, describing the mayor as an ambitious politician whose career could stand to benefit from a dust-up with the commander in chief.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking for the next step, obviously, and this is a way to get national recognition and get his name out there,\u201d Kroll said. But objective observers of the conflict, he cautioned, would assess that \u201cthe president gave the mayor a beatdown.\u201d\n\nJennifer Carnahan, the chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party, was even more doubtful that Frey\u2019s time in the president\u2019s crosshairs would expand his brand beyond the Twin Cities.\n\n\u201cHe might get attention for a few days, and then he will go back into oblivion,\u201d she told POLITICO, adding: \u201cI\u2019m sure he is loving every minute of this.\u201d\n\nFrey insists, however, that despite his current ability to capture the attention of the sitting president, he is not seeking to take advantage of this peculiar moment by pushing a particular policy or projecting a certain message. He said the task at hand is readying for Trump\u2019s looming rally, \u201cnot capitalizing on some sort of, I don\u2019t know, internet phenomenon.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Frey reiterated in a tweet that \u201cMinneapolis taxpayers should not have to bear the brunt of operating costs resulting from the president\u2019s visit,\u201d and participated in a news conference \u201cto Reaffirm that Minneapolis Stands United for All of Our Residents\u201d ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival. He also sat for an interview with MSNBC \u2014 his first outing on a cable news network this week.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the mayor will receive another mention by the president as he addresses supporters, but Frey told POLITICO that he is encouraging residents not to become inflamed by the \u201chateful rhetoric\u201d and \u201cugliness\u201d that accompany Trump campaign events.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do my job, and right now my job is preparing for this event tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling people very clearly: If you see cruelty, call it out and answer it with kindness. If you see hate, counter it with love. And we\u2019re going to show with grace and clarity that Minneapolis is a world-class city, and that we\u2019re not going to take the bait.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3e/74/0aa88f0748539a5d25e650de80df/gettyimages-983280684-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
