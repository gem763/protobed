Global Climate Summit were the 500 international scientists, engineers and other stakeholders sounding a very different message: \u201cThere is no climate emergency.\u201d\n\nThe European Climate Declaration, spearheaded by the Amsterdam-based Climate Intelligence Foundation [CLINTEL], described the leading climate models as \u201cunfit\u201d and urged UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to pursue a climate policy based on \u201csound science.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrent climate policies pointlessly and grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, reliable electrical energy,\u201d said the Sept. 23 letter signed by professionals from 23 countries.\n\nMost of the signers hailed from Europe, but there were also scientists from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South America.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe signers asked Mr. Guterres to place the declaration on the UN\u2019s agenda for the meeting ending Monday\u2014which hasn\u2019t happened\u2014and organize a meeting of scientists \u201con both sides of the climate debate early in 2020.\u201d\n\nLetter to UN SecGen @antonioguterres Ant\u00f3nio Guterres from 500 scientists warns \u201ccurrent climate policies pointlessly and grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, reliable electrical energy.\u201d https://t.co/INTsVOIlGu \u2014 Dr. Waheed Uddin (@drwaheeduddin) September 28, 2019\n\nThe declaration was dismissed by Penn State climatologist Michael E. Mann, who called it \u201ccraven and stupid,\u201d as well as the left-of-center [U.K.] Guardian, which said the document \u201crepeats well-worn and long-debunked talking points on climate change that are contradicted by scientific institutions and academies around the world.\u201d\n\nHave to admit I did a double take when I first glanced at this. Was sure that last signature was \u201cHe Who Must Not be Named\u201d.\n\nThen I reflected on the matter and realized how unlikely that is.\n\nNot even Valdemort would sign his name to something so craven and stupid\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PPkkwVzNUI \u2014 Michael E. Mann (@MichaelEMann) September 24, 2019\n\nAt the same time, the sheer number of prominent signers with scientific and engineering credentials belied the contention that only a handful of fringe researchers and fossil-fuel shills oppose the climate-catastrophe \u201cconsensus.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. contingent was made up of 45 U.S. professors, engineers and scientists, including MIT professor emeritus Richard Lindzen; Freeman Dyson of the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, and Stanford University professor emeritus Elliott D. Bloom, as well as several signers formerly affiliated with NASA.\n\nThe declaration made six points:\n\n\u00b7 \u201cNature as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWarming is far slower than predicted\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cClimate policy relies on inadequate models\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Carbon dioxide is \u201cplant food, the basis of all life on Earth\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cGlobal warming has not increased natural disasters\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cClimate policy must respect scientific and economic realities\u201d\n\nConvincing climate-focused institutions like the UN to engage on such topics has been a struggle, said Guus Berkhout, professor emeritus of geophysics at Delft University of Technology and a CLINTEL co-founder.\n\n\u201cWe promote a scientific discussion at the highest level between both sides of the climate debate, but the mainstream refuses so far,\u201d said Mr. Berkhout in an email. \u201cThey always come with the same arguments: they are right and we are wrong. Period!\u201d\n\nIndeed, the UN discussion is moving full speed ahead on carbon neutrality, with policymakers, researchers and media outlets calling for increasingly urgent measures to combat the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more concrete plans, more ambition from more countries and more businesses,\u201d said Mr. Guterres in a Sept. 23 statement. \u201cWe need all financial institutions, public and private, to choose, once and for all, the green economy.\u201d\n\nUN spokesman Dan Shepard said the body is guided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, adding that any \u201ccompelling evidence to the contrary\u201d should be \u201cbrought to the attention of IPCC working groups.\u201d\n\nIn their letter, the CLINTEL network called it \u201ccruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions of dollars on the basis of results from such immature models.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe science is far from settled,\u201d said Mr. Berkhout.\n\nCLINTEL was founded this year by Mr. Berkhout and journalist Marcel Crok with a grant from Dutch real-estate developer Niek Sandmann.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
