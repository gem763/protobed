Post-mortem examinations of 11 of the deceased were due to start on Friday afternoon.\n\nExperts who follow human trafficking trends suggested that the Essex victims could have been compelled into forced labor. Or they could have been migrants who paid their way for the dangerous journey gone horribly wrong.\n\nAD\n\nEssex Police and Belgian prosecutors said the refrigerated container arrived by sea from Zeebrugge, a Belgian port, and docked at Purfleet, a small port in Essex on the Thames, shortly after 12:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nPolice said the truck that picked up the container at Purfleet entered Britain separately, via ferry from Dublin, at Holyhead port in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nNew GPS tracking data shows that the refrigerated container crossed the English Channel several times over the past week.\n\nThe case echoed a fatal episode in June 2000, when the bodies of 58 Chinese migrants were found in a shipping container in the English port city of Dover. Those victims were supposedly destined to work in Britain as domestic servants, authorities said. The following year, a Dutch driver was sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter. The immigrants, who paid a smuggling gang $26,000, suffocated after the driver closed a vent on the truck during a five-hour ferry ride across the English Channel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union, which represents British border, customs and immigration officers, said that desperate attempts to reach Britain appear to be on the rise. She described a form of modern-day slavery in which Chinese, Bangladeshi, Vietnamese and others allow themselves to be shipped to Britain, where they toil for years in construction, domestic service, agriculture, nail salons and the sex trade to \u201cpay back\u201d the debt they owe gangs for smuggling them abroad.\n\nRichard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said there are not enough security checks in many European ports and that this could be exacerbated with Brexit, as the United Kingdom\u2019s looming departure from the European Union is known.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found it hard enough to try and get the Europeans to accept that this is a collective problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no incentives for the Europeans to really help us if we\u2019re exiting the E.U. Their view is that this is our problem because these people want to get to the U.K.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice have not named the driver, although several British media outlets have identified him, citing sources in Northern Ireland, and posted photos from what were said to be his social media accounts. Several of his friends have defended him. Some suggested that he could have been the one who called the ambulance services.\n\n\u201cWe have not speculated about the identity of this man, and we will not do so,\u201d Essex police said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe truck was registered in Varna, Bulgaria \u2014 a port city on the Black Sea \u2014 to a company owned by an Irish citizen, according to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov told a local television broadcaster that the truck left immediately after it was registered in 2017 and had not returned.\n\nAD\n\nBritish officials had issued warnings about the route the container took across the North Sea.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Britain\u2019s Border Force identified Zeebrugge, along with the Hook of Holland, as key ports for \u201cclandestine arrivals\u201d into Britain.\n\nIn a report published last year, Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency said Belgium had \u201cbecome a location of greater focus\u201d for human trafficking and that smuggling activity increased following the closure of a migrant camp in Dunkirk, France.\n\nAnalysts said Zeebrugge lacks many of the security measures \u2014 including sniffer dogs and high-tech monitors \u2014 employed in French ports.\n\nGerry Shih and Lyric Li in Beijing and contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The pair, both 38, were held on suspicion of human trafficking and manslaughter.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xONPaOHB0cOrwrEfGvW-KDQyahQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5SQNQYXXE4I6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
