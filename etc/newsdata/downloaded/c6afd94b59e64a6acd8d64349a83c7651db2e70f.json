It\u2019s a suburban and rural North Carolina district stretching along the South Carolina border from Charlotte, and it\u2019s traditionally Republican to its core. Trump won it by 12 percentage points. Republicans have represented it in Congress for a half-century. Now, Democrat Dan McCready is in a close race with Republican Dan Bishop for the open seat.\n\nThe election is happening nearly a year after all the other House elections because of an alleged election fraud scheme that benefited the Republican nominee in 2018 and which resulted in the election results being thrown out.\n\nThis is just one election for one House race. It\u2019s also expected to be low turnout, given that it\u2019s in an off-month in an off-year.\n\nBut what\u2019s happening in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District is not dissimilar to when Democrats won big, or got close, in special elections in 2017 in Trump country. Those strong performances precipitated Democrats winning back the majority in the House, which they did by winning 31 seats that Trump won. Now, they\u2019re defending those seats, but their majority is such that Republicans will have to have a really good election next year to win back the majority.\n\n[The top 10 House races of 2020]\n\nEven Trump is acknowledging that this race could set the tone for the 2020 elections. In a sign of how nervous Republicans are about this seat, he traveled to the district Monday and held a rally, where he framed this as a test case for which party has the momentum going into 2020.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we take the first step to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House,\u201d President Trump says ahead of the special election in North Carolina. \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) September 10, 2019\n\nVice President Pence also traveled there.\n\nMcCready doesn\u2019t even have to win \u2014 if he comes within a percentage point or two here Tuesday, Democrats hope it will provide a road map to help them at all levels in 2020: They\u2019ve campaigned by focusing less on Trump and social issues and more on health care.\n\nNorth Carolina will be the center of the political universe next year. There\u2019s a competitive Senate race, a competitive governor\u2019s race, and it could be a battleground state for the presidential race.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District is made up of some key test constituencies for all those elections: suburban women (who were a swing vote in 2018), African American voters (whom Democrats need to turn out in high numbers for the presidential election) and rural voters (whom Trump needs). Democrats are using this district to try to test how to turn out black voters, since in 2016 they voted in lower numbers than in recent previous elections. They\u2019re actually trying not to focus on Trump, or the alleged election fraud or the bathroom bill that tainted Republicans\u2019 image in the state.\n\n(It\u2019s to be determined how much that worked. The Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis traveled to the district recently and found several voters who said they were casting their vote to support Trump or stick it to Trump. There\u2019s also evidence that voters are thinking quite a bit about the alleged election fraud.)\n\nRepublicans argue this race is not indicative of where the national mood is. North Carolina Republicans have had a rough year. An operative working for the Republican nominee in 2018 is accused of forging mail-in ballots. Also, the state\u2019s GOP chairman was indicted in April amid a campaign finance bribery scandal. And in 2016, Democrats won the governor\u2019s mansion after national and local backlash to the Republican-led bathroom bill, which Bishop was the lead sponsor for.\n\n\u201cThis phenomena will not be seen anywhere else and is one of the many reasons whatever the outcome is here, it\u2019s a poor indication of national trends,\u201d said a Republican strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the race.\n\nBut with elections like these, perception matters almost as much as reality. So even if Tuesday\u2019s election in this district is an isolated political event, DeBonis reports that Washington Republicans worry that their lawmakers could see a poor showing here as a sign that they won\u2019t be able to win the House back in 2020, and even more could retire. (So far, 16 House Republicans have retired, opening up a path for Democrats to pick up seats in places like Texas.)\n\nSo yes, this is just one House seat in one state. But for many reasons, it\u2019s a crucial state and, potentially, a crucial House race to signal what will happen in 2020.", "description": "It's a good test case for Democrats' strength with suburban and rural voters going into 2020.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4PPGIuPhD1dpq1uLqXd4OI80iS8=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-10-2019/t_9f0da0d10e4f4973bf015619523339c4_name_IjeYzVcKzhDMzzPs_00_02_48_13_Still005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
