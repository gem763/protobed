Once electricity is in the grid, suppliers cannot distinguish the power produced by solar and wind farms from the power produced by fossil fuels, hydroelectric dams and nuclear plants.\n\nTo get around this problem, power companies came up with renewable energy certificates. Each certificate represents a given amount of electricity that\u2019s been generated from renewable sources. When energy companies produce that power, they get certificates they can sell to consumers.\n\nSo, when you sign up for green energy, you\u2019re really buying those renewable energy certificates.\n\n\u201cShort of having a solar array on your roof and keeping all those electrons to yourself, it\u2019d be really hard to figure out what type of electrons you\u2019re using if you didn\u2019t have something like R.E.C.s to keep track of the math,\u201d said John Rogers, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nIf you live in a state with a deregulated energy system (most Northeastern states, California, Oregon and Texas) you can sign a supply deal with a renewable energy company. If you do, your provider will probably never mention the certificates behind the system. But, wherever the electrons really came from, all the energy you use will represent green power generation.\n\nThose supply deals generally cost a bit more than a traditional utility bill. Prices vary, but the average household should expect to pay a few dollars more each month.", "description": "Also, reporters, activists and world leaders get set for climate week.", "authors": ["John Schwartz", "Eduardo Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/climate/18cli-newsletter-energy/18cli-newsletter-energy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
