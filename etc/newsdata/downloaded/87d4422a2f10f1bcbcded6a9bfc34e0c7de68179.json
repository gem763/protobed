He had to be defended by London Underground staff and other passersby.\n\nAt Shadwell, five activists blocked the Docklands Light Railway, with two climbing on top of a train and at least one glued to the door.\n\nHolly Collins (@HollyJoCollins) Commuters now physically dragging protestors from the roof of the train. @itvlondon pic.twitter.com/gDkXfJNxmL\n\nPhil Kingston, 83, whose hand was glued to the side of a carriage, said he was doing it for the sake of his grandchildren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also very concerned about what\u2019s happening in the poorer parts of the world who are being hit the hardest by climate breakdown,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian and it really upsets me to see God\u2019s creation being wrecked across the world.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m here on those three counts and I\u2019m longing for the government to take some actions which are in accord with the parliamentary declaration of climate and environmental emergency.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion defies protest ban and targets Google Read more\n\nPolice said four people had been arrested as a result of both incidents.\n\nRuth Jarman, who sat next to Kingston, said they had targeted the DLR because its destination was London\u2019s financial district.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heading for the City, which is the God of our time,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the scientific reports coming out now about what we should do about the climate breakdown, about the ecological breakdown, we need total transformation of the economy. At the moment we serve economic growth. Humanity, the planet is crucifying itself to economic growth. It cannot go on.\u201d\n\nDamien Gayle (@damiengayle) \u201cI\u2019m a Christian and it really upsets me to see God\u2019s creation being wrecked.\u201d#ExtinctionRebellion @CClimateAction activist Phil Kingston, 83, who has superglued himself to the DLR at Shadwell. This will be his 13th arrest pic.twitter.com/oH57nwAoud\n\nExtinction Rebellion launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the risks posed by the climate crisis and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species. At least 1,6426 have been arrested since the protests started.\n\nMost commuters at Shadwell were not impressed. \u201cIs an electric train good or not?\u201d one asked the protesters. \u201cIs this train good for the environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey way they\u2019re doing it is not right,\u201d said another, who complained that her daughter was now stuck on a DLR train between stations.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said in a statement that activists were willing to go to prison \u201cin order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity\u201d.\n\nThe group said: \u201cThe actions are intended to bring further economic disruption to the capital as part of the ongoing campaign to convince the government to take meaningful action on the climate and ecological emergency.\n\n\u201cSafety measures are in place to ensure nobody is trapped underground.\u201d\n\nBritish Transport Police said: \u201cFour arrests have been made in connection to the Stratford and Canning Town incidents, with those detained being taken to police custody.\n\n\u201cWe continue to urge protesters to not target the London Underground network. This is dangerous, not only for protesters but for commuters.\u201d\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cI strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.\n\n\u201cIt is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.\u201d", "description": "Commuters clash with demonstrators over morning rush hour disruption", "authors": ["Damien Gayle", "Richard Vize"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762b9ae0be9cba0652b2ff99ca2b45e788372068/330_311_1282_769/master/1282.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=698bb2172de5bf7484f9e8efc9b046fa", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
