This would require flipping three Republican seats if the party can also capture the White House \u2013 and four seats if they fail to take the White House. (If Democrats win the White House then they need one less since the vice president can vote and break a tied vote in the Senate). If the Democrats were to win the White House but fail to get a majority in the Senate, it would seriously curtail their ability to enact legislation, since Republicans would likely block any meaningful reform. The race for the Senate is almost as vital as the White House.\n\nThis race in Maine could, therefore, have a defining impact in 2020 and beyond. And all because of Collins\u2019 backing for Kavanaugh. Her role in affirming his nomination to the supreme court seemed all the more acute because many Democrats had hoped she, as a centrist Republican, would withhold her support for his confirmation.\n\nIn the end, Collins described Kavanaugh as \u201can exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and father\u201d, before adding: \u201cI will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Kavanaugh controversy was reignited last week with the publication of a book offering new allegations of sexual misconduct. To some Maine voters \u2013 and especially Collins\u2019 would-be Democratic opponents \u2013 the renewed focus on Kavanaugh has opened up a fresh opportunity to unseat Collins from her crucial Senate seat.\n\nTo Sweet, Collins\u2019 decision to support Kavanaugh represented a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the moderate persona Collins has projected over her four terms in office.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins had been, to many of us, a moderate vote \u2013 especially on issues of choice and family planning,\u201d Sweet said after the town hall in Topsham, just a 30-minute drive north along a tree-lined highway from Portland. \u201cThis is the lifetime appointment to the supreme court. So when she had the opportunity to help, to do something, she didn\u2019t. It literally felt like a knife to the gut.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued by her Senate office, Collins defended her vote and blamed the New York Times for initially neglecting to mention in its essay \u2013 excerpted from the book \u2013 that the alleged victim of one newly-reported incident involving Kavanaugh declined to talk to the work\u2019s authors.\n\n\u201cThe news stories today are not adding anything to what has already been reported,\u201d said Collins spokesperson Annie Clark. She dismissed the latest claim as \u201can accusation that lacks an accuser\u201d.\n\nBut Collins\u2019 opponents, in Maine and nationally, are eager to cast her Kavanaugh vote as representative of a broader political shift toward the Republican party line.\n\nThe campaign of Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine house of representatives who is also seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, said in a statement: \u201cSenator Collins voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh despite evidence and allegations that cast serious doubt on his fitness for the supreme court, and that vote is one example of the many ways in which she has let Mainers down.\u201d\n\nGideon\u2019s campaign has attracted national endorsements from groups such as Emily\u2019s List and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who have similarly accused Collins of abandoning her constituency.\n\nMairead Lynn, the deputy director of campaign communications for Emily\u2019s List, said: \u201cFrom voting to defund Planned Parenthood, to giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax break, to confirming Trump\u2019s anti-women, anti-reproductive rights judges, Susan Collins has made it very clear she would rather please Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump than stand up for Mainers.\n\n\u201c[A]nd that\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re going to vote her out of office next year.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Women participate in a sit-in in Senator Susan Collins\u2019 office to urge her to vote no on the confirmation of supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on 28 September 2018.

In the week after she announced her candidacy in June, Gideon raised more than $1m \u2013 dwarfing the $81,000 raised by Sweet. The victor of the Senate primary will also be the beneficiary of $4m that Democrats raised for the eventual nominee in the wake of Collins\u2019 Kavanaugh vote.\n\nBut Republicans are responding to Democratic enthusiasm by powering an even more impressive fundraising operation for Collins, who has not yet officially announced her intention to run for re-election.\n\nCollins has already raised more than $6.5m through the end of this year\u2019s second quarter, eclipsing her fundraising totals from three of her four past races with more than a year still to go until the election.\n\nCollins\u2019 critics have been keen to point out how much of her money has come from outside Maine, arguing it represents her ideological drift away from the center of the political spectrum.\n\nBut Collins\u2019 allies continue to tout her willingness to work across the aisle, highlighting reports that rank her as one of the most bipartisan senators. Collins\u2019 campaign spokesman Kevin Kelley said: \u201c[A]s soon as Mainers do focus on next year\u2019s campaign, and Senator Collins\u2019 extraordinary record of bipartisan accomplishments, we are confident that she will prevail just as she has in past elections when extreme, out-of-state interests have tried to defeat her.\n\n\u201cOur campaign will remind Mainers of Senator Collins\u2019 long record of bipartisan accomplishments that have helped people who live in all corners of our state.\u201d\n\nEven strategists on the left acknowledge they face an uphill battle to oust Collins.\n\nStill, Democrats are hopeful that voters will rethink their support for Collins with Kavanaugh\u2019s name back in the headlines.\n\nSweet told the story of a lifelong Republican voter she encountered who said he would never vote for Collins again. She said the man told her he thought Collins had \u201cbetrayed\u201d her voters.\n\nRevealed: how US senators invest in firms they are supposed to regulate Read more\n\n\u201cShe has been offered up so many moments of courage where she could have done it, and she\u2019s passed them by. And she\u2019s passed them not because she didn\u2019t think they were good for Maine, but because she was bound to the pressure of the party,\u201d Sweet said.\n\nShe gestured to the room where a voter had asked her just a half an hour earlier how she would consider judicial appointments before adding: \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s disappointing to Mainers.\u201d", "description": "Republican senator\u2019s vote to confirm Kavanaugh could have positives for Democrats as they seek to take Senate in 2020", "authors": ["Joan E Greve"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba952c0fcf0e612400e6a0d07e36f72dbe3289d2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3279d4e7de07cb9aec1e519417312f2c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
