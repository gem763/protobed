That\u2019s what makes security particularly difficult \u2014 there are no panaceas, and the cybersecurity startup field is crowded. So much so, some entrepreneurs complain that the vast number of solutions on the market are weighing down chief security officers with a deluge of data but not the clear visibility they need.\n\nOr, as one of the cybersecurity-focused VCs we surveyed called it: \u201cstartup fatigue.\u201d\n\nMany of the rising cybersecurity startups focus on the same or overlapping problems could lead to a \u201ccybersecurity consolidation,\u201d one that\u2019s dictated by customers and not necessarily the businesses themselves.\n\nBut there\u2019s usually one element that feeds into everything \u2014 data.\n\nAs hacks and breaches become more common, companies and customers alike are reevaluating their relationships with data. Customers want more ownership of their data and the ability to give it out granularly, while an increasing number of businesses are shifting away from central banks of data and leaning towards a \u201czero data\u201d approach.\n\nBy minimizing the amount of information companies store or collect, it\u2019s validation that even some larger startups don\u2019t even trust themselves to secure data properly.\n\nNot only that, there\u2019s as much mistrust inside their own networks. That\u2019s where \u201czero trust\u201d comes into play \u2014 where you don\u2019t trust, but you certainly verify. The idea is that you get no extra special access inside a company\u2019s four walls. Many big companies, like Google, treat all employees the as if they present the same level of security risk whether they\u2019re in the office, at home, or in a coffee shop down the street.\n\n\u201cYou should be able to run your whole business out of a Starbucks,\u201d said Google security chief Heather Adkins at Disrupt SF.\n\nWhy the mistrust? Because security isn\u2019t just a technology problem, it\u2019s a people problem. And it\u2019s not only people creating the solutions, it\u2019s people with the solutions to create these startups to begin with.\n\nWe asked ten leading cybersecurity VCs who work at firms that span early to growth stages to share where they see opportunity in this sector:\n\nIn addition, we did a deep-dive interview with Arif Janmohamed at Lightspeed about how he and his firm are targeting the sector and what he sees as the next-generation of cybersecurity startups. Be sure to check it out.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the data.\n\nAnswers have been edited for clarity.\n\nAmit Karp, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners\n\nIn cybersecurity, what are you most interested in right now from an investment perspective?\n\nUnfortunately, the cybersecurity landscape is overcrowded with many vendors that offer point solutions. I believe CISOs are tired of deploying additional security products which for the most part have overlapping functionality. So I am very cautious with additional tools that are deployed inside the enterprise perimeter (network, endpoint, etc.). I am looking for companies that can be deployed quickly and demonstrate immediate value to CISOs, and do not overwhelm the CISO with many new alerts.\n\nWhat are the most interesting trends in the space, particularly ones you think are under-appreciated by other investors?\n\nI think there are still many opportunities to improve application security. The combination of every company becoming a software company on the one hand and development environments becoming more chaotic on the other hand, results in many new risks and opportunities in securing your software. This includes securing third-party APIs or open-source components which are outside your control and giving developers and devops engineers more security tools while not hindering the pace of development. Another interesting trend is micro-segmentation and authorization \u2014 with the adoption of zero-trust frameworks and authentication becoming a solved problem \u2014 deciding who gets access to what has become increasingly important.\n\nAre there any startups in cybersecurity you wish existed, but haven\u2019t seen yet?", "description": "Security is one of the toughest things to get right; a hacker only needs to win once, but businesses have to get it right every single time.
