His Twitter account has since been deactivated.\n\nHe is due to appear at a court hearing on October 15.\n\nPolice are planning to seek a full protection order, which would keep guns out of his hands for a full year.\n\nThe man had a concealed permit license for two handguns that was issued in May, but the license has since been revoked.\n\nThe US Army and FBI issued warnings of potential mass shootings at screenings of the film Joker - starring Joaquin Phoenix (pictured) - based on social media posts by people who refer to themselves as 'incels'\n\nAuthorities nationwide heightened security efforts ahead of the October 3 release of Joker amid fears that the film's depiction of the Batman villain could inspire an incel mass shooter.\n\nThe FBI said it was looking into posts made by extremists about the movie and warnings over potential shootings at theaters.\n\nThe film, which some reviewers raved would finally win actor Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar, drew criticism claiming that its depiction of Joker's origin story would appeal to incels.\n\nSome also feared that the movie could inspire a copycat of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado theater shooting, where gunman James Holmes killed 12 at the opening weekend of The Dark Night Rises, another Batman film.\n\nHolmes, currently serving 12 life sentences, reportedly identified himself as 'The Joker' when he was initially arrested.", "description": "Police seized eight guns and several high-capacity magazines from the man's home in Redmond, Washington, on October 1 under an Extreme Risk Protection Order.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495850-0-image-a-18_1570631875459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
