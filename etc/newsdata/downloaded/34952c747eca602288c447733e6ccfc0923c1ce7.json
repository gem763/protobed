So far, 199 companies have reported third-quarter earnings and 78% of them beat earnings per share estimates, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. However, adjusted earnings growth is down more than 14% on average from the third-quarter of last year.\n\nGoogle's parent company Alphabet reports third-quarter earnings after the bell on Monday. Aegis Capital Group is expecting the tech giant to report earnings of $11.88 per share, compared to the $13.06 per share they earned in the same quarter last year. The firm forecasts Q3 revenue of $40.3 billion, higher than the $33.7 billion earned in the same period of 2018.\n\nAlphabet had its best day in four years in July after reporting second-quarter earnings that beat the Street. The tech giant saw strong growth in its cloud business Google cloud, which rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The beat was despite recent investigations into the privacy practices of big technology companies. Aegis Capital said it is not worried about the long term implications of the crackdown on big tech.\n\n\"We expect the regulatory calls to intensify as we head deeper into the election cycle given the bi-partisan support, with more calls for breakups, big fines, and increased data privacy controls,\" said Aegis' Victor Anthony in a note to clients. \"However, we do not anticipate any large-scale business model changes or breakups.\"\n\nShares of Alphabet are up more than 10% in the past three months.", "description": "We'll get earnings from Alphabet and Beyond Meat to kick off the busiest week of earnings season.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106199081-1571858526194gettyimages-887454120.jpeg?v=1572011793", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
