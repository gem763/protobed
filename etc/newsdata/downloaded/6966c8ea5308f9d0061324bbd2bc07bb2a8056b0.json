Williams went from the Jets to the Giants, which means he\u2019ll play his home games in the same stadium.\n\n\u201cThat definitely makes the adjustment a lot easier,\u201d Williams said, via Tom Rock of Newsday. \u201cIf I had to be traded, it makes it a lot easier that I don\u2019t have to pack a bag and move to a whole new city overnight. I\u2019m still right up the street, I don\u2019t have to change my area code or anything like that.\u201d\n\nWilliams will have an extra day to get used to life with the Giants as they don\u2019t play the Cowboys until Monday night. Williams also has recent experience against Dallas as the Jets beat them in Week Six. The Giants will then go on to play the Jets in Week 10, so there are plenty of familiar things in Williams\u2019s life despite the change in uniforms.", "description": "Defensive lineman Leonard Williams heard his name in trade rumors in recent days, so it wasn't a great surprise to learn he'd been traded on Monday.
