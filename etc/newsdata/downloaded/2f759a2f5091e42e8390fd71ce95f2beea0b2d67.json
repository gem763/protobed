In Quinnipiac\u2019s poll from a week ago, support for impeachment and removal from office was slightly underwater, at 46-48 percent.\n\nThe poll spotlights the wide partisan divide over impeachment, with Democrats approving of the inquiry by a 93-7 percent margin and Republicans disapproving 88-10 percent. A majority of independents back the inquiry by a 58-37 percent margin, with support rising 8 points in a week.\n\nThe president has come under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that\u2019s been battling Russia. Biden is one of the top Democratic 2020 presidential contenders hoping to challenge Trump in next year\u2019s election. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.\n\nAdding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong. He says there was no \"quid pro quo\" and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nThe president and allies have repeatedly tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u2013 who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office \u2013 was later dismissed.\n\nBiden, defending his actions in Ukraine, has said \"there\u2019s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.\"\n\nActing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified on Tuesday that the president pushed Ukraine to investigate both interference in the 2016 presidential election and the company linked to Hunter Biden \u2014 and was willing to hold up military aid and a White House meeting to get a public announcement from the country that the probes were underway.\n\nFifty-nine percent of those questioned in the new poll say the president was pursuing his own personal interests in his dealings with Ukraine, with a third saying Trump was pursuing the national interest.\n\n\u201cRepublicans remain rock solid in opposing both the impeachment of President Trump and the House impeachment inquiry. But when it comes to the president\u2019s motives in Ukraine, Republicans aren\u2019t all on the same page. Roughly 7 in 10 Republicans say the president was pursuing the national interest in his dealings with Ukraine. The rest say he was pursuing his own personal interest or they don\u2019t know,\u201d Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17-21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nRECORD SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT IN FOX NEWS POLL\n\nThe release of the poll comes two weeks after a national Fox News Poll indicated 51 percent support for impeaching and removing Trump from office, with 40 percent opposed.", "description": "A new national poll by Quinnipiac University indicates that 55 percent of registered voters support the House Democrats' impeachment investigation into President Trump, with 43 percent opposed.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096821169001_6096817891001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
