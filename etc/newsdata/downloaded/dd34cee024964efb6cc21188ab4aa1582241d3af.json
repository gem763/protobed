On Friday morning, President Trump tweeted that \u201cgood things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting.\u201d (Richard Drew/AP)\n\nThe specter of even a limited trade deal between the United States and China sent stocks surging Friday ahead of a high-stakes meeting between President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 450 points, or 1.7 percent, by late Friday morning. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had climbed 1.7 percent, and Nasdaq composite index 1.9 percent. The gains put all three indexes on course to erase the week\u2019s losses.\n\nInvestors were evidently responding to positive reports following Thursday\u2019s meetings, which Trump said were \u201cgoing really, really well.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump tweeted that \u201cgood things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cI will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!\u201d\n\nTrump then stressed that a trade deal will be easier to finalize because it wouldn\u2019t require congressional approval.\n\n\u201cWhen the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nGood things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nOne of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with a team from Beijing headed by Liu. People familiar with the talks told The Washington Post that the Chinese delegation, which included the nation\u2019s central bank chief and hard-line commerce minister, brought a proposal for an \u201cearly harvest\u201d accord.\n\nBeijing also backed away from making any agreement conditional on the elimination of every tariff Trump has imposed since the trade war began last year. Instead, the Chinese are asking that increases planned for Oct. 15 and Dec. 15 \u2014 which would affect scores of popular consumer products \u2014 be canceled and that the United States roll back a recent tariff increase that took effect Sept. 1.\n\nThe two sides also may spotlight a currency agreement that was first made public several months ago, which would rule out manipulating the yuan\u2019s value to gain a trade advantage, the people told The Post.\n\nTrump, who is scheduled to meet Friday afternoon with Liu, has repeatedly rejected the notion of a limited accord, insisting that major changes are required in China\u2019s state-directed economic model to create a more reciprocal trade relationship. But he is under pressure from his supporters, especially in the industrial Midwest and farm belt, to resolve the 15-month standoff.\n\n\u201cBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I?\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday morning.\n\nIf enough progress is made this week, Trump could seal an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping at an Asia-Pacific leaders\u2019 summit in Chile next month.\n\nBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThe trade war has taken some of the wind out of the U.S. economy. A key manufacturing index last week fell to its lowest mark in a decade, business investment has turned negative and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for bringing the talks to a conclusion \u201csoon\u201d to ease the burden on rural America.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices jumped 2 percent Friday after Reuters reported that an Iranian-owned oil tanker had been struck, probably by missiles, in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia\u2019s coast. The incident had yet to be independently confirmed but was circulating in Iranian media, sometimes with contradictory information. Still, such an incident would probably escalate already-heated tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia and become the latest flash point involving oil tankers in the Gulf.\n\n[Trump to meet with top Chinese official as trade talks reach critical stage]\n\nThe preliminary reading for October consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan was also set to be released Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect sentiment to fall to 92 from 93.2 at the end of September.\n\nAmerican consumers, often cited as holding up the global economy, are growing increasingly anxious about the trade war with China. The last survey showed a near-record number of consumers citing trade policies as a drag weighing on the economy.\n\nGlobal markets also were trending up in response to extended Brexit talks between the European Union and Britain. On Friday, the E.U. said that negotiations to find an agreeable divorce deal were back on course. European Council President Donald Tusk said he has \u201creceived promising signals\u201d from Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that a deal was still an option.\n\nProtests in Hong Kong have also bumped up against the trade talks, with China lashing out against Western brands and businesses expressing support for the pro-democracy marches. After the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the protesters over the weekend, the National Basketball Association issued a statement saying it recognized the tweet \u201coffended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\nBut later, Commissioner Adam Silver said the NBA would \u201cnot put itself in position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say.\u201d\n\nStill, China suspended TV broadcasts of NBA games, and many Chinese firms severed their advertising relationships with the league. Trump later pointed fingers at NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, who have been critical of him in the past, alleging they \u201ctalk badly about the United States, but when it [comes to] China they don\u2019t want to say anything bad.\u201d\n\nAnd Wednesday, Apple said it would remove an app that had been used by protesters in Hong Kong to track the movement of police. The app\u2019s developers said Apple was wrong to claim that the tool had been used in a way that threatened public safety.\u201d", "description": "On Friday morning, President Trump tweeted that \u201cgood things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting.\u201d", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter", "David J.
