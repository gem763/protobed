Hong, File/AP Photo south china morning post Hong Kong formally withdraws controversial bill after weeks of unrest\n\nThis story is being published by POLITICO as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post. It first appeared on scmp.com on Sep. 4, 2019.\n\nEmbattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has formally withdrawn the much-despised extradition bill that sparked the nearly three-month long protest crisis now roiling the city, confirming the Post\u2019s exclusive report earlier on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShe will also set up an investigative platform to look into the fundamental causes of the social unrest and suggest solutions for the way forward, stopping short of turning it into a full-fledged commission of inquiry, as demanded by protesters.\n\nThe decision to withdraw the bill will mean that the government is finally acceding to at least one of the five demands of the protesters, who have taken to the streets over the past 13 weeks to voice not just their opposition to the legislation, but the overall governance of the city in demonstrations that have become increasingly violent.\n\nApart from the formal withdrawal of the legislation, the protesters have asked for the government to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate police conduct in tackling the protests, grant amnesty to those who have been arrested, stop characterizing the protests as riots, and restart the city\u2019s stalled political reform process.\n\nWhether they will view the investigative committee as adequate in meeting the call for a commission remains to be seen. On the bill withdrawal, a government source said that Lam will emphasize that the move was a technical procedure to streamline the legislative agenda, with the Legislative Council set to reopen in October after its summer break.\n\nLam had earlier suspended the bill, which would have allowed for the extradition of criminals to jurisdictions with which the city lacked a treaty, including the mainland, but critics have not been satisfied.\n\nThey argued that for as long as the bill remained on the legislative agenda, there was every chance it could be resuscitated within the Legislative Council\u2019s current term which ends next year.\n\nThe chief executive dug her heels in, saying the bill was suspended to signal that the government\u2019s intention \u2014 to close existing loopholes to the legislation to go after criminals who were treating the city as a safe haven \u2014 remained a worthy and legitimate goal.\n\nA day after she suspended the bill, an estimated 2 million people took to the streets on June 16, and more protests have since followed.\n\nThe chief executive then declared the bill to be \u201cdead\u201d, stressing that there was not a chance that it would be tabled. Critics again lambasted her for being prideful in not wanting to be seen to be backing down.\n\nLast weekend saw some of the fiercest battles between protesters and police, as the force launched a wave of mass arrests on the eve of a banned march, and demonstrators lobbed 100 petrol bombs at targets such as police headquarters and stations and government buildings.\u201c\n\nThis gesture to formally withdraw is a bid to cool down the atmosphere,\u201d a source said.\n\nAnother source said the full withdrawal of the bill was the easiest way to ease ongoing tensions in the city.\n\n\u201cThe chief executive started to change her mind after meeting with 19 city leaders two weeks ago. She heeded their views on how to de-escalate the tensions,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn August 24, some 19 senior city leaders and politicians gathered at Lam\u2019s residence to brainstorm how to broker a dialogue with those behind Hong Kong\u2019s crippling anti-government protest crisis\n\nLam is due to meet her pro-establishment allies this afternoon at her official residence in Government House, other sources said.\n\nAll 43 pro-establishment lawmakers were invited on Tuesday night to meet Carrie Lam at 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Hong Kong deputies to the National People\u2019s Congress and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference have also been invited to attend the afternoon meeting.\n\nTik Chi-yuen, chairman of the political group, Third Side, and one of the attendees at the Aug. 24 meeting, said the withdrawal of the bill, and the launch of an independent inquiry, were practical ways for the government to show sincerity in engaging in dialogue with various sectors.\n\nAnalysts said there were critical differences between the suspension and withdrawal of a bill.\n\nExperts on parliamentary procedures said that with a suspension, the legislation was technically still alive and, in theory, could be reintroduced by way of a straightforward notice from the government to the Legislative Council president.\n\nIt remains on the books as part of the government\u2019s legislative agenda, but its shelf life will exist in sync with the current term of Legco, which ends in July 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the government tried to enact the national security law, a constitutional duty under Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city\u2019s mini-constitution. Back then half a million people took to the streets in opposition.\n\nThen chief executive Tung Chee-hwa first delayed the second reading of the draft bill on the national security law in July, and promised to listen to public opinion and study the draft bill again. But faced with doubts, Tung withdrew the bill entirely two months later.\n\nIn anticipation of Lam\u2019s announcement, the Hang Seng benchmark index had jumped 952 points or 3.73 per cent to 26,359 as of 3:25 p.m.\n\nU.S. stock futures expiring in September jumped as well. As of 3 p.m., the Dow Jones futures jumped 190 points or 0.72 per cent to 26,323, while S&P 500 futures rose 23 points to 2,929. Nasdaq 100 futures leapt 83.75 points or 1 per cent to 7,701.\n\nOn LIHKG, the Reddit-like site popular with protesters, the immediate reaction appeared of scepticism as commentators said the withdrawal was coming too little too late. They said the key demand now was to hold the police force accountable, as clashes with them had turned increasingly violent.\n\nLam\u2019s decision comes a day before she leaves for Nanning in Guangxi for the annual pan-Pearl River Delta regional cooperation conference. It will mark her first official trip outside the city since the protests began on June 9. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung will be acting chief executive.", "description": "The extradition bill sparked the nearly three-month long protest crisis now roiling Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Scmp Reporters", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1b/d9/fb6d3d7b4223bf122359079457bd/190904-carrie-lam-ap-773.jpg"}
