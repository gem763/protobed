Danica Roem pictured on her first day in office during the opening session of the House of Delegates at the Virginia State Capitol in January 2017.\n\nVirginia Delegate Danica Roem, who beat a 26-year incumbent in 2017 to become the third openly transgender person ever elected to a state legislature, is up for reelection next month. The race is a key test of whether Virginia\u2019s shift toward Democrats \u2014 and away from transphobia \u2014 will continue, or whether Republicans can rebound by deemphasizing national and social issues in a rapidly changing state.\n\nRoem won her seat by trouncing then-Del. Bob Marshall, the sponsor of Virginia\u2019s failed \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d after campaigning mostly on traffic issues, which she had covered for 15 years as a local news reporter in Prince William County.\n\nRoem\u2019s opponent this time around, Republican Kelly McGinn, has mimicked Roem\u2019s strategy of keeping the focus off of social issues \u2014 even naming transportation as her biggest campaign priority. But like Marshall before her, McGinn has a long history of advocating against civil rights for LGBTQ people. In a 2011 letter to the state\u2019s social services department, she called LGBTQ adoption \u201ca social experiment on children.\u201d In 2008, McGinn signed a joint letter condemning Catholic politicians who support same-sex marriage, abortion rights and stem cell research. Marshall and national social conservative organizations have donated significant sums to her campaign.\n\n\u201cRepublicans saw that we won [in 2017] by talking about local issues and having a different value set,\u201d said Matt Harringer, the national press secretary at the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, a group that works to elect Democrats to state legislatures. \u201cYou see that in this race where McGinn has a terrible record on LGBTQ rights, she realizes her only chance is talking about anything but her stances on those issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not going to work,\u201d Harringer argued.\n\nRoem\u2019s race is an important one \u2014 not just for its historical relevance, but because the result could cement Virginia\u2019s status as a blue state just in time for the legislature to redraw the state\u2019s maps. If Democrats can gain a hold of both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, they\u2019ll be able to redraw maps that Republicans gerrymandered a decade ago. Roem keeping her seat in Virginia\u2019s 13th District will help them get there.\n\nHow can you serve the people of the 13th District when you\u2019re stigmatizing the very residents you\u2019re running against in the first place? Del. Danica Roem\n\nRoem is ready for another fight, and she has the support of the Democratic Party behind her. She\u2019s raised over $400,000 more than McGinn, with most of her donations coming from Virginians \u2014 though she\u2019s also raked in some major donations from national groups like Emily\u2019s List, Human Rights Campaign and the George Soros-backed Democracy PAC.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a much better place than at this point in 2017,\u201d Roem told HuffPost. \u201cWe knew at this point in 2017 that our ground game was dominant and our ad campaign was dominant \u2014 it was just the anxiety of beating a 26-year incumbent. This time around we didn\u2019t leave anything to chance.\u201d\n\nRoem\u2019s district has been slowly moving to the left. In 2014, for example, 51% of the district voted for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, but by 2016, 62% voted for Democrat Tim Kaine. It\u2019s likely that it will continue to move in that direction, according to Kyle Kondik, managing editor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cIf Roem were to lose it would represent a very significant backslide from where the district is going,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cThe trend is pretty clear that prior to Trump, [District 13] was competitive but more Republican-leaning, but now it\u2019s more Democrat than the state as a whole.\u201d\n\nBut the off-off-year election \u2015 meaning the election is taking place without a congressional midterm or presidential election happening at the same time \u2015 might make for a lower voter turnout, which has historically benefited Republicans, Kondik said.\n\n\u201cThe turnout dynamic is just different in off-off-year elections,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be significantly lower. Republicans are going to hope that it\u2019s going to be a Republican-leaning turnout.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are \u201ctaking nothing for granted,\u201d said Harringer of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nRepublicans were less open to talking about their strategy. When reached by HuffPost for comment, Republican Party of Virginia Executive Director John Findlay replied that this reporter is a \u201cleft-wing hack masquerading as a journalist\u201d and \u201cthe epitome of fake news.\u201d\n\nRoem\u2019s Promises\n\nRoem\u2019s reelection campaign, like her first run for office, has largely focused on local issues, like the fact that commuter buses she called for are beginning to run in her district, her vote to expand Medicaid and her efforts to increase teacher pay.\n\nTransportation is her bread and butter. In August, Roem announced that the state Department of Transportation would begin its study on the most efficient ways to remove stoplights from Northern Virginia\u2019s traffic-clogged Route 28, and the department has, since Roem took office, allocated more than $120 million to fixing the corridor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve delivered on my promises,\u201d she said.\n\nRoem argues that for all of her recent talk about transportation, McGinn is less likely to deliver. Notably, the same day that Roem helped to pass a major transportation reform amendment, McGinn was also present at the Capitol \u2014 to protest abortion rights.\n\n\u201cThat should tell you everything about us,\u201d Roem said. She noted that McGinn\u2019s website does not include a detailed plan for fixing Route 28 and that hers does.\n\nIn a candidate forum on Wednesday night, McGinn maintained that she was praying, not protesting.\n\n\u201cI object to the belief that prayer be characterized as protest,\u201d McGinn said. \u201cI supported and helped women who felt forced to have abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even buy for a minute that she has a plan that she hasn\u2019t presented in eight months of candidacy,\u201d Roem said. \u201cYou see the difference between vague platitudes and actual action items that my constituents can follow.\u201d\n\nMcGinn\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on her platform or political stances.\n\nMcGinn\u2019s Anti-LGBTQ Views\n\nRoem also believes McGinn is out of step with the district on LGBTQ rights issues. Roem said that in her first year in office, two constituents \u2015 a lesbian couple, one of them a trans woman \u2015 invited her to a birthday party for their 1-year-old child. The invitation was emblematic of how having an LGBTQ political leader was meaningful to constituents, Roem felt.\n\n\u201cThat they felt their delegate wanted to celebrate the joy of their life with them, that they wanted their delegate there \u2026 compare that to their prior representation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went from having to fight for their civil rights to inviting [their delegate] to their baby\u2019s birthday party.\u201d\n\nAlthough Roem has campaigned hardest on transportation infrastructure, she has by no means neglected social issues and LGBTQ protections in her district. The local school board in her district voted in support of expanding LGBTQ student protections shortly after she took office, and as a delegate, Roem has spoken out about health care access for the trans community and turned transphobic attacks into campaign donations.\n\n\u201cHow can you serve the people of the 13th District when you\u2019re stigmatizing the very residents you\u2019re running against in the first place?\u201d Roem said.\n\nMcGinn has received a $2,000 donation from Eagle Forum, a group founded by conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly that has applauded Trump\u2019s ban on letting trans Americans serve their country in the armed forces.\n\nRoem has used McGinn\u2019s ties to socially conservative lawmakers, including past Delegate Marshall, to raise support. After Marshall donated $3,000 to McGinn\u2019s campaign, Roem encouraged her constituents and followers to donate to her campaign in response. They raised $3,500 in four hours \u2014 and the average contribution was just $33.\n\n\u201cThe voters get it,\u201d Harringer said. \u201cThey know who their candidates are. And they know Danica better than anybody, because she\u2019s probably knocked on their door before.\u201d", "description": "Roem will face off against socially conservative opponent Kelly McGinn on Nov. 5 in a key test of the state's blue shift.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db0d3cf210000ae2534add2.jpeg?cache=jdgxrxxlko&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
