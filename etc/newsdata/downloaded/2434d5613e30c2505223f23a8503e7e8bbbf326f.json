More than one in three said they owed 70% or more of their success to their sales talents.\n\nSo what sales jobs did they have early on? They sold everything from costume jewelry and cosmetics to used car radios and wheel rims \u2014 and even old egg cartons that could be used as noise insulation.\n\nPlenty of wealthy celebrities and CEOs say they did sales work before becoming rich, too. Kanye West was a salesperson at the Gap; both Johnny Depp and Jennifer Aniston were telemarketers; and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was a door-to-door vacuum-cleaner salesman. \u201cI loved it, strange as that might sound,\u201d Hastings told his former college newspaper. \u201cYou get to meet a lot of different people.\u201d\n\nAnd a separate study of thousands of CEOs from LinkedIn found that sales manager was one of the five most common first jobs for CEOs (consultant was No. 1 on that list \u2014 and it, too, is a role that typically requires sales skills).\n\nExperts say it\u2019s no coincidence that successful people have strong sales skills. \u201cSales skills are very valuable,\u201d says Cheryl Palmer, founder of career coaching firm Call to Career. \u201cEvery company runs on sales.\u201d\n\nEven if you don\u2019t plan to run a company, sales experience is essential, experts say. \u201cEveryone needs a basic understanding of their strengths and how to sell them, because no one else is going to sell them for you,\u201d says Randalyn Hill, a relationship-development specialist with career coaching firm Ama La Vida. \u201cThroughout your entire life and career, you need to advocate for yourself and sell your worth. This will help you get clients, negotiate salaries, secure promotions. The ability to sell yourself is crucial in many aspects of your career journey.\u201d\n\nSo how do you get sales experience if you have none? Palmer suggests applying for positions that are commission-only, as they may be easier to get. \u201cThis is a no-risk proposition for the company. If you do well, they make money. If you don\u2019t, they don\u2019t lose anything,\u201d she explains.\n\nYou can also learn to excel at sales in a side gig. Hill says you could consider looking for a weekend shift as a barista (upselling customers on drinks, for example) or at retail stores, especially those with unusual offerings, as \u201cyou learn how to give convincing advice and sell them on a product they aren\u2019t sure about.\u201d\n\nThere are also plenty of classes that can teach sales skills. Look online for courses (Cornell\u2019s online education offerings include the subject, for example) and at your local university, or consider grabbing a book on the topic.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t instantly good at it, says Hill: \u201cAlmost all selling is uncomfortable at first, but, the more and more you do it, the stronger you get.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2019.", "description": "And why it\u2019s important for all of us to do that job, too.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB669_bill_ZG_20190109150001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-10"}
