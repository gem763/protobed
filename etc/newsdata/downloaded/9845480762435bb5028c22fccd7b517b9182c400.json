Powell will speak at 12:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThat\u2019s only a few hours after the government releases the key August employment report.

They want the Fed to refrain from action in September and take a \u201cwait-and-see stance.\u201d\n\nAnother faction thinks that the Fed has to ease in the face of a weaker global picture.\n\nNot easing would push up the dollar and be tantamount to a rate increase, said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\nIn his speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week, Powell was \u201cskillfully noncommittal\u201d about whether the Fed would cut rates in September, according to Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nRead: Powell says Fed \u2018carefully watching developments\u2019 and \u2018will act as appropriate\u2019\n\nPowell could use the speech to address former New York Fed President William Dudley\u2019s essay this week that suggested the Fed might want to take steps to consider the economic risks of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election when setting interest rates.\n\nThe Fed quickly put out a statement distancing itself from Dudley\u2019s comments, but the controversy has not subsided.\n\nSee: Dudley: I picked a fight with Trump because the Fed didn\u2019t stand up for itself\n\nTrump has castigated the Fed for not cutting interest rates and lowering the value of the dollar relative to U.S. trading partners.
