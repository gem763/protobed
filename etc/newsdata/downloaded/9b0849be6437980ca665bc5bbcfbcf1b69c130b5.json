The overall fire danger index has increased for most of southern Australia over the past 40 years and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre says the trend is expected to continue.\n\nOn Monday, Littleproud told ABC\u2019s Radio National that Australia has been \u201cadapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we\u2019ll have to continue to do that and do that with the best science we\u2019ve got available\u201d.\n\nWhen asked whether human-induced climate change is making bushfires more intense, Littleproud replied: \u201cWe\u2019re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we\u2019ll continue to equip our service workers \u2026 Whether it\u2019s manmade or not is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nThe minister suggested there were \u201cextremes from both sides\u201d of the debate which should be about \u201cdo we want to breathe healthy air\u201d. He said his job was to ensure emergency services \u201care given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe\u201d.\n\nAsked by Guardian Australia why he had avoided taking a position on the effect of manmade climate change, Littleproud replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if climate change is manmade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about practical outcomes, whether that\u2019s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.\u201d\n\nAustralians increasingly fear climate change related drought and extinctions Read more\n\nOn Monday, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, used Senate question time to target Littleproud for his original answer, suggesting he was in effect dismissing the concerns of emergency services chiefs who have warned of climate change\u2019s contribution to fires.\n\nThe agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, rebuked Di Natale for \u201cpoliticising bushfires which right now are affecting landholders, homes, environmental assets and farmers in communities in Queensland and north-east NSW\u201d.\n\nMcKenzie \u2013 answering on behalf of Littleproud \u2013 said the minister and she had been \u201cvery upfront \u2026 about the fact that the climate is changing\u201d. \u201cThere is variability around the climate.\u201d\n\nAsked if she accepted that human-induced climate change is making bushfires worse, McKenzie replied: \u201cOur government has made very clear that we take climate change seriously.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Di Natale repeated the tactic \u2013 this time targeting resources and northern Australia minister Matt Canavan, who again accused the Greens of using the tragedy in \u201ccombustible fashion\u201d to further the party\u2019s own political cause.\n\nCanavan quoted a NSW environment department report which suggested there was \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d of the impact of climate change on bushfire risk, although the report concluded it will likely increase bushfire risk.\n\nCanavan said the Liberal-National Coalition supported \u201csensible responses to climate change that included support for the high-quality coal and gas that we produce in this country\u201d. \u201cIt is through the high-quality production of energy that we will respond to climate change and reduce emissions,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, four Coalition MPs raised the issue of drought and natural disasters in the joint party room, urging practical options to help regional businesses including shops that are not eligible for drought assistance.\n\nSeveral others raised the issue of insurance in north Queensland, which is subject to monsoonal troughs and severe tropical cyclones. The MPs complained of exorbitant premium rises of between 300% and 500% and argued the situation is a market failure with insurers warning it is no longer profitable to insure areas including Townsville.\n\nThe MPs suggested reducing regulatory barriers to encourage smaller insurers or mutuals to offer insurance. Scott Morrison directed the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, to meet northern Queensland MPs; Sukkar said he was already working with the competition regulator on the issue.", "description": "Minister tells Guardian he is unsure of causes of crisis, saying he wants farmers to have tools to adapt to change", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6ac36785967bc84a214a5b70e8aa0fec89f3bb/0_163_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0fbd98a6cf81f5777404f6b767deb7ae", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
