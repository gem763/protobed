Funnily enough, I\u2019m not in the market for a \u00a3126 stone essential oil diffuser. But these words set all my alarm bells ringing.\u2019\n\nThe Good Morning Britain presenter believes that the article is \u2018offending\u2019 and could be \u2018open to misinterpretation\u2019, particularly by fans of Gwyneth who aspire to have a figure like hers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe later stated that the 47-year-old needs to be more cautious at the fact that the articles commissioned for her business could be misinterpreted by those reading them.\n\n\u2018Gwyneth\u2019s response is to say she doesn\u2019t read everything on Goop. That\u2019s not good enough,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018You are accountable to people who look up to you, and if her website \u2013 which is reportedly worth millions \u2013 promotes advice that might be misinterpreted by those susceptible to eating disorders, that accountability isn\u2019t being upheld.\n\nGwyneth\u2019s wellness brand has proven to be controversial (Picture: Getty Images for Goop)\n\n\u2018Gwyneth may claim she\u2019s just as entitled as anyone else to share opinions online, but the truth is people buy into products endorsed by celebrities, so we have to be extra careful.\u2019\n\nThis is just the latest in a long line of controversies that the Goop brand has had to face.\n\nThe practice of vaginal steaming was previously endorsed by the company, which claims to \u2018cleanse the uterus\u2019 and detox the vagina, but it has also been criticised for the lack of scientific evidence behind it to prove it is beneficial, with one woman being left with severe burns as a result of the practice.\n\nAnd in September 2018, Goop settled a $145,000 (\u00a3110,000) lawsuit which accused them of false advertising \u2018not supported by competent and reliable science\u2019 after promoting jade vaginal eggs and other products.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
