It had earlier forecast 2019 EPS at 0.25 to 0.29 euros, and 2020 EPS in the range of 0.37 to 0.42 euros.\n\nNokia reported a slip in underlying earnings to 0.05 euros per share during the July to September period, compared to 0.06 euros a year ago, but in line with 0.05 euros forecast in a Refinitiv poll.\n\nThe report is in stark contrast to rival Ericsson <ERICb.ST> which last week beat quarterly earnings expectations and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020, saying demand for superfast 5G networks was taking off more quickly than expected.\n\n5G networks are at the centre of a technology battle between United States and China, as they are expected to host critical functions from driverless vehicles to smart electric grids and military communications, underscoring their importance to national security.\n\nNokia said it now has 48 commercial 5G deals and 15 live networks.\n\nNokia counts Sweden's Ericsson and China's Huawei [HWT.UL] as its main rivals, and some analysts say the Nordic companies may benefit from challenges faced by Huawei after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - charges Huawei denies.\n\n\n\n\n\n($1 = 0.8980 euros)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tarmo Virki and Anne Kauranen; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Rashmi Aich)", "description": "Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia  on Thursday reported third-quarter profit in-line with expectations but lowered its full-year profit forecasts for 2019 and 2020, citing tough competition and additional investments.
