But here we are: after an overwhelmingly productive half-decade of unofficial releases and collaborations, Charli is an album proper, a diminishingly important semantic distinction but one that puts the 27-year-old firmly at its heart.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Charli XCX: Charli album art work\n\nHer last mixtape, 2017\u2019s Pop 2, centred outsider guests in 10 diamond-hard would-be hits, laced with hard-partying nihilism and numbed with a measure of Auto-Tune that made Cher\u2019s Believe sound like Etta James singing At Last. While Charli\u2019s left-field guests and themes (ie \u201cI go hard, I go fast and I never look back\u201d) are superficially similar, here she balances world-straddling confidence with unprecedented exposure of the anxieties and self-destruction that stymie her relationships, turning her from pop powerhouse to empathetic protagonist.\n\nHer bluff nature is written through the tracklist. She cops to lying, to running away, to smothering the pain with ever more work and drugs (stories that hit harder because she rarely uses metaphor) then detonates gems like Click, which ties the sound of selfie shutters, cash-register pings and impatient snapped fingers into a bristling, braggy blowout. The pared-back, twinkling Official is as detailed and exposing as an X-rated Taylor Swift song, XCX reminding her on-off lover about the \u201cthings you save when I make bad decisions / things that we do by the sink in my kitchen\u201d. Immediately, she explodes the vulnerability with Shake It, a multilingual celebration of grinding, fleshsport rendered in warped, inhuman processing.\n\nWhile XCX paints herself as intimacy-phobic, the way she brings out the best in her collaborators tells a different story. Her chemistry with Troye Sivan makes the asinine throwback 1999 irresistible (although the Michael Jackson reference is unfortunate), and she gives fellow embattled pop star Sky Ferreira a taste of freedom on the gothic, lurching Cross You Out. But it\u2019s on the metallic battering ram of Gone that XCX finds her match in Christine and the Queens: the fantastic vocal interplay between XCX\u2019s cynicism and Chris\u2019s roguishness forging not only a protective allegiance against an indifferent industry, but the ingenuity that will reshape it in her image.", "description": "The embattled singer reveals her anxieties and coaxes brilliance from various guests in a candid, confident third album", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22eb0904e58ee6383bfdcac5deb52d3840c2c690/0_158_4734_2840/master/4734.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4daccc25828f4e02d2a0473e592e8278", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
