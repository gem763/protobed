The Man Behind Them Is Just as Surprising.", "language": "en", "text": "CAIRO \u2014 Under the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, so little dissent is allowed \u2014 and what little there is comes at such a high price \u2014 that when just a few hundred people across the country called for Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s ouster in a burst of scattered protests on Friday night, it came as a shock.\n\nThe apparent trigger for the demonstrations was almost as unexpected: Mohamed Ali, a 45-year-old construction contractor and part-time actor who says he got rich building projects for the Egyptian military and then left for Spain to live in self-imposed exile, where he began posting videos on social media accusing Mr. el-Sisi of corruption and hypocrisy.\n\nIn the three weeks since his first video appeared, Mr. Ali has reinvented himself as a whistle-blower, an el-Sisi antagonist and a protest guru, and his tales of corruption at the top have transformed him into a leading voice of opposition to the president. When the protests erupted, it was at the time and date Mr. Ali had urged from afar.\n\nBut the extent, and durability, of Mr. Ali\u2019s out-of-nowhere influence \u2014 and his ability to spur further demonstrations \u2014 remains to be seen. His surge from obscurity to prominence has also raised questions in Egypt about whether his sudden fame has been helped along or exploited by powerful interest groups in the country, inside or outside the government.", "description": "The videos of a potty-mouthed millionaire, who cheerfully insults the president, spurred protests across Egypt.
