I was just trying to get another sevens contract and it has been a few crazy years which I have really enjoyed.\n\n\"If someone had said I would be here at the World Cup four years later, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. At that time, it wasn\u2019t even a thought that I was good enough and would want to be back in XVs. It is a dream come true.\"\n\nCokanasiga was only 17 at the time of the opening ceremony, and the thought of one day playing at a World Cup hadn\u2019t yet entered his head either.\n\nStory continues\n\nPODCAST \ud83c\udf99\n\n\n\nHe's starting at 11 for England on Thursday...and he's also the star of the latest episode of the England Rugby Podcast: O2 Inside Line.\n\n\n\nHere's what happened when @vernonkay met @bathrugby and England wing @J_cokanasiga: https://t.co/xXOnTbxgWT #WearTheRose pic.twitter.com/ZmqI9MuXWz \u2014 England Rugby (@EnglandRugby) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cI remember watching that final - thinking, 'this is unbelievable' - and imagining getting the chance to play in one of these games,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt feels weird (that I am) playing on Thursday. I didn\u2019t think it would be possible and I feel grateful. Every day is a dream.\"\n\nIndeed, you don\u2019t even have to look back as far as 2015 to find a time when these two were still the longest of shots to be here in Japan.\n\nOnly a year ago, McConnochie had not pulled on the Blue, Black and White of Bath, let alone the Red Rose, after switching from sevens to XVs.\n\nCokanasiga might be the younger of the two, but his shot at the big time came sooner.\n\nCalled up by Eddie Jones for the trip to Argentina back in 2017, then soon bounced out again.\n\nUncapped and unsure of his own abilities, Jones then publically aired concerns about Cokanasiga's fitness and attitude and it looked like his time would not come for RWC 2019.\n\nBut a move from London Irish to Bath has paid dividends.\n\n\u201cI have definitely matured,\u201d says the 21-year-old.\n\n\u201cAt that time I didn\u2019t know what I had to do to be an international player.\n\n\u201cI gave myself a kick, I realised you have got to work hard for this stuff. I feel I have definitely developed into that type of player now.\u201d\n\nEngland were not short of back three options. The names just roll off the tongue. Anthony Watson, Elliot Daly, Jonny May, Jack Nowell, Mike Brown, Chris Ashton, Denny Solomona. It keeps going, Marland Yarde, Christian Wade. These guys were surely ahead in the pecking order.\n\nBut Cokanasiga got his chance last autumn, and two tries in two Tests caught the eye.\n\nHis real coming out party though was the jaw-dropping Six Nations debut against Italy in March.\n\nThe Twickenham crowd could not quite believe what they were seeing, the blend of power and pace had pundits, both armchair and expert, comparing the youngster to Jonah Lomu and Israel Folau.\n\nAnd he has not looked back ever since.\n\nMcConnochie might not be blessed with that same physicality. But he makes up for it with his quick feet and even quicker brain.\n\nThe Olympic silver medallist has a natural feel for the game as an elusive runner with enough versatility to pique Jones\u2019 interest.\n\nAnd the West Country teammates are clearly big fans of one another as well. Cokanasiga calls McConnochie \u2018impossible to stop\u2019.\n\nMcConnochie meanwhile, is happy to pay tribute to the gentle giant who has shown him the way.\n\n\"I got to know Joe at the back end of August and to go through his journey with him getting his England debut in the autumn and learning off him,\u201d said McConnochie.\n\n\"In his own way, he is a world-class winger and it is great to go through that journey learning from one of the best wingers out there.\n\n\"The obvious difference between us is size and he is a beast. He is 118kg and one of the quickest in the squad. He is a thoroughbred winger. I like to think of myself being able to play the back three positions. We complement each other well.\"\n\nMcConnochie\u2019s debut did not come until this August, and it was a delayed one at that.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 Awesome to have one of my brothers able to experience my first cap. Both have helped so much in my journey and wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near where I am now without them or the rest of my family! pic.twitter.com/ZTfpjRLeiI \u2014 Ruaridh McConnochie (@ruaridhmcc) September 16, 2019\n\nThe winger twice pulled up lame on the eve of his Test bow before finally getting his chance at St James\u2019 Park against Italy.\n\nThat was barely a Test match in all honesty, more two sides going through the motions with their minds in Japan if not yet their bodies.\n\nThursday in the Kobe Misaki Stadium will be something different altogether. The white-hot pressure of a World Cup pool game against an improving USA who are sniffing an upset.\n\nBut there will be familiar faces wherever McConnochie looks. Not just his clubmate on the other wing. But also his father and step-mother who will be in the crowd, and even his opposite man Martin Iosefo, a fellow sevens convert.\n\n\"You couldn\u2019t make it up. I have known Martin for the last three years and we were both travelling reserves at the Olympics and both ended up playing,\u201d added McConnochie.\n\n\u201cIt is quite a cool story that we now end up playing against each other at the World Cup.\n\n\"My dad and step-mum are coming out, arriving tomorrow, and they always say they planned this because they knew it would be my first match having not been there for my debut (in Newcastle against Italy). It is good timing.\"\n\nAs for Cokanasiga, his mum is en route and will arrive in Kobe on Wednesday, before his sister and girlfriend join them next week.\n\n\"I am really excited, and it has been such a long build up and I cannot wait,\u201d added the winger, whose shyness belies his hulking frame.\n\n\"Everyone has their skills that make them shine and it is a case of making sure everything gels together and for me to get involved as much as I can.\n\n\"I have matured over the last two years and I gave myself a kick and told myself what I had to do to develop into that type of player.\"\n\nThese two Bath boys have surprised even themselves in making it to the big dance. Now they just need to move their feet.\n\nBe part of the greatest rugby tour of them all and follow The British & Irish Lions in South Africa. www.lionsrugby.com/tours\n\n\n\n", "description": "Four years ago, the closest Joe Cokanasiga got to the World Cup was as a Fijian war dancer at the opening ceremony.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cJnsuibYFOJTtQwqZ5.EwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMDEzLjMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzQ-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wFuLku1AhHkK4WBjsoLPtQ--~B/aD0zMDkzO3c9MzkwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/fbe4ef60-df3b-11e9-bfc3-c6a7bcced0b8", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
