They refused to characterize what Hill said, or whether she was credible.\n\n\u201cThat one is not a simple question -- yes or no,\u201d said Representative Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican. But he did say that if the president had been inside the hearing room, and heard Hill\u2019s testimony, he \u201cwould be excited about being able to tell you what he heard in there.\u201d\n\nFormer Pompeo Adviser to Testify Wednesday (6:45 p.m.)\n\nMichael McKinley, who resigned last week as a senior adviser to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, is scheduled to speak with House impeachment investigators on Wednesday, according to multiple officials familiar with the plans.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s testimony will be followed two days later, on Friday, with an appearance by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper, the officials said.\n\nBoth will testify behind closed doors. Members of the three committees -- Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight -- are investigating Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nThe news of their appearances came as Hill, who was until recently Trump\u2019s top aide on Russia and Europe, was still testifying Monday evening. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent is scheduled to appear Tuesday, and Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, is set to testify Thursday.\n\nKent, who remains an employee of the State Department, is expected to testify Tuesday under subpoena, says an official working on the impeachment inquiry. Other witnesses have been issued subpoenas to give them legal cover to appear against the wishes of the White House.\n\nState Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, who had also been scheduled for Thursday, is no longer scheduled to appear that day. It could not be learned if he is to be rescheduled.\n\nRepublicans Object as Ex-Trump Aide Hill Testifies (1:30 p.m.)\n\nRepublicans on the three committees conducting the investigation objected to Hill testifying behind closed doors.\n\nRepresentative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania said Democrats were conducting \u201cpartisan star chamber\u201d proceedings.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said previous witnesses testified privately \u201cand not a single thing was said that was classified\u201d or shouldn\u2019t be made public.\n\nDemocrat Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, defended closed-door hearings, saying Republicans are upset they are losing a forum to serve as the president\u2019s defenders. He said some witnesses may be called to testify publicly later.\n\nFormer Trump Aide Hill Arrives for Testimony (9:14 a.m.)\n\nHill arrived at the Capitol to give closed-door testimony Monday to the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry focusing on Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nHill\u2019s testimony kicks off what could be a pivotal week in the probe, with at least three other witnesses scheduled to appear before the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees.\n\nHill served as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council until this summer. She left the post before the controversial July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- House committees investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine heard Monday from former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill, who left the administration last summer.Here are the latest developments:Two Parties, Two Views of Testimony (10:15 p.m.)Democrats", "authors": ["Billy House", "Steven T.
