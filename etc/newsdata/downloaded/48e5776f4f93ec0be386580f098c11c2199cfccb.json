People are shifting and moving from trains into planes, and more and more people are flying as the economy grows, as disposable incomes increase,\" Singh told CNBC at the India Economic Summit. He added that airlines are operating \"in an environment where our costs are among the highest and our fares are amongst the lowest.\"\n\nIndia is considered to be one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, but not every airline has been able to weather the challenging operating environment.\n\nJet Airways, which was once India's biggest private carrier, stopped flying in April after the company ran out of cash. In June, it filed for bankruptcy after its lenders failed to agree on a revival plan. On the other hand, the Indian government is still struggling to sell debt-laden national carrier Air India, and Reuters reported last month that New Delhi could be open to selling a partial stake in the airline to a foreign competitor.\n\nSingh pointed out airlines are struggling because India has high taxes on aviation turbine fuel; carriers also pay high airport charges as well as duties on aircraft parts that are re-imported after repair.\n\n\"I think it's time we made the structural changes that are required in aviation and made Indian aviation competitive with our peers around the world,\" he said. That includes ensuring India's aviation fuel costs, import duties and airport charges are on par with other countries in the region. If that happens, aviation can give a boost to tourism and the economy, Singh added.", "description": "Some, like Jet Airways, have filed for bankruptcy process while others, like the government-owned Air India, are in heavy debt.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106163725-1570158020000gettyimages-91298531.jpeg?v=1570158367", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
