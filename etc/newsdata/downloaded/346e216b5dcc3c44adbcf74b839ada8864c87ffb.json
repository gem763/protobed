Do you want a ride? Or do you want to see food delivery options near you?\n\nKhosrowshahi said the company is testing the new experience in nine countries around the world, but did not specify when the update is expected to launch.\n\nThe chief exec did say on Thursday that because some users will inevitably just want to use Uber for ride-hailing, the company will offer a separate app just for that service. Khosrowshahi also did not specify when this side-car app would be launching.\n\nThe app overhaul comes as Uber announced a slew of safety updates on Thursday including a four-digit PIN system for riders to make sure they're getting into the right car with the right driver. Uber is also updating its facial recognition technology to help ensure its verified drivers are indeed the ones driving.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "At an event on Thursday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi unveiled the new vision for the ride-hailing giant, including a major overhaul of its app.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/c2922e3c367b423c85b69cc9ab1bbf68.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
