At least 85 per cent of villages in the Amazon, a vast region that spans eight countries and the French territory of Guiana, cannot celebrate Mass every week. Some see a priest only once a year.", "description": "Pope Francis has urged Roman Catholic Church leaders to make bold changes to better protect the Amazon and its indigenous people at the start of a three-week meeting that could become one of the most controversial moments in his papacy.", "authors": ["Andrea Vogt", "Reuters News Agency", "Nick Timothy", "Sara Khan", "Tim Stanley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212184166-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
