(Photo: Hulu,Photo: Freeform)\n\nMarvel\u2019s Runaways returns in December, but the kids won\u2019t be alone. They\u2019ll be joined by the stars of Freeform\u2019s Cloak and Dagger in a crossover event. Gizmodo had a chance to ask the Runaways\u2019 cast and executive producers all about it last weekend at New York Comic Con.\n\nDuring an interview at Gizmodo's studio at NYCC, Deputy Editor Jill Pantozzi chatted with the cast and crew of Runaways about the upcoming crossover with Cloak and Dagger.\n\nThe event is something the showrunners have said they\u2019ve been trying to do for a long time, and the cast told Gizmodo the Freeform stars \u2014 Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph \u2014 brought new energy to the show. Gregg Sulkin, who plays Chase, said it helped unite everyone after such a \u201cchallenging season,\u201d with co-star Rhenzy Feliz (Alex) noting that we\u2019ll get to see a lot of interplay with their powers... and a few nasty jabs back and forth.\n\nThe episode will also open up Cloak and Dagger\u2019s story in a significant way, as it looks to mark the first time those two characters have met any other teenagers with powers. Given how isolated they\u2019ve been, it will probably be a big deal for them to learn they\u2019re not actually alone.\n\nJeph Loeb, Executive VP Marvel Television: Just to be clear there\u2019s... there is no Netflix in any of that but in the\u2014\n\nGizmodo: But there was a Netflix character, I believe one of Missy\u2019s cop friends in the Freeform show.\n\nLoeb: Oh that part, ok got it. Wow, you\u2019re really playing \u2014 Look, all I do is get in trouble for saying it\u2019s all connected, but folks, it is all connected. This was an opportunity that we talked about really in season one. The young heroes of the Marvel Universe have always had a relationship with each other.\n\nStephanie Savage, showrunner: Cloak and Dagger are in The Runaways books, so it\u2019s always been something that we wanted to do. And this year it just really made sense, in terms of the story that we were telling and how our story connects to something that is happening also in their world.\n\nJosh Schwartz, showrunner: It was also something, the cast all knows each other from the different shows and it was something they were excited about doing. And I think we\u2019ve all been very proactively knocking on Jeph\u2019s door and saying, \u201cCan we do it this year Jeph, please?\u201d And so this was the year that it all came together and it\u2019s gonna be great.\n\nGregg Sulkin (Chase): To be honest, this season was a very challenging season for all of us. I think having Olivia and Aubrey come into our world really helped us. They brought such great energy to set and it united everybody. Then carried on with their energy even when they had left and used what we had, you know, taken from the episode and really tried to finish the season strongly. So we loved having them on set.\n\nRhenzy Feliz (Alex): Yeah it was pretty awesome. Also, you know, Cloak and Dagger, just to get to see their powers sort of mix with ours. The dynamics of us, you know, as we banter a lot on the show and sort of crack jokes back at each other \u2014 sometimes meanly \u2014 but it\u2019s like sort of getting to see them jump into that fold. And that was super fun.\n\nGetting to see, you know, powers sort of meshed together that was... I can\u2019t wait to watch, because we\u2019re doing this [makes a hand motion] all day \u2014 well, we\u2019re not, she\u2019s doing this all day [gestures toward Allegra Acosta (Molly)]. They\u2019re doing these things all day without anything there. When we actually get to see it. I\u2019m excited for that.\n\nAllegra Acosta: In addition, I think at the point that Cloak and Dagger are now, they have no idea that other kids have powers like they do. And it\u2019s really exciting to play with that dynamic. And I think when they come together it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re expanding onto a whole new world of what Marvel can do in the TV world.\n\nAnd just to see that onscreen for the first time with our show works, we\u2019re extremely lucky, and we\u2019re extremely blessed to have them on. They\u2019re also just amazing, amazing people and they really took on their roles proudly and they just really fit well with our show.", "description": "Marvel\u2019s Runaways returns in December, but the kids won\u2019t be alone.
