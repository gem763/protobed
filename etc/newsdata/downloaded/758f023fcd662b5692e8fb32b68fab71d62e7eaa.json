(AP/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nAnthony Davis returned to the court for the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday after a minor thumb injury, and looks like he hasn\u2019t missed a step.\n\nDavis was in a groove Wednesday night at the Staples Center, nearly dropping a triple-double in their dominant 126-93 win against the Golden State Warriors. Davis finished with eight points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in 28 minutes in his home debut for the Lakers, and seemed to have no issue facilitating their offense.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDavis sprained his right thumb in their preseason game against the Brooklyn Nets in China on Saturday, and missed their game against the Warriors on Monday, too. He was cleared on Wednesday morning, however, after both an MRI came back clean and he felt comfortable at the team shootaround.\n\nHe proved that almost instantly, too, expertly throwing up a perfect lob to JaVale McGee just minutes into the game.\n\nDavis had a fantastic assist to Alex Caruso under the hoop after putting the moves on Kavion Pippen to close out the first half, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nHandles like a guard. Passes like a guard. Dominates like nothing else.\n\n\n\n(\ud83d\udcfa: @SpectrumSN + @espn) pic.twitter.com/HKMI8leLFf \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) October 17, 2019\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t score as much as he did earlier in the preseason \u2014 Davis averaged 19 points in nearly 22 minutes in their first two outings before his injury \u2014 his chemistry with the Lakers\u2019 offense is still incredibly strong.\n\n\u201cIt feels good knowing that you don\u2019t have to do much, everybody has a role,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen you have guys all over the board who can score the basketball, you don\u2019t need to do everything every possession.

He joked to LeBron that it's been rare that his team has been ahead by 30 when he's scored just 5 or 6 points.\n\n\n\n\"It feels good to be able to just, you know, fit in.\" pic.twitter.com/SVcUT635OH \u2014 Kyle Goon (@kylegoon) October 17, 2019\n\nWith the thumb injury now behind him, Davis made it clear once again that he\u2019s capable of being the piece the Lakers needed to make waves in the league this season \u2014 even if it is still just the preseason.\n\nLeBron James\u2019 court vision remains unmatched\n\nJames may be 34-years-old and entering his 17th season in the league, but his court vision remains unmatched.\n\nHe proved that yet again on Wednesday night.\n\nLate in the third quarter, James caught the ball near mid-court and pushed the fast break, driving right at the rim. As Warriors forward Juan Toscano-Anderson attempted to stop him, James whipped the ball to Danny Green in the corner in a way that only he could \u2014 with his offhand behind his head as he fell to the floor under the hoop.\n\nWith time to spare, Green easily drilled the three-point bucket.\n\nYear 17 and LeBron\u2019s court vision is STILL 20/20 \ud83d\udc40pic.twitter.com/MMzkVeiwxt \u2014 Yahoo Sports NBA (@YahooSportsNBA) October 17, 2019\n\nJames finished the night with 18 points and 11 assists, shooting 6-of-9 from the field in 25 minutes.\n\n\u201cHis ability to read help is maybe the best ever,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said, via Harrison Sanford. \u201cWherever the help is coming from he\u2019s able to just find, identify and find and deliver the ball right on target time and time again.
