We will always be brothers.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we are so busy but I love him dearly.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the stuff is created out of nothing but as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nMeghan, who has also been rumoured to have feuded with Kate Middleton, described the past year as \u201chard\u201d and said her British friends warned her not to marry Harry.\n\nMeghan, 38, has had to face an increasingly hostile press since she married into the Royal Family last year, with the tabloids luxuriating in stories about her fractured American family and the rumours of palace rifts.\n\nThe couple launched legal action this month against British tabloid the Mail on Sunday for invasion of privacy.\n\nThe US-born former actress said she had tried to cope by putting on a \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d but she was not prepared for the intensity of tabloid interest.\n\nMeghan said: \u201cWhen I first met my now-husband my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life\u2019.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she can cope, Meghan said: \u201cIn all honesty I have said for a long time to H \u2014 that is what I call him \u2014 it\u2019s not enough to just survive something, that\u2019s not the point of life.
