The right-hander first met with pitching strategist Jeremy Accardo and then manager Mickey Callaway, and he eventually had a half-hour sit-down with general manager Brodie Van Wagenen but reportedly wasn't satisfied with the results of those meetings.\n\nSyndergaard allowed four earned runs in five innings of what became a 10-7 loss to the fellow wild-card contenders. On Monday, Callaway spoke to reporters, addressing the report regarding Syndergaard's frustrations:\n\nCallaway added, \"It's not about making guys happy. It's about winning,\" per Anthony DiComo of MLB.com.\n\nHis struggles with the veteran catcher have been pronounced this season, compiling a 5.09 ERA in 15 games with Ramos behind the plate. Syndergaard has been much better when throwing to backup Tomas Nido, producing a 2.45 ERA in 10 starts.\n\nRene Rivera caught Syndergaard for the first time this season in his previous start last Monday, resulting in seven shutout innings with 10 strikeouts and zero walks.\n\nDespite the stark contrast, the front office \"believes the pitcher-catcher dynamic is overstated,\" per Sherman and Kernan.\n\nWhat complicates the matter is Ramos is by far the team's best offensive catching option, entering Monday with a .298 batting average, .360 on-base percentage and 14 home runs. He was on fire in August with a .434 batting average while continuing a hit streak that eventually ended at 26 games.\n\nOn the other hand, Nido has hit .200 in 41 games this year, while the 35-year-old Rivera is a .221 career hitter.\n\nConsidering Ramos also signed a two-year, $19 million deal in the offseason, it seems the Mets are happy to stick with their starting catcher as often as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mets considered trading Syndergaard before the July deadline, and the latest confrontation could motivate the team to make a move in the offseason despite having two more years under team control.", "description": "Noah Syndergaard reportedly hasn't enjoyed throwing to catcher  Wilson Ramos  this season, and it led to a confrontation with  New York Mets  leadership...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/292/hi-res-c9b56218418667d73542c95b5b3a9aef_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
