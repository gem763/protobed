Kaelin, Jr, Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability,\u201d the Nobel Committee announced Monday.\n\nThe discoveries made by the three men \u201chave fundamental importance for physiology and have paved the way for promising new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and many other diseases,\u201d said the Karolinska Institute.\n\nThe trio \u2014 Kaelin and Semenza are Americans, and Ratcliffe is British \u2014 will share equally the 9 million kronor ($918,000) cash award. It is the 110th prize in the category that has been awarded since 1901.\n\nKaelin works at Harvard, Semenza at Johns Hopkins University and Ratcliffe is at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain.\n\nIn announcing the prize, the Nobel Committee said the work by the three laureates has \u201cgreatly expanded our knowledge of how physiological response makes life possible.\u201d The Committee said that Semenza, Ratcliffe and Kaelin found \u201cthe molecular switch for how to adapt\u201d when oxygen levels in the body vary, noting that the most fundamental job for cells is to convert oxygen to food and that cells and tissues constantly experience changes in oxygen availability.\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary of the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, said he was able to call all three laureates Monday. But he reached Kaelin via his sister who gave him two phone numbers \u2014 the first one was a wrong number.\n\n\u201cHe was really happy,\u201d Perlmann told a news conference.\n\nThe announcement kicked off Nobel week. The Nobel Physics prize is handed out Tuesday and the following day is the chemistry prize.\n\nThis year\u2019s double-header Literature Prizes \u2014 one each for 2018 and 2019 \u2014 will be awarded Thursday and the Peace Prize will be announced on Friday.\n\nThe economics prize will be awarded on Oct. 14.\n\nThe 2018 literature prize was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The body plans to award it this year, along with announcing the 2019 laureate.\n\nPrize founder Alfred Nobel \u2014 a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite \u2014 decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nHe specifically designated the institutions responsible for the prizes: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry; the Karolinska Institute is responsible for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the Swedish Academy picks the Nobel Prize in Literature; and a committee of five people elected by the Norwegian Parliament decides who wins the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe economics prize \u2014 officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel \u2014 wasn\u2019t created by Nobel, but by Riksbanken, Sweden\u2019s central bank, in 1968. It is the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that was tasked with selecting the winner.\n\nNobel glory this year comes with a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at elegant ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896.", "description": "The 2019 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to scientists William G.
