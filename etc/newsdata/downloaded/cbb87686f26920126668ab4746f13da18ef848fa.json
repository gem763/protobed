Life just gets worse in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 15,000 candidates on 1,500 lists are contesting 217 seats in a parliament dominated by the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha in alliance with centrist party Nidaa Tounes, which has been decimated by infighting.\n\nPolling stations for the seven-million electorate are to remain open until 6:00 pm (1700 GMT), with preliminary official results scheduled for Wednesday although exit polls will be released from late Sunday.\n\nSurveys circulated informally due to a ban on their publication predict Ennahdha will lose ground to the new Qalb Tounes (Heart of Tunisia) party of jailed business tycoon Nabil Karoui, who has won a place in a two-way presidential runoff on October 13.\n\nThe sidelining of the ruling political class in the first round on September 15 was rooted in frustration over a stagnant economy, high unemployment, failing public services and rising prices.\n\nBut monitors worried voters on Sunday found little inspiration at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cPeople no longer trust the old parties, and they don\u2019t know the new ones, so they\u2019re not motivated in this election,\u201d said Ali Rekiki, who works with Tunisian electoral monitor Mourakiboun.\n\n\u2013 New movements vie for vote \u2013\n\nKaroui, a media mogul held since August on money-laundering charges, came second behind Kais Saied, an independent law professor, in the first round of presidential voting.\n\nCourts have rejected several appeals for his release during campaigning.\n\nInterim president Mohammed Ennaceur \u2014 filling in since the death of Beji Caid Essebsi in July brought forward the vote for head of state \u2014 warned Friday that Karoui\u2019s detention could have \u201cserious and dangerous repercussions on the electoral process\u201d.\n\nThe presidential race may have overshadowed the legislative contest, but parliament is responsible for tackling the main challenges facing Tunisian society.\n\nA strong showing for Qalb Tounes could bolster Karoui\u2019s campaign and supporters say it might make a case for him to take over as prime minister if he loses to Saied.\n\nThe socially conservative professor has not come out in support of any party.\n\nWith the electorate tired of political manoeuvring and the failure to improve living conditions since the ouster of late longtime autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, new movements have been vying for votes.\n\nAich Tounsi, which calls itself an \u201canti-party\u201d, has emerged from the civil society movement, while Islamist populist lawyer Seifeddine Makhlouf\u2019s Karama aims to take seats from Ennahdha, which has been weakened by past alliances with political elites.\n\nWith the plethora of parties and movements in contention, the stage is set for complex and rowdy negotiations before any side emerges with the minimum 109 seats needed to head Tunisia\u2019s next government.\n\nIn the runup to the vote, Qalb Tounes and Ennahdha have officially ruled out forming an alliance.\n\nParliament will have two months to agree on the formation of a new government in a country hailed as the Arab Spring\u2019s sole democratic success story but straining to meet the revolution\u2019s other demands of \u201cwork and dignity\u201d.\n\nWhile it has succeeded in curbing terrorist attacks that rocked the key tourist sector in 2015, Tunisia\u2019s economy remains hampered by austere International Monetary Fund-backed reforms.", "description": "Tunis (AFP) \u2013 Outsider candidates challenged Tunisia\u2019s political elite on Sunday as voters returned to the polls weeks after a presidential", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/b8f3d7_tunisia-political-elite-is-facing-challenge-ballot-box-outsider-candidates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
