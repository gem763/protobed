Bitmain may, based on the situation, consider terminating employment contracts of those who violate this note.\u201d\n\nZhan is Bitmain\u2019s biggest shareholder, with a reported 60% stake.\n\n\u201cI have come to save this ship\u201d\n\nZhan\u2019s sudden departure marks the latest chapter in a series of unexpected occurrences at Bitmain. As Cointelegraph reported, Wu himself suddenly abandoned his post as CEO of the company in November 2018, instead taking on a non-executive role on its board.\n\nReacting to the email, private investor Dovey Wan described Wu\u2019s tone as \u201cintense\u201d in the original Chinese version.\n\n\u201cWOW THIS IS MORE DRAMATIC THAN I THOUGHT,\u201d she summarized on Twitter. According to Wan, Wu told employees that he intended to take control in order to improve Bitmain\u2019s waning share of the Bitcoin mining pie.\n\n\u201cJihan, literally said to his employees \u2018I have to come back to save this ship (from sinking),\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s continued strength in 2019 has nonetheless been a boon for Bitmain and other miners. Last week, executives announced they intended to create the world\u2019s largest mining facility in Texas.\n\nBitcoin Cash, on the other hand, has failed to produce similar successes. Bitmain is an open supporter of Bitcoin Cash, with Wu notoriously vocal about his own belief in the coin.", "description": "Sudden change at the top of the mining giant appears unexpected, with fellow co-founder Jihan Wu threatening staff who do not shun Micree Ketuan Zhan immediatel...", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODk0ZjU1YmM0MGZkYTRkYTFjNTNiOWQwMDE0MjkxZGYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
