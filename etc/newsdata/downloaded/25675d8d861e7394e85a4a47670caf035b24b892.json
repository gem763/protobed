If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? . . . So it\u2019s very important that, on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nTrump was essentially doing what Giuliani did Thursday: laying a preemptive defense in case it emerges that Trump did offer Ukraine something or threatened (explicitly or implicitly) to withhold something \u2014 such as $250 million in aid, which Trump did withhold for a time \u2014 in exchange for Ukraine investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Trump refers broadly to \u201ccorruption,\u201d but that\u2019s the umbrella term used to talk about investigating the Bidens (conveniently, without alluding to the fact that this is an issue in which Trump has a very personal stake). And the argument would cover just such an arrangement.\n\nGiuliani offered a similar argument Thursday, while clarifying that he did not know exactly what had gone down.\n\n\u201cThe reality is the president of the United States has every right to say to another leader of a foreign country, \u2018You got to straighten up before we give you a lot of money,\u2019\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt is perfectly appropriate for [Trump] to ask a foreign government to investigate this massive crime that was made by a former vice president.\u201d\n\nGiuliani notably told Fox Business Network on Monday that Trump made no such threat against Ukraine \u2014 before checking himself and saying he couldn\u2019t guarantee it:\n\nBARTIROMO: Did the president threaten to cut off aid to the Ukraine? GIULIANI: No, no that was a false story. BARTIROMO: One hundred percent? GIULIANI: Well, I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s 100 percent.\n\nTrump seemed to revert to denying the allegation in a tweet not long after he talked to the media.\n\n....know the correct facts. Is he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from. Is this all about Schiff & the Democrats again after years of being wrong? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019\n\nThe progression of the comments from the Trump team follows a familiar pattern. To get ahead of bad news, Trump acolytes often will deny or decline to confirm the underlying charge, but also offer a preemptive defense in case it\u2019s proven. As evidence finds its way out, though \u2014 and as Trump himself keeps talking publicly \u2014 we eventually learn that the initial suspicions were correct and they were offering a preemptive defense for a reason.\n\nIt was the pattern followed with the Stormy Daniels hush-money payments. They first denied it completely, then Giuliani got out in front of the story by arguing that there would be nothing wrong with it because it was simply a private transaction (even though it occurred shortly before the 2016 election). At the time, Trump himself denied that he had any knowledge of what went down, but eventually it was discovered that he was aware of the payment in real time.\n\nThe pattern also held at various points during the Russia investigation, when Trump would dismiss accusations or media reports as \u201cfake news\u201d before later trying to inoculate himself even if the story was true, and then eventually admitting that it did happen. The most pronounced example would be Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russia lawyer.\n\nJust because both Trump and Giuliani are offering preemptive defenses, that doesn\u2019t prove what the whistleblower said was accurate. We don\u2019t even know exactly what the whistleblower alleges, beyond that it involves Ukraine and some kind of \u201cpromise,\u201d and that it was regarding more than a single communication.\n\nBut if the complaint is completely without merit, you don\u2019t really need to litigate what might happen if it turns out to be true. And history suggests this is a strong signal of what\u2019s to come \u2014 whether Trump\u2019s talks with the Ukrainians included an explicit quid pro quo or not.", "description": "\"It's very important to talk about corruption.
