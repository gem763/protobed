He\u2019s an eight year old and it\u2019s probably a much bigger deal to him.\"\n\nAnother asked: \"He was acting like a child because he IS a child. Why were you acting like a child?\"\n\nThe dad was quick to accept the judgement and said he would have a long hard, think about where to go from here.\n\nHe later provided an update, saying that he took his son out for breakfast where they discussed what had happened and he had apologised.\n\n\"He tried to con me into letting him have chocolate chip pancakes so I think we\u2019re good,\" he added.", "description": "He broke his son's work and told him it 'meant nothing' to give him a taste of his own medicine", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article18795895.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS180803451.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
