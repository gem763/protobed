Burnett.\n\n\"Are we getting any softballs this afternoon?\" Brown joked, after a student stepped forward with a question about consensus and conflict between Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe nine Supreme Court justices are in Winnipeg this week to meet with the public and hear two cases; the first time in the court's 144-year history justices will hear a case outside of Ottawa.\n\nEach justice also visited a Winnipeg high school on Monday.\n\n\"It was incredible. I was really surprised and really shocked,\" said Sara Mueller, 16. The Grade 11 student at Miles Mac helped organize Brown's visit.\n\n\"They haven't left [in] 144 years, and now they're coming here? Crazy.\"\n\nMueller said she's considering law as a career, and wants to see an overhaul of the family law system.\n\n\"Honestly, I just want everybody else in our school to have a good experience,\" said fellow organizer Lochlan Lubinski, 16. \"That's what I want the bottom line to be: I want everybody to learn at least one thing today.\"\n\nThe Winnipeg visit is part of an effort to make the Supreme Court more accessible to Canadians. Supreme Court Chief Justice Richard Wagner told reporters on Monday morning he insisted on visiting high school students to engage the younger generation. The justices will also meet with Indigenous, M\u00e9tis and French leaders.\n\nAhead of the Q&A at Children Of The Earth High School, Grade 9 student Cornelius Kakegaemic said he'd like to see an Indigenous justice.\n\nSabiha Imtiaz, left, Lochlan Lubinski, centre, and Sara Mueller, right, are all 16-year-old Grade 11 students at Miles Macdonell Collegiate who helped organize the visit. (Trevor Brine/CBC)\n\n\"It would be pretty cool if a First Nations person could make it up to Supreme [Court] judge,\" the 14-year-old said. \"We're all equal, right? So why not have a First Nations person up there?\"\n\nWagner told reporters earlier he'd welcome more diversity.\n\n\"It's a question of respect. I think that Canadian people should see themselves in their courts and in the Supreme Court. If only for that reason, I would hope that one day we would be able to sit with a colleague of Indigenous origins,\" he said.\n\nIn its history, the court has had 79 male and 10 female justices. It has never had an Indigenous justice.\n\nSupreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Richard Wagner talks to reporters Monday in Winnipeg. (Angela Johnston/CBC)\n\nChildren Of The Earth Grade 9 student Crystal Garson, 14, said she hoped to ask Justice Andromache Karakatsanis about the court's thoughts on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nKarakatsanis later said the students asked excellent questions.\n\n\"I think they probably will think a little bit more carefully next time they hear about the Supreme Court of Canada or about a case or a belt law. I hope I sparked an interest,\" she said.\n\n\"They've clearly done a great deal of thinking about it.\"", "description": "Supreme Court justices were on the hot seat Monday, facing a barrage of tough questions from Winnipeg high school students on issues ranging from First Nations land claims to the essence of legality and morality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294781.1569281012!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/supreme-court-of-canada-justice-russell-brown-miles-macdonell-collegiate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
