Police haven\u2019t determined the identity of the man.\n\nOnce Braun made contact with the child, police called his father, who drove to Charleston to pick him up and bring him back to Simpsonville.\n\n\u201cThe child\u2019s home safe,\u201d James Donnelly of the Simpsonville Police Department told WCIV. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing case.\u201d\n\nPolice are still investigating whether the man lured the boy to Charleston, WCSC reported.\n\nReynolds, the Charleston police chief, issued a warning about social media.\n\n\u201cI would love tonight, right now, anybody who\u2019s watching this, who is a parent of a child, especially an 11-year-old, to sit down with your 11-year-old, right now, right this moment, and have a conversation about what you\u2019re doing on social media, the dangers, the benefits and things that as a parent we need to talk about every day,\u201d he told WCIV.\n\nRead more:\n\nA 7-year-old\u2019s TD went viral as he fought cancer. Six years later, he\u2019s playing for real.\n\nA masterpiece hung above a woman\u2019s hot plate for years. It could be worth millions.", "description": "Police found him lost in Charleston, S.C., and he was returned to his family.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "September At Am", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
