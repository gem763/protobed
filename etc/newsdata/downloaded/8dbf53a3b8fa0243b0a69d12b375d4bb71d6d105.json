REUTERS/Carlos Jasso//File Photo\n\nLautenschlaeger, Germany\u2019s appointee to the board of the ECB, said on Wednesday she would step down on Oct. 31, a day before Lagarde replaces Mario Draghi as ECB president.\n\nShe did not explain her decision but told staff in an email seen by Reuters that she had found herself \u201cin a situation in which this is the best course of action\u201d.\n\nEarlier this month, Lautenschlaeger was among just over a third of 25 members of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council who opposed a decision to resume bond purchases as part of measures that also included a rate cut and a pledge to keep the money taps open indefinitely.\n\nAnother German, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, and the Dutch central bank governor have also publicly criticised the new money-printing scheme, setting the stage for new boardroom battles unless Lagarde addresses their concerns.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the opposition against the last policy decision has become very vocal even after the decision shows how fragile the ECB currently is,\u201d ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. \u201cWhen Christine Lagarde takes over from Mario Draghi in November, she will have some work to do to mend the ties.\u201d\n\nLagarde has so far taken a balanced approach in public, telling the European Union\u2019s parliament during her confirmation hearing that policy would need to stay easy for a long time but that rate-setters must be mindful of its side-effects.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s low and latterly negative interest rates have caused frustration in cash-rich Germany, where savers have seen returns on traditional investments collapse while house prices have soared.\n\nSome Germans also fear that massive purchases by the ECB of government bonds from all euro zone countries mean they will end up footing the bills for more profligate nations such as Italy, Portugal and Spain.\n\nLautenschlaeger is the fourth German official to step down early from the ECB\u2019s policymaking Governing Council since it started taking extraordinary measures to combat the euro zone debt crisis nearly a decade ago.\n\nAxel Weber, then head of the Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, and Juergen Stark, then ECB chief economist, both resigned in 2011, followed by board member Joerg Asmussen two years later.\n\n\u201cIf the ECB President consistently decides against the interests and principles of the largest national central bank, such a number of resignations does not come as a surprise,\u201d said Markus Ferber, a conservative member of the European Parliament from Germany.\n\n\u201cChristine Lagarde would be well advised to take a considerably more inclusive approach.\u201d\n\nNO RESULT\n\nWhoever Berlin nominates to replace Lautenschlaeger is likely to hold similar views, but will not alter the balance of votes on the Governing Council.\n\nAnd those previous high-profile resignations had little impact on policy, with sceptical representatives from Germany and other northern euro zone countries outnumbered by supporters of Draghi\u2019s line from countries south of the Alps.\n\n\u201cWhile the voices of opponents of the securities purchase programme may become louder, it is unlikely that there will be a real balance in the Governing Council,\u201d said Ulrike Kastens, an economist at German think-tank DWS.\n\nFrench central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau and ECB board member Benoit Coeure may have edged France into the hawkish camp, but Germany will have its work cut out to woo governors from further south after years of bad blood.\n\nThe turning point was the 2010-12 crisis, when indebted governments from Portugal to Greece struggled to raise money on financial markets and the euro was on the brink of collapse.\n\nWeidmann then opposed any suggestion of the ECB stepping in to help but was eventually left as the lone opponent to Draghi\u2019s scheme to buy the bonds of countries in distress, known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Central Bank (ECB) executive board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger delivers her keynote speech during the annual regulatory conference of Austrian markets watchdog FMA in Vienna September 30, 2014. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader//File Photo\n\nThat marked the start of an era of isolation for Germany in Draghi\u2019s ECB, during which the Bundesbank opposed decisions from the launch of a landmark bond-buying programme in 2015 to throwing Greek banks a lifeline during its latest debt crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bundesbank already ceded some influence in the discussions surrounding OMT in the summer of 2012,\u201d Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Natixis in Frankfurt, said.\n\n\u201cThe critics of OMT could not really come up with a viable alternative solution.\u201d", "description": "Sabine Lautenschlaeger's shock resignation from the European Central Bank illustrates the deep divisions that Christine Lagarde will have to heal when she takes over next month, with some policymakers in open revolt over a new stimulus package.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434164425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P18O", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
