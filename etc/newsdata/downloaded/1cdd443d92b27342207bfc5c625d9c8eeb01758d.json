In response to a question on automation, Yang argued that his program, in which the government would give $1,000 a month to every American over 18, would be better than a federal jobs guarantee. \u201cWhen we put the money into our hands,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families and our communities up.\u201d\n\nYet as much as Yang has surpassed our nonexistent expectations as a sharp and charismatic candidate, his presidential campaign has done little for the cause he says he represents. The hot idea that\u2019s transforming the 2020 primary is not universal basic income. It\u2019s Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax, which has prompted Bernie Sanders to outbid her and compelled the Joe Biden campaign to consider its own version. Four years ago, Bernie Sanders similarly turned \u201cMedicare for All\u201d into a rallying cry that now a majority of House Democrats support, and several 2020 presidential candidates have adopted his position.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYang\u2019s Freedom Dividend has not caused the same kind of political reverberations. No major presidential candidate has adopted a proposal for a universal basic income in response to Yang\u2019s rise. Both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are in fact outspoken opponents of UBI. Elizabeth Warren has given it a diplomatic reaction: \u201cI think there\u2019s so much more that we should do before we get there.\u201d Yang has had more influence over the marginal candidacies of Tulsi Gabbard and Marianne Williamson, both of whom have expressed support for UBI to varying degrees.\n\nThat might be because Yang has so far shown himself to be a less-than-perfect pitchman to sell a multi-trillion-dollar transformation of America\u2019s economy and social contract. He lacks a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9. His economic analysis is thin. And his numbers don\u2019t easily add up. In fact, despite all of his success to date, Yang may end up hurting the UBI cause more than helping it.\n\nDonald Trump may have proven that political outsiders from the business world can impress voters with their money-making prowess. But Yang is not an especially successful businessman; estimates put his net worth at less than Sanders\u2019, America\u2019s most famous socialist. His attempt to create 100,000 jobs through a nonprofit that supported entrepreneurship was a bust. And he has no experience at designing public policy or managing government agencies. Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising that America is not following him into the very expensive unknown.\n\nStill, Yang seems to have had some success in moving public opinion. Scott Santens, one of America\u2019s leading universal basic income advocates, points to a recent Hill-HarrisX poll that found support for \u201ca universal basic income program that pays all Americans $1000 per month\u201d rising, between February and September, from 43 percent to 49 percent. The rise was particularly sharp among adults under 35: from 55 percent to 72 percent. There were also upward ticks among Republicans (27 percent to 30 percent) and independents (44 percent to 48 percent). With no other obvious factor to cite, Santens reasonably argued to me in an interview, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty much almost entirely because of Yang.\u201d\n\nSantens is optimistic that a passionate niche constituency is forming. \u201cHowever small they are compared to the entire population, these are people who are very passionate about the idea of basic income,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent economic conditions, in say 2022, 2024, in regards to the effects of automation [and] stagnant wages\u201d will create additional pressure on candidates to put UBI in their platforms, he further predicted.\n\nBut even if Yang has made universal basic income more popular than it was a year ago, that doesn\u2019t mean the issue has become part of mainstream political discourse. Forty-nine percent is not a gangbusters poll number for a policy idea, especially when pollsters don\u2019t mention any counterarguments. Plenty of ideas, such as an assault weapons ban or a public health insurance option, have much stronger numbers and still have difficulty getting through Congress.\n\nWorking in Yang\u2019s favor is the simplicity of his pitch: He taps economic fears about robots wiping out our jobs, then offers a bumper-sticker solution. His approach resonates with some economic pessimists across party lines. After hearing Yang sound the alarm about \u201crobot trucks\u201d devastating working-class communities, Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson raised his perpetually furrowed brow and said, \u201cI sit with my jaw open, I agree with you so strongly.\u201d (Carlson did not, however, discuss, let alone endorse, Yang\u2019s policy proposal.) At a Yang rally, CNN\u2019s Jon Sarlin interviewed a former Donald Trump supporter who said Yang convinced him that, \u201cit\u2019s not immigration, it\u2019s automation.\u201d\n\nBut Yang overstates the threat of robots coming for your paycheck\u2014and tying UBI to a vision of the future that may not come to pass might well undermine other cases for the proposal. MIT Technology Review examined 18 studies of the effect of automation on employment and found wildly different predictions, concluding, \u201cWe have no idea how many jobs will actually be lost to the march of technological progress.\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s website trumpets McKinsey\u2019s prediction that a third of American workers \u201cwill lose their jobs to automation by 2030.\u201d But the consulting firm\u2019s research arm actually said that \u201cup to\u201d one-third of Americans \u201cmay need to learn new skills and find work in new occupations,\u201d not that they would become destitute. With sufficient infrastructure investment, McKinsey projects that American job gains would outstrip job losses. The analysis suggests spending money on infrastructure and education would do more to mitigate economic disruption than issuing monthly personal checks.\n\nAsked about the differing conclusions found in automation studies, Yang campaign spokesperson S.Y. Lee acknowledged that \u201cprojections and timelines may vary\u201d but still stressed that \u201cexperts agree that the automation of jobs in many industries is not only inevitable but is happening now.\u201d \u201cUnlike with previous economic disruptions like the Industrial Revolution,\u201d he continued, \u201cthis time new jobs will not appear quickly enough and in large enough numbers to make up for displacement.\u201d Considering America\u2019s track record on infrastructure and education investments, such pessimism is understandable.\n\nBut some basic income advocates reject an emphasis on automation. For them, the economy of the present\u2014with its persistent poverty and widespread low-wage work\u2014provides a sufficient rationale. And Yang may be undercutting their argument.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the incredible instability that the current economic environment has created for the majority of Americans,\u201d said Chris Hughes, the Facebook co-founder who is now co-chair of the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group that promotes \u201cguaranteed income.\u201d \u201cIt has really little to do with technological automation,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to do with decades of economic and racial injustice that need to be directly addressed head on.\u201d\n\nMichael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, California, is in the middle of a basic income pilot project largely funded by Hughes\u2019 Economic Security Project. He gives Yang credit for calling attention to universal basic income. But he also stressed that the idea\u2019s origins predate the rise of Silicon Valley. \u201cI didn\u2019t learn about basic income from Andrew Yang, or from Mark Zuckerberg or from Elon Musk,\u201d Tubbs said in an interview. \u201cI learned about it from studying Dr. [Martin Luther] King.\u201d\n\nThis difference in opinion on what drives the need for a UBI leads to another divide that Yang is exposing: the disagreement on how to execute it.\n\nThe most significant policy disagreement among advocates involves whether UBI should replace the welfare system, or be built on top of it. Yang proposes to cut back the existing social safety net, by asking the poor to choose between receiving existing welfare benefits or the monthly $1,000 check. \u201cThe best way to do math is additive,\u201d counters Tubbs, in what could be interpreted as a jab at the one-word slogan that festoons Yang\u2019s campaign gear. \u201cI think those folks who have those benefits have them for a reason,\u201d continued Tubbs. \u201cGiving them some cash on top of that will allow them to get off those benefits faster.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, after Tubbs made similar comments critical of the Freedom Dividend\u2019s impact on welfare in a Twitter post, Yang replied, \u201cI agree we need to supplement what exists and improve on it.\u201d Asked if that comment represented any change in Yang\u2019s position on existing welfare programs, Yang\u2019s spokesperson did not answer directly, but his answer reinforced the position that recipients would have to choose between the Freedom Dividend and existing benefits. \u201cThe Freedom Dividend is opt-in. Anyone would be free to keep their current benefits,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe Freedom Dividend is meant to be an alternative to means-tested welfare programs.\u201d\n\nWhile some of the left chafe at Yang\u2019s reduction of the current welfare state, those on the right who support UBI don\u2019t like that Yang wouldn\u2019t eliminate all other government income transfers, which is part of the conservative case for a basic income. Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute told me, \u201cYou can fund UBI, if you get rid of other things.\u201d For Murray, \u201cother things\u201d include not just welfare, but also Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and more.\n\nYang\u2019s pitch lands somewhere in between Murray\u2019s tear-it-all-down philosophy and Tubbs\u2019 just-add-more. While he would scale back some welfare programs, he backs Medicare for All. To pay for the Freedom Dividend, he proposes a 10 percent value-added tax\u2014a tax on goods and services at every stage of production, including final sale\u2014plus a carbon tax and a financial transaction tax.\n\nThe Freedom Dividend\u2019s sticker shock is also making some people who might otherwise embrace the plan hesitant. To pay out $12,000 a year to nearly 254 million American adults costs a treasury-busting $3 trillion. That\u2019s equivalent to more than two-thirds of today\u2019s entire federal budget. And the taxes he proposes, while far-reaching and politically fraught, don\u2019t even cover the full cost. Former Obama administration economist Austan Goolsbee told CBS\u2019 Sunday Morning that a value-added tax might need to be set at 30 percent to pay for it all.\n\nYang, however, argues the Freedom Dividend partially pays for itself, with reduced welfare payments and stronger economic growth. But if you drill into his projections, it becomes clear that Yang is using fuzzy math. Yang\u2019s website projects the Freedom Dividend would \u201cpermanently grow the economy by 12.56 to 13.10 percent,\u201d based on a study from the progressive Roosevelt Institute, which assessed the eight-year impact of various UBI models. Based on that projection, Yang assumes reaping $800 to $900 billion in new government revenue. But the libertarian Foundation for Economic Education spotted that Yang uses the growth projection scenario of a UBI fully financed by government debt, the most stimulating way possible, despite the fact that Yang\u2019s Freedom Dividend is largely financed by new taxes.\n\nYang also appears to be overselling how much money would be saved by forcing poorer Americans to forgo most welfare benefits. Back in March on the \u201cCalifornia Nation\u201d podcast, Yang said that the net cost of the Freedom Dividend would be roughly $1.2 trillion less than the \u201cheadline\u201d number of \u201cabout $3 trillion,\u201d because so many people would forgo welfare assistance. The Yang website uses different numbers, claiming an unspecified reduced cost because \u201cwe currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like.\u201d But Max Ghenis, founder of the \u201copen source think tank\u201d the UBI Center, estimates that the savings from reduced welfare would be only $133 billion. Asked about the differing analyses, Yang\u2019s spokesperson Lee didn\u2019t directly challenge Ghenis\u2019 conclusion, but said in an email that \u201cthe $20 trillion U.S. economy can easily afford the Freedom Dividend once we take into account the cost savings, new revenue and economic growth it will yield.\u201d\n\nThese bad numbers, from the man with the \u201cMATH\u201d hat, may also be limiting his ability to unify basic income advocates around the Freedom Dividend. The political arm of the Economic Security Project is more supportive of proposals from some of Yang\u2019s 2020 rivals\u2014Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Kamala Harris\u2014which dramatically expand the Earned Income Tax Credit system, putting more cash into the pockets of lower-income workers without sending checks to the rich, too. Although short of \u201cuniversal\u201d basic income, these plans would achieve a similar goal of creating a higher \u201cincome floor\u201d for all who work. And they would cost about $200 to $300 billion annually\u2014a significant chunk of change, but a fraction of the Freedom Dividend\u2019s price tag. (Booker would also establish \u201cbaby bonds\u201d that give all American children, starting at birth, at least $1,000 annually in government-run accounts that they could tap once they reach 18. That would cost another $60 billion a year.)\n\nGranted, Booker, Castro and Harris have had even less success than Yang in popularizing their plans. Perhaps that\u2019s because a proposal to tackle poverty, in and of itself, lacks the drama of an enemy to vanquish. Yang at least has the robot apocalypse. But Warren\u2019s wealth tax\u2014the biggest breakout idea of the 2020 campaign\u2014hits a more visible target for populist discontent: the human multimillionaires who are already here.\n\nWarren leans in to polarization. Yang, as Santens noted to me, shies away from it, often framing his plan as \u201cnot left, not right, but forward.\u201d But America\u2019s polarization can\u2019t be avoided, only navigated. Yang has won over a few Trump-friendly converts here and there, but he has not unified the community of basic income proponents behind him, let alone enough Democratic primary voters to persuade his opponents to co-opt his ideas.\n\nYang does appear to be a savvy marketer who knows the value of a good gimmick. He super-charged his donations after announcing a contest during the September debate in which 10 entrants would receive their own Freedom Dividend for 12 months. Entering the contest meant giving the Yang campaign your contact info, and three days after he announced the contest, his email list of current and potential donors ballooned by more than 400,000. Unsurprisingly, his third quarter fundraising haul more than tripled his second quarter number, giving him the veneer of fresh momentum.\n\nBut juicing your fundraising through a (possibly illegal) contest is not strong evidence your policy ideas are catching fire. If basic income is going to become a bigger part of our national discourse, in all likelihood a new leader is going to have to step up: one with a more polarizing edge, and a better grasp of math.\n\nThis article tagged under: The Big Idea\n\n2020", "description": "His analysis is thin, his math is off and he might be ruining what little consensus the idea has.", "authors": ["Bill Scher"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/31893a2/2147483647/resize/1160x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6b%2F2a%2F877448564725b41c937dccf63c68%2F191011-scher-yang-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
