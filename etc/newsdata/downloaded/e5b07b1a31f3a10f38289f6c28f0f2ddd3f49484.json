That does not deter.'\n\nLord West also highlighted Mr Corbyn's 'association' with IRA figures during the 1980s, including inviting two convicted terrorists to Parliament shortly after the Brighton Bombing.\n\n'He has a propensity to side with those who seem to have a disagreement with our nation,' Lord West said.\n\nMr Woodcock, who quit Labour after falling out with Mr Corbyn, warned that MPs saying they could 'live with' him as a caretaker PM must 'come to their senses before it is too late'.\n\nHe compared the damage the veteran left-winger could cause to the impact of Soviet double-agent Philby, although he did not suggest Mr Corbyn himself was a traitor. Philby passed huge quantities of sensitive material to the Kremlin for years before fleeing to Russia in 1963.\n\nOne of the first things a new PM must do is send so-called 'letters of last resort' to commanders of submarines carrying the Trident nuclear deterrent (pictured is HMS Vengeance)\n\nMr Woodcock told MailOnline: 'Placing Mr Corbyn, John McDonnell and their shadowy top team at the helm of UK national security apparatus and nuclear deterrent could do more damage to our national security in a few short weeks than Kim Philby and the Cambridge spy ring did over many years infiltrating British intelligence services.\n\n'Vladimir Putin's malignant Russian regime and the Islamists who hate our way of life would would be elated knowing we had just elected a man who has sided with Britain's enemies his whole life.\n\n'And God knows what he would write in the letters of last resort.'\n\nHe added: 'A temporary Corbyn government is not an acceptable trade off to cancel Brexit, it is a calamity that could permanently undermine Britain's capacity to defend itself.\n\n'It must be ruled out now or many of us will refuse to play any further part in pushing for a second referendum.'\n\nA Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'These are false and ridiculous claims. Jeremy Corbyn has consistently made the correct calls in the interests of security and peace, including on the Libyan intervention and his opposition to the disastrous Iraq war that has caused catastrophe in the region and made us less safe at home.\n\n'Jeremy Corbyn will always do whatever is necessary and effective to keep our people safe. Labour is proudly committed to peace, justice and security at home and abroad.'", "description": "Labour has been stepping up the pressure for opposition parties to back Jeremy Corbyn as head of a 'unity' government to avoid No Deal Brexit.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19389094-0-image-a-40_1570442395657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
