He said that the aim was to get Iran back on the diplomatic path.\n\nReuters has previously reported that the United States believes the attack was launched from Iran.", "description": "The U.S. military said on Thursday it was consulting with Saudi Arabia on ways to mitigate threats from the north after Saturday's attack on Saudi oil facilities, which U.S. officials have blamed on Iran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
