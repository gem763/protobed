The geyser of opportunity, it seems, comes with a set of rules and restrictions.\n\nEpisode by episode, On Becoming a God has been skewering the concept of the American dream, observing it as a con the haves orchestrate to prey on the have-nots. But in this mid-season entry, the show drives the knife in deeper: Krystal may be trying to rise through the ranks in order to earn bonuses and get out of debt, but she realizes that there\u2019s no way to do so without lying about her success and taking advantage of others\u2014in other words, doing exactly what Garbeau does. In that regard, the series has reached its timely thesis: To pursue the American dream is, too often, to corrupt it, eventually tarnishing the idea of success itself.\n\nKrystal, after all, had been the paragon of anti-Garbeau-ism since the day her late husband brought his tapes home\u2014yet by Episode 5, she\u2019s expounding the virtues of the \u201csystem.\u201d And though she tells herself she\u2019s unmoved by FAM (she\u2019s just trying to rise through the ranks, earn bonuses, and get out of debt), she\u2019s become a poster child for the scheme, extraordinarily good at executing FAM\u2019s ideas. She\u2019s a self-starter: She recruits her neighbor when she realizes he\u2019s at a vulnerable moment in his life. She\u2019s her own boss: She overpowers Cody (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin), her recruiter (or \u201cupline\u201d), and manipulates him into seeing her as a love interest. She\u2019s a winner: At Garbeau\u2019s McMansion, \u201cParadise Cay,\u201d she orders Cody to propose to her onstage, a grotesque display of affection she concocts to impress Garbeau.\n\nThe latter stunt doesn\u2019t work, and this only frustrates Krystal further. She began the series hoping to make enough money to raise her daughter. But midway through the season, she\u2019s dreaming of never being poor again and going to greater lengths to attain her goal. Worse, her pursuits are taking her away from home; she spends most of her time in Paradise Cay determined to meet Garbeau. It\u2019s as if her original intentions have been overshadowed by her new ambitions.\n\nOn Becoming a God isn\u2019t the only comedy tackling this hypocrisy. The Righteous Gemstones, HBO\u2019s provocative comedy about a televangelist family in the South, also complicates the American dream in its latest installment. Told mostly through flashbacks set in 1989, its fifth episode finds a young Eli (John Goodman), the Gemstone family patriarch, and his wife, Aimee-Leigh (Jennifer Nettles, of the country-music duo Sugarland), strolling across a picturesque plot of land on which they\u2019re hoping to put down roots. The couple joke they\u2019ll build houses for each of their children so they can keep them close forever. Then Eli proposes, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll build our own amusement park with our own roller coasters.\u201d", "description": "On Becoming a God in Central Florida and The Righteous Gemstones, two shows about self-delusion and wealth, expose the costs of worshipping success.", "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/OnBecomingAGod_105_0589_R/facebook.jpg?1568659838", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
