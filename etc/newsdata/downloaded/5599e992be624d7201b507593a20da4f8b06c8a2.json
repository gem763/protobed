We\u2019re averaging about 300 mass shootings a year. No other country comes close.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSo yes, this is fucked up,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we don\u2019t call it out for what it is, if we\u2019re not able to speak clearly, if we\u2019re not able to act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America, and I cannot accept that.\u201d\n\nSaturday afternoon, a man opened fire during a traffic stop in Midland, Texas, and continued to shoot at residents and motorists as he drove down the highway. The shooter then drove into Odessa, firing in a populated shopping area. The attack occurred less than a month after a shooting in El Paso, in which a gunman killed 22 people and wounded 24 others.\n\nO\u2019Rourke used similar language when speaking to voters during a campaign stop in Fairfax Station, Va., on Saturday afternoon, as the details about the shooting were still coming forward.\n\n\u201cNot sure how many gunmen. Not sure how many people have been shot. Don\u2019t know how many people have been killed [or] the condition of those who have survived,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told his supporters. \u201cDon\u2019t know what the motivation is. Do not yet know the firearms that were used or how they acquired them.\"\n\n\"But we do know this is fucked up,\" he continued. \"We do know that this has to stop in our country. There is no reason that we have to accept this as our fortune, as our future, as our fate.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke addressed the same topic along the same lines on CBS\u2018 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d without, however, using the F-word. \u201cWe've got to follow the lead of those moms who demand action, the students who are marching for our lives who themselves have announced ambitious plans to ensure that we can protect one another and that our kids don't have to fear going to school or the future of this country,\u201c he said.\n\nHis campaign apparently saw some potential in his CNN tirade. New T-shirts were available for sale on his campaign site that had the words \u201cThis is F*cked up\u201d six times in all caps, followed by \u201cEnd gun violence now.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate emphasizes his concern after another Texas shooting.", "authors": ["Aubree Eliza Weaver"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/56/7e/1229dfc246febc8b07cbe4d683ab/20190901-beto-speaks-gty-773.jpg"}
