It makes me angry,\u201d Sutton said in a column in the Daily Mail newspaper.\n\n\u201cAngry for people like my dad, Mike, and other former footballers who are dying in the most horrible and humiliating way. Angry for the future generations who will suffer, too, because this study was rolled out 15 years too late.\u201d\n\nSutton said a study should have been commissioned in 2002, after Astle\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe PFA, led by Gordon Taylor, had a duty of care to their members,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThey let them down.\u201d\n\nJeff Astle\u2019s daughter, Dawn, who has been campaigning since her father\u2019s death for football to research into the area, said she was \u201cstaggered\u201d to learn of the findings.\n\n\u201cMy overall feeling is that I am staggered even though my own research and instinct was always that there was a serious problem,\u201d she said.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Football Association chairman Greg Clarke wants concussion substitutes introduced \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d following a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/dd2627_fa-chairman-greg-clarke-fa-chairman-concussion-substitutes-in-football-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
