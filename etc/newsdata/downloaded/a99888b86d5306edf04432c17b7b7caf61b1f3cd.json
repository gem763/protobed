Big Meat Companies", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWhen companies like Tyson and Smithfield launch plant-based meat products, that transforms the plant-based meat sector from niche to mainstream,\u201d said Bruce Friedrich, who runs the Good Food Institute, an organization that advocates plant-based substitutes. \u201cThey have massive distribution channels, they have enthusiastic consumer bases, and they know what meat needs to do to satisfy consumers.\u201d\n\nBut the emergence of these meat companies in the plant-based-protein market has also prompted suspicion and unease among some environmental activists, who worry the companies could co-opt the movement by absorbing smaller start-ups, or simply use plant-based burgers to draw attention away from other environmental misdeeds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a legitimate concern,\u201d said Glenn Hurowitz, who runs the environmental advocacy organization Mighty Earth. For years, big oil companies bought clean-energy start-ups and essentially shut them down, he noted.\n\n\u201cMaking admittedly modest investments in plant-based protein is a legitimately good thing for these businesses to do,\u201d Mr. Hurowitz said, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t entirely balance out all the pollution they\u2019re causing.\u201d\n\nMany of the major food companies began investing in plant-based meat or other vegan alternatives years ago. But the pace has accelerated over the past few months.", "description": "Tyson, Smithfield, Perdue and Hormel have all rolled out meat alternatives, filling supermarket shelves with an array of plant-based burgers, meatballs and chicken nuggets.", "authors": ["David Yaffe-Bellany"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/business/00fakemeat-2/00fakemeat-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
