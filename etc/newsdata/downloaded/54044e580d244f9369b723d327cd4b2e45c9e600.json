(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nIn a gesture of goodwill President Trump said Wednesday he is delaying the planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion in imports from China set to take effect on Oct. 1. The new tariff hikes will instead begin on Oct. 15. Trump said he is taking this action at the request of the Vice Premier of China Liu He; Oct. 1 marks the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nChina may have paved the way for the start of a trade truce ahead of planned talks as it has also shown a willingness to waive tariffs on U.S. products starting Sept. 17.\n\nThe slight reprieve may be little comfort to American businesses that have had to struggle with trade uncertainties. Trump\u2019s tariff policy has cost American businesses $6.8 billion in July, a 62% increase from the same period last year, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, an alliance of more than 150 associations representing every sector of the U.S. economy.\n\nDespite assurances by Trump and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro that China is paying \u201cthe full burden\u201d of these tariffs, U.S. businesses are paying the highest tariffs in history, and that painful financial reality will only get worse if Trump follows through on his threats of further tariffs.\n\nThe $6.8 billion businesses paid in July only reflects the tariff rate increase from 10% to 25% that occurred on May 10 on $250 billion in imports from China. Trump has threatened two more rounds of tariffs. On Sept. 1, Trump\u2019s order to place 15% tariffs on roughly $112 billion in imports from China went through. And on Oct. 15, Trump plans to implement 30% tariffs on the $250 billion in Chinese goods currently being tariffed at the 25% rate.\n\n\u201cThese historic tariff increases are what\u2019s causing significant uncertainty for American employers, leading to less investment, higher prices and fewer job opportunities,\u201d Tariffs Hurt the Heartland spokesman Jonathan Gold said in a statement. \u201cYou can\u2019t budget for a double-digit tariff increase, and you can\u2019t plan a business when you\u2019re living tweet-by-tweet. The administration needs to use upcoming negotiations to end a trade war that truly has no winners.\"\n\nIn June, American businesses paid $6 billion in tariffs, a 74% increase from the same period in 2018. Trump-imposed tariffs cost them $3.4 billion of that total amount.\n\nJob losses\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the trade war and its outcome has led businesses to cut back on hiring and potentially threatening the record-low unemployment rate, one of the few positive economic benchmarks Trump can point to. Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that Trump\u2019s tariff policy has already cost the U.S. economy 300,000 jobs and could rise to 450,000 jobs later this year once the full effect of the additional tariffs kick in.\n\nThe retail, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors have faced the biggest impact. The manufacturing sector shrunk for the first time in three years and the August jobs report reflected a decline in 11,000 retail workers. China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on American-made goods has resulted in 13 straight months of decline in exports compared to the same period last year.\n\nTaxpayer burden\n\nTariffs Hurt the Heartland estimates that the U.S. trade war with China has cost Americans over $30 billion in additional import tariffs from the start of the trade war to July.\n\nA recent report from the National Foundation for American Policy Tariffs estimated the tariffs\u2019 cost American households to come to more than $2,000 per year in 2020.\n\nMore from Sibile:\n\nWhy a Trump tax cut is no longer a winning campaign strategy\n\nTrump\u2019s stimulus hopes may get frustrated by Congress, 2020 politics\n\nFor first time since Trump elected, more voters say economy is worsening\n\nWhy more than half of millennials get denied credit\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s immunity to big market losses spells trouble for Wall Street\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "American businesses paid $6.8 billion in tariffs in July, the highest record in U.S. history", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MjbW7lzyOZRht0u9WrTgWA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/86970ec0-d4d5-11e9-9bbe-5bbbad29c022", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
