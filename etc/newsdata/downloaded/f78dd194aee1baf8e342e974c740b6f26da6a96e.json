It will be audible and visible on social media, on the airwaves, in this very travel section. There will be images of barbed wire, of barricades, or walls driven down the middle of urban streets - splitting the houses and the people on one side from those metres away on the other.\n\nHappily, every one of these pictures and decriptive paragraphs will be cast in the past tense. November 9 marks the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall - a pivotal moment in European history, and one usually hailed as one of our continent's happiest.\n\nBut even as the celebrations gleams, the speeches are made and the ghosts of three decades ago flit again across computers, phones and TV screens, another city will be going about its day in another corner of Europe - with the same tranches of barbed wire and unsmiling no-entry signs wedged into its heart. They have been there for 45 years now, raw and ugly in the Mediterranean heat. They could easily be there for 45 more.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chris Leadbeater", "Travel Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/nicosia-cat-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
