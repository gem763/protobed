He\u2019s a three-time winner of the Cy Young Award as top pitcher and a three-time National League strikeouts leader.\n\nWhile Scherzer had been on the injured list in July with a strained upper back muscle, this latest injury was unrelated to the earlier one, Martinez said.\n\n\u201cHe was in there with the training staff yesterday getting all kinds of treatment,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe woke up today and it was a lot worse. He told them right away he was really hurting.\u201d\n\nScheduled game six starter Stephen Strasburg, 4-0 in the playoffs, will remain set for Tuesday\u2019s contest in Houston, Martinez said, with Scherzer possible if healthy for a seventh game start Wednesday if necessary.\n\n\u201cAs of right now I\u2019d leave Stephen starting game six,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIf we get to game seven, Max starts game seven.\u201d\n\nJoe Ross, who has thrown only two innings in one game with one hit allowed during the Nationals\u2019 surprise playoff run into the World Series, was named the game-five starter.\n\nThe 26-year-old US right-hander went 4-4 this season in nine starts and 27 appearances. He allowed 41 runs on 74 hits over 64 innings while walking 33 batters and striking out 57.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a great competitor and great athlete,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cI trust in his ability to compete.\u201d\n\nMartinez said Scherzer would continue to receive treatment but was unhappy aboiut missing what could have been a career-defining start.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really upset about it. I\u2019ve never seen Max this quiet,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nLacking Strasburg means extra duty not only for Ross but the Nats\u2019 relievers, including rested ace late-inning specialists Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let him go,\u201d Martinez said of Ross. \u201cHe can get up to 70-80 pitches.\u201d\n\nStrasburg said he was never truly a candidate to fill in for \u201cMad Max\u201d on short rest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it ever really was an idea,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cI threw (in the) bullpen yesterday. I\u2019m kind of at that point where I\u2019m preparing for game six.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Got to be pretty bad\u2019 \u2013\n\nWhile many players are hurting since they began training camp eight months ago, the loss of Scherzer could be catastrophic for a team that has squandered a 2-0 series lead with two home losses.\n\n\u201cGuys were talking in the clubhouse. I think everybody is dealing with the effects of a long season,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cYou just focus on what you can control. Sometimes things are out of your control.\u201d\n\nHouston\u2019s Justin Verlander, the game two loser and scheduled game six starter, was a former teammate of Scherzer in Detroit.\n\n\u201cIt has got to be pretty bad,\u201d said Verlander. \u201cHe\u2019s a competitor, always wanted to have the ball. Given the situation, I assume it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nDespite not having an expected top pitcher\u2019s duel with Houston\u2019s Gerrit Cole, Verlander said Scherzer\u2019s absence should not dim the World Series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should take anything away from the series,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cWe\u2019re not robots. We\u2019re human. It\u2019s a long season. Things go wrong all the time. Being on the biggest stage brings more attention to the adversity.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Washington Nationals star pitcher Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start Sunday in game five of the World Series due", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/74aaa5_washington-pitcher-max-scherzer-was-scratched-sunday-game-world-series-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
