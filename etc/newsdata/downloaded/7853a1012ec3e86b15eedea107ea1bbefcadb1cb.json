But they do have a chance to redeem themselves.\n\n\"Spirit of Shankly call on the authorities to do the right thing and revert all Boxing Day fixtures to a sensible kick-off time.\"\n\nSupporters groups had already been angered by the delay in releasing the fixtures, which were originally scheduled to be announced on October 11.\n\n\"These fixtures are five days late. This impacts on family arrangements, the price of train tickets, the ability to book leave and much more,\" said the Chelsea Supporters' Trust.\n\n\"It is especially sensitive over Christmas, when match-going fans already have challenges regarding fitting in with family arrangements.\"", "description": "Manchester City believe the sporting integrity of the Premier League has been compromised by the scheduling of a hectic festive period.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7145/225c462734504347bcf35e88c0277072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
