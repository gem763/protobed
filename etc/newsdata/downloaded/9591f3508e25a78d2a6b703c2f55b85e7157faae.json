You might be surprised to see this steep decline in Yes Bank\u2019s stock, especially when the broader market was up. was up by 1.15% yesterday. However, given the history of Yes Bank, this volatility in its stock is hardly a surprise. Yes Bank\u2019s stock has already lost 72% of its value in the last year.\n\nCorporate governance lapses and under-reporting of NPAs were some of the issues that have affected Yes Bank (NS: ) in the past. But more recently, financer Altico Capital defaulted on Rs. 20 crore interest payments to Dubai-based Mashreq bank. Yes Bank had a Rs. 450 crore exposure to Altico, which was the third-highest after Mashreq and HDFC Bank (NS: ). Both Mashreq and HDFC Bank are bigger banks so that they can cushion this blow, but for Yes Bank, it was too big a blow to handle. In the past as well, Yes Bank had to encounter bad debts related issues with its exposure in Jet Airways (NS: ), which shut down in April, and DHFL. Its name was also tainted due to its exposure in fraud-hit CG Power.\n\nTo come out of this mess, Yes Bank\u2019s founder Rana Kapoor is possibly looking to sell his stake to Paytm. However, since Paytm controls Payments Bank, and RBI norms clearly says that an entity cannot control two banks, this deal looks unlikely.\n\nAccording to an exchange filing last Thursday, Rana Kapoor did manage to sell a 1.82% stake from his family business Yes Capital. According to the filing, \u201cThe proceeds will be utilized to prepay entire balance outstanding non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Yes Capital subscribed by various schemes of Franklin Templeton.\u201d However, the sale happened at Rs. 51.94, which was one of the reasons why Yes Bank\u2019s stock decline to breach Rs. 51 levels yesterday.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Nifty 50, HDFC Bank Ltd, Jet Airways Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd.
