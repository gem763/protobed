Jeffrey Morgan is one of the few to know first-hand what it\u2019s like to have the government forgive your student debt.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s allowing me to pay rent and keep paying my private loans and not run out of money and not default on anything. That\u2019s significant.\u2019 \u2014Jeffrey Morgan, who had $38,000 in student debt forgiven\n\nEarlier this year, the 39-year-old attorney for Massachusetts\u2019 Department of Mental Health had $38,381.32 in federal student loans discharged through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, an initiative which allows borrowers who work for the government and certain nonprofits to have their federal student loans wiped away after 10 years of payments.\n\nHaving his debt discharged through the program required a combination of vigilance, attention to detail and patience \u2014 whether you\u2019re looking at the traditional PSLF program or a temporary expansion to it that Morgan used, initial rejection rates are above 95%.\n\nRead MarketWatch\u2019s Moneyist advice column on the etiquette and ethics of your financial affairs. This week: \u2018 My children\u2019s stepmother won\u2019t return family heirlooms and gifts they gave their late father \u2014 how can we get them back?\u2019\n\nBut even though Morgan made it successfully through the process, his money woes haven\u2019t disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing me to pay rent and keep paying my private loans and not run out of money and not default on anything,\u201d Morgan said of the forgiveness. \u201cThat\u2019s significant.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Morgan acquired the debt, paid it down, qualified for forgiveness and how the experience has affected his life.\n\nBulk of the debt came from law school\n\nThough Morgan took on some debt to attend college, the bulk of his student loans came from law school. For his undergraduate career, he received a generous scholarship from Harvard University, where he went to school, a work-study job and help from his parents in the form of taking on debt themselves.\n\nBy the time Morgan started law school in 2004, he had paid some of the debt he incurred as an undergraduate off. But \u201cI was obviously an adult and my parents weren\u2019t going to pick up more loans for me because they have four other kids who they also were sending to college.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Jeffrey Morgan Jeffrey Morgan had roughly $38,000 in student debt forgiven. He still owes nearly $68,000.\n\nMorgan knew he was going to need to take on debt to pay for law school. All of the schools he was considering offered similar financial-aid packages that weren\u2019t enough to cover tuition, books, rent and tools he needed for school, like a laptop.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if I could have really afforded to take out less in loans.\u2019 \u2014Jeffrey Morgan\n\nThe period when Morgan attended law school, between 2004 and 2007, was during the heyday of private student lending. Much of the debt he acquired was from private lenders, meaning it wasn\u2019t eligible for PSLF. Even after the forgiveness, Morgan said he still owes $67,987.09 in private student loans.\n\n\u201cLike a lot of people, you just go into it hoping for the best and saying \u2018this is something I have to do and hopefully it will all work out in the end,\u2019\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have really afforded to try and take out less in loans.\u201d\n\nMorgan took steps early on to try and qualify for PSLF\n\nWhen Morgan took on the debt, he wasn\u2019t planning on having it forgiven \u2014 PSLF wasn\u2019t established until 2007. But once he started his career at the Berkshire District Attorney\u2019s office in Massachusetts about a year after he graduated law school, Morgan realized he planned to stay in public service long term and so it made sense for him to do what was necessary to qualify for the program.\n\nHe called his loan servicer and was told that actually none of 22 payments he thought he made towards forgiveness counted. \u2014Jeffrey Morgan\n\nAt that point, in 2008, Morgan consolidated his federal loans from Federal Family Education Loans, which don\u2019t qualify for the program, to Direct Loans, which do. After taking that step, Morgan thought he was on track to have his loans forgiven after making 120 payments.\n\nBut a couple of years later, Morgan found himself on his servicer\u2019s website looking for the answer to an unrelated question and discovered only about half of the payments he\u2019d made since consolidating his loans qualified towards forgiveness. He called his servicer to figure out why and was told that actually none of 22 payments he thought he made towards forgiveness counted.\n\nThat\u2019s because he was making them in the wrong kind of repayment plan. In order for a payment to qualify for the 120 needed for forgiveness under PSLF, a borrower must be either in a 10-year-standard repayment plan (in which case they would have already paid back their loans by the 10-year mark) or an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nA common mistake\n\nMorgan\u2019s mistake is relatively common. So common in fact that in 2018, Congress authorized a $700 million fund, known as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, for borrowers who used an incorrect repayment program.\n\nOnce Morgan realized his mistake, he switched into a repayment plan that qualified. At that point, \u201cit was just a matter of time,\u201d until forgiveness. Because it was still several years before Congress authorized TEPSLF, Morgan assumed he\u2019d have to wait an extra two years for forgiveness because of the lost 22 payments.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t even start to think about having kids because I have no idea how I would pay for even the regular stuff \u2014 the diapers, the food, \u2014 let alone school, colleges, higher health insurance.\u2019 \u2014Jeffrey Morgan\n\nBut in 2018, when Congress authorized TEPSLF, Morgan realized he might qualify. He read \u201ca ton\u201d as he put it, made phone calls to his servicer and followed the conversation surrounding the expansion on Reddit to figure out whether he\u2019d qualify, and how many of his lost payments would be eligible.\n\nCongress allocated a limited pot of money for TEPSLF, so Morgan said he was eager to apply for the program the minute he was eligible, which was after he made at least 120 payments on his loan \u2014 including the 22 he thought he\u2019d lost.\n\nTo access TEPSLF, borrowers first have to apply to the regular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and be rejected. Morgan did that in March 2019 as soon as he thought he\u2019d made the 120 payments. He got rejected and then promptly applied for TEPSLF \u2014 which essentially involves sending an email to the servicer that oversees PSLF. By May 2019, his debt had been forgiven.\n\nDebt forgiveness coincides with an increase in expenses\n\nTo know that the whole thing worked was a relief for Morgan, who for years has used a spreadsheet to track expenses and had factored forgiveness into his financial planning strategy.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting, I printed out the letter from my email \u2014 still have it hanging up on the wall,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018It was exciting, I printed out the letter from my email \u2014 still have it hanging up on the wall.\u2019 \u2014Jeffrey Morgan\n\nStill, the experience wasn\u2019t as life-changing as he\u2019d hoped. The forgiveness coincided with a decision by Morgan\u2019s landlord to renovate the apartment he shared with two roommates, so they had to move out. Morgan and one of those roommates found a different, third roommate to share a new apartment, which costs him $265 more a month in rent (or $625 total, for the three of them together). In addition, he and his roommates had to split a $2,500 realtor fee.\n\n\u201cIf it didn\u2019t coincide with this increase in my expenses, it would have been even better,\u201d Morgan said of the forgiveness. Still, the debt relief has been helpful. \u201cI probably would have had to go into some kind of forbearance on my private loans right now if I was still paying my federal loans.\u201d\n\nA spreadsheet, side-hustle and little room for luxuries\n\nThroughout his career in public service, Morgan has lived close to the financial edge with little extra money to spare outside his expenses. In addition to his day job, he worked a side-hustle for several years as a contract-proofreader.\n\nEven with debt forgiveness, Morgan still can\u2019t afford many luxuries, like to take a vacation, or to plan long-term due in part to his private student loans.\n\n\u201cI cant even start to think about having kids because I have no idea how I would pay for even the regular stuff \u2014 the diapers, the food, \u2014 let alone school, colleges, higher health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have all these loans to pay back I might be able to do that.\u201d\n\nMorgan said his experience with student debt has changed the way he talks to prospective lawyers. He advises them to think critically about the decision to go to law school and whether it\u2019s worth acquiring the debt that\u2019s required.\n\nStill, he doesn\u2019t regret his decision to work as a public-interest lawyer. These days, he helps ensure that adults who are mentally incapacitated have access to medical and psychiatric care and guardians who are helping to improve their lives.\n\n\u201cThe work that I\u2019ve done has been worthwhile and enriching,\u201d he said.", "description": "At one point in the process, Jeffrey Morgan discovered only about half of the payments he\u2019d made since consolidating his loans qualified towards forgiveness.", "authors": ["Jillian Berman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO861_Manfro_ZG_20190805201941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
