The British ships were no longer carrying fine muslins and calico to Europe. The primary produce brought over was jute, cotton, the sorts of materials used in the emerging British industrial project.\u201d\n\nPriyamvada Gopal, who teaches at the faculty of English at Cambridge University, said that Britain\u2019s history of commercial shipping was \u201ca deeply violent one, which included shipping millions of black and indentured bodies tightly packed in the holds of ships to be exploited on plantations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is shameful to not acknowledge this in favour of a diffuse and dishonest pride,\u201d Gopal said.\n\nWagner said that the ad campaign reminded him of a tweet from the Treasury in 2018, which congratulated the British public for contributing to the end of slavery. \u201cDid you know? In 1833, Britain used \u00a320 million, 40% of its national budget, to buy freedom for all slaves in the Empire,\u201d the earlier tweet had said.\n\n\u201cIt is a reflection of the pervasive ignorance that goes hand in hand with Empire nostalgia\u201d Wagner said.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThe slave trade was an abhorrent practice for which the British government has rightly apologised.\n\n\u201cThis tweet was intended to promote the future of Britain\u2019s maritime sector, which accounts for 95% of British trade. Needless to say, we apologise if any offence has been caused.\u201d", "description": "Campaign accused of ignoring colonial abuses when setting out maritime industries\u2019 future", "authors": ["Vidhi Doshi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b68c28e05952ad409fb47c18ffbbd072c9b4042/0_148_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=639ee5bb3342fc7e054f14c1a44a1084", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
