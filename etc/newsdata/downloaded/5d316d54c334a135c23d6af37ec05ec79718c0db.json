And 89 percent support expanding federal background checks to cover private sales and gun-show transactions. Both measures are supported by at least 8 in 10 Republicans, white evangelical Christians, members of gun-owning households and other traditionally conservative groups.\n\nMore far-reaching restrictions also have majority support, the survey finds, albeit by more modest margins. Six in 10 support a federal ban on gun magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.\n\nA 56 percent majority supports a new federal ban on sales of military-style assault weapons, and nearly all who support such a ban also back a mandatory federal buyback program for those weapons \u2014 a notion that has been decried as government \u201cconfiscation\u201d by gun-rights supporters and has been at the fringes of the national gun debate until recently.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Americans-Of-Both-Parties-Overwhelmingly-Support-Red-Flag-Laws-Expanded-Gun-Background-Checks-Washington-Post-Abc-News-Poll-Finds"], "top_image": ""}
