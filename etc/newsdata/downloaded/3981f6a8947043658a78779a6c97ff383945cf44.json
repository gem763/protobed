Now people are trying to imitate his rise to the top.\n\nIn early 2017, MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, began to skyrocket in popularity, his videos growing bigger and more ambitious alongside the new viewership. Donaldson started publishing 12-hour videos of himself performing lengthy but mundane tasks (like reading every word in the dictionary), and he has progressed into much showier stunt performances. He\u2019s become known for large-scale, exhausting, and expensive challenge videos, with premises that include \u201cPaying People $10,000 To Eat Ghost Pepper,\u201d \u201cI Bought Everything In A Store,\u201d and \u201cLast To Remove Hand, Wins House.\u201d They\u2019ve helped his channel grown from 100,000 subscribers to 25 million subscribers in less than two years.\n\n\u201cHe has the ideas of a 12-year-old and he turns them into a reality in a way YouTubers haven\u2019t done before.\u201d\n\nYouTube has shifted under Donaldson\u2019s influence, with grandeur challenges and sponsor-fueled money giveaways becoming an overnight sensation. Other YouTubers, like Azzyland and MindofRez, have also run with Donaldson\u2019s ideas, adding their own takes to some of his more popular videos or sometimes going one step further to parody them. In one instance, the channel Tiana published a video reenacting the exact same challenge Donaldson did five months earlier. The video, \u201cLast One to Leave the Slime Pool,\u201d netted Tiana more than 2 million views. Another YouTuber, Carter Sharer, copied Donaldson\u2019s \u201cLast One to Leave Roof\u201d challenge and pulled in more than 12 million views in the process.\n\nChallenges are only one part of the formats Donaldson has popularized. Other videos include buying as much of one product as possible and using it in an absurd way. For example, one of Donaldson\u2019s most popular videos is \u201cI Put Millions of Pennies in my Friend\u2019s Backyard.\u201d\n\nThis style of video is something longtime YouTuber and Smosh co-founder Anthony Padilla refers to as \u201cjunklord YouTube.\u201d Effectively, a creator will spend an exuberant amount of money on an absurd amount of product \u2014 1 million red Lego blocks or 10,000 pounds of dry ice \u2014 that\u2019s meant to be used for one video, and the sheer extravagance and oddity pull in curious viewers.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the item is, or the topic of the video anymore, really,\u201d Rob Wilson, a YouTube creator and analyst at VidIQ, told The Verge. \u201cThey\u2019re just fascinated in what [Donaldson] does. He has the ideas of a 12-year-old and he turns them into a reality in a way YouTubers haven\u2019t done before.\u201d\n\nNo one has perfected the model like Donaldson, but that hasn\u2019t stopped others from trying. One creator, in particular \u2014 Morgan \u201cMorgz\u201d Hudson \u2014 has attracted ire from the creator community because of his attempts to copy Donaldson\u2019s stunts. Hudson has used extremely similar thumbnails while re-creating some of Donaldson\u2019s most viral videos, including spending a night in prison as part of a challenge. Members of popular YouTube collectives like Faze Clan have shouted out Donaldson in their own versions of his videos, including stunts like, \u201cPaying for Everything You Can Carry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in the human brain that is just, \u2018Oh my god, there are so many of these things, I have to see it,\u2019\u201d Padilla said in a video examining the rise of MrBeast copycats. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that watching someone waste a whole bunch of money, doing something ridiculous with a whole bunch of things, is fascinating.\u201d\n\nPeople have an inherent fascination with watching the extreme, Wilson said. While most creators can\u2019t match Donaldson\u2019s spending habits \u2014 most of his money comes from brand deals \u2014 nor can they pull in the same viewership numbers, there\u2019s enough of an incentive to try, according to Dallas Korol. Korol is a longtime YouTuber who has known Donaldson since 2012 when they played Xbox Live together. While Korol believes YouTubers who try to perform the same stunts as Donaldson do find some joy from producing that specific type of content, he also believes the potential to make money, in the long run, plays a major factor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still definitely 90 percent wanting to get views.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were to assume what the minds of most YouTubers think, it would be mainly just to get views because I don\u2019t think anyone really likes spending $10,000 on a video,\u201d Korol told The Verge. \u201cBut you have to have some passion and want to actually do it because it would reflect off your video if you\u2019re not having a fun time. It\u2019s still definitely 90 percent wanting to get views.\u201d\n\nThis happens with every burst in popular content, Korol said. Donaldson\u2019s over-the-top-stunt-content-meets-philanthropy is just the latest trend. When Minecraft became a big focus point on YouTube, non-gaming creators found ways to rack in those views. Others have dropped their channel\u2019s mainstay content to focus on becoming drama vloggers or commentators. Borrowing formats isn\u2019t entirely frowned upon, but the YouTube community appreciates it when creators bring enthusiasm and an original approach to the mix so it doesn\u2019t just feel like they\u2019re doing it for the views.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I think anybody can do it because MrBeast has proved that this is a successful model,\u201d Wilson told The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be harder to replicate because it\u2019s not a unique idea anymore. No one is doing it bigger or better than him.\u201d\n\nConversation has shifted within the YouTube community away from \u201cwho will become the next MrBeast?\u201d into \u201cwhat comes after MrBeast?\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that YouTube viewers have an appetite for the gargantuan style of videos he makes, but looming concern about burnout, the financial cost of constantly trying to best his most popular videos, and incoming competition all point toward an inevitable change for Donaldson.\n\nMany top YouTube creators have felt that same pressure to adapt. Felix \u201cPewDiePie\u201d Kjellberg went from being a gaming creator to reviewing memes and back to a gaming channel over the last decade. Wilson points out that YouTube, like fashion, is cyclical.\n\n\u201cIf and when the cycle ends, and if it does become a stale topic, MrBeast is probably intelligent enough to transition,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s survived and thrived on YouTube for years. That\u2019s no coincidence.\u201d", "description": "MrBeast has accomplished a feat that no other individual creator has achieved in YouTube history: surpassing 10 million views on every single video he\u2019s posted for more than a year straight.
