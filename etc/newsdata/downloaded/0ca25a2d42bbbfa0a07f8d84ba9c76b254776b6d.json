(Picture: Ella Byworth/Metro.co.uk)\n\nProvider: Ella Byworth/Metro.co.uk\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest profession has always lived in limbo.\n\nSex work has been around for as long as humans have but for nearly 1,000 years, there has been a combination of condoning and condemnation of people making a living from one of our most primal needs.\n\nWhy are we still so bashful about it and, in some cases, adamant that it should be stopped? And what does the future hold for sex work in the digital age?\n\nIn the UK, the odd limbo of sex work has existed since 1161, when Henry II introduced legislation giving royal recognition for the Bishop Of Winchester to licence brothels and prostitutes in Southwark on the banks of the Thames in London.\n\nThis combination of taboo and begrudging acceptance while turning a blind eye has existed ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpponents of sex work say it\u2019s exploitative of people of all genders and sexualities alongside politicians trying to collate it with people trafficking.\n\nA vast majority of those involved in sex work are there consensually and, though a serious issue, sex trafficking and sex work are two different things and, according to charity Stop The Traffik, often wrongly confused.\n\nIn 2019, more people than ever are making money from sex work.\n\nOver 10% of men in Britain have paid for sex and nearly 73,000 people work as sex workers in the UK.\n\nLike any other profession, sex work has remote workers. These are people who offer subscriptions to sexual Snapchat accounts, OnlyFans websites or webcam streams of them performing sex acts.\n\nThree of the biggest 11 websites in the world are dedicated to pornography and adult entertainment.\n\nAs a guide, Amazon is 14th on the list, Netflix is 20th.\n\nYet as a society, we turn our face away from the realities of sex work, which advocates say puts those involved in the industry at risk.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nMillions worldwide pay for sex every day, either online or in real-life and our advertising and television are full of sexualised images, yet we\u2019re loath to validate sex workers\u2019 existence by legitimising their profession.\n\nWe\u2019re squeamish about sex and the laws reflect that:\n\nThe Holbeck area of Leeds is the only \u2018managed\u2019 zone for prostitution in the UK, allowing street work between 8pm and 6am each day (Picture: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got lots of laws that criminalise things on the street,\u2019 says Teela Sanders, a researcher at the University of Leicester\u2019s criminology department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is both from the seller and the purchaser\u2019s side, brothel-keeping being the main obstructive law,\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s an uneasy solution dating back to the 1957 Wolfenden report, which was concerned about the impact of prostitution as a public nuisance.\n\nSir John Wolfenden, the author of the report, set the tone for politicians\u2019 approach to sex work for the next six decades: as long as it was out of sight, it was out of mind.\n\nIt was deemed that it was \u2018not the law\u2019s business\u2019 whether somebody wanted to pay for sex, also recommending that homosexual acts between two consenting adults should by be decriminalised.\n\nOne recommendation has moved a lot further than the other.\n\n\u2018Ultimately the paying and the selling and buying between consenting adults is still perfectly legal,\u2019 says Sanders.\n\nBut police forces differ vastly in their approach to sex work depending on the whims of frontline officers and their commanders.\n\nLeeds has a sex workers\u2019 zone where street work is allowed while in London, six massage parlours were raided by police with accusations of brothel-keeping.\n\nA BBC Three documentary about Leeds was highly critical of the scheme, focusing on drug use, but was condemned by sex workers.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a complete mish-mash and mismatch between the reality of what\u2019s going on and the organisation of sex work with these 1950s laws,\u2019 Sanders says.\n\nBritain is far from the only society to have this odd approach to sex work.\n\n\u2018You see that all around the world,\u2019 Kate Lister, a lecturer at Leeds Trinity University and the author of A Curious History of Sex, tells Metro.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There is no law that\u2019s consistent. There are always loopholes people get around \u2013 this bit is criminalised, that bit isn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s probably to do with the subject of sex, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019re very comfortable with, and it\u2019s difficult to figure out how you legislate it.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s seen on the frontline of sex work.\n\nNici Evans works with the NHS, local government and police in South Wales, which has its own local quirks but it reflects the national issue around sex work.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not been recognised politically, there is no policy from the Welsh government, therefore there\u2019s no political steer or direction,\u2019 she says.\n\nThat is because, she says, it sits between violence against women, community safety, public health, substance misuse, in housing and homelessness so no one department takes responsibility.\n\nEvans sees different approaches as she drives along the M4, which stretches across South Wales.\n\nIn Cardiff, a progressive chief superintendent is focused on the safety of sex workers, pushing the \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 notion to its limits.\n\nIn Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the Red Light District is legal and regulated (Picture: Horacio Villalobos/Getty Images)\n\nJust down the road in Swansea, there\u2019s a much more aggressive approach to sex workers, hitting them with criminal justice notices. In Gwent, south east Wales, the police are focused on harm reduction.\n\nIn the absence of clear guidance, it\u2019s left to individuals in power to decide on an approach to sex workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It starts from a place of moral judgment on individuals,\u2019 says Evans.\n\n\u2018Whoever you speak to about prostitution and sex work will have an opinion about it, either that it\u2019s right or wrong.\n\n\u2018Fundamentally, all discrimination will come from an individual bias, and we see that day in, day out with the health service in terms of discrimination showed by doctors and nurses to sex workers.\u2019\n\nCriminalising sex work is troublesome, says Angelika Strohmayer of Northumbria University, who has conducted research with sex workers in the UK and Canada.\n\n\u2018It means they can\u2019t come forward if someone commits violence against them,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018In a decriminalised system, where stigma is reduced and people can go to the police or other service providers without the fear of being criminalised themselves, it encourages the people who listen to believe victims and act on it.\u2019\n\nLaws around brothel keeping (which means anyone working with a colleague is breaking the law) are seen to make problems worse.\n\n\u2018It means they have to make the decision between working legally \u2013 by themselves \u2013 or working safely, with others, illegally,\u2019 says Strohmayer.\n\nIn London, the brothel raids mentioned above were encouraged by local councillors keen to take a hardline approach to sex work.\n\nThere has been plenty of tinkering around the edges of sex work, but there\u2019s a stasis in actual action.\n\nThe webcamming sex work revolution is a great example of this \u2013 there are nearly no laws for the live broadcast of sex acts despite clients paying for them, even if it is remotely.\n\nWith some cam sites believed to be worth nearly $1bn (\u00a3820m), it has become big business and a way for many sex workers to make a stable income.\n\nThe web allows those offering services to be more empowered, with better vetting and information sharing about their clients, but it is a double-edged sword:\n\nDigital footsteps leave traces of real-life identities in ways that real-life encounters don\u2019t.\n\nWith booking sex work still seen as shameful by society, the risk of being \u2018exposed\u2019 as someone who pays for sex could still have repercussions on their family life or job.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been seen as a technological way to ensure privacy and allow more freedom for webcam performers and clients.\n\nAnd with sex work moving ever closer to augmented and virtual reality, with robots predicted to be a part of our sexual lives by the middle of the 21st century, antiquated laws are likely to be even further out of touch with reality.\n\nBut even in the present day, the law is still struggling to keep up.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not dealing with the reality of sex work,\u2019 says Sanders.\n\n\u2018People are having to work under awful working conditions, no control over their work, working together \u2013 which is against the law \u2013 and these fundamentals are just not being addressed.\n\n\u2018Because politicians just can\u2019t seem to be grappling with the realities that we have a sex industry that\u2019s not going away.\u2019\n\nAnd when politicians are minded to act, they\u2019re doing so in ways those who liaise with sex workers say is wrong.\n\nThe \u2018Nordic model\u2019 of legislation says that paying for sex services \u2013 rather than the selling of them \u2013 is illegal.\n\nIt\u2019s adapted from the law in Sweden, and has highly vocal lobby groups supporting it \u2013 who have tried to sway politicians to support its introduction in the UK.\n\nIt would criminalise those paying for sex and make the client the criminal rather than the sex worker.\n\nBut the hard-line it takes is far from the reality of many people.\n\n\u2018I just think politicians can\u2019t deal with the complexities,\u2019 says Sanders.\n\n\u2018Someone may not like to be escorting, but equally, they don\u2019t want to be working in Tesco or in a factory or other parts of the gig economy.\u2019\n\nInstead, those who work day in, day out with sex workers suggest a better alternative: decriminalisation, which is the approach taken in New Zealand and New South Wales, Australia.\n\nSuch a move would remove all specific laws that criminalise sex work.\n\nOpponents fear that would result in a free-for-all and the exploitation of people engaged in sex work but that\u2019s not true, says Lister.\n\n\u2018Sexual abuse and sexual assault are already illegal and would remain illegal,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018But what it would do is reduce the social stigma that exists around selling sex that is so damaging and so hurtful, because it forces it underground.\n\n\u2018It makes people cast moral assumptions on those people who sell sex.\u2019\n\nA letter, written earlier this year by the Sex Work Research Hub, a collection of researchers, academics, sex workers and policymakers who work with and in the sex industry, advocated decriminalisation and lambasted the Nordic model.\n\n\u2018People who are well-informed, who know sex workers who worked in the industry, would say the decriminalisation of sex work has got to be the starting point,\u2019 says Evans.\n\n\u2018With that, we would then be able to do far more effective outreach work,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018People would be far less hesitant to contact support services if they felt they weren\u2019t going to be in trouble. It would have a major impact on developing co-operatives of sex workers, being able to feel safe to work together.\u2019\n\nDecriminalisation is preferred to regulation because people still have negative views of those engaged in sex work.\n\n\u2018Regulation does little to reduce the stigma,\u2019 says Strohmayer.\n\nBut Lister isn\u2019t hopeful that those in power will listen.\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be a brave politician that can say decriminalisation is the way forward,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018So many of the narratives and the propaganda around it are so caught up with the idea that if you don\u2019t think sex work should be abolished and heavily criminalised, you\u2019re somehow supporting rape, exploitation and pimping.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s very untrue and very unfair.\u2019\n\nThe web and social media revolution, along with the different types of sex work it has created, has also removed some of the stigma and danger around it.\n\nTechnology and apps have allowed sex workers to more easily share advice and warnings around good and bad punters, while the anonymity of social media has allowed sex workers to speak out about the realities of their lives.\n\n\u2018What it\u2019s done is cut the need for third parties like pimps and madams,\u2019 says Lister.\n\n\u2018People can manage themselves using apps. It\u2019s allowed screening to take place so that increases safety levels.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s had another effect, destigmatising the idea that sex workers are somehow subhuman.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re starting to realise as well that sex work is a really broad experience, from people who sell their underwear online or talk dirty on the phone to full-service providers,\u2019 says Lister.\n\nSex work involves mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters; students and shop workers; homeless and homeowners. It\u2019s been going on for centuries and will continue to go on.\n\n\u2018People get exploited in the fishing industry and factory industry,\u2019 says Lister.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s long past time to have a grown-up conversation about sex work, and to treat it as a job like any other.\u2019\n\nThe difficulty here, again, is the grey area of the law.\n\nGoogle has blocked certain functions of an app launched to help screen potentially dangerous clients. Other apps aimed at providing check-ins for sex workers after appointments have been curtailed.\n\nThe goal of those campaigning for recognition and respect for sex workers is that the government will start by decriminialising the world\u2019s oldest profession as a starting point to enabling better advocacy for those involved.\n\nThose trying to ban it outright want to shut it away and run it out of business.\n\nOne thing is for certain: whichever path we take, the world\u2019s oldest profession will continue unabated.\n\nThe key question is how long we\u2019re going to continue the world\u2019s longest conversation about what to do next.\n\nThe Future Of Everything This piece is part of Metro.co.uk's series The Future Of Everything.
