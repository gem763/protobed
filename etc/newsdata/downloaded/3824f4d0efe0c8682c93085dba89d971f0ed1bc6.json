Urtula killed himself on the day of his graduation from Boston College in May 2019, after his family had traveled from New Jersey for the ceremony.\n\n\"Abuse became more frequent and more powerful and more demeaning in the days and hours leading up to Mr. Urtula's untimely death. The abuse was witnessed by family and classmates of both parties and documented extensively in text messages between Ms. You and Mr. Artula and in Mr. Artula's journal entries,\" Rollins added.\n\nIn the two months before Urtula's death, You sent him more than 47,000 text messages, prosecutors said. Those messages included \"repeated admonitions for Mr. Urtula to 'go kill himself' to 'go die' and that she, his family, and the world would be better off without him.\"\n\nFriends and family said they repeatedly witnessed You abusing Urtula. Suffolk County District Attorney's Office\n\nYou's indictment has striking parallels to that of Michelle Carter, who made headlines after she was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter for sending text messages repeatedly pushing for her then 18-year-old boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to end his life and chastising him when he hesitated.\n\n\"You keep pushing it off and say you'll do it but u never do. It's always gonna be that way if u don't take action,\" Carter, who is currently serving a 15-month sentence, texted Roy on the day he died.\n\nThe District Attorney said on Monday that You was tracking Urtula's location via her phone on the morning of his death. Rollins added that You was at the parking garage in Roxbury, a Boston neighborhood, when he jumped.\n\n\"The investigation revealed that Ms. You used manipulative attempts and threats of self-harm to control him. It also found that she was aware of his spiraling depression and suicidal thoughts brought on by her abuse yet she persisted continuing to encourage him to take his own life,\" Rollins said.\n\nAccording to a letter to the Boston College community, Urtula was a biology major from Cedar Grove, New Jersey. He was working as a researcher at a New York hospital and described as a \"gifted student.\"", "description": "A former Boston College student was indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter over the death of her boyfriend, who killed himself on the day of his graduation.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db75213e94e86186443a204?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
