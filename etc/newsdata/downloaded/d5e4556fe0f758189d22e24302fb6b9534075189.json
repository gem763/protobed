The top 30 in voting by a nationwide panel of 60 football historians and media who regularly cover the NFL will be announced next Friday night.\n\nPro Football Hall of Famer John Randle, who retired with the most sacks for his position of anyone, came in at No. 30, one spot in front of the always-entertaining and sometimes out of control Terry Bradshaw. While Bradshaw was recognized in great part for his uninhibited TV persona, Randle scored so high for his face-painting before games and his elaborate, often comical sacks dances.\n\nThe list includes such never-back-down coaches as Rex Ryan (No. 43) and Jimmy Johnson (No, 62) - How \u2018bout them Cowboys? How \u2018bout that hair? Mean Joe Greene (No. 33), who never was particularly mean, rode his Coca-Cola commercial as much as anything to make the list, one spot in front linebacker Thomas \u201cHollywood\u201d Henderson, who many times lived up to his dramatic nickname.\n\nSpeaking of which, how about Billy \u201cWhite Shoes\u201d Johnson and his sensational dance celebrations? He came in at No. 44.\n\nTed \u201cThe Stork\u201d Hendricks was 48th, Brian \u201cBoz\u201d Bosworth right behind at No. 49, Bronislau \u201cBronko\u201d Nagurski at No. 55, Elbert \u201cIckey\u201d Woods and his shuffle at No. 57, and Fred \u201cThe Hammer\u201d Williamson at No. 60.\n\nThere are intimidators such as Chuck Bednarik (No. 35), Ray Lewis (No. 38), Jack Lambert (No. 40) and Ben Davidson (No. 50), who also had a reputation for dirty play while with the Raiders.\n\nJust to prove these weren\u2019t just characters, but dynamic players, Hall of Famers among this group are Randle, Bradshaw, Greene, Hendricks, Nagurski, Bednarik, Lewis and Lambert. Plus Michael Irvin (No. 41), Randy Moss (45th), Shannon Sharpe (51st), Walter Payton (56th), Sammy Baugh (61st), Michael Strahan (69th), and Jerome Bettis (98th). No surprise that some of them had cool nicknames, too: The Playmaker; Sweetness; Slingin\u2019; and The Bus.\n\nNo. 100 was former Cowboys running back Walt Garrison, who also did TV commercials.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From a sackmaster defensive tackle to a do-everything running back, the list of the NFL's greatest characters, numbers 31-100, is impressive.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/nfl_at_100_greatest_characters_31-100_97812_c0-92-2208-1380_s1200x700.jpg?a22b112eb4c158df8d5b9e2f18c6bbd7e64e0243", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
