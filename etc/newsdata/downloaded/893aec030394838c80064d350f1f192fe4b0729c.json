They tangled first over the NAFTA trade agreement, later on immigration, nationalism and defense spending, in ways that sometimes reinforced Trudeau\u2019s appeal, but which also showed him to be just another prime minister coping with his big difficult neighbor.\n\nIn 2019 a more disturbing Trudeau track record emerged into public view: one of poor judgment, from a love of painting his face in racist makeup to seeking to shield a large Canadian company neck-deep in bribes from criminal charges.\n\nNow, in the heat of Canada\u2019s federal election campaign \u2014 early voting begins Friday \u2014 the question asked about Trudeau around the world is: does the emperor have clothes?\n\nWas the world really into Trudeau: or is his good brand \u2014 tangled up as it is with Canada\u2019s reputation on the global stage \u2014 disappearing like one of the fun memes it was based on?\n\nJustin Trudeau during a G-7 summit in Quebec. | Neil Hall/Getty Images\n\nAs a member of the G-7 and G-20, Canada carries weight whoever leads it. But with one of the most recognizable and highly rated national brands, and with a campaign for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council underway, Canada also has a lot to lose.\n\nUltimately, Canada\u2019s reputation is bigger than Trudeau. But Canadians care deeply about their national brand. Everything from real estate advertising to the political parties themselves are swathed in red and white, the national colors. In case anyone in Ottawa forgets where they live, they are permanently reminded that the answer is \u201cCanada,\u201d thanks to the official government brand logo appearing on every second building.\n\nPOLITICO tested perceptions of Canada with 20 current and former ministers, commissioners, diplomats and trade negotiators from Europe, the United States, Middle East and Australia. Most did not want to speak on-the-record, for fear of being seen interfering in Canada\u2019s election process. A representative view of their opinions on Canada and Trudeau\u2019s role on several key issues appears below.\n\nWe also asked for opinions about opposition leader Andrew Scheer. The most common reaction around the world: \u201cWho?\u201d It turns out that Scheer is not merely an unknown quantity in Washington, D.C. (despite holding dual Canada-U.S. citizenship), but in all of the forums Canada deals in, with the exception of the U.K.\u2019s Conservative government.\n\nCorruption\n\nCanada has long enjoyed a relatively squeaky-clean image when it comes to corruption. But while Ottawa is not alone in lecturing the developing world about transparency and governance, this year\u2019s SNC-Lavalin scandal and Trudeau\u2019s defensive response to it have underlined a big gap between its contributions to anti-corruption plans at global summits and its weak laws and enforcement at home, according to Transparency International.\n\nThanks to SNC-Lavalin, which was involved in a conspiracy to pay more than $160 million in bribes to the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi over a bridge project in Bangladesh, Canadian companies now make up around half of the 250 companies blacklisted by the World Bank.\n\nThe scandal has \u201cput pressure on Canada in the multilateral processes,\u201d said James Cohen, spokesperson for Transparency International, because it builds on \u201ccriticism by the OECD over lack of adherence to convention against bribery,\u201d and compounds a money-laundering problem in Canada that TI has labeled snow-washing. \u201cCanada plays an active role in global corruption because of lax anti-money laundering laws,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nTransparency advocates like Cohen say Canada can no longer \u201cride on the image being the friendly world\u2019s neighbor.\u201d Still, Nicole Valentinuzzi of the U.K. Institute for Government argues that the SNC-Lavalin scandal \u201chasn\u2019t cut-through here in the U.K.,\u201d and \u201cwill not knock Canada off its global good governance pedestal.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations and international development\n\nTrudeau\u2019s polling numbers have been resilient in the wake of his blackface scandal (the big dip came earlier in 2019 after the resignation of his attorney general over the SNC-Lavalin scandal). But if there\u2019s one place those pictures may come to haunt him, it\u2019s at the United Nations, where Canada is seeking a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, and where most countries are dominated by non-Caucasian populations.\n\nWith the United Nations General Assembly taking place a week after the scandal broke, Trudeau didn\u2019t show, and nor did any of his senior ministers, leaving the Canadian delegation effectively leaderless. Ambassador Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard took the podium where Trump and other heads of state delivered speeches.\n\nCanada\u2019s competitors for a coveted non-permanent seat on the Security Council are Ireland and Norway, and they wiped the floor with Canada. Ireland sent its prime minister, foreign minister and treasurer to New York, and soon after announced an increase in development spending; Norway sent a team of five female leaders, stealing Trudeau\u2019s feminist thunder.\n\n(It\u2019s worth remembering that Trudeau was thrust into the global limelight via a set of back-to-back international summits in the weeks after his election including G-20, Commonwealth and Paris climate summits \u2014 and he capitalized on the early attention with eye-catching decisions to resettle Syrian refugees no one else wanted and naming a gender-equal cabinet.)\n\nWhile Andrew Scheer is scandal-free for now, his promise to cut Canada\u2019s development aid by 25 percent contrasts sharply with the efforts of Canada\u2019s competitors.\n\nTrade\n\nIf you believe in free trade, you like Canada: and Trudeau has had a pretty good run. His high-point on trade came via his trade (later foreign) minister Chrystia Freeland, who inked a deal with the European Union after tortured negotiations beholden to European domestic politics. When signed in 2017, it was the biggest bilateral trade deal in history.\n\nDavid Plunkett, Canada\u2019s former ambassador to the EU, said that it takes sharp elbows and a keen sense of interests to get a trade deal done, something he credits both Canada\u2019s main parties with: \u201cUltimately no-one is going to waste a lot of time and energy trying to work out a deal with a country just because they are nice guys. Life doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schaake, the former liberal MEP, who conducted shuttle diplomacy between various European and Canadian trade negotiating teams, it was Canada\u2019s patience with the EU\u2019s complicated governance systems that mattered most: \u201cI am convinced the trade agreement would not have been concluded without Trudeau in office,\u201d she said.\n\nClimate\n\nWith the United States leaving the Paris climate accord, the remaining signatories can\u2019t afford to lose Canada too. But staying in the agreement is no guarantee of success. While Canada\u2019s official policy is a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 (against a 2005 baseline), Climate Action Tracker predicts stable emissions by 2030 based on current policies.\n\n\u201cThe image has worn off,\u201d Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, the co-leader of the European Greens party, said of Trudeau\u2019s climate policies. That said, given Conservative skepticism of Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax, it is unlikely that any future government would meet the goals, potentially putting at risk future trade deals, which will increasingly include green conditions.\n\nCanada has nevertheless built up strong political capital from its role in the Paris agreement. When President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw, the European Union became desperate. It had the political will and the technology to address climate change, but with no U.S. support and Europe responsible for less than 10 percent of global emissions, the EU could not push China alone. The EU needed allies \u2014 and it turned to Canada.\n\nTogether, China, the EU and Canada worked together to act as the spine of the Paris agreement process, which has struggled to squeeze detailed plans from a majority of its 194 signatory governments. \u201cCanada has been a central partner to the EU in our efforts to achieve comprehensive, balanced, effective results that are consistent with the spirit of Paris,\u201d said Miguel Arias Ca\u0148ete, the bloc\u2019s climate and energy Commissioner.\n\nImmigration\n\nCanada\u2019s immigration system has helped to drive both the country\u2019s population growth and a nearly uninterrupted economic boom over the past two decades, while making it a popular destination for skilled workers and refugees alike \u2014 and Trudeau has been a prime supporter of that system.\n\nBut it\u2019s now under attack, and that has real ramifications for Canada\u2019s image. While Trudeau supports lifting the net immigration intake to 350,000 per year, Conservative leader Scheer has wavered, and populist minor party leader Maxime Bernier openly attacks the immigration system.\n\nCanada may have one way of masking the negative impact of being seen as less open to immigration: by highlighting some of the 300,000 Hong Kongers with Canadian citizenship returning to Canada, led by the high-profile activist and businessman Albert Cheng, in the wake of China\u2019s attempts to further control the territory. (The South China Morning Post also reports a 30 percent rise in Hong Kongers seeking Canadian permanent residency.)\n\nAdditionally, Trudeau\u2019s compassion-focused rhetoric on refugees \u2014 including its urging that other countries help shoulder the burden \u2014 has oversold the data, and generated backlash in some global quarters.\n\nWhile Canada resettles more refugees than any other country, it does not rank in the top 20 of the World Bank\u2019s per capita rankings for overall numbers of refugees received.\n\nZolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, a Cabinet member in Hungary who serves as the government\u2019s spokesperson, says the damage is not in the numbers but in Trudeau\u2019s message: that the West should welcome asylum seekers, whether or not a given country is the first safe port of call.\n\nCiting illegal immigration as \u201can immediate danger to national security all over the globe,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs called the Trudeau approach \u201can unnecessary ideological burden on the relationship\u201d between Hungary and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe are always puzzled if a foreign government comes to our region trying to tell us what to do and how to behave. Our attitude is simple: we don\u2019t come to Canada to tell Canadians how to live their lives,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs said.\n\nTo Budapest\u2019s fury, the foreign affairs committee of the Canadian Parliament invited Michael Ignatieff \u2014 Trudeau\u2019s predecessor as Liberal leader \u2014 to give evidence about the state of rule of law in Hungary in April 2019.\n\nWould Kov\u00e1cs welcome Scheer, from the same right-wing political family as Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n , as Canadian leader?\n\n\u201cWe respect the will of the Canadian people. Hungary is not entitled to have an opinion on Canada\u2019s domestic politics,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs said.\n\nWhat about the Commonwealth?\n\nBrits joined in on the Trudeau-mania after his election in 2015, said Nicole Valentinuzzi, a Canadian who works as a spokesperson for the U.K.\u2019s Institute for Government.\n\nBut the government-to-government relationship has produced warm words on the rules-based international order and trade \u2014 and little else.\n\nScheer, on the other hand, was \u201c pro-Brexit before it was cool,\u201d and is seen by many U.K. Conservatives as a potential ally. As Speaker of the House in Canada, he got to know many U.K. Conservatives through inter-parliamentary links, and is on good terms with Boris Johnson and Chancellor Sajid Javid. But he\u2019s unknown outside those circles, Valentinuzzi said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/37/66744fc54063a49e73cbb534013a/191010-trudeau-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
