DeMille Award at the 77th Golden Globe Awards in January, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced Tuesday.\n\n\"For more than three decades, he's captivated audiences with rich and playful characters that we've grown to love and admire,\" said HFPA President Lorenzo Soria in a statement. \"As compelling as he is on the silver screen, he's equally so behind the camera as a writer, producer and director.\"\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille Award is awarded to those the HFPA have recognized as leaving a lasting impact on the film industry. Past honorees include Jeff Bridges, Robert De Niro, Audrey Hepburn, Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Sophia Loren, Sidney Poitier, Steven Spielberg, Denzel Washington and Robin Williams.\n\nHanks, who starred in \"Big,\" \"Philadelphia,\" \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Cast Away,\" was most recently nominated for his performance in \"The Post\" at the 2018 Golden Globes.\n\nHe's also only one of only two actors in history to win back-to-back best actor Academy Awards.
