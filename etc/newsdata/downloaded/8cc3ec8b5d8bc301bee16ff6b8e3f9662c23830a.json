(Image: CW)\n\nThis one, at least, we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths is the mother of all reunion shows. With a chance to bring to the fore a bunch of characters from DC that the Arrowverse hasn\u2019t gotten to feature, plus an excuse to bring around any character they have featured that the audience might want to see again, Crisis is a place where anything and everything could happen. Here\u2019s one more name for the list: Jonah Hex!\n\nAs reported by Entertainment Weekly, Johnathon Schaech will return as Jonah Hex to yee-haw his way through the crisis affecting the multiverse over five hours of superhero content across Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Batwoman.\n\nThis will be his fourth appearance in the universe, after Hex was introduced in the first season of Legends of Tomorrow and kept popping up for the next couple of seasons.\n\nWho\u2019s next? Martian Manhunter\u2019s son, Martian Boyhunter? Another version of Superman? A million angry Beebos from Earth-666 hungry for nondescript vengeance? We\u2019ll find out starting December 9 on the CW.\n\nEditor's Note: The entire crossover is likely to air on FOX8 in Australia; stay tuned for news closer to the release.", "description": "This one, at least, we\u2019ve seen before.", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ivikttm7icztwomccgo0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
