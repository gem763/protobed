He\u2019ll take the mound Tuesday in Game 3 of the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, and if the Astros keep advancing, Cole could be well on his way to becoming the latest postseason pitching sensation.\n\nIf that happens, he\u2019ll join an illustrious group. A great postseason (or two) can turn a journeyman into a household name - and an ace into a legend.\n\nHere are the five different types of dominant postseason pitchers - the men who have made their mark from the mound:\n\nTHE STARS\n\nThe cream of the crop. These are the pitchers who delivered some of the most memorable postseason moments in baseball history. They are workhorse starters who were great for at least one terrific postseason run - and often more than that.\n\nMadison Bumgarner won LCS and World Series MVP honors in 2014, finishing that postseason with four wins, 52 2/3 innings and a memorable five-inning save in Game 7 of the World Series for the Giants. Jack Morris went 3-0 during Detroit\u2019s 1984 title run, then pitched a 10-inning shutout in Game 7 of the \u201891 series for Minnesota. Curt Schilling led Arizona to the title in 2001, then pitched through injury troubles when Boston broke its long championship drought three years later.\n\nJustin Verlander pitched 17 scoreless innings for Detroit over the course of two decisive Game 5s in the ALDS, in 2012 and 2013 against Oakland.\n\nThe expanded playoffs have given these standouts more chances to shine, but even before divisional play, there were some remarkable performances. Sandy Koufax had a 0.95 ERA in eight World Series games and was MVP in \u201863 and \u201865. Bob Gibson made nine World Series starts, going 7-2 with a 1.89 ERA and winning MVP twice. His St. Louis Cardinals lost the 1968 series to Detroit, but he struck out 17 in Game 1.\n\nThe 1905 World Series is noteworthy for the performance of Christy Mathewson, who threw three shutouts in a six-day span.\n\nTHE RELIEVERS\n\nNo discussion of great postseason pitchers is complete without mentioning dominant relievers - they\u2019ve become too important in today\u2019s game.\n\nAccording to thebaseballgauge.com, Mariano Rivera ranks No. 1 in career \u201cchampionship win probability added\u201d - a stat that adjusts win probability figures depending on how important the game was to a team\u2019s chances of winning the World Series. Rivera posted a 0.70 ERA in 141 postseason innings, while consistently being used in high-leverage spots for the Yankees.\n\nOakland\u2019s Rollie Fingers was the MVP of the 1974 World Series. For his career, he went 4-4 with a 2.35 ERA in the postseason, throwing 57 1/3 innings in 30 relief appearances.\n\nOUT OF NOWHERE\n\nSome of these pitchers had solid careers, but none were Hall of Famers. What they did do was pick a good time to be at their best.\n\nArt Nehf won the clinching game of the 1921 and 1922 World Series for the New York Giants, the former with a 1-0 shutout of the Yankees. Lew Burdette was an All-Star in 1957, albeit with just a 3.72 ERA. He reached another level for Milwaukee in the World Series that year with three complete game victories, including a shutout of the Yankees in Game 7.\n\nJohnny Podres was barely 23 when he pitched a shutout at Yankee Stadium in Game 7 to give Brooklyn a long-awaited World Series title in 1955.\n\nRalph Terry was the man who allowed Bill Mazeroski\u2019s World Series-winning homer in 1960, but two years later he came through in a big way for the Yankees, throwing a shutout in Game 7 against the Giants, a tense 1-0 victory for New York.\n\nJosh Beckett was the MVP of the 2003 World Series for the Marlins. Although the rest of his career didn\u2019t quite live up to that promise, he also earned ALCS MVP honors in 2007 as part of Boston\u2019s run to a title.\n\nONE-DAY WONDERS\n\nSome of the most impressive single-game pitching performances in postseason history:\n\nDon Larsen\u2019s perfect game in the 1956 World Series is an obvious example, as is Roy Halladay\u2019s no-hitter for Philadelphia in a 2010 Division Series game.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Dave McNally threw an 11-inning shutout in a 1969 ALCS game, and Babe Ruth pitched 14 innings in a 2-1 victory for Boston in the 1916 World Series.\n\nRoger Clemens struck out 15 for the Yankees in a one-hit shutout in Game 4 of the 2000 ALCS against Seattle.\n\nIn Game 5 of the 1999 ALDS, the Red Sox and Indians were tied at 8 in the fourth inning. Then Pedro Martinez came on in relief and put a stop to that slugfest, pitching six hitless innings in Boston\u2019s 12-8 win.\n\nVALIANT IN DEFEAT\n\nThese pitchers were on the wrong end of the final outcome but had no reason to hang their heads.\n\nJohn Smoltz pitched 7 1/3 scoreless innings opposite Morris in that incredible Game 7 in 1991. Smoltz was just beginning what would turn out to be a fine postseason career.\n\nMike Mussina allowed one run in 15 innings in two ALCS starts in 1997, but his Orioles lost both those games - and the series - to Cleveland. Mike Scott gave the Mets fits in two NLCS starts in 1986, but New York advanced past Houston without having to face him a third time.\n\n___\n\nInformation from Baseball-Reference.com was used for this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even on a team with three stars in the starting rotation, Gerrit Cole has stood out in these playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/alds_rays_astros_baseball_80704_c0-0-3533-2060_s1200x700.jpg?60b1c88ca152341444105b3e5294d9ce599cc4e9", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
