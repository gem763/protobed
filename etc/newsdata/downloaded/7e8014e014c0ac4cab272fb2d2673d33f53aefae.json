But she was also the mother of a 1-year-old and she was exhausted from working a variety of part-time jobs. Choosing to accept a full-time job at the Citizens Bank to support her son, she tucked college into the back of her head and carried on.\n\nBut as the years went by Vidal found the lack of a college degree was getting in the way of her goal of creating a textile recycling and fashion company that employs people affected by human trafficking.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going through real-life stuff,\u201d Vidal, 35, said. \u201cI just kind of felt stuck.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2015, a friend suggested Vidal look into a program called College Unbound that had opened three years earlier in Providence, R.I. The program was designed to help adult learners who had some college credit but hadn\u2019t earned a four-year degree; it remains the best path to a good-paying job\u2014at least $35,000 for workers ages 25 to 44.\n\nCollege Unbound in Providence, R.I., offers a chance for low-income adults who didn\u2019t finish college to get a four-year degree.

Leave us a voicemail at (202) 922-6112 and we might share your story.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEvery Tuesday, from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., Vidal and the dozen or so other students in her cohort, most of them in their 30s, would gather in a classroom space at The Met High School\u2014another initiative created by College Unbound founder and President Dennis Littky. After a quick dinner and casual conversation, students would clear the table to dive into their coursework. For Vidal, that often meant meeting with an adviser to discuss her fashion line and studying things like the four-step process of turning plastic bottles into recycled polyester fabric. The rest of the week was usually devoted to online classes.\n\nThough College Unbound is open to all students with a minimum of nine college credits, its admissions policy prioritizes \u201cunderrepresented, low-income, adult learners with some college credit but no degree who are employed full-time in low wage jobs with little possibility of advancement.\u201d Tuition costs $413 per credit, with a maximum of $4,956 per term. In contrast, undergraduate tuition, fees, room and board in the 2016-2017 academic year amounted to approximately $17,237 at public institutions, $44,551 at private nonprofit institutions and $25,431 at private for-profit institutions.\n\nBefore classes begin, students and staff meet for a meal and community announcements.

One of the benefits of College Unbound is that it provides childcare during the evening classes. | Jason Grow for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cThere are schools that focus on adults for continuing education. But specifically targeting low-income adults? Low-income working adults? \u2026 That\u2019s the unique aspect of it,\u201d said Louis Soares, the chief learning and innovation officer at the American Council on Education. Soares has been conducting a yearlong study on CU, to be released in October.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s aligning a need,\u201d Soares added. \u201cFor adult students whose identity is as focused on the role as a provider, family, or as a parent, you need to align your services, your purposes, your curriculum, your pedagogy, to that reality.\u201d\n\nEighty-seven percent of all CU students graduate, according to Vidal, who now works as director of recruitment and communications for CU while continuing to pursue her fashion line. The CU degree\u2014a bachelor\u2019s in organizational leadership and change\u2014requires at least 1.5 years, with most students graduating in around two years. CU has enrolled 135 students for the fall of 2019.\n\nTen years ago, when Littky first envisioned the school, \u201cthe college situation for low-income kids was horrible.\u201d It still is. Sixteen percent of low-income college students graduate, compared with 58 percent of undergraduate students overall. Low-income students are also twice as likely to drop out of high school when compared with students from a middle-high income background, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. These numbers intersect with race and ethnicity, with historically higher dropout rates for people of color. In Rhode Island, only 50 percent of public high school graduates in 2009 earned college degrees within six years; the state has a lower completion rate than four other New England states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all the student\u2019s fault,\u201d Littky said. \u201cIt\u2019s partly the college\u2019s fault. College is all about, \u2018We want our students to be college ready,\u2019 right? And my mantra is: \u2018Colleges need to be student-ready.\u2019\u201d\n\nTop left: Dennis Littky is the co-founder and co-director of The Big Picture Company, The Met School and College Unbound.

This recognition allows CU to apply to federal grants for financial aid, Littky said, which will benefit the 80 percent of CU students who are eligible for financial aid.\n\nCU\u2019s model could help other traditional colleges better support their students. One way to replicate the college model would be to create a structure that maximizes personalized classroom attention and meets the needs of nontraditional students while minimizing costs by using alternative facilities, like CU does, to house class meetings.\n\nIt\u2019s got the \u201cright engine,\u201d Soares, of the American Council on Education, said. \u201cThe chassis feels right \u2026 . It seems like it has good legs. And if it can continue to recruit students and grow in that cohort-driven way, I do believe it has total resiliency and sustainability.\u201d\n\nZuli Vidal, the director of recruitment and communications specialist at College Unbound, address students during the Tuesday night meeting. When she was a student, she focused on creating a fashion line to benefit victims of human trafficking. | Jason Grow for Politico Magazine\n\nFor her graduation day in December, Zuli Vidal designed her gown with the number 18 on the back, for the 18 years from the beginning to the end of her college journey. \u201cI remember giving my speech when I was valedictorian in high school at 17 and looking from the stage to my son who was in the audience, and he was a baby at the time,\u201d she said.\n\nAs she crossed the stage once more, she found her son again, now 19, holding her diploma. That same baby, a young man himself, presented Vidal with her certificate of achievement. \u201cIt was just full circle,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was a very emotional moment.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: College\n\nColleges\n\nCollege Students", "description": "College Unbound offers a traditional 4-year degree in a nontraditional setting geared to the lives of working people.", "authors": ["Shawna Chen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e7/7f/ab95a4784018a0742e96ee25fb9a/chen-lede.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
