The community is located just south of Donna, Texas.\n\nThe shootout took place on Friday night as a squad of Tamaulipas state authorities were patrolling in Rio Bravo and encountered a group of Gulf Cartel gunmen riding in a Toyota Sequoia. Authorities tried to pull over the vehicle, but the gunmen fled and began exchanging gunfire with police.\n\nThe two sides clashed in a short but fierce gun battle that ended when authorities managed to kill three cartel gunmen. Near the vehicle, authorities seized three rifles, a radio, small drug doses, and a hat bearing a Gulf Cartel logo. The logo identified the gunmen as members of the group Alacranes that currently operates in Rio Bravo.\n\nIn recent days, the border city of Rio Bravo has seen an escalation of violence as rival factions of the Gulf Cartel continue to fight for control of the region\u2019s numerous drug trafficking corridors that lead to South Texas. Those clashes led citizens to report, once again, the presence of SUVs filled with gunmen roaming the streets of Rio Bravo and Reynosa searching for their rivals. Both cities have also seen numerous murders and kidnappings also tied to that push for control.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.
