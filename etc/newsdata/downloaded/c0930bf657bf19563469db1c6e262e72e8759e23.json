In the case of dating, however, it could get burned.\n\nShares of leading online matchmaker Match Group Inc. MTCH -0.94% fell 22% last May when Facebook announced it was getting into dating. Since then, the stock has more than doubled as users continue to swipe right on Match\u2019s portfolio despite Facebook Dating\u2019s launch in select markets. Last week, Facebook Dating launched in the U.S., sending Match\u2019s stock down a cumulative 13% over the past five trading sessions. Given myriad privacy scandals over the past 18 months at Facebook, investors should be prepared for Match shares to recover\u2014and then some\u2014yet again.\n\nAddressing investors at Deutsche Bank \u2019s annual technology conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Match\u2019s chief financial officer, Gary Swidler, presented new data showing Match platforms have continued to grow as Facebook Dating ramped up. In Canada, year-over-year average subscriber growth for Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid and PlentyofFish improved slightly from October 2018 to July 2019, despite Facebook Dating launching there in November. In a basket of several other countries, Tinder\u2019s year-over-year growth rate in average subscribers nearly doubled to 50% year-over-year, though Facebook Dating launched in many places over the same period.\n\nFacebook says its Dating platform is meant to be about \u201cmeaningful relationships.\u201d As such, it isn\u2019t surprising that Tinder, often focused on more casual connections and a younger demographic, has continued to gain momentum. In the second quarter, Match said Tinder added more than half a million subscribers\u2014the second highest sequential increase in quarterly subscribers in the app\u2019s history. At the same time, Match also said it saw more mature apps like OkCupid grow internationally while global downloads for \u201crelationship app\u201d Hinge grew more than 200% year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nMatch doesn\u2019t break out subscribers but said in the second quarter that it had roughly the same number across its platforms in North America as it had internationally.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you consider joining Facebook Dating? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nOn the social-media side, Facebook\u2019s products such Stories and Watch have quickly surpassed growth from incumbent competitors in the U.S. such as Snapchat, leveraging its established user base. Dating could be different. Facebook says it built Dating to be safe, working with experts to build protection from the start. That might be too little, too late to grow in a category Match calls \u201cdeeply personal.\u201d Match said in May that 75% of new users chose to sign up via SMS rather than use Facebook after it offered the option to avoid Facebook. On Tuesday, Mr. Swidler said that number is now \u201cprobably closer to 90%.\u201d\n\nAlthough today newer apps like Tinder drive the company\u2019s share performance, its legacy apps like Match.com have been making love connections for more than 20 years. That history is likely to engender long-term trust with Match\u2019s users\u2014an opportunity younger Facebook already may have squandered.\n\nWrite to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com", "description": "Match Group\u2019s stock cools after Facebook Dating launches in the U.S., but its platform growth is still red-hot.", "authors": ["Laura Forman", "Laura.Forman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106415/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
