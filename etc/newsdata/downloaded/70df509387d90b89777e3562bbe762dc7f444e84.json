That climate cataclysms are real, imminent and indeed already devastating our planet is an article of faith. So host Wolf Blitzer and ten Democrat presidential wannabes vied to make the most extravagant claims about how bad things are and who would spend the most taxpayer money and impose the most Green New Deal rules to restrict our freedoms and transform our energy, economy, agriculture and transportation, in the name of preventing further cataclysms.\n\nCory Booker opened the bidding at $3 trillion. Kamala Harris and Julian Castro raised it to $10 trillion, and Bernie Sanders upped it to $16 trillion. Then they got down to the business of which personal choices and living standards would be rolled back the furthest. Among the proposals:\n\nBan all commercial air travel, except for ruling and privileged classes. Change our dietary guidelines or ban beef outright. \u201cMassively\u201d increase taxes, to \u201cmake polluters pay\u201d for emitting greenhouse gases. Eliminate onshore drilling, offshore drilling, fracking, coal-fired power plants and internal combustion engines. No pipelines. No new nuclear power plants. Ensure \u201cclimate justice.\u201d\n\nThe first bucket of icy cold reality is that we simply do not face a climate emergency. Computer models certainly predict all kinds of catastrophes. But both the models and increasingly hysterical assertions of planetary doom are completely out of synch with reality.\n\nThe second, even colder bucket of reality is that the wind and sun may be free, renewable, sustainable. and eco-friendly. But the technologies and raw materials required to harness this widely dispersed, intermittent, weather dependent energy to benefit humanity absolutely are not. In fact, they are far more environmentally harmful than any of the fossil fuel energy sources they would supposedly replace.\n\nBiofuels. US ethanol quotas currently gobble up over 40% of America\u2019s corn \u2013 grown on cropland nearly the size of Iowa, to displace about 10% of America\u2019s gasoline. Corn ethanol also requires vast quantities of water, pesticides, fertilizers, natural gas, gasoline and diesel, to produce and transport a fuel that drives up food prices, adversely affects food aid and nutrition in poor nations, damages small engines, and gets one-third fewer miles per gallon than gasoline.\n\nReplacing 100% of US gasoline with ethanol would require some 360 million acres of corn. That\u2019s seven times the land mass of Utah. But eliminating fossil fuel production means we\u2019d also have to replace the oil and natural gas feed stocks required for pharmaceuticals, wind turbine blades, solar panel films, paints, synthetic fibers, fertilizers, and plastics for cell phones, computers, eyeglasses, car bodies and countless other products. That would mean planting corn on almost 14 times the area of Utah.\n\nSolar power. Solar panels on Nevada\u2019s Nellis Air Force Basegenerate a minuscule 15 megawatts of electricity, about 40% of the year, from 72,000 panels on 140 acres. Arizona\u2019s Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant generates 760 times more electricity, from less land, 90-95% of the time.\n\nGenerating Palo Verde\u2019s electricity output using Nellis technology would require acreage ten times larger than Washington, DC. And the solar panels would still provide electricity only 40% of the year.\n\nGenerating the 3.9 billion megawatt-hours that Americans consumed in 2018 would require blanketing over ten million acres with solar panels. That\u2019s half of South Carolina \u2013 a lot of wildlife habitat and scenic land. And we\u2019d still get that electricity only when sufficient sun is shining.\n\nWind power. Mandated, subsidized wind energy also requires millions of acres for turbines and new transmission lines, and billions of tons of concrete, steel, copper, rare earth metals and fiberglass.\n\nLike solar panels, wind turbines produce intermittent, unreliable electricity that costs much more than coal, gas or nuclear electricity \u2013 once subsidies are removed \u2013 and must be backed up by fossil fuel generators that have to go from standby to full-power many times a day, very inefficiently, every time the wind stops blowing. Turbine blades kill numerous raptors, other birds and bats every year \u2013 a million or more every year in the USA alone. Their light flicker and infrasonic noise impair human health.\n\nModern coal and gas-fired power plants can generate 600 megawatts some 95% of the time from less than 300 acres. Indiana\u2019s Fowler Ridge wind farm also generates 600 megawatts \u2013 from 350 towering turbines, located on more than 50,000 acres, and less than 30% of the year.\n\nNow let\u2019s suppose we\u2019re going to use wind power to replace those 3.9 billion megawatt-hours of US electricity consumption. Let\u2019s also suppose we\u2019re going to get rid of all those coal and gas-fired backup power plants \u2013 and use wind turbines to generate enough extra electricity every windy day to charge batteries for just seven straight windless days.\n\nThat would require a lot of extra wind turbines, as we are forced to go into lower and lower quality wind locations. Instead of generating full nameplate power maybe one-third of the year, on average, they will do so only around 16% of the year. Instead of the 58,000 turbines we have now, the United States would need some 14 million turbines, each one 400 feet tall, each one capable of generating 1.8 megawatts at full capacity, when the wind is blowing at the proper speed.\n\nAssuming a barely sufficient 15 acres apiece, those monster turbines would require some 225 million acres! That\u2019s well over twice the land area of California \u2013 without including transmission lines! Their bird-butchering blades would wipe out raptors, other birds and bats in vast regions of the USA.\n\nBut experts say every turbine needs at least 50 acres of open airspace, and Fowler Ridge uses 120 acres per turbine. That works out to 750 million acres (ten times Arizona) \u2013 to 1,800 million acres (ten times Texas or nearly the entire Lower 48 United States)! Eagles, hawks, falcons, vultures, geese and other high-flying birds and bats would virtually disappear from our skies. Insects and vermin would proliferate.\n\nManufacturing those wind turbineswould require something on the order of 4 billion tons of steel, copper and alloys for the towers and turbines; 8 billion tons of steel and concrete for the foundations; 4 million tons of rare earth metals for motors, magnets and other components; 1 billion tons of petroleum-based composites for the nacelle covers and turbine blades; and massive quantities of rock and gravel for millions of miles of access roads to the turbines. Connecting our wind farms and cities with high-voltage transmission lines would require still more raw materials \u2013 and more millions of acres.\n\nAll these materials must be mined, processed, smelted, manufactured into finished products, and shipped all over the world. They would require removing hundreds of billions of tons of earth and rock overburden \u2013 and crushing tens of billions of tons of ore \u2013 at hundreds of new mines and quarries.\n\nEvery step in this entire process would require massive amounts of fossil fuels, because wind turbines and solar panels cannot operate earth moving and mining equipment \u2013 or produce consistently high enough heat to melt silica, iron, copper, rare earth or other materials.\n\nNot once did any of CNN\u2019s hosts or Green New Deal candidates so much as mention any of this. To them, \u201crenewable\u201d energy will just happen, like manna from Gaia, or beamed down from the Starship Enterprise.\n\nThey should no longer be allowed to dodge these issues, to go from assuming the climate is in crisis, to assuming \u201creliable, affordable, renewable, sustainable, eco-friendly\u201d alternatives to fossil fuel (and nuclear) energy will just magically appear, or can just be willed or subsidized into existence.\n\nCitizens, newscasters, debate hosts and legislators who are more firmly grounded in reality need to confront Green New Dealers with hard questions and icy cold facts \u2013 and keep repeating them until the candidates provide real answers. No more dissembling, obfuscation or incantations permitted.\n\nPaul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (www.CFACT.org) and author of books and articles on energy, climate, environmental and human rights issues.", "description": "CNN just hosted a seven-hour climate bore-athon.
