India's Oyo to launch Japan hotels in SoftBank JV\n\nBENGALURU, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Indian hospitality unicorn Oyo's Japanese arm is set to open over 100 hotels across the East Asian nation in a joint venture with majority investor SoftBank Group Corp , as the company looks for a path to profitability.\n\nSoftbank has been struggling to raise money for a second investment fund after the failed public offering of office-rental company WeWork - one of its marquee investments - and due to questions about the profitability of others such as Oyo and taxi aggregator Uber UBER.N . Japanese tech giant has already invested nearly $1 billion in Oyo.\n\nThe SoftBank-Oyo partnership, Oyo Hotels Japan, will open hotels in over 50 Japanese cities, including Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, Oyo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nIt was not immediately known how much either of the companies have invested in the partnership, but a person aware of the development said SoftBank and its Vision Fund will have a 50% share in the venture.", "description": "India's Oyo to launch Japan hotels in SoftBank JV", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6S0EV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
