Sadly one more student from Chattisgarh succumbed to the pressure and decided to end it all after getting what according to him were poor marks.\n\nShocked by the student's suicide, an IAS officer of 2009-batch and Kawardha district collector took to Facebook post to appeal to students to 'not to get disheartened or lose hope'.\n\nFacebook\n\n'Today I read a shocking [piece of] news in [a] newspaper that one student committed suicide because of unexpected result in the exam,' he wrote. 'I appeal to all students and their parents not to take the result very seriously! It\u2019s just a number game.

He went on to work harder to achieve his goal.\n\n\"Today choices are not limited and the opportunities will keep coming as long as the students endeavour to persist with their mission. Why to let the school percentage decide the future,\" the New Indian Express quoted him as saying.\n\nTo all the kids who are awaiting results, marks are a passing phase and it's not the final test of anybody's calibre. There are always a billion other things to aim for.", "description": "Shocked by the news of suicide, a 2009-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) Officer Awanish Kumar Sharan, who is currently the District Magistrate of Kabirdham district, Chhattisgarhm shared a post talking about the futility of results. , the IAS officer also posted the results he had obtained in his Class 10 and 12 board exams, college and other educational qualifications.", "authors": ["Kc Archana"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/May/ias_1557825054_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
