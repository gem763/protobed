The Lakers brought in LeBron James last season and still missed the postseason, so this time around they traded for Anthony Davis. They had hoped to add Kawhi Leonard and become the new Golden State Warriors. Then the Clippers not only added Leonard but Paul George. Now the Lakers may not even be the best team in their own building. HF\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe end of the superteam era means the first legitimately wide-open title race in years. The star-studded paradigm favored by the Celtics, Heat and Warriors over the last decade has given way to a two-star model co-opted by more than a dozen NBA teams. Increased league-wide parity promises an improved nightly product and a much-needed injection of suspense at the business end. BAG\n\nDuos. The regular season will mirror the offseason, with the NBA\u2019s best duos dominating the headlines in the same way they did this summer. Leonard and George with the Clippers, James and Davis with the Lakers and James Harden and Russell Westbrook with the Rockets are just a few of the superstar combinations that are sure to own the months to come. DP\n\nInjuries. Every team is one bad spill away from watching their championship dreams swirl down the drain. Take the 2019 NBA finals, for example, when Golden State lost Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson to back-to-back injuries, greatly interfering with their hopes of beating Toronto. Talent is nothing without health. MR\n\nRate the NBA\u2019s handling of the China situation out of 10\n\nStory continues\n\nCan I give a 0/10? If NBA commissioner Adam Silver is telling the truth about resisting China\u2019s demands to force Daryl Morey out from his role as GM for the Houston Rockets for tweeting in support of anti-government protestors in Hong Kong, feel free to bump this up to a 3/10 for taking at least one clear stand. Strike me as not giving the commissioner the benefit of the doubt on this one. HF\n\n7/10. The controversy has in many ways awakened the broader public to the scale of Chinese censorship \u2013 and the degree to which US corporations are willing to play along with it in pursuit of their bottom lines. The NBA has shown it\u2019s no different than the countless other American corporations who have bowed to Beijing in recent years, but Silver has done an admirable job by standing steadfastly behind his players. BAG\n\n3/10. The NBA took a benign tweet and turned it into an international fiasco. Representatives at every level of the NBA overreacted, as LeBron, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and Silver all scolded Morey and created a media firestorm. DP\n\n7/10. The NBA learned that it can\u2019t have it both ways. In Silver\u2019s first statement he toed the line, angering many people who thought he was supporting a totalitarian regime which happens to generate huge revenues for the league. After the backlash, he released another statement clarifying that the league supports free expression, later adding that Money won\u2019t be disciplined. With millions on the line, Silver was in a tough position \u2013 but he ended up doing the right thing.

Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nIf the Brooklyn Nets were getting a healthy Durant alongside Kyrie Irving, they would have a case. But Durant\u2019s likely out for the entire season, so it\u2019s clearly the Clippers for luring Leonard and George to California. HF\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 splashy acquisitions of Leonard and George could go down as the best summer for any NBA team since the Miami Heat signed Chris Bosh and James in 2010. The addition of a lengthy superstar wing player who can create for himself or his teammates off the dribble, make threes and play lockdown defense would have been enough to lift the longtime Los Angeles afterthoughts into the title conversation. Adding two of them, while managing to retain their depth, makes them overnight frontrunners in a loaded Western Conference. BAG\n\nIt would be utterly insane to argue in favor of any team other than the Clippers. Leonard\u2019s decision to skip town on the Raptors and link up with the Clippers\u2019 veterans was a win from the jump. The surprise addition of George took things over the edge, separating their summer from the rest of the pack in one of the biggest off-seasons in recent memory. DP\n\nThe Clippers secured the biggest free-agent on the market in Leonard and also acquired George. That\u2019s enough to transform a team that have never made it past the second round of the playoffs in their 49-year franchise history into instant title contenders. Leonard led the Raptors to their first-ever championship last season, perhaps he could do the same thing this year with the former laughing stocks of the league. MR\n\nOne bold prediction\n\nThe Boston Celtics will have a better record this season than they did last year despite the losses of Irving and Al Horford. The Celtics won\u2019t be able to replace everything Horford gave them but Kemba Walker could end up being a better fit for the Celtics than Irving, even if he\u2019s somewhat of a downgrade at point guard. HF\n\nLonzo Ball wins the Most Improved Player Award. The No 2 pick in the 2017 draft has resurfaced with the Pelicans after a pair of injury-hit seasons with the Lakers and he should thrive away from the drama and pressure of playing alongside LeBron. New Orleans has some interesting pieces in place, and it all should add up to plenty of opportunities for Ball to shine in his natural point guard role. BAG\n\nKyrie Irving will be a perfect teammate. Many are expecting the Nets\u2019 newest member to cause a talented team to crumble from the inside out. But I think Irving learned a lot about himself and the potential pitfalls that leaders face in the locker room and in front of the media last season. Irving has close friends around him in Kevin Durant and DeAndre Jordan and a strong leadership in Kenny Atkinson and Sean Marks. We can expect Irving to play just as well on the court and comport himself much better off it. DP\n\nDon\u2019t count out the Warriors. Sure, Durant bolted and Thompson is out at least until February with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, leaving the Warriors with a 47.5-point scoring hole. But Stephen Curry is in top shape and D\u2019Angelo Russell is awfully talented too. Not to mention, the team needed a challenge after five-straight NBA finals appearances and three championships. No more going through the motions.

Photograph: Chuck Cook/USA Today Sports\n\nZion Williamson has this one locked up if \u2013 and it turns out this could be a big if \u2013 he\u2019s healthy and doesn\u2019t miss more time once he\u2019s back from the knee surgery that has ruled him out for the start of the season. Expect the New Orleans Pelicans to be extremely cautious with the Future of the Franchise, but here\u2019s hoping that we aren\u2019t denied what could be a rookie season of the ages. HF\n\nZion Williamson\u2019s bully ball won\u2019t immediately translate to the NBA, so I expect the No 1 pick to endure some growing pains as a rookie. He\u2019s also surrounded by an intriguing mix of young and veteran talent, which could make it difficult for him to stand out even if he plays 30 minutes a night. Instead look to Ja Morant, who put up PlayStation-like numbers at Murray State and will get plenty of opportunity running the point for the rebuilding Memphis Grizzlies. BAG\n\nZion Williamson. A rare lock in a season that is otherwise impossible to predict. Williamson\u2019s game is built for New Orleans, a team full of young guards who are sure to get up and down the floor. If preseason and Summer League serve as any indication, Williamson will be productive and efficient every night. DP\n\nZion Williamson. Barring his knee injury causing problems down the line, Williamson should make an immediate impact on the league when he returns to action. He\u2019s strong, agile and unstoppable around the hoop. MR\n\nMVP\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo. If Zach Lowe says he\u2019s going back-to-back, who am I to argue? The Bucks star\u2019s main rival should be Davis, but it\u2019s hard to get the votes when you\u2019re on the same team as LeBron James. HF\n\nStephen Curry. The best shooter in the history of basketball first earned the NBA\u2019s highest individual honor in 2015, then became the first-ever unanimous winner in 2016. Only Curry\u2019s willingness to accept a scaled-back role to accommodate the addition of Durant loosened his stranglehold on the trophy. But with Durant out of the picture and Thompson sidelined all or part of the year with an ACL injury, Golden State will be relying on Curry more than ever \u2013 and his numbers will reflect it. BAG\n\nThe Lakers wanted Anthony Davis as badly as he wanted them. The worst kept secret in the NBA paired Davis with one of the best passers in league history, LeBron James. While they have two of the most transcendent basketball players in history, the Lakers are still top heavy and they\u2019ll need career years from Davis and James. If the Lakers are to make good on their lofty expectations, Davis must be the best player in Los Angeles \u2013 and the league. DP\n\nLeBron James. We all know the saying \u2018Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\u2019 Well, I believe that saying \u2013 gender notwithstanding \u2013 now applies to a certain 6ft 8in, 250lbs player from Akron. He missed the playoffs last season with the Lakers after eight-straight finals appearances. Not reaching the postseason was embarrassing for the four-time MVP, and you better believe he\u2019ll be playing with a chip on his behemoth shoulders this time around.

MR\n\nNBA finals\n\nThe Clippers now have a proven winner in Kawhi Leonard to go alongside the formidable Paul George. Photograph: Darryl Dyck/AP\n\nLA Clippers 4-2 Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks were the best team in the East last season but they lost to Leonard and the Toronto Raptors in the Conference finals. Leonard\u2019s in the West now, which means their biggest challengers in the East are an oddly-constructed Philadelphia 76ers team and whatever the post-Kyrie Boston Celtics end up being. The bad news? They may end up facing Leonard again eventually. The Clippers will have a tougher road to the finals, but if they make it they will have a clear advantage over whoever comes out of the East. HF\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers 4-3 LA Clippers. The superteam era may be over but Philadelphia may have the closest thing resembling one. The Sixers lost Jimmy Butler in free agency but added Josh Richardson and the still-underrated Al Horford to a lineup that includes Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. This is a team that\u2019s built their identity around size, versatility and defense and one of the few outfits equipped to counter the Clippers\u2019 two superstar wings. One year after pushing Kawhi and the Raptors to the limit in a seven-game Eastern Conference semi-final thriller, look for Philadelphia to go further and capture their first NBA title since 1983. BAG\n\nLA Clippers 4-2 Milwaukee Bucks. With the Warriors\u2019 dominance drawing to a close, this season feels like one of the hardest to predict. The star power is heavy across the league but so are the issues. The Clippers, Warriors and Nets have injury issues, the Lakers and Bucks have short rotations and the 76ers and Nuggets are still green. Equipped with the best stars and the strongest supporting cast, the Clippers are essentially my pick by default. DP\n\nLA Clippers 4-3 Philadelphia 76ers. Leonard and George are going to be an incredible duo, and they\u2019re going to be hungry. Coached by Doc Rivers, this team is going to go far. As for the 76ers, it\u2019s quite tough to bet against a team that added Horford to a roster with Simmons and Embiid. It will be an exciting series, with the Clippers coming out on top.
