Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats.\n\nFeinstein and the group sent a letter asking Barr to recuse himself from the investigation of the Russia probe and anything to do with investigations related to Ukraine.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Democrats have called on Attorney General Barr to recuse himself from matters related to Ukraine because of concerns about his role in President Trump\u2019s efforts to damage a political opponent and undermine the Russia investigation pic.twitter.com/iTHoxNWtCo \u2014 Senator Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) October 27, 2019\n\nFirst, Barr had absolutely nothing to do with the Ukraine call. Just because he\u2019s mentioned in the call isn\u2019t a reason to recuse.\n\nSecond, Feinstein\u2019s claim that Barr is trying to \u201cundermine the Russia investigation\u201d by investigating the origins of the probe, the FISA abuse and possible involvement of the Obama administration/FBI/DOJ officials is laughable and projection. They accuse Barr of somehow abusing his powers when that\u2019s what they are doing with their \u2018not really impeachment\u2019 effort to find something on which to get Trump.\n\nNow, this Democratic letter comes right after it was announced that the Durham investigation had turned into a criminal investigation. What a coincidence that suddenly the Democrats want to somehow besmirch the investigation and/or shut it down. Sure sounds like obstruction, by Democratic standards.\n\nOne has to wonder why Democrats and their willing fellow travelers in the media are all suddenly freaking out and why people like former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA head John Brennan seem awfully nervous.\n\nAre they concerned about what might be found about Democratic/FBI/DOJ/CIA involvement in efforts to undermine Trump with Russian and Ukrainian information in 2016?\n\nSounds like they think that Barr and U.S. Attorney Durham might be getting close and they\u2019re hoping to stave him off.\n\nIf they really want to look at people who should recuse themselves they should send a letter to their colleagues in the House and flag Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) who had prior contacts with the Ukraine whistleblower that he didn\u2019t tell the truth about and that the whistleblower failed to reveal to the ICIG. There are other questions as well, such as Schiff having a meeting with Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker, seemingly trying to pressure him as to his testimony. And there are questions as to his aide\u2019s contact with charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires Bill Taylor in Ukraine.\n\nFor that matter, Democrats don\u2019t even have to go to the House or even leave the Senate to look for Democrats who should have recused themselves.\n\nAs National Review\u2019s Andrew McCarthy observes, if anyone should have recused, it should have been Feinstein herself, from the Kavanaugh vote, after she was personally involved in holding back and allegedly not informing her colleagues of the complaint of Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nDemocrats have no leg to stand on when it comes to Barr and one can just imagine how he must be having a good laugh over that letter.\n\nLove this guy.\n\nLast time he laughed at them:\n\nWATCH: AG Barr was asked what he thought about Congress holding him in contempt\u2026 almost laughing he said, \"It goes with the territory these days.\" pic.twitter.com/LjyxXbxaV2 \u2014 Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) July 23, 2019\n\nHT: Twitchy", "description": "AG Barr Might Just Laugh His Head Off at This Request From Dianne Feinstein", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Brandon Morse", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Alex Parker", "Kira Davis", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-28-at-10.52.36-PM-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
