I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way,\u2019 James wrote.\n\nHe went on to add: \u2018That said, I will always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contribution to cinema, and can\u2019t wait to see The Irishman.\u2019\n\nHe spoke out on social media (Picture: Twitter/JamesGunn)\n\nScorcese\u2019s movie The Last Temptation of Christ prompted boycotts from vocal Christian groups upon its release in 1988 due to its departures from gospel narratives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames\u2019 comments saw mixed reactions from fans \u2013 while some agreed with him and argued that Martin\u2019s claims were unwarranted, others argued that the two situations can\u2019t be compared.\n\nThe 53-year-old went on to write: \u2018For those tweeting me I\u2019m somehow saying zealots picketing Last Temptation is the same as Scorsese judging my films, I\u2019m not. What outraged me about the picketers at the time of Last Temptation is NOT that they thought the film was blasphemous. Nor that they were picketing.\n\nJames later clarified his comments (Picture: Twitter/JamesGunn)\n\n\u2018Doing those thing are within their rights. What bothered me was that 99% of them were doing it without having seen the movie.\u2019\n\nThe Taxi Driver director faced backlash from Marvel die-hards when he spoke out about his ambivalence towards the franchise.\n\n\u2018I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema,\u2019 he told Empire magazine.\n\nAvengers: Endgame is currently the highest-grossing movie of all time (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nAvengers: Endgame this year became the highest grossing film in history with a whopping $2,796,274,401 (\u00a32,267,066,117) worldwide gross, while Avengers: Infinity War, The Avengers, Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Black Panther, Iron Man 3, Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Far From Home and Captain Marvel are all in the top 30.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel boss Kevin Feige previously defended the comic book blockbusters, saying last year at the Produced By conference: \u2018Maybe it\u2019s easy to dismiss VFX or flying people or spaceships or billion dollar grosses. I think it is easy to say that you have already been awarded in a certain way.\n\n\u2018[Alfred] Hitchcock never won best director, so it\u2019s very nice, but it doesn\u2019t mean everything. I would much rather be in a room full of engaged fans.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
