She then looped her legs into a hoop and hung upside down all the while still managing to sing.\n\nHugh Jackman has some competition from the Greatest Show(wo)man.\n\nPink treated the packed-out audience to a host of her biggest hits, including So What, Who Knew, Just Like Fire, What About Us and Raise Your Glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the incredible performance, Pink posted on Instagram: \u2018That\u2019s me up top, 100,000 strong tonight.
