Because the past three plays, I\u2019ve been staring at the sky.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, you know, he\u2019s not looking at my side, but I at least made him aware.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter Bakhtiari says he complained, Flowers was flagged for a pair of controversial illegal-hands-to-the-face penalties that had a significant impact on the outcome of the game that the Packers won, 23-22.\n\nFirst penalty led to a Packers TD\n\nThe first contested penalty negated a fourth-quarter sack on a third-down pass play that would have left the Packers in fourth-and-21. Replay clearly shows that Flowers\u2019 hand was on Bakhtiari\u2019s shoulder pad, not his facemask.\n\nWhat \u201chands to the face\u201d looks like\n\n\n\nFrom a punt to a TD, all because of the refs. Just disgusting. pic.twitter.com/K2ho1fBFEy \u2014 Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) October 15, 2019\n\nThree plays after the penalty resulted in a new set of downs, Aaron Rodgers hit Allen Lazard for a 35-yard touchdown.\n\nSecond penalty let Packers run out the clock\n\nFlowers was flagged again for the same penalty later in the quarter in another critical game situation. This time the call came on a third-down incompletion inside the two-minute warning. And this time, like the first, there was no actual hands-to-the-face violation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Packers trailed 22-20 and would have been forced to kick a field goal with around 1:36 remaining without the penalty. Instead they ran out the clock with the new set of downs, setting up Mason Crosby for the game-winning kick with no time remaining. The Lions didn\u2019t get the ball back.\n\n\u201cIt was hands to the chest initially,\u201d Flowers said after the game. \u201cI was doing it all game. I didn\u2019t know that was a flag to the chest. I didn\u2019t think hands to the chest was a penalty. I thought hands to the face [was a penalty].\n\n\u201cI had him right here to the chest, and the second time I changed it. I don\u2019t think that was a penalty.\u201d\n\nNFL says officials got it wrong\n\nThe NFL agreed.\n\nVice president of operations Troy Vincent said at owners meetings in Florida Tuesday that the second penalty on Flowers wasn\u2019t warranted.\n\n\u201cAfter you review it \u2014 you\u2019ve seen some slo-mos \u2014 the foul wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Vincent said.\n\nDavid Bakhtiari's complaint to officials may have won the Packers a game. (Getty)\n\nFair play by Bakhtiari?\n\nBakhtiari, of course, found the officials\u2019 assessment on Monday night to be fair.\n\n\u201cI can definitely tell you for a good portion of the game, I was getting my throat punched in, and I was looking up at the sky a fair amount,\u201d Bakhtiari told Packers News. \u201cIf you think about it, if your hand is in my throat, you\u2019re probably hitting my facemask, which is pushing my head up in the sky.\u201d\n\nBakhtiari isn\u2019t right about the calls. But he\u2019s definitely right about his strategy to influence officials. It may have won the Packers a game.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "David Bakhtiari's complaint to officials may have won the Packers a game.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R.q742YSCCHr6C61HysEBA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mIn99BmbrnhXLr4.qh0JzA--~B/aD0zMTQxO3c9NDcxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0ac84160-efa1-11e9-96df-2bd498dd1c95", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
