The special outfit known as Delta Force stormed into Syria, tracked down Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and cornered him in a tunnel. The coward blew himself up with a suicide vest.\n\nAmerica and the world are now safer. That\u2019s a good thing, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIt\u2019s a terrible thing because Donald Trump is president.\n\nWhen Barack Obama ordered the mission that took out Osama bin Laden, the heinous terrorist who led the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, Americans cheered \u2014 as they should.\n\nWhat did they do this time? They booed. Literally.\n\nHours after detailing the mission at the White House, Mr. Trump attended a World Series game in Washington. When his image came up on the jumbo screen, boos were heard throughout Nationals Park.\n\nThe cesspool that is D.C. was weirdly unified over the upstart team, which in May had a 0.1% chance of making the playoffs. Not any more. The mere image of the president, along with first lady Melania Trump, brought jeers from the rafters.\n\nBut let\u2019s back up. Mr. Trump was mocked Sunday when he said \u201cbin Laden was a big thing, but this is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever.\u201d Worse than bin Laden? You bet. Here\u2019s why.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was the scum of the earth. As founder and leader of the Islamic State, he was seeking to set up a global caliphate under Islamic law.\n\n\u201cHis followers burned victims alive in cages or slowly drowned them. They threw gay people off rooftops, and beheaded others on videos they then broadcast online,\u201d the Daily Mail reported. \u201cThey executed 13 teenage boys in Iraq with machine guns because they were watching a football match on TV. They shot, suicide-bombed and massacred any rival Shia Muslims they could find in a relentless frenzied attempt to ethnically cleanse them off the face of the planet.\u201d\n\nDuring his reign of terror, ISIS was responsible for the attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, as well as massacres at a soccer stadium, European cafes, a festival in France and an Ariana Grande pop concert in England. ISIS killed hundreds in the attacks and injured many more.\n\nBut the U.S. media couldn\u2019t give Mr. Trump even a modicum of credit.\n\n\u201cFace the Nation\u201d put on James Winnefeld, Barack Obama\u2019s deputy chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who ripped Mr. Trump for \u201cpiling humiliation\u201d on ISIS after the mission. \u201cIf you look back at the bin Laden raid, we treated his body with respect that is due under Islam.\u201d (For the record, they photographed his dead body then dumped him in the sea.)\n\nNick Paton Walsh, an international correspondent for CNN, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was reminiscent of ISIS, saying the \u201cexplicit details\u201d he gave \u201cechoed, frankly, the crudeness you would often expect to hear maybe from ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post went so far as to claim al-Baghdadi was courageous in death.\n\n\u201cThe assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up,\u201d columnist Max Boot wrote. Another columnist, Greg Sargent, said Mr. Trump\u2019s detailed account of what happened on the raid featured \u201cdeeply sick and twisted\u201d rhetoric.\n\nAnd, of course, The Washington Post wrote in a headline Sunday referred to al-Baghdadi was an \u201caustere religious scholar.\u201d Not \u201cworld\u2019s worst terrorist.\u201d\n\nTim Graham, director of media analysis for the Media Research Center, a conservative press watchdog, summed up the MSM\u2019s reaction.\n\n\u201cWhat a fascinating glimpse into the mind of the liberal media. They have developed such an aversion to covering the president favorably that they cannot even bear to celebrate an American special-forces victory over ISIS,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nThat\u2019s where we are today. The mainstream (read: liberal) media cannot even deliver straight news coverage on a major event that made America and the world safer.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all about to get worse, with impeachment and the 2020 election.\n\nBrace yourselves.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
