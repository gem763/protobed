But when the governor was asked, he told the media that it was simply \u201cunnecessary panic\u201d created by \u201crumour mongering\u201d.\n\nHe had lied. The next day, the Modi administration announced that Kashmir\u2019s constitutionally enshrined autonomy was being unilaterally withdrawn, and the state was being downgraded and split into two \u201cunion territories\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Hospital employees told The Independent they were largely unable to give an accurate count of their supplies in the short span of time provided.\n\nThe preparations led to a climate of hostility towards non-locals. Videos show migrant workers from the rest of India flocking to taxi ranks leaving Srinagar with only the luggage they can carry, while non-local students at the National Institute of Electronics and Information and Technology were picked out and taken away from a hostel by forces \u2013 possibly for their own safety.\n\nThe communications lockdown, in force since 4 August, meant that the scale of the preparations was not appreciated at the time, and only official statements such as those from the governor, insisting everything was OK, were widely circulated.\n\nThe announcement on 5 August, that the government was reading down Article 370 of India\u2019s constitution, meant the worst nightmare of many Kashmiris had come true.\n\nAn angry backlash was expected. But visiting the most restive districts of southern Kashmir, The Independent heard allegations from residents that security forces resorted to extreme brutality and public humiliation in order to snuff out any unrest at source.\n\nPeople in Nadapora Parigam, an area of the Pulwama district where a deadly suicide bombing killed 40 paramilitary officers in February, said that local boys were tortured by the security forces on the night of 5 August, hours after the Article 370 announcement was made.\n\nMohammad Yasin Bhat, 22, said he was dragged out of his bed at midnight by soldiers and brought out of his home to the main road, where he was made to stand naked in line with 11 other civilians.\n\nIt became apparent that security forces passing through the neighbourhood had been pelted with stones earlier in the day, and the troops were rounding up youths \u2013 seemingly at random \u2013 to find the culprits.\n\nThe officer in charge began by asking Yasin about his views of the Article 370 decision, he said. \u201cI could sense the tension around, so, for my own safety, I said \u2018we are happy \u2013 it is a good decision\u2019. But I knew he didn\u2019t trust my words,\u201d said Yasin.\n\nYasin said he and the others were asked to remove their clothes, and then beaten with canes, gun butts and kicks. He says there was no one to help them \u2013 the whole village was cordoned off, and troops were at every corner.\n\nDuring the beating, \u201cmany of us fainted\u201d, Yasin said. \u201cThey would give electric shocks in our private parts, and start the torture again.\u201d\n\nThe family showed pictures of severe bruising on Yasin\u2019s backside and thighs, while other families provided images of other youths who had suffered injuries.\n\nDuring the beating, one man who asked for water was made to drink muddy drain water from the side of the road, Yasin said. And the final indignity came when, at the end of the beating, the naked men were made to \u201clie face-down on top of each other in a pile\u201d. \u201cIt was harassment, making us feel violated,\u201d he said.\n\nNeighbours gave similar accounts of the incident. One man in his eighties, who asked not to be named, said he watched the beatings from beginning to end and, when the security forces left, came out onto the street to help \u201crescue all of the victims\u201d.\n\nYasin\u2019s is not the only allegation of torture by the security forces to have emerged since the current crisis in Kashmir began, and representatives for the Indian army have strongly denied the claims.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, which reported on alleged beatings in Pulwama on Friday, a spokesperson said the Indian army was \u201ca professional organisation that understands and respects human rights\u201d and that all allegations \u201care investigated expeditiously\u201d.\n\nOn the same night of 5 August, at around 2am, armed forces arrived at the residence of Mohammad Maqbool Khan in the New Colony area of south Kashmir\u2019s Shopian district.\n\nSoldiers started banging on the door. Maqbool\u2019s daughter in-law, Shazada Bano, said she rushed to open it in a panic.\n\n\u201cThey ordered all of us to come in the courtyard. All of us gathered and they started asking our names,\u201d she said. As soon as they heard the name of Amir Khan, a 27-year-old man who runs an electronics shop, they dragged him outside.\n\n\u201cWe tried to stop them, but they said they want him to guide them in locating a few houses for searches, and we believed them. But that wasn\u2019t true at all,\u201d said Shazada.\n\nThe next morning when they reached the nearest police station, they found Amir in lockup. Maqbool asked officials the reason for his detention and they replied simply that he \u201cwill be released after 15 August\u201d (India\u2019s Independence Day, when a spike in unrest was expected).\n\nThat never happened, and on 18 August when Maqbool went to see Amir, the commanding officer told him he had been moved to the central jail in Srinagar.\n\nThe family travelled to the city and asked after Amir. They were told he and three other men from their village had been booked under the Public Safety Act \u2013 an emergency law that allows the authorities to imprison a person for up to two years without charge or trial.\n\nOne of the other youths detained was Shahid Ahmad Bhat, a 25-year-old boy whose father Mushtaq Ahmad Bhat is a pharmacist who lives a few metres away from Maqbool.\n\nBut unlike Maqbool, Mushtaq doesn\u2019t even know where his son is being held. \u201cFor some time he was in the police station, later they said he has been shifted to Srinagar. At central jail, officials said he is not there. I have no idea where my son is, or if he is dead or alive,\u201d Mushtaq said.\n\nGovernment officials would not comment on specific cases, but they were not shy about the scale of the arrests carried out since 5 August decision. An official told The Independent that more than 4,000 people have been detained since the announcement, though they could not give an exact number. Many, like Shahid and Amir, face the prospect of potentially years in jail without any recourse to justice.", "description": "When Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s governor addressed the world in a press conference on 4 August, people in the Muslim-majority valley were worried.
