No. 2 overall pick in the 2017 draft, he was hurt scrambling on opening drive in win over Minnesota on Sept. 29. \u2026 QB Chase Daniel, who played for New Orleans from 2009-12 and in 2017, would make second straight start if Trubisky unavailable. \u2026 WR Allen Robinson had seven receptions for 97 yards, two TDs against Oakland. In only game against New Orleans, Robinson had six catches for 151 yards and one TD playing for Jacksonville on Dec. 27, 2015. \u2026 Fantasy Tip: The Saints figure to continue leaning on Thomas, particularly if RB Alvin Kamara (knee, ankle) is unavailable or limited.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (5-1) at CHICAGO (3-2)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
