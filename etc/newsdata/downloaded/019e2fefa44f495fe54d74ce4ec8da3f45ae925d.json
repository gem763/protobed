Add Interest\n\nThe explosive rise in a serious lung illness linked to vaping spotlights the popularity of e-cigarettes among teens and young adults \u2014 and how little is known about the devices\u2019 safety and use.\n\nAs of Tuesday, federal health officials were investigating at least 450 possible cases of the mysterious pulmonary illness across 33 states, including six cases that resulted in death. California has reported nearly 60 cases of lung illness since late June in patients with a history of vaping; one of those patients, in Los Angeles County, has died.\n\nHarriet Blair Rowan/California Healthline\n\nVaping has surged in the past two years, particularly among teenagers and young adults. More than 20% of high school students reported vaping in 2018 \u2014 almost twice the 2017 rate \u2014 according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That translates to 3 million high school students using e-cigarettes in 2018 \u2014 well more than double the number who reported using traditional cigarettes.\n\nVaping is the popular shorthand for using electronic cigarettes to \u201cvaporize\u201d nicotine or an array of liquid concentrates. The devices initially were marketed as a way to inhale nicotine without the risks associated with burning tobacco. But they quickly evolved for use with hundreds of combinations of flavorings and chemical compounds, including THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and other marijuana extracts.\n\nFederal and state investigators say many of the people who have fallen ill said they had vaped THC, and officials are focusing on contaminants in black-market products containing THC as possible culprits. Other patients reported using nicotine cartridges, and authorities stress that they have yet to identify a specific device or chemical at play. For now, officials are warning people of all ages to avoid e-cigarettes, particularly products purchased on the street.\n\nHarriet Blair Rowan/California Healthline\n\nVaping is now so pervasive among high school students that federal health officials say its use has fueled a sharp reversal in what had been a celebrated two-decade decline in overall tobacco use by teenagers. As of 2018, the CDC\u2019s National Youth Tobacco Survey showed overall tobacco usage among high schoolers had reverted to levels not seen since 2004. Though marketed as a healthy alternative to traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes can contain substantial levels of nicotine, which is highly addictive.\n\nJuul, the San Francisco-based company that dominates the e-cigarette trade, and other manufacturers publicly market their devices as a tool to help adults quit smoking. But government surveys show the sleek devices \u2014 and multitude of copycat products \u2014 are far more popular among high school students than adults. While the legal age to buy e-cigarettes is 18 in most states \u2014 and 21 in California \u2014 the products are widely available online and not all sellers require proof of age. And vaping kits now come in the form of pens, flash drives, key fobs, even watches \u2014 making them both stylish and easy to disguise.\n\nHarriet Blair Rowan/California Healthline\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
