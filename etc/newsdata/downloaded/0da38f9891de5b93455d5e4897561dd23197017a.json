(AP) - The Western Kentucky Hilltoppers will do anything for the chance to play their neighboring Power Five teams, even if it means going across state lines.\n\nThe Hilltoppers will be playing Louisville at Nissan Stadium, home to the NFL\u2019s Tennessee Titans, on Saturday as their \u201chome\u201d game in a three-year contract requiring a visit from Western Kentucky to the Cardinals\u2019 stadium. It\u2019s the first neutral site game between these teams, and first-year Western Kentucky coach Tyson Helton can\u2019t wait.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great. I love the atmosphere,\u201d Helton said. \u201cI love that we\u2019re going down to Nashville, I love that it\u2019s at Titans Stadium, I love that it\u2019s an in-state opponent. I make no bones about it, I would love to play a Louisville or Kentucky every year, for nothing more than I think it\u2019s great for the state, for college football. I know that\u2019s not the case, but just the opportunity to play against a really good opponent.\u201d\n\nNissan Stadium has almost become a home away from home for the Hilltoppers, who are playing their third game and first since 2013 in that building. Western Kentucky lost to Kentucky in 2011, though Bobby Petrino beat Kentucky 35-26 in 2013 in his coaching debut with the Hilltoppers.\n\nLouisville barely edged Western Kentucky 20-17 last year in Petrino\u2019s final season. Scott Satterfield is now coaching the Cardinals (1-1) and got his first win last week by shutting out Eastern Kentucky 42-0 . That ended a 10-game losing streak dating back to Louisville\u2019s victory over Western Kentucky last September. Petrino was fired in November with two games left in a 2-10 season for the Cardinals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, because we did get a win, no question about it,\u201d Satterfield said. \u201cBut, win or lose, last week has nothing to do with this week. Win or lose, it\u2019s a new week. \u2026 Everything now is straight-focus on WKU.\u201d\n\nThe Hilltoppers (1-1) won their Conference USA opener 20-14 at Florida International last week after losing at home to Central Arkansas in the season opener. The Hilltoppers finished 2018 with a 3-9 mark under Mike Sanford. Helton called it a big confidence win for the Hilltoppers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about that and it helps us to try and take the next step,\u201d Helton said.\n\nSome things to know about Western Kentucky\u2019s \u201chome\u201d game with Louisville:\n\nROAD WOES\n\nThe Cardinals ended one skid last week with a blowout victory over Eastern Kentucky. They will attempt to end a six-game losing streak on the road. Louisville\u2019s last road victory was a 44-17 win over Kentucky in Lexington in November 2017 with Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson.\n\nWALKER RUNNING\n\nWestern Kentucky running back Gaej Walker leads Conference USA in rushing through two games, totaling 252 yards on 46 carries against Central Arkansas and Florida International. Walker ranks 11th in the nation in rushing yards and seventh overall in carries.\n\nINTERCEPTION ISSUES\n\nSteven Duncan has thrown for lots of yards through Western Kentucky\u2019s first two games, putting up 545 against Central Arkansas and Florida International. The redshirt junior has three touchdown passes, but Duncan also has been intercepted four times already as well with one returned for a touchdown by FIU.\n\nGRINDING IT OUT\n\nLouisville coach Scott Satterfield wants to run. Through the first two games, the Cardinals have run the ball 85 times averaging 285.5 yards per game. Louisville ran for 322 yards last week against Eastern Kentucky - the Cardinals\u2019 highest rushing total since getting 346 yards against Kentucky in the 2017 regular season finale. Javian Hawkins has been leading the way, with 245 yards through two games, including 197 coming after contact.\n\nPASSING WITH PASS\n\nJawon Pass had his best game last week for Louisville, completing 12 of 19 for 196 yards and a career-high four touchdown passes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Western Kentucky Hilltoppers will do anything for the chance to play their neighboring Power Five teams, even if it means going across state lines.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Terry Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/e_kentucky_louisville_football_07381_c0-153-3663-2288_s1770x1032.jpg?c6ff9bdbe4e9f8c0b0e04fb3eea64108325022c3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
