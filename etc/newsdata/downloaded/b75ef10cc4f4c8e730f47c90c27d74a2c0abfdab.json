He also claimed Kurds in northern Syria 'may be releasing some' ISIS fighters from their prisons as a tactic to draw the U.S. military back in.\n\nThe militants, he said, would be '[e]asily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.'\n\nThe Turkish onslaught in Syria has raised fears that ISIS fighters and their families held by the Kurdish-led forces previously allied with Washington might escape and reorganize the terrorist group. Hundreds are said to have escaped already.\n\nKilmeade and his two 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts, Ainsley Earhardt and Steve Doocy, began the 7:00 a.m. hour on Monday with a news alert about a coming Turkish incursion aimed at driving Kurdish-led fighters from the Syrian town of Manbij.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that Kurds in northern Syria are releasing some ISIS militants from prisons as Turkish troops approach, and claimed it was a tactic to get the U.S> to return to the battlefield\n\nTrump lashed out at a Fox News Channel host on Monday for saying Turkey was 'carving up the Kurds' as a result of Trump's troop pullout from northern Syria\n\nA Turkish-backed Syrian fighter is pictured firing during clashes in the border town of Ras al-Ain on Sunday as Turkey and its allies continue their assault on Kurdish-held border towns in northeastern Syria\n\n'Fox & Friends' began its second hour on Monday with a 'news alert' about Turkey's advance on Kurdish-controlled Syrian border towns, leading Brian Kilmeade (right) to complain about the president's actions\n\n'Breaking overnight, the country of Turkey warning of an imminent attack on a major Kurdish stronghold,' Doocy said.\n\n'That's right,' Earhardt added. 'The Syrian city is at risk three years after U.S. troops helped the Kurds take it back from ISIS.'\n\nKilmeade, who has been the trio's most critical of Trupm since he announced the Syria troop pullout, quipped: 'Yeah, they're carving up the Kurds right now and we're just moving out.'\n\nHe added a jab about 'how the U.S. is responding \u2013 or not responding.'\n\nTrump blames other nations for relying on U.S. backed Kurds to keep thousands of ISIS fighters under wraps while refusing to repatriate them.\n\n'Europe had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn't want the cost,' he tweeted Monday. '\"Let the USA pay,\" they said.'\n\nHe also announced '[b]ig sanctions on Turkey coming!'\n\nSyrian government troops moved into a series of towns and villages in northern Syria Monday, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces in the area, as U.S. troops prepared to pull out.\n\nProtesters attended a New York City demonstration Saturday against the Turkish military operation in northern Syria\n\nSmoke rises after Members of Syrian National Army hit terror targets in Syria's Ras al-Ayn to clear the town from PKK terror group and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey regards as a terror group, following entering the territory east of Euphrates River in northern Syria\n\nPeople look on as smoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, in a picture taken from the Turkish side of the border in Ceylanpinar during Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces\n\nThe Syrian army's deployment near the Turkish border came hours after Syrian Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad's government to help fend off Turkey's invasion, now in its sixth day.\n\nThe announcement of a deal between Syria's Kurds and its government is a major shift in alliances that came after President Donald Trump ordered all U.S. troops withdrawn from the northern border area amid the rapidly spreading chaos.\n\nThe shift sets up a potential clash between Turkey and Syria and raises the specter of a resurgent Islamic State group as the U.S. relinquishes any remaining influence in northern Syria to Assad and his chief backer, Russia.\n\nThe fighting also seems likely to endanger, if not altogether crush, the brief experiment in self-rule set up by Syria's Kurds since the war began.\n\n'We are going back to our normal positions that are at the border,' said a Syrian officer said, as embattled Kurdish authorities invited the government to retake towns and villages in the north.\n\nSyrian troops arrived on Monday in the northern province of Raqqa aboard buses and pickup trucks with mounted heavy machineguns.\n\nTurkey has pressed on with its invasion of northern Syria, warning its NATO allies in Europe and the United States not to stand in its way.\n\nIn this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, residents welcomed Syrian soldiers shortly after they entered the northern town of Tal Tamr on Monday; Kurds said Syrian government forces agreed to help them fend off Turkey's invasion, a major shift in alliances\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to the media in Istanbul on Monday, criticizing NATO allies that are looking to broaden an arms embargo against Turkey over its push into northern Syria\n\nTurkish troops and Syrian proxy forces have steadily pushed their way south of the border, clashing with the Kurdish fighters over a stretch of 200 kilometers (125 miles). The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people.\n\nTurkey's president signaled that it was ready to launch an assault on the city of Manbij, where Kurdish-led groups invited Syrian government forces to re-enter and defend the town.\n\n'We are about to implement our decision on Manbij,' President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Monday.\n\nHe added that Turkey's aim would be to return the city to Arab populations whom he said where its rightful owners.\n\nTurkish forces were already positioned at the city's edge, according to CNN-Turk.\n\nErdogan has already said Turkey will not negotiate with the Syrian Kurdish fighters, which it considers 'terrorists' for links to a long-running Kurdish insurgency within its own borders.\n\nSyrian state media reported late Sunday that government troops were marching toward Manbij - as well as the border town of Kobani that in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group's first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.\n\nTrump has long argued that the U.S. should be involved in less military adventurism around the globe\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters are pictured in the town of Ayn al-Arus, south of the border town of Tal Abyad, on Monday as Turkey and its allies continue their assault on Kurdish-held border towns\n\nA wounded child injured in an alleged Turkish airstrike is pictured receiving medical treatment at a hospital in Tal Tamr, northeastern of Syria, on Sunday\n\nIn another direction, Syrian troops moved east from Aleppo province to Raqqa where state media said they had reached Ein Issa. Heavy fighting the previous day there reached a Kurdish-run displaced-person camp that is home to some 12,000 people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of ISIS fighters and their children. Hundreds are believed to escaped amid the chaos.\n\nThe Syrian army also moved into the town of Tal Tamr, which is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Turkish border, and Tabqa, known for its dam on the Euphrates River and its nearby air base that carries the same name.\n\nSANA said government forces planned to 'confront the Turkish aggression,' without giving further details. Photos posted by SANA showed several vehicles and a small number of troops in Tal Tamr.\n\nTal Tamr is a predominantly Assyrian Christian town that was once held by ISIS before it was retaken by Kurdish-led forces. Many Syrian Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million, left for Europe over the past 20 years, with the flight gathering speed since the country's conflict began in March 2011.", "description": "Brian Kilmeade 'got it all wrong,' the president said on Twitter.
