Martin and Ryan Condal.\n\nIt would be set 300 years before the events of \"Game of Thrones\" and tracks the beginning of the end for House Targaryen.\n\nHBO declined to comment.\n\nThis would be the second prequel series with a greenlit pilot (HBO still has not ordered the first prequel, set in the Age of Heroes, to series).\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nHold your dragons, \"Game of Thrones\" fans, another prequel of the hugely popular fantasy series is eyeing a green light.\n\nI've learned that HBO is close to giving a pilot order to a \"Game of Thrones\" prequel from author and \"Game of Thrones\" co-executive producer George R.R. Martin and \"Colony\" co-creator/exec producer Ryan Condal, which is set 300 years before the events in \"Game of Thrones\" and tracks the beginning of the end for House Targaryen. The network declined comment.\n\nRead more: The first 'Game of Thrones' prequel show is moving forward at HBO \u2014 here's what you need to know\n\nCreated by Martin and Condal and written by Condal, I hear the project is based on the \"Fire & Blood\" book by Martin and has been in the works at HBO since last fall.\n\nThis prequel would be one of the five possible ideas previously teased by HBO\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin is the author of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book series and \"Fire and Blood.\" Rich Polk/Getty Images\n\nAccording to sources, the Condal/Martin project is not a sixth \"Game of Thrones\" prequel.\n\nI hear it represents a brand new take on a world originally tackled by Bryan Cogman in one of the five \"Game of Thrones\" prequel scripts commissioned by HBO in 2017. Former \"Game of Thrones\" co-executive producer Cogman confirmed in April that his prequel idea was not going forward.\n\nIn typical Martin fashion, the author had been dropping clues about the House Targaryen prequel project all along. \"We have had five different 'Game of Thrones' successor shows in development at HBO, and three of them are still moving forward nicely,\" he wrote on his blog in May.\n\nThe first prequel announced will involve the time period leading up to the creation of the White Walkers. HBO\n\nOne of the three is the untitled prequel, written by Jane Goldman and starring Naomi Watts, which shot a pilot this summer. The project, now in post-production and awaiting word whether it will get a pickup, chronicles the world's descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.\n\n\"Two other shows remain in the script stage, but are edging closer,\" Martin wrote in May. \"What are they about? I cannot say. But maybe some of you should pick up a copy of 'Fire & Blood' and come up with your own theories.\"\n\nRead more: George R.R. Martin says HBO's 'Game of Thrones' wasn't 'very good' for him\n\nCoincidentally \u2014 or not \u2014 a large image of the 'Fire & Blood' cover was featured just above this section in the same blog post with a note about the book's success, having just re-entered New York Times' Top 10 bestseller list where it had previously spent more than three months.\n\n\"You can't keep a good dragon down,\" Martin wrote about the feat.\n\nDrogon and Daenerys on the eighth season of \"Game of Thrones.\" HBO\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin's 'Fire and Blood' book outlines all the bloody Targaryen history\n\nNamed after House Targaryen's words, \"Fire & Blood's\" first volume was published last November with the tag line, \"300 Years Before a Game of Thrones, Dragons Ruled Westeros.\"\n\nThe Targaryen history book, a companion to Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" saga, goes back to a time when House Targaryen \u2014 the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria \u2014 took up residence on Dragonstone.\n\n\"Fire & Blood\" starts off with Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold the throne, all the way up to the civil war, known as the Dance of the Dragons, that nearly tore their dynasty apart. The war will be a significant part of the TV adaptation, I hear.\n\nViserys and Daenerys Targaryen were among the last living members of their great House. HBO\n\n\"Game of Thrones,\" which is based on \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" featured a couple of surviving Targaryens, including Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd), and Jon Snow (Kit Harington).\n\nHBO executives have previously said they want to be 'careful' about making 'Game of Thrones' spin-offs and prequels\n\nAt TCA in July, HBO Programming President Casey Bloys would not comment on the status of the other \"Game of Thrones\" prequels besides the Watts pilot, but did not rule out the possibility for another \"Game of Thrones\" offshoot to get a green light by the end of the year.\n\n\"It's something I would not comment on,\" he said.\n\nJust days before, \"Game of Thrones\" had landed a whopping 32 Emmy nominations for its final season, breaking yet another Emmy record, for most nominations in a single year. The show, a three-time outstanding drama series Emmy winner, also holds the Emmy record for most overall wins, 47 and counting, most wins in a single year, 12, and most total nominations for a scripted series, 161.\n\nRead more: 7 shows nominated for Emmys this year that critics don't actually like\n\nDaenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow on the \"Game of Thrones\" series finale. Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nBeyond critical acclaim, \"Game of Thrones\" was a rare cultural juggernaut, with more than 45 million people tuning in for its final episodes.\n\n\"We are proud to have been the home for it, it's been a great show for us,\" Bloys said after the \"Game of Thrones\" finale in May.\n\nA month earlier, Bob Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer, addressed the possibility of putting multiple \"Game of Thrones\"-themed shows on the air in light of the original series' enormous global success.\n\n\"It's a double-edged sword,\" he told Deadline. \"We're having conversations about how do we smartly continue the 'Game of Thrones' universe, but we have to be really thoughtful about not killing the golden goose and not putting on shows that aren't up to that quality level, and how many is too many.\"\n\nA Targaryen-focused series would involve lots of dragons by default. HBO/\"Game of Thrones\"\n\nBloys echoed his sentiment.\n\n\"I think 'Game of Thrones' is a fantastic property but I don't want to just be the home of prequels and sequels and all that stuff,\" he said. \"I think you want to be really careful about how you do it.\"\n\nCondal was the co-creator, executive producer and showrunner of sci-fi drama \"Colony,\" which aired on USA for three seasons. On the film side, he has been adapting \"Logan's Run\" for Warner Bros. In addition to executive producing all \"Game of Thrones\" prequels, Martin executive produces the \"Wild Cards\" universe Hulu is developing based on his books. He also recently executive produced the Syfy series \"Nightflyers.\"\n\nCondal and Martin have long-standing relationship. In 2016, Martin's theatre in Santa Fe, Jean Cocteau Cinema, hosted a screening of \"Colony,\" followed by a conversation between Martin and Condal.\n\nCondal is repped by Grandview and McKuin Frankel. Martin is with manager Vince Gerardis. Both Condal and Martin also were repped in the original deal for the project, which was made last fall, by WME.", "description": "Deadline reports the network might soon give the order for a pilot for a series set 300 years before the events of the hit fantasy series.", "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/57911c60dd089552598b4acf?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
