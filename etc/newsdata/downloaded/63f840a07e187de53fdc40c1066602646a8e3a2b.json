Adaptations by Ireland\u2019s Michael Keegan-Dolan and Britain\u2019s Matthew Bourne steer clear of anything so predictable. For instance, a commanding 84-year-old woman has a prominent role in Keegan-Dolan\u2019s \u201cLocho na hEala\u201d (\u201cThe Lake of the Swan\u201d in Irish) at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Oct. 15-20.\n\nIt isn\u2019t Keegan-Dolan\u2019s style to follow convention. Every couple of years \u2014 or whenever inspiration strikes \u2014 he invites dancers to collaborate on a new project, calling the group Teac Damsa, or \u201cHouse of Dance.\u201d They work at his home in the small coastal town of Dingle, in Ireland\u2019s County Kerry (lately a hot tourist spot; the last two Star Wars movies were shot nearby). Keegan-Dolan moved there to be immersed in the native Irish language, which should give you a sense of what kind of \u201cSwan Lake\u201d he has created. Keegan-Dolan\u2019s version looks beyond the 19th-century treatment to older folk tales about people being turned into animals and birds as punishment, and reaches forward, pulling in aspects of modern Irish life.\n\nAt 75 minutes, this eclectic work is surreal and industrial looking all at once. The lake is black plastic. Keegan-Dolan has tossed out the Tchaikovsky score and remodeled the traditional character of Von Rothbart, the evil sorcerer, into a holy man who addresses the audience in monologues and takes on multiple identities. He also sings Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall.\u201d Live musicians contribute most of the music, which veers toward traditional Irish. The prince is a fellow named Jimmy O\u2019Reilly, who happens to be suicidal.\n\n\u201cDepression is common,\u201d Keegan-Dolan said in a recent phone interview from Dingle, where he had to step outside his house to get a connection. \u201cAnd it is universal, and it is almost necessary, like winter is necessary for things to regenerate.\u201d\n\nIt was the notion of a depressed prince that attracted Keegan-Dolan to \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Depression has surfaced in his family, and he thought it could explain why the ballet\u2019s leading man is typically depicted as a loner, uninterested or unable to connect with the people around him.\n\n\u201cThat aspect of the prince is much more interesting to me than a prince who\u2019s 6 feet tall with a great chin and blond hair,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can take a childish, perhaps silly story that\u2019s founded on a profound mythology, and it has all this information that might help one navigate life.\u201d\n\nHow so?\n\n\u201cHow long do you have?\u201d Keegan-Dolan replied, chuckling. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s this: Somehow one could walk away from a performance thinking it\u2019s okay that these darker emotions take hold of us. We don\u2019t need to be ashamed of them. They\u2019re part of life.\u201d\n\n\n\nMatthew Bourne\u2019s \u201cSwan Lake\u201d swaps out the traditional female corps de ballet with men in feathered breeches. (Kristian Dowling/Getty Images)\n\nBourne\u2019s \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d coming to the Kennedy Center on Jan. 21-26 with its thunderous flock of hairy, shirtless and homoerotic male swans, isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call experimental \u2014 after all, it played on Broadway. But it challenged expectations of what \u201cSwan Lake\u201d could be and now features some updates since its explosive 1995 premiere, when Bourne shocked and thrilled audiences (and angered some) by swapping out a corps de ballet in tutus for glistening men in feathered breeches.\n\nThe story centers on a modern royal family beset by scandal. The queen is struggling to put things right, yet the heir apparent (one can\u2019t help but compare him to a young Prince Charles) wants none of it; he\u2019s having doubts about his sexual identity and his future. His tender duet with a male swan created a stir and prompted some walkouts in the work\u2019s early outings, but 24 years later, that feels like a different age.\n\nIt\u2019s the timelessness of Bourne\u2019s approach that will be tested by this revival tour. Indeed, the quest for acceptance and resiliency in the face of loss are its major themes, just as they are in the traditional, classical \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d\n\n\n\nBe prepared, however, for twists. Bourne takes inspiration from the whirling glamour of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cThe Birds,\u201d to deliver fresh views of what love, romance and midnight hookups look like. And even what a Tchaikovsky waltz can look like.\n\nEspecially when miniskirted molls in a back-alley dive are leading it.", "description": "Michael Keegan-Dolan and Matthew Bourne knock the classical ballet sideways.", "authors": ["Sarah L.
