The level of disrespect. You should be ashamed for the way you\u2019ve left the club after nine years!\u2019 said Wright in August.\n\nHowever, Koscielny has dismissed Wright\u2019s claims and says he always gave his \u2018maximum\u2019 for the club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always been upstanding, respectful and loyal,\u2019 said Wright.\n\n\u2018I always gave my maximum. I spoke with the coach, who was understanding. And as for the rest\u2026\u2019\n\nArsenal replaced Koscielny with David Luiz from Chelsea in the final days of the transfer window.\n\nKoscielny did not reveal his reasons for wanting to leave the club last summer but he insists now that it was due to the physical demands of the Premier League.\n\n\u2018A Premier League season is very long. It requires a lot physically and mentally. I didn\u2019t feel I could play 40-50 matches and I didn\u2019t want to end my career with injuries. I\u2019ve gone down a level, but to take more pleasure,\u2019 said Koscielny.\n\n\u2018Either I finished there or changed clubs. With my family, we felt it was time. Everything was in my thinking: football, my physical state, my wife, my children, the daily life we could have.\n\n\u2018I can only say that I left with my head held high. All of those I worked with for nine years\u2026 everyone respected my decision to return home with my family.\u2019\n\nMORE: What England need to qualify for Rugby World Cup quarter-finals \u2013 and how to avoid New Zealand", "description": "Former Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny has hit back at Ian Wright's claims that he disrespected the club by insisting he was 'loyal' to the Gunners.
