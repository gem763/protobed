The mobility scooter.\n\nAlmost every Japanese maker is presenting solutions for the aged and infirm. There are sit-on scooters galore, plus powered wheelchairs, self-righting \u201cwalkers\u201d, home assistant robots and various concept cars designed to highlight how automation will benefit those who can\u2019t, or no longer wish to, hold a steering wheel.\n\n\"We are confident you will see the car on Australian roads,\" says Mazda Australia's Alastair Doak.\n\nThe demographics tell it all. Twenty-eight per cent of Japanese citizens are over 65 years old, and the population is shrinking as dramatically as it is ageing. There will be fewer and fewer young people to look after the swelling ranks of the elderly.\n\nThe car show itself is also shrinking, as are almost all others. Most foreign makers have stayed away from Tokyo and most cars on display are micros aimed at the domestic market.\n\nExceptions include the Lexus LF-30 concept and a near-production ready electric SUV from Mazda. Known as the MX-30, it has a fastback roof, and reverse opening rear doors like a Mazda RX-8 or BMW i3. Mazda has confirmed few details beyond the fact the MX-30 will go on sale in Europe next year, and could come to Australia after that.\n\nThe interior of the MX-30. No specs are available yet.\n\n\u201cIt is very much on our wish list,\u201d says Mazda Australia marketing director Alastair Doak \u201cand we are very confident you will see it on Australian roads \u2013 probably in 2021.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is no indication yet of pricing, it will be most likely be an expensive niche model.\n\nAt September\u2019s Frankfurt Motor Show, attendance numbers were down 30 per cent on the previous show (2017) and more than 40 per cent on 2015. Many in the industry have pointed out that such shows are no longer the most cost-effective way of connecting with consumers, nor the best way for consumers to gain all the details on the latest new models.\n\nAlso on show in Tokyo: Suzuki's Kupo can be used as a cart for shopping or as an electric wheelchair.\n\nTellingly, VW has just unveiled its eighth-series Golf, yet chose not display it at either Frankfurt or Tokyo.\n\nCan the world\u2019s few remaining major car shows survive?
