Companies have been taking advantage of this, as you can see in Tesla\u2019s twin-trunk designs and Volkswagen\u2019s volume-maximising reborn electric Microbus. A startup called Canoo is taking a similar approach as VW, with an EV that\u2019s a clever study in the maximisation of interior volume. You know, a van.\n\nThough it\u2019s not autonomous, though the company says they\u2019re working on that, the room-on-wheels design is exactly what future autonomous vehicles should be (there may be a book out that says just that) and even in its current, human-driven form, the design looks incredibly flexible and usable.\n\nThe Canoo was designed by Richard Kim, the designer behind BMW\u2019s very innovative i3 and the sleek i8, and while there are clear similarities to Kim\u2019s earlier designs, the Canoo shows a much purer design, an unashamed, streamlined, heavily-windowed box on a skateboard, an envelope that surrounds a very versatile and appealing interior.\n\nThe front and rear profiles of the Canoo are just about identical; were it not for the position of the rear-view mirrors and colours of the lights, it would be hard to tell which end was front and which was the rear. It\u2019s sort of like a very modernised VW Bus, or perhaps even an enlarged and updated Z\u00fcndapp Janus.\n\nThe rear of the vehicle has a U-shaped bench seat, with what appears to be seat belts for three passengers. There\u2019s also some flip-down jump seats behind the front seats as well, adding two more places to sit:\n\nIf there are seat belts provided for the side-mounted seats, you could have five on the rear bench, plus the two jump seats, plus the front seats, for a total of nine seats, which seems about right.\n\nThere are some cubbies under the rear seats and in the doors, but it looks like there are no strictly-designated cargo areas, though there is certainly room for plenty of cargo on the large, flat floor area.\n\nIt also appears that the rear bench can fold to make room for bulky cargo, like that dude\u2019s asphalt-coloured surfboard, and it looks like there are two little modules in the side panel there, one containing a clock and the other having what I think is a small planter?\n\nIt also appears that the front seats can rotate, Captian\u2019s Chair-style, which is always a good thing for a van. There\u2019s also plenty of windows in the roof as well, and the whole interior feels incredibly airy and open. It looks like it has lots of camping potential as well, and while I haven\u2019t actually touched any of the interior materials, these pictures do make it look like they could be fairly hard-wearing and hopefully easily washable.\n\nThe Canoo uses conventional hinged doors instead of a more van-like sliding door, which is sort of a curious choice, but not necessarily a bad one. The only really glaring bad choice I can see here is in the driver\u2019s controls, with a steering wheel that\u2019s not a wheel at all, but a square frame:\n\nVisibility looks great, sure, with that extra low window below the beltline, but does anyone actually like driving with a rectangle?\n\nThe centre of the not-wheel has an airbag with a lot of text I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t need to have so constant and prominent, while the instrumentation appears to be on the beltline band separating the upper and lower windshields.\n\nThere\u2019s a large volume of space in front of the instrument panel that I suppose could be used for cargo, at the risk of blocking that lower window.\n\nThe fundamental design of the Canoo I think is great. It\u2019s logical and practical yet feels sleek and futuristic as well. This is what Tesla\u2019s Model X should have been, really, instead of a chubby SUV with fancy doors. This has the potential to be a genuine do-anything electric transport pod, and I mean that in a good way.\n\nTechnically, the 4,453-pound Canoo has a single rear-mounted motor making a claimed 300 horsepower, and with their floor-mounted 80 kWh battery pack, they claim a range of 402km, all decent numbers.\n\nCanoo has some diagrams that suggest alternate bodies for their platform may be possible down the road, for sportier models, possibly with HVAC fans capable of blowing ties backward.\n\nNow, Canoo\u2019s model isn\u2019t an ownership one, so if you want to buy one, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s a subscription model, much like what Lynk & Co is planning, where everything \u2014 insurance, registration, maintenance, even charging costs \u2014 is wrapped up in a monthly fee. It\u2019s not clear if there will be minimums or not yet, but if there aren\u2019t this could potentially even compete with rental cars.\n\nThe design looks impressive, but the real question is, of course, will it actually happen? Canoo was born as EVelozcity (and thankfully they\u2019ve changed that idiotic name) and began with a lot of people who came from perpetual shitshow Faraday Future, amid a lot of fighting and legal battles.\n\nThings seem to have settled down, and Canoo allegedly has decent funding, but this is a hard business to get going in, so I\u2019m not sure a breath-holding policy makes sense here. Like all startups, we can only dream.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a clever vehicle, and could be interesting competition to Volkswagen\u2019s upcoming ID Buzz. A lot will depend on how much those monthly subscriptions are, and how well they can be supported.\n\nI guess we\u2019ll just have to see.", "description": "One of the biggest advantages of electric vehicles is that they can potentially have far more packaging flexibility than combustion-engine cars.
