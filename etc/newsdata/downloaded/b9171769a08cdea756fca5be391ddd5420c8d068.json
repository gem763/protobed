It was broken about three years ago and is now above 25 000.\n\nIdentifying the precise levels that trigger adrenaline in the market is important for trading the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. That\u2019s because, with scant fundamentals and an opaque ownership structure, knowing the pressure points of others can be paramount for investors.\n\nThe data currently underline a growing confidence in the digital coin when it holds above the round number of $10 000, and a thinning out near $12 000. It\u2019s only closed above the higher number five times this year. Bitcoin in fact is demonstrating an almost inverse bell curve of prices, the analysis shows.\n\n\"You\u2019re seeing it range-bound now,\" said Erlam. \"And the highs it\u2019s been reaching are lower and lower. When it breaks out of this range, you could see a fairly strong move down.\n\nThe most-traded virtual currency was steady at $10 358 versus Friday\u2019s close as of 7:41 a.m. in New York.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has diminished over the past month. It\u2019s 30-day average daily move is 2.4% up or down, compared with 5.5% back in mid-July, according to a separate Bloomberg study.A similar study using data from Coinbase Inc., another of the largest crypto platforms, also showed a strong concentration at $10 000, though less so approaching $12 000.", "description": "Bitcoin\u2019s trading range is narrowing as speculators seek positions on the right side of a potential break-out.", "authors": ["Todd White"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7615/0947c77fd4a74214acd86ec29f1968a5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
