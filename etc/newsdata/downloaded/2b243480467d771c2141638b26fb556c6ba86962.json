In the Harry Potter films, Voldemort's robes faded in colour every time a Horcrux was destroyed, to give the impression he was slowly fading away.\"\n\nThose who have seen the Deathly Hallows Part Two will remember that during his final battle, when Harry defeats him, Voldemort crumbles to pieces as he dies.\n\nAccording to information given on the Warner Bros Studio Tour, the faded effect was achieved by interweaving seven robes with different shades of green. Each robe became slightly duller in colour, the more pieces of his soul were stripped away.\n\nWizarding World's post has been liked more than 260,000 times, with many Potterheads sharing their shock at the revelation.\n\nOne person commented: \"So cool! I don't think I ever noticed that.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Now I need to watch all of these over again to spot this!!\"\n\nA third added: \"Holy s*** I didn't know.\"\n\nSomeone else exclaimed: \"Wow!\"\n\n(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nVoldemort was portrayed by several different actors over the course of the eight films, including Christian Coulson in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nMost notably, from the Goblet of Fire onwards, he was played by Ralph Fiennes.\n\nThe Harry Potter movies are based on the best-selling book series of the same name written by J.K. Rowling.", "description": "The Wizarding World Instagram account has shared an interesting fact about Voldemort's costume in the films", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Allstar", "Warner Bros."], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6419759.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_MAIN-RALPH-FIENNES-Characters-Lord-Voldemort-Film-HARRY-POTTER-AND-THE-ORDER-OF-THE-PHOENIX-2007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
