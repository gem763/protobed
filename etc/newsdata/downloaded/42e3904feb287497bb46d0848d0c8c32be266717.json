She\u2019s a hugely significant part of this upcoming season, and the overall universe and the stories planned all exist in the head of [chief content officer] Scott Gimple. He has his plans of what will happen and we don\u2019t always even know how it\u2019s going to go.\n\nCould Michonne reunite with Rick in the movies? (Picture: AMC)\n\n\u2018But for me personally as a fan, if there\u2019s a chance of seeing Michonne again either here in the movie, or whatever else they come up with, I would be very excited to see that happen.\u2019\n\nA big indicator of whether Michonne could return depends on when the Rick Grimes movies will be set in the timeline, with his initial departure followed by a timeline jump in the show of six years.\n\nMichonne hasn\u2019t seen Rick throughout that whole period, so unless they use flashbacks or the movies are set beyond events in season 10, it could be tricky for her to make a return in a logical way.\n\nA trilogy of movies around Rick, however, would feel odd without Michonne\u2019s inclusion considering how important they\u2019ve been to one another, so we\u2019ll just have to see if Danai\u2019s departure will hold some answers on the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanai\u2019s exit marks the third major departure from the show in recent years following Rick and Carl (Chandler Riggs), which has drastically changed the material the show pulls from Robert Kirkman\u2019s comics.\n\n\u2018Those are three hugely important characters in the comic book that made it basically to the end,\u2019 Denise said. \u2018So to have those iconic characters not here, it definitely changes how the writers approach the story, and looking at what stories we can tell from the comics [that] we can adapt to a different character; how we can evolve a story from the comic book to make sense without those very important characters here.\n\nMichonne, Judith and Rick in The Walking Dead (Picture: AMC)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard of course, I miss all of them. It\u2019s weird not to think of them being here all the time. But it also is kind of exciting because it opens up possibilities for the storytelling and I think anytime we can adjust the comic story and evolve it and change it, it\u2019s exciting as a fan.\n\n\u2018The comics always exist as the comics, that story never changes. It\u2019s always there to go back and be reread and be enjoyed, so it gives us freedom and flexibility with the show to surprise audiences and maybe do a different character in a different way because we can tell a story from the comic in somebody else\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s always really cool to do.\u2019\n\nAvi Nash, who plays Siddiq, also recently spoke to Metro.co.uk about what to expect from Michonne\u2019s exit and the upcoming tenth season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 kicks off on Sunday 6 October in the US, and returns in the UK on Fox Monday 7 October.\n\nMORE: Inside Norman Reedus and Jeffrey Dean Morgan\u2019s heartwarming bromance ahead of The Walking Dead season 10 premiere\n\nMORE: The Walking Dead producer is \u2018very hopeful\u2019 that Lauren Cohan will return as Maggie", "description": "Danai Gurira is set to leave The Walking Dead in season 10, but could she return for the Rick Grimes movies?", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lvQwfgFR-e3cc_1570288483.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
