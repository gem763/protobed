Both have its pros, that's for sure.\n\nThe allure of a small town, sitting pretty in the middle of the West Coast or Midlands, or perhaps even close to Golden Gate, is undeniable. The drive is a bit more time-consuming, but if you choose the right people to join your road trip, it could fly by in a jiffy.\n\nSmall towns have lots of character, a more compact selection of restaurants, maybe an artisan market or cheese shop here and there and are usually defined by its proximity to nature. It's reserved for those who choose quiet, one-horse instead of busy city streets - even if it is just for the weekend.\n\nWATCH: Have a farm-fresh experience just 2 hours outside of Durban\n\nBut we also love cities.
