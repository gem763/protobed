Photo: Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg is not your average presidential candidate. Currently 37, if nominated, he would become the second youngest major-party candidate in U.S. history (William Jennings Bryan was 36 in 1896); if elected he\u2019d be the youngest president by a wide margin. Despite his youth, he\u2019s that increasingly rare commodity: a military veteran. He\u2019s the first openly gay major-party presidential candidate. He has an unconventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as the mayor of a relatively small city (South Bend, Indiana, population: 102,245). He harkens back to an abandoned tradition of multilingual aspirants to the presidency, as his campaign confirms his working knowledge of eight languages (English, Norwegian, Spanish, French, Italian, Maltese, Arabic, and Dari). That would put him in the same company as Thomas Jefferson, who was fluent in English, French, Greek, Italian, Latin, and Spanish, and knew some Dutch and Arabic (!) as well.\n\nBut Buttigieg stands out in an even less conventional way: He\u2019s an observantly religious (Episcopalian) Democratic millennial, part of a party and a generation increasingly characterized by nonsectarian belief or unbelief, and prone to thinking of religious expression in a political contest as something those intolerant, Bible-thumping conservative Republicans do. That makes him an unusually effective scourge for politicized conservative Evangelicals who can\u2019t begin to grasp the phenomenon of a married gay Christian who may go to church more often than they do. But if he\u2019s not careful, he could alienate both irreligious voters and those whose view of the intersection of faith and politics don\u2019t match his own. It\u2019s inherently a balancing act.\n\nMayor Pete shows his understanding of this problem in answering a very basic question from Religious News Service\u2019s Jack Jenkins about \u201cthe appropriate role of religion in American politics\u201d:\n\nYou should be able to offer (messages) that anyone \u2014 of all religions or of no religion \u2014 should find meaningful. Sometimes we\u2019ve been afraid to use this language because we think it means not honoring the separation of church and state. For me, it means we need to honor the separation and also speak to those who are guided (by faith.)\n\nThis is a very carefully wrought answer that avoids the sort of shrugging my religion is an accident of birth language that was common in a bygone era when everyone was nominally religious, and the off-putting militancy of those who would build a Christian Left to fight the Christian Right for control of the Bible and the cross. Asked if he thought conservative Christians were \u201csinful\u201d for their love of Donald Trump, Buttigieg stuck to criticizing the hypocrisy involved in that unnatural attachment:\n\nI\u2019ll be careful to use that word to kind of point out a speck in my brother\u2019s eye. What I would say is that it\u2019s clear that some naked sins are being at best condoned by people who then summon religious arguments. That rings more and more hollow. It\u2019s not just that we might have a different interpretation of faith, it\u2019s that these arguments no longer stack up even on their own merits, right?\n\nFor example: Mike Pence\u2019s view of Christian sexuality is obviously a little different than mine. But even with his view, it makes no sense to condone this president and his behavior. So there\u2019s two layers to this. There\u2019s the fact that I subscribe to a vision of faith that leads me to a certain place politically. But it\u2019s also just seeing the hypocrisy among people who now endorse people and practices that are offensive, not only to my values, but to their own.\n\nThe fine line Mayor Pete has to walk is one that isn\u2019t necessarily very politically convenient. Asked about his silent attendance of a recent protest near the White House held by the Poor People\u2019s Campaign (much of whose leadership, notably Rev. William Barber II, is very definitely faith-based), Buttigieg is particularly circumspect:\n\nWhat I saw was a moral call coming from people of many very different faith traditions, all concerned about how policies of this White House were harming those most in need of our support. And, to me, there\u2019s a direct line between that moral call and what is in the Christian faith. But the people who were there were not all Christian. Nobody was there as a Democrat or a Republican, which is one of the reasons why I understood that my role was simply to be there and witness.\n\nYou have to acknowledge that Pete Buttigieg\u2019s single biggest political problem as a presidential candidate is his lack of demonstrated appeal to minority voters, and especially African-American ones. Tensions back home in South Bend over police misconduct toward black citizens have made this problem even more acute. Being conspicuously identified with someone like Barber (often considered the heir to Martin Luther King\u2019s legacy of church-based social protest) would be worth its weight in gold to a white wine-track candidate like Mayor Pete. But Buttigieg takes his own religion seriously enough to avoid opportunistic use of it even when he really needs it. That won\u2019t help him become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. But perhaps he is storing up treasure in heaven.", "description": "Mayor Pete Buttigieg, as an openly gay and married, religiously observant millennial is an unusual presidential candidate who is in a good position to challenge conservative Christian hypocrisy, but must avoid hypocrisy himself.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/30/30-pete-buttigieg.w1200.h630.jpg"}
