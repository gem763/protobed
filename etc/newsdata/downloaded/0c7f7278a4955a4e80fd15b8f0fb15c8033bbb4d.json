He's so in control of everything in his life and he's a very aspirational man, he's got everything in place.\n\n\"The minute something slips off kilter, that's what gets him. He panics. There's a very insecure side to Gray and it's a fear of losing the things he needs around him.\"\n\n*EastEnders airs Mondays and Fridays at 8pm and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: EastEnders actor Toby-Alexander Smith opened up to Mirror TV about the dark times ahead for Chantelle and Gray", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Bbc", "Kieron Mccarron", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539435.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_18585566-high-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
