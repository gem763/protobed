Bush, the left lost its mind", "language": "en", "text": "Ellen DeGeneres sat next to former President George W. Bush Sunday at the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers game in Dallas. A photo was taken by DeGeneres of the two and it went viral. The Twitter mob came for her.\n\nThe very people who virtue shame anyone within earshot about civility to justify hatred toward President Trump are the first to jump ugly when their delicate sensibilities are offended. Nothing threatens ideologues more than a friendship between a liberal and a conservative. In the real world, though, it is the norm, not the exception. Any person going through life with only those who agree with him or her politically is traveling in a rare circle.\n\nI remember seeing the photo on Twitter Sunday and shrugging. Frankly, it\u2019s pretty normal behavior for George W. Bush. The dirty little secret in politics is that conservatives bend more and quicker than liberals do when it comes to everyday life. In culture, this is especially true. Just sitting there and watching that game meant that Bush was turning a blind eye to the current social justice warrior behavior of professional NFL players. It\u2019s his choice to make but it must have given him pause at some point when the kneeling on the sidelines began.\n\nEllen\u2019s Twitter feed is a mess. A quick glance shows why she felt the need to address the reaction from the outrage mob. She posted a tweet with a video from her pre-recorded Tuesday show.\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\nEllen explains that she and her wife were invited to be guests of owner Jerry Jones by his daughter, Charlotte. They were in his \u201cfancy\u201d owners suite, along with George and Laura Bush. Ellen did what anyone would do if sitting next to a former president at a public event \u2013 she took video footage of the two of them. It went downhill from there, even from the entertainment industry.\n\n\"I'm friends with George Bush,\" boasts Ellen, saying it's good to have friends with different views But this isn't a matter of views; it's a matter of *crimes*. Bush is a war criminal with the blood of 1 million Iraqis on his hands. He should be in prisonhttps://t.co/IJvbvuhQQ0 \u2014 Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 8, 2019\n\nAh, yes. The party of tolerance is still calling Bush a war criminal. He shouldn\u2019t be attending a football game, he should be locked up in jail. Got it. Hey, he \u201ccreated ICE\u201d, too. He must be shunned for protecting our borders and wanting to know who is in our country.\n\nHe\u2019s responsible for creating ICE and its detention centers \u2014 lil grandma (@psych_gma) October 8, 2019\n\nThis \u201cVoice of Social Justice\u201d spoke up, too:\n\nIt appears many of you may be genuinely unaware that insiders said NOBODY worked harder to get Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court than George W. Bush. He fought for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. And the Iraq War, which was based on a lie, killed millions. \u2014 Shaun King (@shaunking) October 8, 2019\n\nThere are good responses, too. Mostly, this is Ellen DeGeneres being Ellen DeGeneres. She once was as strong a critic of Bush as the rest of the Hollywood elite. Then she got really successful and really wealthy and now she\u2019s friends with ex-presidents and other public figures so it\u2019s all kumbaya now.\n\nShe knew what she was doing. See how tolerant I am? She still zings Republicans but just the ones she doesn\u2019t know in real life. If a conservative is a friend, she\u2019s just being tolerant. DeGeneres now wants you to know she can be friends with conservatives, at least the wealthy and well-known ones. She\u2019s into a different kind of virtue-shaming now.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d DeGeneres continued. \u201cWe\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different\u2026 but just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them.\u201d \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nWhat she is doing, though, is simply being an adult. Grown-ass people know that in order to live in civil society, interactions will happen and we are expected to be mature enough to handle it. It is silly to pat yourself on the back for acting like an adult, which she is doing if we are being honest here. A true test of how magnanimous she is would be to be sitting next to someone from Trump World. During the two terms of George W. Bush, she was as vocal as anyone else against him.\n\nThis week the Supreme Court is taking up a case of particular interest of the LGBTQ community. The timing of DeGeneres\u2019s interaction with Bush was noted ironically. The left is nothing if not predictable.\n\nThe \u201cbe kind\u201d mantra is the politically correct way of saying \u201cbe a decent human being\u201d. The left needs that lesson as much as any of those they criticize. To call this gesture a moment of restoring faith in humankind is hyperbole, to put it kindly.", "description": "Be kind.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b4fe37f2-65db-40ce-b064-7affa8f1769d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
