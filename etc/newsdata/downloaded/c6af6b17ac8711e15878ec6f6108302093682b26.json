The arrest came in two separate incidents and involved Mexican nationals with convictions for child rape in California and Child Abuse with Serious Physical Injury in North Carolina.\n\nAgents assigned to the El Cajon Border Patrol Station witnessed a group of three migrants illegally crossing the border from Mexico on September 27. The agents intercepted and placed them under arrest for immigration violations. The agents then transported the migrants to the Border Patrol station for processing and a biometric background investigation, according to information obtained from San Diego Sector Border Patrol officials.\n\nDuring the investigation, agents identified one of the men as a 39-year-old Mexican national. The Mexican migrant\u2019s records include a previous deportation by immigration officers following a conviction by a California court in 2006 for \u201csexual intercourse with a minor,\u201d officials reported.\n\nThe following evening, El Cajon Station agents observed another small group of migrants attempting to sneak into the U.S. from Mexico. As agents moved into the area, the migrants fell to the ground in an apparent attempt to avoid detection and apprehension, officials stated. The agents and a K-9 found the group of four men and placed them under arrest.\n\nAfter transporting them to the El Cajon Station, the agents conducted a biometric background investigation on the four migrants. Agents identified one of the men as a 29-year-old previously deported Mexican national. The agents carried out a records check and learned the Mexican migrant has a 2010 conviction from a North Carolina court for Chile Abuse with Serious Bodily Injury, officials stated in response to an inquiry from Breitbart Texas. Immigration officers also deported this migrant following his incarceration in North Carolina.\n\nAll of the migrants are being processed for immigration violations after illegally crossing the border. The two deported felons also face new federal felony charges for aggravated re-entry after removal as a convicted felon. If convicted, the two Mexican migrants could each face up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nBreitbart News reports extensively on previously deported sex offenders and other criminal aliens who are stopped by Border Patrol agents from successfully re-entering the United States.", "description": "Border Patrol agents arrested two previously deported felons after they illegally crossed the border into the sanctuary state of California.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/GettyImages-57124901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
