PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The inmate who claims to have killed more than 90 women across the country is now considered to be the deadliest serial killer in U.S. history, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.\n\nSamuel Little, who has been behind bars since 2012, told investigators last year that he was responsible for about 90 killings nationwide between 1970 and 2005. In a news release on Sunday, the FBI announced that federal crime analysts believe all of his confessions are credible, and officials have been able to verify 50 confessions so far.\n\nInvestigators also provided new information and details about five cases in Florida, Arkansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Louisiana.\n\nThe 79-year-old Little is serving multiple life sentences in California. He says he strangled his 93 victims, nearly all of them women.\n\nSome of his victims were on the margins of society. Many were originally deemed overdoses, or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found.\n\nThe FBI provided 30 drawings of some of his victims \u2014 color portraits that were drawn by Little himself in prison. They are haunting portraits, mostly of black women.\n\nThe agency also provided videos taken during prison interviews with Little. He described how he spoke about a woman he strangled in 1993 \u2014 and how he rolled her down a slope on a desolate road.\n\n\u201cI heard a secondary road noise and that meant she was still rolling,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another video, he described a victim in New Orleans. \u201cShe was pretty. Light colored, honey brown skin,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cShe was tall for a woman. Beautiful shape. And, uh, friendly.\u201d\n\nIt was 1982, and they met in a club. She left with him in his Lincoln, and they parked by a bayou.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only one that I ever killed by drowning,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestigators around the country are still trying to piece together his confessions with unidentified remains and unsolved cases from decades past. In August , he pleaded guilty to murdering four women in Ohio. He was convicted in California of three slayings in 2013 and pleaded guilty to another killing last year in Texas.\n\nLittle, who often went by the name Samuel McDowell, grew up with his grandmother in Lorain, Ohio. He was described by investigators as a transient and former boxer who traveled the country preying on drug addicts, troubled women and others.\n\nAuthorities in Knox County, Tennessee, said Monday that a woman named Martha Cunningham was likely a victim of Little\u2018s.\n\nThe Knoxville News Sentinel reported in December that a cold case investigator with the Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Office had identified the victim who Little called \u201cMartha.\u201d The Knoxville mother\u2019s body was found in a wooded area in eastern Knox County in 1975.\n\nCunningham\u2019s body was found by a pair of hunters on the afternoon of Jan. 18, 1975. She was bruised and nude from the waist down; her pantyhose and girdle bunched around her knees. Her purse and some of her jewelry were missing. Her body appeared to have been dragged into the woods and dumped behind a pine tree, authorities said at the time.\n\nDespite that evidence, detectives at the time attributed Cunningham\u2019s death to natural causes within a day of the discovery. The medical examiner\u2019s investigative report lists the probable cause of death as \u201cunknown.\u201d\n\nCunningham was a talented singer and pianist who grew up performing with her parents and her six younger siblings in a gospel group known as the Happy Home Jubilee Singers.\n\nLaw enforcement in Tennessee had Little in custody 19 years after Cunningham\u2019s body was found.\n\nLittle was convicted of misdemeanor larceny in 1994 in Nashville, Tennessee, and he was sentenced to 90 days in jail, according to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation criminal records obtained Monday by The Associated Press.\n\nTed Bundy confessed to 30 homicides from about 1974 to 1978. John Wayne Gacy killed at least 33 boys and young men in the 1970s.\n\nArguably one of the deadliest globally was an English general practitioner named Harold Shipman, who an investigative panel determined was responsible for the deaths of 250. He was convicted in 2000 in the deaths of 15.\n\n____\n\nSainz reported from Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The inmate who claims to have killed more than 90 women across the country is now considered to be the deadliest serial killer in U.S. history, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tamara Lush", "Adrian Sainz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/serial_killer_investigations_82676_c0-155-3032-1922_s1770x1032.jpg?6ed7573fbe5be878e33e39fb042a098825cdf2a3", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
