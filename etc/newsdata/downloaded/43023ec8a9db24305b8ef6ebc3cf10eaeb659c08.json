Further, the amount of stimulus is likely to be small and in the low tenths of percentage points of GDP, while the effects on growth (not levels) are likely to prove transitory.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know this morning:\n\nNotable Earnings: Shopify Inc, Air Canada, Pan Andean Minerals Ltd, McEwen Mining Inc, FortisBC Inc, Canada Coal Inc., Yield Growth Corp/The Spey Resources Corp, Shopify Inc, Air Canada, PrairieSky Royalty Ltd\n\nAlberta is forecasting a 30-per-cent jump in non-renewable resource revenues in order to move from an $8.7 billion deficit this year to a surplus in four years, writes Geoffrey Morgan. The province expects to pull in an extra $1.4 billion in revenues from the oilsands and an increase of $615 million in other resource revenues between now and 2022-2023 \u2014 accounting for the expected $1.8-billion budget surplus that year.\n\nAlberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said the expectations of higher non-renewable resource revenues were based on a cautious outlook for oil and gas prices and new pipelines. \u201cThis is not a boom-time scenario. This is a very cautious revenue projection,\u201d he said.\n\nIf no new pipelines are built, the province expects its revenues will drop by $3 billion, an amount that demonstrates how the fate of the province\u2019s finances are tied to the success of TC Energy Corp.\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline to the U.S. Gulf Coast, Trans Mountain Corp.\u2019s pipeline expansion project to the West Coast and Enbridge Inc.\u2019s Line 3 replacement to the U.S. Midwest.\n\n\u2014 Please send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014 Yadullah Hussain @yad_Fpenergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/shopify.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
