Maybe her presidential campaign really is an audition for a Fox News show.\n\nI kid. And when I say it sounds like she\u2019s opposed to impeachment here, I use that term advisedly. The process will be \u201cterribly divisive,\u201d she says, which is true \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t flatly commit to voting no. It would be in both her short-term and long-term interest as a Democrat to support impeachment, however reluctantly. \u201cLong-term\u201d in the sense that Gabbard is young, making a national name for herself, and might conceivably be a formidable presidential contender down the road \u2014 unless she alienates her party\u2019s base forever by siding with Trump in the war to come.\n\n\u201cShort-term\u201d in the sense that there\u2019s news today about the 2020 campaign. Because she notched two percent in the latest Monmouth poll of New Hampshire, Gabbard has qualified for the next Democratic debate.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the debate will take place over two nights, but Ms. Gabbard\u2019s inclusion adds to that possibility. The June and July debates featured 20 candidates evenly split over two-night events; after the D.N.C. tightened its qualification requirements for the fall, the debate this month was held with 10 candidates on a single evening\u2026 The Monmouth poll released Tuesday showed Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden atop the Democratic field in New Hampshire: Ms. Warren had 27 support, and Mr. Biden had 25 percent. Mr. Sanders finished third with 12 percent, followed by Mr. Buttigieg with 10 percent. Ms. Harris finished fifth with 3 percent support.\n\nCongrats to her on making the cut but she\u2019ll be in an excruciating position if she\u2019s onstage in mid-October as the lone Democratic candidate standing who opposes impeachment at a moment when her party is in a frenzy to do it. The moderators are sure to press her about it too; even if they don\u2019t, her pal Kamala Harris will bring it up to exact revenge for Gabbard\u2019s withering attack on Harris\u2019s record as AG at the second debate. What will Gabbard say in response? You can imagine how the criticism of her will be framed: \u201cThe reason impeachment is \u2018terribly divisive\u2019 is because Donald Trump, not our party, has consistently placed his own interests over the interests of the country. What do you propose to do to stop him from leaning on foreign leaders to investigate his political opponents over the next 16 months short of joining us in trying to remove him?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Harris and Gabbard, here\u2019s the rest of that Monmouth poll that secured Gabbard\u2019s place in next month\u2019s debate. Hoo boy:\n\nRemember after the second debate when Harris sneered that she was \u201ctop tier\u201d and therefore didn\u2019t need to worry about attacks from a no-chancer like Gabbard? They\u2019re now separated by a point in national polling in a key early state.\n\nI\u2019m done parsing Gabbard\u2019s political pronouncements for strategic angles, by the way. I don\u2019t think she has a strategy; I think she\u2019s just speaking her mind and letting the chips fall where they may. That\u2019ll be good for her future as a political pundit, not so good for her future as a Democratic politician.", "description": "Skepticism.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tg-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
