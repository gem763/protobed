Just consider this letter to the editor published in a newspaper:\n\n\"To open the immigration floodgates in American now would only weaken us by drastically altering our national, racial, and cultural composition\u2026\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not today\u2019s paper. It\u2019s from The Indianapolis Star in 1965, just before President Lyndon Johnson signed a major reform to the nation\u2019s immigration law, which had favored northern and western Europeans over those from elsewhere. Johnson said the new law repaired \u201ca very deep and painful flaw in the fabric of American justice.\u201d\n\nWhat a difference 54 years makes \u2013 or not. Inflammatory and divisive rhetoric coming from many quarters in recent years, including President Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE, have exacerbated our divide as a nation.\n\nSo on Nov. 12, when the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments on the DACA case, we\u2019ll hear the parsing of federal statutes \u2013 more than 400 pages of briefs filed so far. But inside and outside the court, we\u2019ll also hear the sound of a nation exploring its own identity.\n\nDACA seems simple enough: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was established under President Obama in 2012. People brought into the country as children and found to pose no security threat were granted temporary, but renewable, permission to stay. They\u2019re often called \u201cDreamers\u201d because of their belief in the American dream.\n\n\u201cBrought to this country as young children, Plaintiffs have spent virtually their entire lives in the United States,\u201d says a brief filed on their behalf. \u201cThey consider themselves to be Americans and call our nation home.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration announced an end to the program two years ago, saying Obama exceeded his authority, but supporters of the Dreamers won lower court decisions to keep DACA in place.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is expected by next June, and nearly 800,000 dreamers can only wait in the meantime. On their side are a host of states, universities and more than 140 of the country\u2019s largest businesses, including Google, Amazon, IBM and Starbucks, say that ending the program will hurt the economy.\n\nThese companies are right. Our nation has a growing need for talent; millions of jobs are unfilled because qualified applicants aren\u2019t available. And even as we grow our national pool of talent through post-high school education and training, we also need to attract more from other countries. More effective, equitable education strategies and smart immigration policies go together.\n\nBut our approach to immigration remains stuck in a muddled past. We\u2019re too focused on mythical threats to border security, and we admit too few newcomers who can contribute to our society economically, culturally and socially.\n\nWe need to think about attracting talent across every level of ability. Many of our best entrepreneurs are immigrants, for example, but lack a college education when they get here. They often get that education when they arrive, adding to the talent base, so we have to be creative when we think about the limits we place on newcomers.\n\nWe\u2019ll miss big opportunities if the national discussion centers on building walls and creating barriers, rather than focusing on the value that immigrants bring. Already, we can see that the debate has little to do with the facts. Most of what we hear is about what\u2019s happening at our southern border, but today about 40 percent of new immigrants are from Asia.\n\nWe sometimes hear that these immigrants are taking jobs that Americans want, but the data show that\u2019s not true. They\u2019re actually filling unmet needs \u2013 not only with jobs at the low end, such as basic labor, but in technology and certain medical fields.\n\nThere are important and complex issues around border security, to be sure. And it\u2019s true that national leadership hasn\u2019t produced the changes needed to modernize our immigration system. We\u2019ve seen interesting models elsewhere: Japan is one, because like us that nation has an aging population. Australia and Canada have explored immigration strategies that focus on a broad range of talent. Those countries have thought about attracting the right combination of people for each segment of the labor market, so they can bring those people into the society, and help them prosper and contribute to the well-being of everyone. We should learn from those models and craft a solution that is unique to the American context.\n\nHundreds of pages of legal filings aside, the debate about the Dreamers can be summarized this way: We need them, they\u2019re not to blame, and they\u2019re in trouble. Even if one court case won\u2019t solve this completely, maybe it will be the catalyst, finally, for legislative action.\n\nWe\u2019ve stumbled before as a country, but we largely got immigration right in 1965. At our best, we\u2019ve always been about helping others when we can and when it makes sense. This is one of those times.\n\nJamie Merisotis is a globally recognized leader in philanthropy, education, and public policy.
