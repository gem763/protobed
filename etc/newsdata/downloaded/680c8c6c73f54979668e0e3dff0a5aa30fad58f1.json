For Castro, who is at risk of not qualifying for the Democratic debate stage in November, the stakes are high.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days\u2014I will have no choice but to end my race for President,\u201d Castro said in an email to supporters. \u201cThe truth is, for our campaign, these debates have offered our only guaranteed opportunity to share my vision with the American people. If I can\u2019t make the next debate stage, we cannot sustain a campaign that can make it to Iowa in February.\u201d\n\nFor the last several weeks, Castro has been trying to raise money to buy ads in Iowa, hoping that new publicity will help him hit the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling threshold required to qualify for the November 20 debate. According to his campaign, Castro has met the DNC\u2019s donor threshold for November\u2019s debate but has yet to earn 3 percent or higher in four national polls.\n\nAccording to FEC filings, Castro has $672,000 on hand, a relatively small nut for any candidate hoping to mount a serious presidential bid. In the last fundraising quarter, which ended at the end of September, he raised $3.5 million, putting him significantly behind his competitors. By comparison, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is among top polling Democrats, raised more than $25 million.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Castro\u2019s campaign has told supporters that he will have to drop out of the race. On Sept. 26, his campaign put out a fundraising call suggesting that his campaign would close its doors unless he qualified for the November debate. But in that case, Maya Rupert, Castro\u2019s campaign manager, quickly walked back the rhetoric, calling it \u201cunfortunately hyperbolic writing.\u201d Castro\u2019s national press secretary told TIME in September that there were no plans for Castro to drop out.\n\n\u201cI understand them kind of sounding the alarm, this is an effective tactic,\u201d Colin Strother, a Democratic strategist in Texas, told TIME. But, he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little early to start sounding the alarm just yet.\u201d\n\nCastro, the only Latino candidate in a still-crowded primary field, has so far used his candidacy largely to highlight immigration issues. A progressive pacesetter in the race, he has generally performed well at debates, using the platform as an opportunity to attack higher-tier candidates. His most likely path forward may be as a vice-presidential pick for the eventual nominee.\n\nBut for now, Rupert is still laser-focused on Castro\u2019s presidential run. \u201cUnfortunately, we do not see a path to victory that doesn\u2019t include making the November debate stage,\u201d she said in a statement on Monday, \u201cand without a significant uptick in our fundraising, we cannot make that debate.\u201d", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro's campaign will end unless he can secure enough fundraising by Halloween.", "authors": ["Lissandra Villa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2ukp2tP7TfHAjTaV9E4HHQ--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/d21c2320cfc9203ac3b603542c42aff3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
