Being here I can be for life, but not with a contract. Here I would stay a lifetime.'\n\nMessi had recently spectacularly revealed that he wanted to quit Barca during his \u00a32.95million tax row with the Spanish government - and it was only a lack of offers from elsewhere that kept him at the club.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with RAC1, the Argentine said: 'At that time, with the mess of the treasury, I wanted to leave, not for wanting to leave Barca but wanting to leave Spain.\n\n'I felt that I was being very mistreated and I didn't want to stay here. I never had an official offer because everyone knew my idea to stay here.'", "description": "Lionel Messi has hinted he will not be signing a lucrative lifetime deal with Barcelona, offering hope to any clubs who are aiming to acquire the living legend before he calls time on his playing career.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/23/19905654-0-image-a-8_1571437369176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
