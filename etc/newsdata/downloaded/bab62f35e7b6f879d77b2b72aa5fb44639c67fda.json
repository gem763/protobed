Here are the 12 stocks he says investors should buy to weather the storm.", "language": "en", "text": "The threat of a market bubble bursting is alarming, but it also creates opportunities in other areas.\n\nJulian Emanuel, the chief equity and derivatives strategist for BTIG, is on record saying the bond market has become not just overinflated but also potentially \"the greatest bubble ever.\" That's driven prices to historic highs and bond yields to all-time lows.\n\nIt's hard to predict what will make a bubble burst, but Emanuel wrote that a turn in investors' mindset was required. And an important one may have arrived.\n\n\"Investors' 'obsession with recession' appears to have topped as the Fed's rates cuts support inflation expectations,\" he wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nThat means a slide in prices and a rise in yields, Emanuel said, with widespread implications for stocks. That trend might already be playing out.\n\n\"We expect further broad market upside to be led by the narrowing of the current valuation divergence - rotation - between cyclicals (Financials and Energy) and defensives/bond proxies (Utilities, Consumer Staples, Software),\" he wrote, saying that the first group should outperform and the second would likely underperform.\n\nTo find the stocks most likely to climb, Emanuel screened the already struggling financial and energy sectors. He looked for stocks that did worse than their respective sectors in the market's downturn from July 26 to September 4 and which have appealing valuations based on their estimated price to earnings and price to earnings growth multiples.\n\n\"This list ... could be expected to outperform if bond yields rise,\" he wrote.\n\nHere are 12 stocks Emanuel says fit the bill:", "description": "The BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel is focused on cyclical stocks, particularly those in the energy and financial sectors.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a5f6cddf421493e028b548d-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
