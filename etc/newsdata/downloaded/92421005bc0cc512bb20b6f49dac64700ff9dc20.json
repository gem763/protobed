It begins with one fateful day in 1989 when 43 babies are born to random, unconnected women who showed no signs of pregnancy before giving birth. Seven of these mysterious bubs are adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves, a billionaire responsible for creating The Umbrella Academy. Each member, save for one, has a super human ability like real mega strength and time travel.\n\nEllen Page leads the cast as Vanya Hargreeves (The White Violin), Tom Hopper as big unit Luther Hargreeves (Spaceboy), David Casta\u00f1eda as Diego Hargreeves (The Kraken), Emmy Raver-Lampman as Allison Hargreeves (The Rumor), Robert Sheehan as sweet angel Klaus Hargreeves (The S\u00e9ance), Aidan Gallagher as Number Five (The Boy), and Justin H. Min as Ben Hargreeves (Number Six).\n\nProduction on season 2 officially kicked off in June and since then we\u2019ve copped a couple of cheeky pictures, but nothing too concrete. Until now.\n\nATTENTION CHILDREN! We heard a rumor that some new friends are joining us this season. Let us welcome them. \u2014 Umbrella Academy (@UmbrellaAcad) September 10, 2019\n\nFirst up is Ritu Arya (AMC\u2019s Humans) as Lila. The academy describes her as \u201ca chameleon who can be as brilliant or as clinically insane as the situation requires.\u201d She\u2019s unpredictable, mischievous, sarcastic, and has a twisted sense of humour so heaps to look forward to there.\n\nYusuf Gatewood (The Originals, Good Omens) will star as Raymond, a \u201cborn leader and devoted husband.\u201d He has the smarts, gravitas, and confidence to never have to prove it to anyone. And he has the innate ability to disarm you with a look.\n\nAnd Marin Ireland is Sissy. She\u2019s described as a fearless, no-nonsense Texas mum who \u201cmarried young for all the wrong reasons.\u201d But she\u2019s keen as hell to rediscover what life and love has to offer.\n\nShowrunner Steve Blackman will return for season 2 which will have 10 episodes all up. We\u2019ll keep you posted on a release date.\n\nAs with every Umbrella Academy yarn I write I shall finish it with a CHOON.", "description": "Netflix's specularly weird series\u00a0The Umbrella\u00a0Academy\u00a0just recruited three new actors to star in its upcoming second season.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/MV5BYmQ5MWM2MWMtYTIyZC00YzEzLTgyYTktOWJiZmY5MTI0YWYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
