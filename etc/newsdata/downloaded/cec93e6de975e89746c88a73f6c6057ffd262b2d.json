No Apology Needed.", "language": "en", "text": "The Dallas Cowboys handily beat the New York Giants last Sunday, winning 35-17. Defensive end Demarcus Lawrence had a solid game\u2014two tackles, a half-sack, and a forced fumble\u2014but it was his verbal roasting of a young Giants fan in the parking lot that got the most attention.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLoading Video Content\n\nWatch more Fatherly Subscribe\n\nRelated Content\n\nA video posted to Twitter shows a young fan decked out in a blue Giants hat and a Saquon Barkley jersey, an NY logo painted on his face for good measure. He\u2019s standing outside MetLife Stadium after the game when Lawrence walks by.\n\nA hand, presumably belonging to the kid\u2019s parent, pushes him into the path of the NFL player, and the kid starts repeating \u201cDeMarcus\u201d while holding out a towel and a Sharpie: the international language for \u201ccan I have your autograph?\u201d Lawrence doesn\u2019t make eye contact and keeps walking.\n\nThat would probably have been it if Lawrence didn\u2019t yell \u201cGet the right jersey, son!\u201d on his way to the van he was taking from the stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video, which was viewed more than 1.6 million times, inspired strong reactions\u2014or at least the performance of strong reactions for the take-driven sports economy\u2014from both talking heads and fans on Twitter who think that it\u2019s Lawrence\u2019s job to sign every autograph for every fan (it\u2019s not) or that he\u2019s not allowed to have a little fun when asked (he is).\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a joke, and ribbing a rival fan seems like a good and fun thing for a professional athlete to do, particularly when the rivalry is as longstanding as that between the Giants and Cowboys.\n\nLawrence didn\u2019t say anything vulgar or crude to the kid, and not getting an autograph isn\u2019t exactly a traumatic experience. He rightly defended his actions on Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy how you fans want to attack me for not signing for a kid. It\u2019s more than one kid that come to the game with Cowboys jerseys and never get to meet any player. So if I\u2019m honest with my own kids I will never treat your kid better than mine so suck it up. #SorryNotSorry https://t.co/FwI7SI8rYS \u2014 DeMarcus Lawrence (@TankLawrence) September 10, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSports are objectively more fun when rivalries are strong and players aren\u2019t just cliche-spewing automatons. One of the better things about cell phones and social media is that we get spontaneous moments like this that would go unnoticed by traditional media.\n\nBut because those same forces can also expose athletes to an onslaught of criticism and hate, Lawrence ended up on the receiving end of the only real abuse in this incident.\n\nIt was enough to get him to change his tune, telling the Dallas Morning News, ironically at a pre-planned event with kids from the Boys and Girls Club of Collin County, that being seen as the villain hurt.\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t me. If I need to be me 24/7 to have my persona on the field and off the field, trust me, I would love to take it all back. I can\u2019t have my persona on the field and off the field. \u2026 Sometimes, I can\u2019t click it off fast enough. I ain\u2019t even get one hit on Saquon Barkley in the game, so seeing that jersey, I kinda wanted to give him a little tackle.\u201d\n\nThis kid likely heard plenty of cursing and encountered at least one drunk person at the game, which as a reminder features men performing violence on each other for entertainment. It\u2019s entirely possible Lawrence\u2019s crack was the most wholesome thing he heard all day, and it\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s what ended up being discouraged.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe post DeMarcus Lawerence Was Right to Snub That Kid.
