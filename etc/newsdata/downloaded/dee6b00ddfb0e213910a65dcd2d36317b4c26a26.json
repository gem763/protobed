For a brief moment Weinstein was relieved,' writes Farrow.\n\nThe book then covers information that had previously been reported about Weinstein telling his staff that it was better for the story to run on a Thursday rather than a Sunday.\n\nWeinstein then left to attend his wife Georgina Chapman's fashion show for her line Marchesa according to Farrow.\n\nWhen he returned to The Weinstein Company office in Tribeca he told several staffers that the story had not killed his relationship, saying: 'She said, \"I'll stick with you.\"'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAnd he's off: Harvey Weinstein went to wife Georgina Chapman's fashion show for her Marchesa bridal line after the New York Times expose went online (Weinstein leaving his office five minutes after the Times story went live)\n\nFalse hope: When he returned to his office after the presentation he told several people that Chapman told him, 'I'll stick with you' (Harvey on left and Georgina on right the day after the Times expose)\n\nIt was not all good news for Weinstein however upon returning to his office that day.\n\nFarrow writes that he made an attempt to rally his staff declaring: 'Roll up your sleeves! We're going to war.'\n\nThat proved to be too much for one assistant, who responded by telling Weinstein she was 'done.'\n\nThat individual recounted the interaction for Farrow, saying: 'I looked at him like are you f***ing kidding me.'\n\nFarrow also makes a point of mentioning that the Times expose did not contain any allegations of rape or sexual assault, and that two of the women who were named in the piece did not cooperate with their story.\n\nThose two women did speak with Farrow, but he makes no mention as to whether or not there was an exclusive agreement between him and he women.\n\nTwo weeks notice: Chapman announced she would be divorcing Weinstein soon after\n\nThat is followed up with two texts Farrow says he received on that day.\n\nThe first, from his boyfriend Jon Lovett, again points out that the Times piece did not detail any allegations of assault.\n\nFarrow then shares a text he received from his former NBC co-worker Rich McHugh saying that the Times report had 'less than what they were stopped for' when they tried to release the story at the network.\n\nThe chapter then closes out with yet another belittling quote, this time from a staff member at the New Yorker.\n\nWhen the magazine's editor Dave Remnick says that the Times report is 'very strong work,' editor Deirdre Foley Mendelssohn replies: 'But they don't have anywhere near what we have.'\n\nThe book does not share any details however on the experiences of the women who had shared their stories with the New Yorker and the Times at the moment those stories were published.\n\nAlso omitted is the fact that Weinsetin's glee over a Thursday release was short lived, as the Times had a second piece already set to run on the same day farrow released his first story for the New Yorker.\n\nChapman meanwhile announced she would be divorcing Weinstein within two weeks of that first story going online.\n\nCatch and Kill is on bookshelves today.", "description": "In his new book Catch and Kill, Ronan Farrow writes that Harvey Weinstein was in his office with attorney Lisa Bloom, American Media editor Dylan Howard and staffers when the article went online", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/18/19753362-0-image-a-21_1571162311539.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
