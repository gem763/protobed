But acting eventually grounded her among less celestial stars.\n\nSo the role of Lucy Cola, whose encounter with the vastness of the universe during a space-station mission triggers an existential crisis back on Earth in Noah Hawley\u2019s Lucy in the Sky, was \u201ca little bit of wish fulfilment\u201d, Portman admits. And it wasn\u2019t merely the prospect of climbing into a spacesuit.\n\n\u201cJust to see a woman in complete humanity, with flaws, with strengths, is so lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cSo often, a woman is adorable, or a badass, or a villain. You could sum her up in one word.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a simple feeling about Lucy at the end,\u201d she adds.\n\nLucy in the Sky is loosely based on the tabloid-ready tale of Lisa Nowak, the astronaut who in 2007 drove from Houston to Orlando to attack her former lover\u2019s new girlfriend \u2013 reportedly wearing a diaper to save time on her journey.\n\nAlas, there\u2019s no diaper in Lucy in the Sky, an omission that has whipped expectant audiences into a froth. \u201cThis is fictional, other than the sort of jumping-off point,\u201d Portma\u200bn says.\n\nAn Oscar winner for Black Swan and an outspoken Time\u2019s Up advocate, Portman will soon be embracing another \u201ctype-A\u201d woman: in July at San Diego Comic-Con, she lifted the hammer high as it was revealed that her Marvel character, Jane Foster, would be anointed female Thor in Thor: Love and Thunder, due in 2021.\n\nTalking from Los Angeles, where she lives with her husband, the choreographer and filmmaker Benjamin Millepied, and their two young children, Portman, 38, speaks about navigating a traditionally male world, both onscreen and off.\n\nThese are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the mystery of the diaper. Why isn\u2019t there one, and what\u2019s with our fixation?\n\nWell, I think that it was the salacious element of the real story. For us, that wasn\u2019t what it was about. We were trying to get into the heart of humans and not make it salacious. It seems to be a symptom of clickbait culture that getting my name and diaper in the same sentence is probably helpful for journalists.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

It's not as glamorous as it sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don't. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, 'What is it?' And they said, 'You look like you've been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.\u201d 2/30 Various cast \u2013 Jaws 2 During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea.

The crew didn\u2019t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point. 3/30 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren \u2013 Rocky IV The fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It\u2019s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week. MGM/UA/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 4/30 Marlon Brando \u2013 The Godfather Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s mafia film. It didn\u2019t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000. Rex Features 5/30 Gucci Mane \u2013 Spring Breakers In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine\u2019s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco\u2019s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.\u201d In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. \u201cI had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o'clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o'clock.\u201d Getty Images 6/30 Tom Cruise \u2013 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: \u201cI knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn\u2019t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, \u2018It\u2019s broken. That\u2019s a wrap. Take me to hospital\u2019 and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.\u201d PA 7/30 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen \u2013 Masters of Sex Caplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. \u201cAnd we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell \u201cCut\u201d and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.\u201c Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn't know that. She said: \u201dMy whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I'm a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that\u2019s just the way it's going to be.\u201d Showtime 8/30 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley \u2013 The Vampire Diaries Nina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley's finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries. Dobrev, who plays Elena Gilbert, falls in love with the good-natured vampire Stefan Salvatore (Wesley) in the supernatural teen drama TV series. But they certainly weren\u2019t expecting any injuries at work that day. In an interview, Wesley said: \u201cBeing the not-suave guy that I am, my thumb got bent back in a romantic scene where I slowly lowered Nina onto a bed. I was out of commission for a week.\u201d Rex Features 9/30 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of Grey Obviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a \u201cwee bag\u201d to protect his modesty, said: \u201cI got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.\u201d 10/30 Michael Imperioli \u2013 Goodfellas Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds. Getty 11/30 Bill Murray \u2013 Groundhog Day During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a divorce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: \u201cBill said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I'm going to learn sign language.\u2019 And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That\u2019s anti-communication, you know? Let\u2019s not talk.\u201d Alamy Stock Photo 12/30 Lena Dunham \u2013 Girls It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: \u201cI stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There\u2019s not one guy who works on that show who hasn\u2019t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don\u2019t care.\u201d HBO 13/30 Kurt Russell \u2013 The Hateful Eight In one scene of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell\u2019s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting \u201cMusic time is over\u201d. As a result, the Martin Museum \u2013 which called the guitar a \"priceless, irreplaceable artefact\" \u2013 vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again. Moviestore Collection 14/30 Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore \u2013 Maps to the Stars The Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg\u2019s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore\u2019s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. \u201cI sweat like a f***ing crazy person,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, 'Are you having a panic attack?' It was so embarrassing.\u201d 15/30 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other Drugs Hathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. \u201cI have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!\u201d Getty Images 16/30 Edward James Olmos - Battlestar Galactica In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos\u2019s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000. 17/30 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During Wartime During a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey's co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. \u201cWe had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said \u2018Action\u2019 and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I'll never forget.\u201d Getty Images 18/30 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-Up The Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. \u201cIn the scene, she\u2019s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she\u2019s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Photo credit should read ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images) 19/30 Sean Connery and Lana Turner \u2013 Another Time, Another Place Sean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner\u2019s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend\u2019s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner\u2019s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US \u2013 but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide. Getty Images 20/30 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking Dead The long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered \u2013 but then as they were \u201chumping\u201d, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: \u201cThen we just started laughing, because it's ridiculous. It's two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.\u201d 21/30 Mel Brooks - Blazing Saddles During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn\u2019t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates. Getty 22/30 Christopher Mintz-Plasse - Superbad Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, \u201cIt\u2019s in. Oh, my God, it\u2019s in.\u201d \u201cShe got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,\u201d Mintz-Plasse said. \u201cAfterwards we didn't talk about it; we still don't speak about that moment.\u201d 23/30 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone \u2013 The Specialist Stallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. \u201cOk. Let it be known, I didn\u2019t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won\u2019t take it off. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t take any liberties, so what\u2019s the problem? She said, \u2018I\u2019m just sick of nudity.\u2019 I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else\u2019s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.\u201d 24/30 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 The Legend of Tarzan Apparently Robbie \u2013 who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. \u201cI didn\u2019t injure Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he\u2019s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.\u201d Courtesy Everett Collection/REX/Shutterstock 25/30 Henry Cavill \u2013 The Tudors Cavill says he had to \u201capologise profusely\u201d after he got aroused on set, adding that \u201cIt had only happened to him once\u201d. \u201cA girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn't rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She's basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.\u201d He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great when you\u2019re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?\u201d Getty Images 26/30 Jesse Metcalfe \u2013 Desperate Housewives It\u2019s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria\u2019s Gabrielle Solis. He said: \u201cWe were rehearsing and then the director was like, 'OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set', and I was like, 'I need a minute.'\u201c He added: \u201cIt doesn't happen that frequently\u201d because \u201dthere are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.\" 27/30 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes \u2013 The Princess Bride When you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner\u2019s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was \u201cmessing around\u201d between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant\u2019s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. \u201cI was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes \u2013 you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).\u201d Sony Pictures Entertainment 28/30 John Malkovich \u2013 Being John Malkovich The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting \u201cHey Malkovich, think fast!\u201d Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role. Universal Pictures 29/30 Viggo Mortensen \u2013 The Lord of the Rings When Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet. Rex 30/30 The entire cast of Roar But whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall\u2019s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene. 1/30 Margot Robbie \u2013 The Wolf of Wall Street The actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. \u201cI got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It's not as glamorous as it sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don't. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, 'What is it?'

Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting \u201cMusic time is over\u201d. As a result, the Martin Museum \u2013 which called the guitar a \"priceless, irreplaceable artefact\" \u2013 vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again. Moviestore Collection 14/30 Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore \u2013 Maps to the Stars The Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg\u2019s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore\u2019s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. \u201cI sweat like a f***ing crazy person,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, 'Are you having a panic attack?' It was so embarrassing.\u201d 15/30 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other Drugs Hathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. \u201cI have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!\u201d Getty Images 16/30 Edward James Olmos - Battlestar Galactica In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos\u2019s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000. 17/30 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During Wartime During a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey's co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. \u201cWe had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said \u2018Action\u2019 and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I'll never forget.\u201d Getty Images 18/30 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-Up The Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. \u201cIn the scene, she\u2019s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she\u2019s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Photo credit should read ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images) 19/30 Sean Connery and Lana Turner \u2013 Another Time, Another Place Sean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner\u2019s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend\u2019s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner\u2019s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US \u2013 but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide. Getty Images 20/30 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking Dead The long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered \u2013 but then as they were \u201chumping\u201d, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: \u201cThen we just started laughing, because it's ridiculous. It's two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.\u201d 21/30 Mel Brooks - Blazing Saddles During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn\u2019t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates. Getty 22/30 Christopher Mintz-Plasse - Superbad Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, \u201cIt\u2019s in. Oh, my God, it\u2019s in.\u201d \u201cShe got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,\u201d Mintz-Plasse said. \u201cAfterwards we didn't talk about it; we still don't speak about that moment.\u201d 23/30 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone \u2013 The Specialist Stallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. \u201cOk. Let it be known, I didn\u2019t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won\u2019t take it off. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t take any liberties, so what\u2019s the problem? She said, \u2018I\u2019m just sick of nudity.\u2019 I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else\u2019s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.\u201d 24/30 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 The Legend of Tarzan Apparently Robbie \u2013 who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. \u201cI didn\u2019t injure Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he\u2019s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.\u201d Courtesy Everett Collection/REX/Shutterstock 25/30 Henry Cavill \u2013 The Tudors Cavill says he had to \u201capologise profusely\u201d after he got aroused on set, adding that \u201cIt had only happened to him once\u201d. \u201cA girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn't rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She's basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.\u201d He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great when you\u2019re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?\u201d Getty Images 26/30 Jesse Metcalfe \u2013 Desperate Housewives It\u2019s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria\u2019s Gabrielle Solis. He said: \u201cWe were rehearsing and then the director was like, 'OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set', and I was like, 'I need a minute.'\u201c He added: \u201cIt doesn't happen that frequently\u201d because \u201dthere are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.\" 27/30 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes \u2013 The Princess Bride When you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner\u2019s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was \u201cmessing around\u201d between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant\u2019s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. \u201cI was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes \u2013 you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).\u201d Sony Pictures Entertainment 28/30 John Malkovich \u2013 Being John Malkovich The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting \u201cHey Malkovich, think fast!\u201d Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role. Universal Pictures 29/30 Viggo Mortensen \u2013 The Lord of the Rings When Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet. Rex 30/30 The entire cast of Roar But whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall\u2019s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.\n\nLucy has a mind-altering experience while floating alone in space that makes life back in Houston suddenly feel so small. Have you ever experienced anything similar?\n\nYou mean, like an existential crisis? [Laughs] Realising our insignificance, and then weighing that with how much you feel everything. I don\u2019t know a human that hasn\u2019t faced that at some point.\n\nAnd yet when Lucy behaves much like a man might in competing for the next mission, her supervisor castigates her for getting too emotional.\n\nNoah had me watch The Right Stuff in preparation to get a sense of that very competitive, arrogant, hazing environment that goes on at Nasa to get those seats. These daredevil personalities that are willing to strap themselves to a bomb and splashdown in the ocean in basically a metal shell that just drops out of space. I mean, it\u2019s really wild what they\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s a very specific personality.\n\nAnd when you see the men doing it in The Right Stuff, it just seems so fun, and good-natured \u2013 guys just messing with each other, you know? But when you see me and Zazie (Beetz, playing Lucy\u2019s rival) doing it, it comes off like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a catty woman in the workplace.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the same thing that I think she experiences when her suit starts filling up with water. She feels like if a man did that, they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh my God, look. He\u2019ll do anything just to finish the mission. What a hero.\u201d With her they say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re reckless and emotional.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t actually have water in your helmet in that scene, did you?\n\nWe did fill up the helmet with water, which was scary, because apparently that\u2019s a difficult thing to do with current special-effects technology. I am not that daredevil personality, so that was definitely a challenging day. Basically, I held my breath as long as I could, and then I could remove myself from the helmet as soon as I couldn\u2019t hold my breath anymore. [Laughs] Oh, yes, it was a less pleasant scene to do, I must admit.\n\nWhat struck you most from your research into female astronauts?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note a profession where there\u2019s usually one woman at a time. Even that recent story about how two women [were scheduled to do the first all-female spacewalk], but they only ended up having one suit, and one of them couldn\u2019t go \u2013 which was so insane \u2013 [and it] shows this idea that there\u2019s one slot for a woman that exists so often in powerful positions. There is one seat for a woman at the board table or whatever.\n\nLucy\u2019s plight reminds me of the speech you gave in which you advised, \u201cStop the rhetoric that a woman is crazy or difficult\u201d. Which leads me to Time\u2019s Up. What are you most proud of accomplishing?\n\nIt\u2019s been a really impressive thing how Time\u2019s Up has been able to shape the conversation around pay equality and promote that. Of course, the US women\u2019s soccer team was really crucial in shaping that conversation. Michelle Williams just furthered it [in her Emmy acceptance speech]. It was really incredible to get to see how culture is shifting in talking about it. Then the recent changes in the New York law that was pro survivor of sexual harassment, abuse and assault was also really incredible. I think all of the conversations \u2013 women talking to each other, women talking publicly more \u2013 is inspiring to each of us. It makes us more capable of knowing even how to articulate what we\u2019re feeling, what we need.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to do still, but it\u2019s also been a very rapid change and definitely feels like all of us have had a light-speed evolution in the past few years.\n\nAnd now you\u2019re about to embark on a new Thor film, your first since \u2018Thor: The Dark World\u2019 in 2013. Three years ago you said that as far as you knew, you were done. How did the franchise lure you back?\n\nThe third one didn\u2019t take place on Earth, where Jane lives, so it didn\u2019t make sense for me to be there. When [director Taika Waititi] came to me with this idea \u2013 that I get to be female Thor \u2013 it was a very exciting prospect. I think Marvel has been really wonderful at making their films look more like a reflection of the world and having superheroes of all different kinds of people. And to have so many female protagonists [with Angelina Jolie as Thena in The Eternals] is also really, really exciting. The Black Widow movie [starring Scarlett Johansson] looks amazing.\n\nHow does it feel to finally become a superhero?\n\nI love getting to be part of something that is such a major part of entertainment for young people. It sets your mindset to recognise injustice. I recently saw a sign at the climate march where this kid was like: \u201cI grew up on Marvel movies. Of course, I\u2019m going to fight against wrong\u201d.\n\nSo just how heavy is that hammer?\n\n[Laughs] It\u2019s heavy. I was surprised.\n\n\u00a9 New York Times\n\nLucy in the Sky is out on 6 December", "description": "As a kid with a precocious mind for science,\u00a0Natalie Portman dreamed of becoming an astronaut.
