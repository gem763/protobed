Extra spending commitments on hospitals, police and schools added another \u00a313bn, the report said, increasing the shortfall between income and expenditure since March to \u00a343bn.\n\nWithout tax increases or a retreat on spending pledges, the deficit next year was likely to be nearer 3% and possibly higher should Brexit knock GDP growth, hitting government income further.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nRichard Hughes, an economist at the foundation, said Javid should ditch inflexible fiscal rules that can only be met with short-term decisions that harm the economy\u2019s future.\n\nHe sad: \u201cFiscal rules have guided, if not always bound, tax and spending decisions over the past 20 years \u2013 from Gordon Brown\u2019s golden rule to George Osborne\u2019s goal of eliminating the deficit.\n\n\u201cBut with the UK\u2019s current fiscal rules set to expire next year, and the government on course to miss them by \u00a316bn anyway, the chancellor should take this opportunity to rewrite the fiscal rule book and set a new framework to guide government policy over the coming decade.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s new fiscal rules should reflect current economic realities such as record low interest rates, and the broad political consensus around the need to invest in improving productivity, tackling climate change, and renewing our public service infrastructure.\u201d", "description": "Economic slowdown and spiralling cost of student loans will force government to break its deficit rule", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da403c42846c5d451e9a45e3f77ad451f6f5730b/0_378_4070_2443/master/4070.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f09670775e2482d5e845cf56e945a8bd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
