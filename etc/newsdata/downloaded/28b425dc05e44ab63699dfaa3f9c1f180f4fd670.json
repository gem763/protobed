U.S. negotiators both condemned the Taliban\u2019s newest attacks but still stressed that a lasting peace deal is on the horizon.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, said the looming agreement will ensure that the Taliban never again allows al Qaeda or another terrorist group to use Afghanistan as a base of operations.\n\nIn exchange, the U.S. is expected to significantly reduce its troop presence inside the country.\n\n\u201cWe are at the threshold of an agreement that will reduce violence and open the door for Afghans to sit together to negotiate an honorable and sustainable peace and a unified, sovereign Afghanistan that does not threaten the United States, its allies, or any other country,\u201d Mr. Khalilzad tweeted.\n\nTaliban officials also publicly confirmed that the two sides are nearing a final deal.\n\n\u201cWe are on the verge of ending the invasion and reaching a peaceful solution for Afghanistan,\u201d said Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Khalilzad warned the Taliban that \u201cviolence like this must stop,\u201d though the Taliban likely views the attacks as a negotiating tool that gives them more leverage to extract concessions from the U.S.\n\nMr. Khalilzad was in Kabul on Sunday to brief Afghan government leaders on the progress in Taliban talks. The Washington-backed Afghan government so far has not been a part of negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban.\n\nWhile they haven\u2019t had a seat at the table, the Afghan government and its forces continue to take serious casualties in violent clashes with the Taliban.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs said that 20 Afghan security forces personnel were killed during operations in Kunduz, along with at least five civilians.\n\nFifty-six Taliban terrorists were killed during ground operations and airstrikes, the Afghan government said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Taliban launched a fresh offensive on Puli Khumri, capital of the Baghlan province. At least three Taliban fighters, four civilians and two members of the Afghan security forces were killed during gun battles on the outskirts of the city, Afghan officials said.\n\nLocal officials said they fear that the area could soon fall to Taliban control.\n\n\u201cWe hear the sound of blasts. The people are so worried,\u201d Safdar Mohsini, the provincial council chief, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Taliban are in residential areas fighting with Afghan security forces. We need reinforcements to arrive as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nRecent fighting also has brought fresh U.S. casualties. Over the weekend, the Pentagon identified Army Sgt. 1st Class Dustin B. Ard of Utah as the latest American killed in that conflict. He died \u201cas a result of wounds sustained while engaged in combat operations in Zabul Province\u201d last week, the Defense Department said in a statement.\n\nTwo other Americans were killed in combat operations in Afghanistan on Aug. 21, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe U.S. currently has about 14,000 troops inside Afghanistan. A major reduction in that number has been a top Taliban demand throughout peace negotiations.\n\nLast week, President Trump said the number will be brought down even though no final deal has yet been reached.\n\n\u201cWe have very good negotiations going on with the Taliban, and the Taliban is saying they\u2019re going to do things. We\u2019ll see if that\u2019s so,\u201d the president said last Friday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made a deal yet. But we will be bringing it down to about 8,600 [troops].\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
