An all-American movie star such as Clint Eastwood, Gary Cooper or John Wayne is relaxing between takes on a movie set, hanging out with the extras. The star challenges a diminutive Asian-American stunt man to a fight and is promptly beaten up. His lumbering cowboy moves are no match for the southern fists and northern kicks action of his kung-fu expert rival. The Asian martial artist humiliates the Hollywood legend.\n\nThis is the reverse of what happens in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Tarantino shows Hong Kong-American star Bruce Lee coming off very much second best in a tussle behind the scenes on Lee\u2019s TV series Green Hornet with Cliff Booth, a rugged stuntman played by Brad Pitt. Martial arts icon Lee is shown as a preening and conceited figure, boasting that his fists are lethal weapons and that he could take down Muhammad Ali, before he suffers his comeuppance.\n\nAt the time of the film\u2019s US release in August, Lee\u2019s daughter Shannon Lee expressed her outrage at what she claimed was a skewed portrayal of her father, based on second-hand sources, by a director who had never met him. Her complaints reached China\u2019s National Film Administration, which last week cancelled the release plans for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, originally scheduled for 25 October, after Tarantino refused to re-edit the film. Although no official explanation was given for the film being pulled so close to its opening, the violence and the demeaning characterisation of Bruce Lee are understood to be behind the decision.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe spat between Tarantino and Shannon Lee can\u2019t help but assume an added significance during the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Pitt\u2019s stuntman beating up Bruce Lee didn\u2019t just offend Chinese sensibilities \u2013 it risked exacerbating tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest film industries. As the Hollywood Reporter noted, the Chinese release of Tarantino\u2019s ninth feature was forecast to push the film\u2019s global box office over the $400m (\u00a3300m) mark. Instead, if the film isn\u2019t seen in China at all, Tarantino\u2019s backers Sony Pictures will lose a small fortune.\n\nChina is driving growth in the global film business is expected soon to outstrip the US as the most lucrative film market. Tens of thousands of new cinemas have opened in the country over recent years. The Chinese are also investing heavily in foreign film companies. The giant, Beijing-based Dalian Wanda Group bought leading US exhibitor AMC in 2012. Dalian Wanda has since sold on some of its stake in AMC as it looks to reduce its overseas debt but still partly owns what has is now the biggest cinema chain in the world (and whose holdings include the UK\u2019s Odeon Cinemas) Wanda also owns Legendary Entertainment, the company behind Godzilla and Jurassic World. Fellow Chinese company Alibaba has a stake in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amblin Partners and has invested in such recent Hollywood blockbusters as Mission Impossible \u2013 Fallout and the ill-fated Gemini Man. Tencent Pictures is one of the backers of Oscar contender, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 30 greatest Tarantino characters Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 30 greatest Tarantino characters 1/30 30. Stuntman Mike Played by: Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell nails the slime-ball nature of Stuntman Mike, a character who's as B-movie as they come. Dimension Films 2/30 29. Billy Crash Played by: Walton Goggins in Django Unchained Walton Goggins in Django Unchained Of all the supporting characters in Tarantino's revisionist western, Billy Crash looms largest in the memory. Perhaps it's due to his mispronunciation of the protagonist's name (\"Duh-jang-go\") right after being shot in the genitals. \"The D is silent, hillbilly,\" Django responds, before finishing Crash off. What happens next, Goggins nails. TWC 3/30 28. Trudi Fraser Played by: Julia Butters in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Julia Butters in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Like much of the film that surrounds her, Trudi is a fantasy version of a child star \u2013 safe, in total charge of her own destiny and far smarter than many of the adults that surround her, including the has-been actor (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) she is paired with in her latest project. But through Trudi, and her overjoyed glee at being thrown to the ground while shooting a tense face-off scene involving her on-screen abductor, Tarantino reflects the pure, heady thrill of movie-making, and it\u2019s glorious to behold. Sony Pictures Releasing 4/30 27. Melanie Ralston Played by: Bridget Fonda in Jackie Brown Bridget Fonda in Jackie Brown A SoCal surfer girl bored out of her mind by the men she's holed up with, Bridget Fonda's Melanie only works because every one of her lines drips with scorn and apathy. There's a real pleasure in watching her kick back with a bong or answer the door with a bothered \"WHAT!\", even if it does lead her to a grim demise in a shopping mall parking lot. But at least she died as she lived: pissing off very unremarkable men. Miramax Films 5/30 26. Gogo Yubari Played by: Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill Vol 1 Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill Vol 1 Many of Tarantino\u2019s greatest villains take a kinky glee in violence, and none are more confident in their madness than Gogo, the personal bodyguard of O-Ren Ishii. She\u2019s also one of the most fun Kill Bill characters to watch on-screen, a twirling, spiked ball-wielding madwoman whose grace is only matched by her sadism. Miramax 6/30 25. Honey Bunny & Pumpkin Played by: Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth in Pulp Fiction Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth in Pulp Fiction Because we would hardly dream of splitting them up. \u201cAny of you f**king pricks move, and I\u2019ll execute every motherf**king last one of ya!\u201d remains one of cinema\u2019s greatest line readings, but Amanda Plummer\u2019s Honey Bunny and her on-screen fella Pumpkin, played by Tim Roth, are spectacular even before the line smashes the film into Dick Dale\u2019s \u201cMisirlou\u201d and Pulp Fiction\u2019s opening credits. The pair carefully dissect their imminent robbery of the patrons of a diner, spewing racist slurs and profanities while they go. They\u2019re a prototype for Mickey and Mallory from the Tarantino-scripted Natural Born Killers, with just as much manic and unmistakably carnal energy. Miramax Films 7/30 24. Captain Koons Played by: Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction Captain Koons is the perfect example of a character damn well near stealing a film with a single scene. This is a character who hid a pocketwatch in his anus for years to protect it from being stolen, all to uphold the honour of one day delivering it to his friend's son. If that doesn't get you on this list, nothing will. Miramax Films 8/30 13. Pai Mei Played by: Gordon Liu in Kill Bill Vol 2 Gordon Liu in Kill Bill Vol 2 The kung fu master responsible for shaping Beatrix Kiddo into a warrior, Pai Mei is Kill Bill\u2019s by turns tyrannical and tender mentor figure. His beard, it should be said, is truly what all men should aspire to. Miramax 9/30 22. Lance Played by: Eric Stoltz in Pulp Fiction Eric Stoltz in Pulp Fiction Everyone needs a Lance in their life \u2013 someone you can call on night or day no matter the emergency. He might angrily protest when Vincent (John Travolta) shows up with an unconscious Mia (Uma Thurman), who has snorted one line too many, but there's never any doubt of him helping his pal through his predicament. Lance is as loyal as they come. Miramax Films 10/30 21. Rick Dalton Played by: Leonardo DiCaprio Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Leonardo DiCaprio Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood A classic down-on-his-luck Tarantino character who\u2019d rather self-destruct than acknowledge he doesn\u2019t truly matter anymore, Rick Dalton is so magnetic because he\u2019s also wildly funny. Played with as much a heavy-browed weariness by Leonardo DiCaprio as he is a child-like sense of wonder, he is entitled, ludicrously demanding and completely loveable. Sony Pictures Releasing 11/30 20. Elle Driver Played by: Elle Driver in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 Elle Driver in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 If Kill Bill is essentially a live-action cartoon, full of fantastical set pieces, superhuman fight sequences and discarded limbs, then Elle Driver is its most cartoonish element. Also, arguably, its most dazzlingly spectacular. As played by Daryl Hannah with tongue firmly in cheek, Elle sports an eyepatch, the cadence of a drag queen and a wardrobe straight out of Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood. She\u2019s the gay icon who never was. Miramax 12/30 19. Zo\u00eb Bell Played by: Zo\u00eb Bell in Death Proof Zo\u00eb Bell in Death Proof Zo\u00eb Bell is the unsung hero of every Tarantino films she's a part of, from Kill Bill (she's Uma Thurman's stunt double) to her sweary cameo in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Her real time to shine came in Death Proof in which she played herself and gets to lead the film's female characters in wreaking vengeance on Kurt Russell's murderous Stuntman Mike. Dimension Films 13/30 18. Butch Coolidge Played by: Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction Considering Bruce Willis rarely does subtle, it is striking that Butch Coolidge is such a laconic character. He is a man happy to throw boxing matches, flee to Mexico and use shotguns and samurai swords to fend off potential threats, yet barely breaks a sweat as he goes. It\u2019s probably because he\u2019s a sociopath, but Tarantino also grounds him in something that resembles heroism, or at least a Pulp Fiction spin on it. Miramax Films 14/30 17. Mr Pink Played by: Steve Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs Steve Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs Tarantino himself loved Mr Pink so much that he wanted the role for himself, but fortunately opted for Steve Buscemi after being blindsided by his audition. It's easy to see why. Miramax Films 15/30 16. Bill Played by: David Carradine in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 David Carradine in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 If you build a film around somebody so villainous the protagonist spends the entirety of its running time trying to kill them, you better make sure they're a good character. Bill, thankfully, lives up to expectations. Miramax 16/30 15. Vincent Vega Played by: John Travolta in Pulp Fiction John Travolta in Pulp Fiction There's a jaded melancholy to Vincent Vega that makes him so compelling to watch. He's no longer entirely fulfilled by his job and he\u2019s a little soft around the middle, his silent stoicism only broken by the occasional release of a cheesy grin, or his moves on the dancefloor with Mia Wallace. Additionally, there\u2019s a lovely black comedy to his presence throughout Pulp Fiction \u2013 from his ambiguous but clearly eventful history in Amsterdam, to his frequent trips to the bathroom, all of which seem to end in disaster. Miramax Films 17/30 14. Mr Blonde Played by: Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs Reservoir Dogs is one hell of a cold film and that's a lot to do with Mr Blonde. Madsen's character just loves committing unspeakably violent acts and it's this trait that infuses the film with the tension that makes it so memorable. Miramax Films 18/30 13. Marsellus Wallace Played by: Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction In lesser hands, Marsellus Wallace would have faded into obscurity alongside the more irreverent Tarantino characters. But the way in which the viewer witnesses him experience an unspeakable trauma after his brawl with Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) \u2013 a fight that sees the pair's worlds collide with extremely sick-minded individuals \u2013 can't help but warm him to the viewer. Rhames's best role to date. Miramax Films 19/30 12. Jackie Brown Played by: Pam Grier in Jackie Brown Pam Grier in Jackie Brown Jackie Brown is introduced, in the words of an abusive federal agent, as \u201ca 44-year-old black woman desperately clinging on to this one sh**y little job [she] was fortunate enough to get\u201d. A flight attendant and part-time drug courier, Jackie\u2019s journey over the course of her film is among Tarantino\u2019s most invigorating. She finds the excitement sorely missing in her life, meets a man who respects her rather than uses her, and regularly outsmarts everyone else in the room. It\u2019s often of the fake-it-till-you-make-it variety, like in the nervous test runs of swiftly yanking a pistol out of her desk drawer in advance of the arrival of a man likely to kill her. But it makes her Tarantino\u2019s most human hero, nowhere near as showy as The Bride or Major Marquis Warren, but arguably all the better for it. Miramax Films 20/30 11. Aldo Raine Played by: Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds \"You probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-takin' business; we in the killin' Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin'\" \u2013 need we say more? Universal Pictures 21/30 10. Max Cherry Played by: Robert Forster in Jackie Brown Robert Forster in Jackie Brown Like Jackie Brown herself, bail bondsman Max Cherry arrives with decades of regrets weighing on his shoulders. Robert Forster grants the role an air of understated cool, Max eager for a fresh start and believing he has found it when an in-trouble flight attendant enters his life. If you kicked off your shoes, lifted a glass of scotch to your lips and threw on some vintage soul, you might match the energy Max exudes in every one of his scenes. Miramax Films 22/30 9. Shosanna Dreyfus Played by: Melanie Laurent in Inglourious Basterds Melanie Laurent in Inglourious Basterds If you think that Shosanna's placement on this list is anything to do with the scene in which she paints stripes on her face ahead of burning numerous Nazis to a crisp \u2013 all while David Bowie's \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" plays \u2013 then you'd be right. Universal Pictures 23/30 8. Stephen Played by: Samuel L Jackson in Django Unchained Samuel L Jackson in Django Unchained Stephen is Django Unchained\u2019s version of a rorschach test \u2013 either a desperate victim forced into the unthinkable by circumstance, or the most insidiously evil character in the movie. A classic \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 figure who runs the day-to-day operations of Calvin Candie\u2019s plantation, Stephen is a giggling, preening yes-man to Candie and his white superiors in public, but a ruthless and petty psychopath behind closed doors, expressing disgust at the sight of a free black man. Jackson contorts his face into a glowering, terrifying scowl, and it\u2019s the greatest thing he has ever done. TWC 24/30 7. Calvin Candie Played by: Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained It was once difficult to think of DiCaprio as a villain, but thanks to the role of Calvin Candie, it's suddenly all too easy. Sometimes the greatest characters are the ones you can't wait to see meet their end and the horrendously racist Candie fits seamlessly on that list. TWC 25/30 6. Beatrix Kiddo AKA The Bride Played by: Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 The many shots of Uma Thurman in that yellow outfit, sword in hand, is as iconic as anything Tarantino has done \u2013 and the character proves she's worthy of that status. Beatrix isn't just one of Tarantino's greatest creations, but one of the best heroines in cinematic history. Miramax 26/30 5. Cliff Booth Played by: Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Could stuntman Cliff Booth be Brad Pitt's greatest achievement? He's certainly up there. The kind of character that only Pitt could have played at this particular stage of his life. Sony Pictures Releasing 27/30 4. Mia Wallace Played by: Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction The iconic femme fatale whose ambivalent glare on the Pulp Fiction poster became one of the definitive images of 1990s cinema, Mia Wallace is a woman comprised of numerous contradictory parts. She is an icy addict permanently sticking things up her nose, but also a helpless dreamer captivated by what might have been. In anyone else\u2019s hands, Mia would be little but a male fantasy, but Uma Thurman imbues her with so much grit and heart that regardless of how brilliant the rest of Pulp Fiction is, you can\u2019t help but wish you could follow her on her own separate adventure. Miramax Films 28/30 3. Hans Landa Played by: Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds Is Hans Lands \u2013 perhaps best remembered by the moniker \"Jew Hunter\" \u2013 Tarantino's most detestable character? He's certainly up there. But he's also one of his greatest creations \u2013 a character you so desperately want to see get their comeuppance but fear they never will due to the exemplary way Christoph Waltz manages to switch on the charm as fluidly as the terror. Just remember, in his presence, always wait for the cream. Universal Pictures 29/30 2. Jules Winnfield Played by: Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Tarantino's crowning glory might always be hitman Jules Winnfield's reciting of Ezekiel 25:17 before firing a round of bullets into the poor goons who dared to screw over his employer, but it probably wouldn't be so had it had been delivered by anyone but Samuel L Jackson. Miramax Films 30/30 1. O-Ren Ishii Played by: Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Many of Tarantino\u2019s best characters are dreamers of a sort \u2013 men and women left abandoned by the world who, through sheer force of will, climb to victory. Tarantino paints O-Ren as neither hero nor villain throughout Kill Bill, but instead a woman who took back the power stolen from her as a child, and who will do anything to maintain it in the face of threats from far weaker men. Her death at Beatrix\u2019s hand is stunning but also saddening, both due to Tarantino\u2019s interest in granting O-Ren the empathy, humour and sheer appeal of Beatrix herself (\u201cSilly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords\u201d remains one of the finest lines in any movie), and via Lucy Liu\u2019s masterful performance. O-Ren is the finest depiction of what Tarantino can do with his creations, and one of the most fun and compelling characters in the QT canon. Miramax 1/30 30. Stuntman Mike Played by: Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell in Death Proof Kurt Russell nails the slime-ball nature of Stuntman Mike, a character who's as B-movie as they come.

Beatrix isn't just one of Tarantino's greatest creations, but one of the best heroines in cinematic history. Miramax 26/30 5. Cliff Booth Played by: Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Could stuntman Cliff Booth be Brad Pitt's greatest achievement? He's certainly up there. The kind of character that only Pitt could have played at this particular stage of his life. Sony Pictures Releasing 27/30 4. Mia Wallace Played by: Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction The iconic femme fatale whose ambivalent glare on the Pulp Fiction poster became one of the definitive images of 1990s cinema, Mia Wallace is a woman comprised of numerous contradictory parts. She is an icy addict permanently sticking things up her nose, but also a helpless dreamer captivated by what might have been. In anyone else\u2019s hands, Mia would be little but a male fantasy, but Uma Thurman imbues her with so much grit and heart that regardless of how brilliant the rest of Pulp Fiction is, you can\u2019t help but wish you could follow her on her own separate adventure. Miramax Films 28/30 3. Hans Landa Played by: Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds Is Hans Lands \u2013 perhaps best remembered by the moniker \"Jew Hunter\" \u2013 Tarantino's most detestable character? He's certainly up there. But he's also one of his greatest creations \u2013 a character you so desperately want to see get their comeuppance but fear they never will due to the exemplary way Christoph Waltz manages to switch on the charm as fluidly as the terror. Just remember, in his presence, always wait for the cream. Universal Pictures 29/30 2. Jules Winnfield Played by: Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction Tarantino's crowning glory might always be hitman Jules Winnfield's reciting of Ezekiel 25:17 before firing a round of bullets into the poor goons who dared to screw over his employer, but it probably wouldn't be so had it had been delivered by anyone but Samuel L Jackson. Miramax Films 30/30 1. O-Ren Ishii Played by: Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol 1 Many of Tarantino\u2019s best characters are dreamers of a sort \u2013 men and women left abandoned by the world who, through sheer force of will, climb to victory. Tarantino paints O-Ren as neither hero nor villain throughout Kill Bill, but instead a woman who took back the power stolen from her as a child, and who will do anything to maintain it in the face of threats from far weaker men. Her death at Beatrix\u2019s hand is stunning but also saddening, both due to Tarantino\u2019s interest in granting O-Ren the empathy, humour and sheer appeal of Beatrix herself (\u201cSilly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords\u201d remains one of the finest lines in any movie), and via Lucy Liu\u2019s masterful performance. O-Ren is the finest depiction of what Tarantino can do with his creations, and one of the most fun and compelling characters in the QT canon. Miramax\n\nNot that Hollywood studios, or western filmmakers in general, have had much success in cracking the Chinese market or that Chinese investments in Hollywood have opened up western markets for Chinese filmmakers.\n\nCensorship and human rights issues, offended sensibilities and cultural confusion continue to dog the fortunes of western films in China. Tarantino\u2019s problems with his portrayal of Bruce Lee follow on from similar difficulties other filmmakers have also faced in getting their films played in China. On the other side of the coin, Chinese actors and filmmakers have struggled for recognition and respect in the west. It is telling that Zhang Yimou\u2019s wildly flamboyant martial arts movie, Shadow (2018), wasn\u2019t even given a cinema release in the UK but limped straight on to DVD.\n\nThe UK is one of many countries that, in recent years, rushed with an indecent haste to sign film co-production treaties with China, but there is little evidence of any meaningful collaboration between the two countries since the treaty was signed in 2014. Meanwhile, British distribution companies who used to release Hong Kong and Chinese films by the dozen 25 years ago (when filmmakers like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Wong Kar-wai were in their prime) rarely go near Chinese cinema today.\n\nUnder the current arrangements between Hollywood and China, 34 foreign \u201cquota\u201d films are allowed into Chinese theatres each year on a revenue-sharing basis, while other titles can be shown in cinemas by local distributors, who license them from foreign partners for a fee but don\u2019t share the profits. Co-productions such as period epic/monster movie The Great Wall, made in China but starring Hollywood\u2019s Matt Damon, can get around the restrictions. However, such films have rarely turned out well.\n\nOne of the more bizarre instances of a western movie hitting a great wall in China involved Disney\u2019s Christopher Robin, a live-action, family-friendly drama starring Ewan McGregor that got middling reviews and whose biggest drawback at the time of its UK release last year seemed to be its extreme blandness. It was kept out of Chinese cinemas on the grounds that Winnie the Pooh looked like Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. In his journey east, AA Milne\u2019s cuddly teddy bear from the Hundred Acre Wood had somehow metamorphosed into a subversive symbol of political resistance in China, a bit like Paddington turning into a member of the Baader-Meinhof gang. You can understand why the Chinese authorities were so upset about the wildly irreverent and abrasive animated TV series South Park, which recently devoted an entire episode to debunking censorship in China, but Pooh Bear is surely a different kind of agitator altogether.\n\nThe authorities are even more draconian with their own actors and filmmakers than they are with foreigners. When Chinese mega-star Fan Bingbing, who had appeared in an X-Men movie in Hollywood, as well as in a string of film and TV hits in China, was caught in a tax evasion scandal, she suddenly vanished from public view for several months, apparently because she was under house arrest. When she resurfaced, she was in disgrace. Her case highlighted the contradictions in a country with a communist government trying to deal with a money and glamour driven business like the film industry.\n\nWith such huge numbers to motivate them, filmmakers are prepared to accept whatever Faustian bargains they\u2019re offered to get their movies released\n\nWhile Tarantino is refusing to re-edit Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for Chinese audiences, the team behind Bohemian Rhapsody had no compunctions about cutting three minutes out of their film including key references to Freddie Mercury\u2019s homosexuality. Released as an arthouse film, Bohemian Rhapsody grossed just over $11m in China \u2013 a strong result albeit one only achieved after the producers capitulated to the Chinese censors.\n\nOften, filmmakers are ostracised on grounds that have nothing whatsoever to do with their own work. Swedish director Ruben Ostlund\u2019s The Square, the arthouse film that won the Palme D\u2019Or in Cannes in 2017, was released all around the world to huge acclaim, but wasn\u2019t shown in China, reportedly because the authorities there were still angry about one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize. South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s film Parasite won the Palme D\u2019Or in Cannes this year but hasn\u2019t reached China, either. A planned screening at a Chinese festival this summer was cancelled at the last minute, ostensibly for \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, but the film appears to have been caught up in China\u2019s ongoing blockade of Korean film and TV, prompted by Chinese disapproval of South Korea\u2019s adoption of an American-backed missile defence system.\n\nBy the same token, when China is making friendly trade or diplomatic overtures to a country, films from that country will suddenly turn up in Chinese cinemas.\n\nFor foreign filmmakers, China can still seem like a promised land. Everyone knows the problems: the censorship and logistical hurdles they face in getting their films into the country and the equally daunting challenges in getting any profits out of it. (Under the revenue sharing terms on bigger movies, western partners only see a small part of the returns. Veteran film trade journalist Mike Fleming recently wrote that, even if Tarantino\u2019s movie was shown uncut, \u201cthe 25 cents on the dollar that China kicks back to US studios on its movies can\u2019t be worth the indignity for an auteur like Tarantino to have to compromise his vision\u201d).\n\nHowever, China was worth over $600m in box-office revenue to Avengers: Endgame, an enormous figure no matter how much of the loot stayed in China. This is also a country where an arthouse title like Lebanese director Nadine Labaki\u2019s Capernaum can gross $50m and a small Japanese film like Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s Shoplifters can earn over $14m in cinemas. With such huge numbers to motivate them, filmmakers are prepared to accept whatever Faustian bargains they\u2019re offered to get their movies released.\n\nSometimes, little European films spurned in their own backyards have turned into runaway hits with Chinese audiences. This was the case recently with Prey (2016), a low-budget Dutch horror film about a bloodthirsty lion that escapes the local zoo and goes on a killing spree in downtown Amsterdam. It grossed $231,000 when it was released in the Netherlands three years ago and looked to have sunk without trace. However, a Chinese distributor bought it, retitled it as Violent Fierce Lion and marketed it as if it was Jaws done on land. It was released earlier this year in China on 4,000 screens and made over $5m during the opening weekend. That would have been very good news for the producers if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact the film had been sold to China for a flat fee. None of the profits filtered back to the Netherlands.\n\nIn Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Tarantino caricatures Bruce Lee as an arrogant motormouth. The portrayal is disrespectful \u2013 but it also provides one of the funniest scenes in the movie. The real unfairness here is not in Tarantino\u2019s portrayal of the star but in the fact that, as matters stands, Chinese audiences won\u2019t be given the chance to make up their own mind about it.", "description": "Imagine the scene.
