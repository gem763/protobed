In the stage show, Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild) was a useful master of ceremonies for the proceedings, but Lloyd Webber has said that the movie will be seen through the eyes of Victoria, the White Cat (Francesca Hayward). That represents something of a promotion for this character, who will also be getting her own brand-new Oscar-bait Lloyd Webber song, with lyrics by one T. Swift.\n\nAlso watch for:\n\n\u2014 Rum Tum Tugger, usually an Elvis impersonator, due for a welcome hip-hop/R&B updating at the hands of Jason Derulo.\n\n\u2014 Macavity, the Napoleon of Crime, who, onstage, plays a relatively minor role in his own number. Odds are that onscreen, the top-billed Idris Elba will get more action.\n\n\u2014 Gus the Theater Cat, a Centrum Silver a ctor who drags on about his days on the Victorian stage. Let us hope Ian McKellen can pump some juice into him.\n\n\u2014 Bustopher Jones, a tuxedoed, white-spatted dandy who will be channeling the pathologically crowd-pleasing spirit of James Corden.\n\nGrizabella the Glamour Cat is the de facto protagonist because, well, she\u2019s the only one something happens to.

Her destiny is to totter into the spotlight at evening\u2019s climax and sing That Song.

It\u2019s \u201cMemory.\u201d\n\n(We might pause to note what a strangely tenacious error this has become for such an oft-recorded tune.
