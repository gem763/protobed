She hit back at a fan, writing: 'She was ok piping up about me before if she wants to give it she needs to take it!'\n\nDanielle however was keen to reiterate that the pregnancy was not a factor.\n\nShe wrote: '[Rebekah] was ok piping up about me before if she wants to give it she needs to take it! Someone on her account sold stories on my mate end of pregnant or not! Coleen was pregnant when some of these stories came out'.\n\nDanielle appeared on the morning TV show to express her opinion on the WAG war, and hinted that she has had a similar experience with Rebekah in the past.\n\nHowever Jamie's wife was quick to retaliate, as she took to Twitter to claim that Danielle's admission was 'utter b******s' and their feud was sparked by her refusal to try and find Danielle a man following her split from Jamie [O'Hara].\n\nNot ok... Appearing on This Morning on Friday, Nicola said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay, as a mother its not okay. She should come out here, until she's proven guilty'\n\nShe wrote: 'Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had \u2018similar run-ins\u2019 is utter b****cks. She is just fuming that I \u2018didn\u2019t get Jamie recruiting\u2019 for her like she asked me to...'\n\nDanielle then accused Rebekah of selling 'more' stories to The Sun, a day after Coleen accused her of leaking fake stories about her life.\n\nThe Sun posted a story in which a well-timed source claimed Rebekah WAS telling the truth and Danielle did enlist her to help her find love.\n\nFuming, Danielle, who has previously dated Teddy Sheringham and Jermain Defoe, took to Twitter once again and said Rebekah must be this source of this new story.\n\nPals: Danielle appeared on the morning TV show to express her opinion on the WAG war, and hinted that she has had a similar experience with Rebekah in the past\n\nIn what has become a War of the WAGs, Coleen released an incredible social media statement aimed at Rebekah in which she revealed she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' who was leaking fake stories.\n\nSubsequently Nicola issued a warning to Coleen about stressing out an expectant mother, as she said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay... Something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby!'\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy has now given an interview with The Daily Mail, in which she insisted arguing with Coleen is akin to rowing 'with a pigeon'.\n\nThe news comes after it was revealed that this week social media stats saw Coleen and Rebekah's row have triple the amount of Twitter mentions (276,822) as Boris Johnson (80,074).\n\nSocial Chain Data, who tracked Twitter activity, confirmed that the emotion generated was higher than Brexit, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump combined.", "description": "After Coleen, 33, accused Rebekah, 37, of leaking false stories to the press, Danielle, 35, came forth with similar claims leading to a row between the duo on social media", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/13/19588658-0-image-a-88_1570798569951.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
