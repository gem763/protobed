He now has four shutouts and a 1.94 goals-against average in 14 career games against Columbus.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois scored for the Blue Jackets, and Joonas Korpisalo made 22 saves in his third start of the season.\n\nAnaheim continued as the only NHL team not to allow a first-period goal this season, then scored twice in just under two minutes of the second to take a 2-0 lead.\n\nAfter the Ducks were called for delay of game when Ryan Getzlaf sent a puck over the glass, they caught a break when a clearing pass hit a linesman, leading to a two-on-one with Silfverberg and Rickard Rakell.\n\nThe initial shot by Rakell was saved, but Silfverberg skated in and scored the rebound for a 1-0 lead at 12:59 of the middle period.\n\nFowler made it 2-0 after Ondrej Kase dropped a pass for him as he was coming through the right circle. Fowler snapped a wrist shot over Korpisalo's right pad for his 60th goal with the Ducks, tying Scott Niedermayer for the most by a defenseman in franchise history.\n\nDubois cut Columbus' deficit to 2-1 at 16:16 of the second. He carried the puck down the left side, flicked it toward the net from the bottom of the circle and it got through on the short side.\n\nGetzlaf passed Corey Perry (988) for the all-time franchise lead in games played.\n\nThe Ducks killed three power plays to improve to 15-for-16 on the penalty kill this season.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Ryan Miller made 26 saves, and the visiting Anaheim Ducks beat the Columbus  Blue Jackets 2-1 on Friday night.Jakob Silfverberg scored short-handed and Cam...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
