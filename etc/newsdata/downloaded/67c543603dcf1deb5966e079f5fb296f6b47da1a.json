The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Saturday in a tweet they said that Apple had \u201cmany business considerations\u201d but had \u201cmake thing(s) right.\u201d\n\nApple is the latest foreign company to catch heat in relation to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have lasted four months.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) and U.S. sports brand Vans also have become embroiled in controversies over the protests.\n\nThe piece on the website of the People\u2019s Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth.\n\nMaking the App available on Apple\u2019s Hong Kong app Store at this time was \u201copening the door\u201d to violent protesters in the former British colony.\n\n\u201cLetting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings,\u201d the paper said.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for a comment.", "description": "The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, lashed out on Tuesday at Apple Inc for allowing an app on its app store that tracks the movement of police around Hong Kong and is used by protesters in ongoing and sometimes violent demonstrations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
