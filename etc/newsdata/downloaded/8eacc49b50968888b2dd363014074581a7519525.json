You know, I wake up every single morning with not a lot of time on my hands because I\u2019m doing things like filling potholes and making sure that our city has enough affordable housing and I don\u2019t have time, with a city of 430,000 people, to be tweeting garbage out. So it\u2019s kind of surprising when the president of the United States, a country with 325 million people, has the time to do this himself. So I don\u2019t know where the guy gets the time, but I certainly don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nTrump launched his Twitter war with Frey after the mayor sought a $530,000 deposit to defray expenses, mostly for security, ahead of Trump\u2019s Thursday rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis.\n\nThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again! https://t.co/ibTqvSbsbn \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Trump campaign issued a statement on Monday accusing the mayor, a Democrat, of an \u201cabuse of power\u201d for threatening to withhold use of the city-owned Target Center unless the campaign made the advance payment.\n\nTrump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, repeatedly went after Frey Tuesday morning, accusing him of overcharging the campaign for the venue, while noting that the mayor had previously stated that Trump\u2019s \u201cmessage of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nTrump was also upset over a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment Tuesday about a new Minneapolis Police Department policy banning officers from wearing their uniforms while attending political rallies or if they are featured in advertisements for candidates.\n\nFrey took notice of the Twitter jabs and did, in fact, find the time to respond on the social media platform.\n\nYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nSomeone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u2019s in town. https://t.co/bXITaPdW4E \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Trump campaign has framed the issue as freedom of speech, but the city insists the issue is the cost to taxpayers. The Minneapolis Police Department has canceled days off this week, MPR News reported, and is paying for additional police from nearby departments to help secure the president\u2019s reelection rally.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has a reputation for not repaying cities for costs associated with his rallies. A study by the Center for Public Integrity has found that the president has failed to reimburse numerous cities for expenses incurred in providing security at his rallies. One such city is El Paso, Texas, whose officials say the president still owes $470,000 in costs stemming from a February rally.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey hit back at President Trump regarding the use of the Target Center for a Thursday campaign rally.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qfjall4SIu.hVltwfTr4PA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/7b03d040-ea0e-11e9-8bef-cb1370c016b8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
