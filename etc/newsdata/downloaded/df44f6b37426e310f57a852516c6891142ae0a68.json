Arfeen stocks some of his designs at a London-based multi-label store called O\u2019nitaa, where clothes from other Pakistani and Indian designers are also on display.\n\n\u201cPrince William saw the traditional outfit at the store on his visit and he really liked my work,\u201d Arfeen told ARY News.\n\nThe Karachi-based designer shared it might be a surprise for many that he didn\u2019t take the Duke\u2019s measurements. Arfeen\u2019s London team contacted him after the sherwani was taken away from the studio.\n\n\u201cI got a picture in which the sleeves appeared short and there were fitting issues. I told my team to fix it. When I asked about its colour, they told me \u2018It\u2019s at the palace\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was when he got to know the order is for Prince William.\u201dThe palace got details of my brand and checked it\u2019s credibility. After which we were contacted by the wardrobe manager telling us what they wanted,\u201d Arfeen said.\n\nThe royal wanted a blue sherwani with green buttons but the designer sent him two options, a teal sherwani as well. He was informed that Kate will be donning green colour as well to highlight Pakistan\u2019s tradition.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge kept both the pieces and opted for the latter to complement the Duchess.\n\nArfeen delivered the sherwani in time although it was a long process. \u201cThe deadline given to us was Monday so we precisely took two days to complete the outfit by working on it day and night.\u201d\n\nSharing details about how his brand went about designing the outfit, he said \u201cMy brand Naushemian has its own exclusivity. Our raw materials, even fabric is produced in-house which differentiates our sherwanis from that of other brands.\u201d\n\nMaterials used for the signature nine button-down sherwani are self embossed jamawar fabric especially handwoven from Naushemian factories. Intricate embroidery in turquoise is done on the sleeves as well as back motif and buttons.\n\nAccording to Telegraph UK, the Prince who is mostly seen in suits or chinos wore a traditional sherwani for the first time and that too by a Pakistani designer.\n\nArfeen said that it\u2019s an honour for him to dress Britain\u2019s future king. \u201cIt\u2019s a proud moment for Pakistan that he chose a traditional outfit in green designed by a local brand.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Prince William turned heads in a traditional jewel-toned sherwani designed by a Pakistani designer on Tuesday night, on the royal visit to Pakistan.", "authors": ["Hamna Iqbal"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/will-alldesi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
