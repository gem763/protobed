(NOAA/AP)\n\nThe science connecting climate change to hurricanes like Dorian is strong. Warmer oceans fuel more extreme storms; rising sea levels bolster storm surges and lead to worse floods. Just this summer, after analyzing more than 70 years of Atlantic hurricane data, NASA scientist Tim Hall reported that storms have become much more likely to \u201cstall\u201d over land, prolonging the time when a community is subjected to devastating winds and drenching rain.\n\nBut none of the numbers in his spreadsheets could prepare Hall for the image on his computer screen this week: Dorian swirling as a Category 5 storm, monstrous and nearly motionless, above the islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n\nSeeing it \u201cjust spinning there, spinning there, spinning there, over the same spot,\u201d Hall said, \u201cyou can\u2019t help but be awestruck to the point of speechlessness.\u201d\n\nAfter pulverizing the Bahamas for more than 40 hours, Dorian finally swerved north Tuesday as a Category 2 storm. It is expected to skirt the coasts of Florida and Georgia before striking land again in the Carolinas, where it could deliver more life-threatening wind, storm surge and rain.\n\nWind strength recorded in 12-hour increments Tropical storm Hurricane 39-73 mph 74+ mph Jacksonville Atlantic Ocean FLA.

But it also fits a trend: Dorian\u2019s appearance made 2019 the fourth straight year in which a Category 5 hurricane formed in the Atlantic \u2014 the longest such streak on record.\n\nShocking though the storm has been, meteorologists and climate scientists say it bears hallmarks of what hurricanes will increasingly look like as the climate warms.\n\n[Tracking Hurricane Dorian: Follow the progress of the storm]\n\nDorian\u2019s rapid intensification over the weekend was unprecedented for a hurricane that was already so strong. In the space of nine hours Sunday, its peak winds increased from 150 mph to 180 mph. By the time the storm made landfall, its sustained winds of 185 mph were tied for strongest ever observed in the Atlantic.\n\nThe link between rapid intensification and climate change is robust, said Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at Woods Hole Research Center. Heat in the ocean is a hurricane\u2019s primary source of fuel, and the world\u2019s oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the warming of the past 50 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe water that Dorian developed over was about 1 degree Celsius warmer than normal, Francis said: \u201cThat translates to a whole bunch of energy.\u201d\n\nBecause warm air can hold more moisture, climate change has increased the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, leading to wetter hurricanes that unleash more extreme rainfall.\n\nThe warm, wet air also gives further fuel to a growing storm.\n\n\u201cWhen that water vapor condenses into cloud droplets, it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere and that\u2019s what a hurricane feeds off of,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThese factors are very clearly contributing to the storms we\u2019ve been seeing lately.\"\n\nModels predict that Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the North Atlantic could become nearly twice as common over the next century as a result of climate change, even as the total number of storms declines.\n\nOnce a hurricane makes landfall, the sea level rise created by global warming can exacerbate its effects by amplifying storm surge. A hurricane\u2019s strong winds will push water toward the shore, causing extreme flooding in a relatively short time.\n\nThe higher the water level on a clear day, the worse floods will be once a storm arrives \u2014 and global sea levels are predicted to rise by about a meter by the end of the century.\n\nHurricane Dorian was particularly striking \u2014 and devastating \u2014 because of the way it lingered over the Bahamas. Such \u201cstalling\u201d events have become far more common in the past three quarters of a century, said Hall, who is a senior scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science in June, Hall found that North Atlantic hurricanes have slowed about 17 percent since 1944; annual coastal rainfall averages from hurricanes increased by about 40 percent over the same period. A 2018 paper found that tropical cyclones worldwide have slowed significantly.\n\nIn stalling events, \u201cyou have longer time for the wind to build up that wall of water for the surge and you just get more and more accumulated rain on the same region,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cThat was the catastrophe of Harvey,\u201d he added, referring to the hurricane that dumped more than five feet of rain over Texas in 2017. Hurricanes Dorian and Florence, the latter of which deluged the Carolinas last year, also fit this pattern.\n\nHall and his colleagues believe there is a \u201cclimate change signal\u201d in this phenomenon, though they are still teasing out the link between human-caused warming and slow-moving storms.\n\nHurricanes have no engines of their own; instead, they are steered across Earth\u2019s surface by large-scale atmospheric winds, like corks bobbing in a turbulent stream.\n\nIf these guiding winds collapse, or even simply shift around, a hurricane can get caught in an eddy and \u201cstagnate,\u201d Hall said. Climate simulations have shown that atmospheric winds in the subtropics, where Dorian is, are slowing down \u2014 making these types of eddies more likely.\n\n\u201cBut there are a lot of points in the chain of cause and effect that remain to be elaborated,\u201d Hall said.\n\nSuch stalling events make hurricanes more difficult to track. Without a known large-scale wind to propel them, the storms are buffeted about by small-scale fluctuations in their environments that are far harder to forecast.\n\nBoth Hall and Francis cautioned that scientists can\u2019t attribute any single weather disaster to climate change \u2014 especially not while that disaster is unfolding. What researchers can do is evaluate how much worse the disaster was made as a result of human-caused warming, and how likely it is that this type of disaster will occur again.\n\nWhen it comes to Dorian, Hall said, the answers to both those questions are grim.\n\n\u201cThis is what we expect more of,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get used to seeing it.\n\nRead more:\n\nHurricanes are strengthening faster in the Atlantic, and climate change is a big reason, scientists say\n\nBahamas lifts Hurricane Dorian storm warnings, assesses \u2018catastrophic\u2019 destruction\n\nPuerto Rico after Maria: A year of disruption", "description": "The storm that struck the Bahamas with deadly force this week shows what hurricanes will look like as the planet warms.", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
