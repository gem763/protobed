Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2019\n\nThe Associated Press noted that a Syria war monitor reported an attack including eight helicopters and a warplane from the international coalition fighting the terror organization targeted a group linked to al Qaeda, Hurras al-Deen, in Idlib Province on Saturday.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added that ISIS operatives were thought to be hiding in the area, according to the AP, which reported that the group documented the deaths of 9 people in the attack.\n\nISIS last April released a video showing al-Baghdadi in good health, speaking with three men whose faces were blurred, according to multiple reports.\n\nAl-Baghdadi in the video acknowledged the end of the battle of Baghouz, Syria, which marked ISIS\u2019s territorial defeat, but vowed that the fight was not over.\n\nThe U.S. and its coalition partners declared victory against ISIS in March after the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) retook its last pocket of land in Baghouz.\n\nThe U.S. military relied on the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is led by the Kurds, as the local ground force fighting ISIS. Trump earlier this month withdrew U.S. forces from northern Syria ahead of a Turkish assault on the area, sparking criticism.

While the claim was met with much skepticism at the time, it did lead to widespread speculation about his whereabouts.\n\n--This breaking news report was last updated at 7:46 a.m.", "description": "Officials believe ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u00a0is dead after a U.S. military raid in Syria, according to multiple reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/isis_2_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
