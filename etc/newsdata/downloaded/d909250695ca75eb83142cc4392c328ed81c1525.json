I can\u2019t thank my teammates enough, both past and present, and the ECB for being supporters and friends along my journey,\u201d Taylor said\n\n\u201cPlaying for England and getting to wear the shirt for so long has been a dream come true and I have been blessed with so many great moments throughout my career. From making my debut in 2006, to Ashes wins, and of course the World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, to name just a few.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also been blessed with travelling the world and making lifelong friends along the way.\n\n\u201cTo be right in the thick of women\u2019s cricket as it\u2019s gone from strength to strength \u2013 not only in England, but across the world \u2013 has been an amazing experience, and I can look back on what women\u2019s cricket has achieved with great pride at playing some small part in it.\u201d\n\nTaylor retires as England\u2019s second leading all-time run-scorer, with 6,533 international runs, including seven hundreds, all made in one-day international cricket.\n\nShe was, in many ways, a trailblazer \u2013 Taylor played first team men\u2019s cricket at Brighton College and would go on to appear in grade cricket in Australia in 2015: the first woman to do so.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it is for her exploits behind the stumps that Taylor might best me remembered. She possessed impossibly quick hands and reactions, with particular penchant for a leg-side stumping. She leaves the international arena having helped the team lift two World Cups (in 2009 and 2017) and a T20 World Cup (2009), and was named ICC Women\u2019s Cricketer of the Year three times.\n\nRead more\n\nKnight on Ashes defeat, The Hundred and growth of women\u2019s cricket\n\n\u201cSarah can be immensely proud of everything she has achieved in an England shirt, and of everything she has done for the women\u2019s game,\u201d Clare Connor, Managing Director of Women\u2019s Cricket for the ECB, said.\n\n\u201cShe is someone that young people can look up to, for her achievements and talent on the pitch \u2013 but also for her bravery and resilience off it. She has come through significant adversity and performed on the world stage for her country.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to Sarah for her contributions to English cricket over the last 13 years. She has become a powerful voice within women\u2019s sport and I\u2019m sure she will make a success of the next stage of her professional life. We all wish her the very best.\u201d\n\nTaylor has publicly spoken of her battles with anxiety, and took an extended break from the game in 2016.\n\nMore recently she missed the T20 World Cup last year, and a portion of this summer\u2019s Ashes,\n\nTaylor became known for her fast hands and quick reactions behind the stumps (Getty)\n\n\u201cThe England girls are role models on and off the field, and they have undoubtedly inspired \u2013 and will continue to inspire \u2013 so many young people to take up the game, girls and boys,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the heights that this team can reach.\n\n\u201cI am extremely proud of my career. I leave with my head held high and with excitement for what my future holds and what my next chapter brings.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Knight on Ashes defeat, The Hundred and growth of women\u2019s cricket", "description": "England wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor has announced her retirement from international cricket.The 30-year-old made 226 appearances for her country after making her debut in 2006.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uC93WhAJjviNL3mVNjJwPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03ODY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YZoJqZ4x_epCR2QJliNnOg--~B/aD0zOTM7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/58f54908e11bb36e3c01f37cbd76d2c0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
