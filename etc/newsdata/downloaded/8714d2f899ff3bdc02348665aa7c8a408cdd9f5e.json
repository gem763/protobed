Its leader, Sidiki Abass, also known as Sidi Bi Soulemane, had been appointed military advisor to the government under the pact, but stepped down on September 4.\n\nThe 3R - from the French words for Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation -- emerged in late 2015 purportedly to defend the Muslim Fulani, or Peul, people from Christian anti-Balaka militias.\n\nIn 2016, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a report that implicated the 3R in the deaths of scores of people as well as rape and wide-scale civilian displacement.\n\nOne of the UN's biggest peacekeeping missions, MINUSCA has nearly 13 000 troops and police in the CAR in support of the elected president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.", "description": "Three Senegalese crew were killed and a fourth was injured when a combat helicopter used by United Nations peacekeepers in the Central African Republic crashed in the west of the country, the UN force said on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3778/a53d1a2990c7425e91b95e7d4f52dc6c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
