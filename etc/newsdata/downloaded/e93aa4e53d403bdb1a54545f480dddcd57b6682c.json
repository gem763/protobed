I did so earlier today, after being approached by various senior leaders throughout the week,\u201d Zille wrote.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, the DA has been through a period of turmoil and distress. As a party, it is important for us to reflect, to introspect and to begin the process of reconnecting with voters. If elected as chairperson of the Federal Council, my objective will be to support the leadership in its goal of stabilising the party and getting it back on track. \u201c\n\nThe stunning announcement comes as party leader Mmusi Maimane \u2013 who succeeded Zille in 2015 \u2013 fights for political survival, with his opponents fighting tooth and nail for his demise.\n\nThe powerful position that Zille will be standing for is one elected by the federal council, which is the highest decision-making body between conferences. That body is scheduled to sit on October 18 for the election of the position as well as to receive a the report from a review panel - headed up by Ryan Coetzee \u2013 on the party\u2019s dismal show at the May polls.\n\nOther names that have been touted to take over from Selfe include former head of policy Gwen Ngwenya, federal executive chairperson Athol Trolip and federal council deputy chairperson Thomas Walters.\n\nZille and Maimane, who were once close allies had a falling out around the time that the leader was forced to institute disciplinary action against the former leader for a series of tweets that appeared to endorse aspects of colonialism. The drawn-out process, which saw Zille sanctioned from party activities, saw battle lines drawn between those who rallied behind each leader.\n\n\u201cI love the DA, and the values it represents \u2013 freedom, fairness, opportunity and diversity. South Africa cannot succeed unless the DA succeeds. I am prepared to work hard and to play my part in saving our democracy,\u201d she said.", "description": "", "authors": ["S'Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3954/99c5e2d117814618b2e0cab5d55e15c3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
