Before the European tour that November, the captaincy was transitioned from long-time skipper Agustin Creevy to Pablo Matera.\n\nInitially, results were good. South Africa and Australia were beaten in the 2018 Rugby Championship, but then the growing pains set in, performances weren\u2019t pretty, and results were even less so.\n\nIn the 31-man Rugby World Cup squad, 16 came to their first in Japan. Their tournament of regret ended on Wednesday, but Ledesma is far from finished with them.\n\nThe coach has come in for heavy criticism for Argentina\u2019s failure to get out of the pool stage for the first time in 16 years. And he is defiant.\n\nHe said he was \u201cmainly responsible\u201d for the exit as coach, but not entirely. He wasn\u2019t half asleep on the field as France produced a 20-3 halftime lead in Tokyo, or when the Pumas had to play with 14 men against England from the 18th minute in Tokyo. The defeats, especially to France 23-21 after coming back to lead by one, were painful.\n\nBut they were not surprising.\n\nWales liked to say it forgot how to lose during its national record 14-win streak that lasted into August. In that regard, Argentina forgot how to win over the past year. Near-misses against Scotland at Murrayfield, New Zealand in Buenos Aires, Australia in Brisbane, and South Africa in Pretoria highlighted the Pumas\u2019 inability to finish off and close out.\n\nThey came to Japan on a nine-loss streak and scarred by defeat. France was their 10th in a row . Beating lowly Tonga ended the run, and was only Argentina\u2019s ninth win in 43 tests since the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe 10th win in 45 tests was against the lowly United States, 47-17 on Wednesday , when the Pumas said they finally began to show their game plan, which must have counted on flimsy Eagles backline tackling.\n\nOn the other hand, Ledesma wasn\u2019t served by Pumas whose form was below expectations. It wasn\u2019t just flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez, the record point-scorer and mainstay who wasn\u2019t even in the reserves against England. Others, including lock Tomas Lavanini - even before the red card against England - and captain Pablo Matera were ordinary.\n\nPerhaps it was no coincidence that most played for the Jaguares, who had their best year yet in Super Rugby by reaching the final. There were 26 Jaguares in the Pumas\u2019 31-man squad. Every team has had a long year, too, but if the Pumas really were tired then they weren\u2019t managed well.\n\nThe union\u2019s rule on picking overseas players for Argentina only when needed to ensure the Jaguares are competitive is upstanding. But it has been said before that Argentina\u2019s reliance on the Jaguares is like the All Blacks picking only from the Super Rugby champion Crusaders. New Zealand has four other Super Rugby teams. Argentina doesn\u2019t have any others, and is undermining only itself when it doesn\u2019t gather its best Pumas for the tournament that best defines them.\n\nSanchez was among three overseas-based players in the squad, and local fans were surprised when overseas-based No. 8 Facundo Isa, and backs Juan Imhoff and Santiago Cordero missed out on selection.\n\nThe Pumas lacked world-class playmakers. They had no individual who worried their opponents. But the future appears in good hands.\n\nLock Guido Petti had a good second World Cup at 24. Juan Cruz Mallia, the center who prefers wing, was the standout in the win against the United States. Also rising to the occasion were scrumhalf Felipe Ezcurra, wing Bautista Delguy, back from a nasty broken ankle, and prop Mayco Vivas, who was one of the six newcomers in Ledesma\u2019s first squad.\n\nLedesma is contracted to 2021 and feels he\u2019s only just beginning to make a mark. After four World Cups as a player and two as a coach, he wants to finish what he started.\n\n\u201cThere are 16 boys that made their World Cup debut, and they are going to get a lot of learning from this experience,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart aches. We are out of the World Cup. But with those young guys, the future is looking good for Argentine rugby.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Daniel Hourcade resigned and Mario Ledesma took over as Argentina coach in August 2018, his first squad included six newcomers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/japan_rugby_wcup_argentina_usa_94884_c0-49-4023-2394_s1770x1032.jpg?8e16f8461f614a188113cd0fbef149b0872d0596", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
