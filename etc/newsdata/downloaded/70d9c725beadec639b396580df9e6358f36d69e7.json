(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Redskins parted ways with cornerback Greg Stroman, who played a significant role last season after Quinton Dunbar went down with a leg injury.\n\nStroman was released with an injury designation Tuesday, and tight end J.P. Holtz also was released. The latter move may be a sign that starter Jordan Reed is ready to return from the concussion protocol.\n\nThe departures allowed the team to sign defensive tackle T.Y. McGill and defensive back Simeon Thomas.\n\n[Redskins\u2019 Derrius Guice has a meniscus injury in his knee, return time is uncertain]\n\nStroman played in 15 games in 2018, starting three, and recorded 38 tackles, one interception and four passes defensed. He was surpassed by rookie Jimmy Moreland on the cornerback depth chart this season and was not used as a punt or kick returner in Sunday\u2019s season-opening loss at the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThomas was a 2018 sixth-round draft pick by the Cleveland Browns who was waived before his rookie season. The 6-foot-3, 197-pounder spent most of last season on the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 practice squad after playing four years at the University of Louisiana.\n\nMcGill played for four teams in four years after signing with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent out of N.C. State in 2015. The 6-foot, 299-pounder had five sacks in two seasons with the Colts but none in six combined games with the Browns, Eagles and Los Angeles Chargers in 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe addition of McGill helps the numbers on the defensive line after the Redskins kept just five at the initial 53-man roster cutdown, and after Jonathan Allen and Caleb Brantley suffered injuries in Sunday\u2019s loss. Allen (medial collateral ligament sprain) and Brantley (foot) were described as day-to-day by Coach Jay Gruden on Monday.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nInside the four drives that doomed the Redskins in their loss to the Eagles\n\nEven after a demoralizing collapse, Redskins remain upbeat about loss to Eagles\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 season-opening loss to Eagles", "description": "Also, Washington\u2019s release of tight end J.P.
