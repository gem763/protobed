Babitz\u2019s journalism treads familiar ground for readers of her lightly fictionalized memoirs. Los Angeles and celebrity are front and center, but so too are Babitz\u2019s struggles with sobriety and the life-threatening accident that left her scarred from third-degree burns. On the page, she is consistently self-referential yet never myopic, occupying the marginal space between fiction and nonfiction with panache.\n\nDespite counting some of the 20th century\u2019s most dazzling creatives as her friends and lovers \u2014 Steve Martin, Harrison Ford, Jim Morrison, Linda Ronstadt, Ed and Paul Ruscha, Annie Leibovitz and Andy Warhol, to name a few \u2014 Babitz only resurfaced in 2014 when Lili Anolik waxed poetic on the author\u2019s smoke-wreathed glamour and legendary biography in \u201cAll About Eve \u2014 and Then Some\u201d for Vanity Fair. The article triggered a wave of reissues of her work with NYRB Classics and Counterpoint Press. Her books \u2014 once out of print and long forgotten \u2014 are now readily available and count Jia Tolentino, Stephanie Danler and Emma Roberts as fans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI Used to Be Charming\u201d pays homage to the riotous glory of shopping and people-watching at the Ralphs on Sunset, swimming nude through a bougainvillea-strewn swimming pool, dashing off notes on engraved Tiffany & Co. stationery and stalking debauchery at the Troubadour\u2019s bar. In examining the quotidian moments of the rich and famous with wit and levity, Babitz opens her reader\u2019s minds to simple truths lurking in plain sight. Her choice of topics \u2014 from the trials and tribulations of navigating life with a 36DD bra size to the symbolism of ordering onions in Archie comics \u2014 showcases the ingenuity of her observations. Babitz may embrace pop culture, but she doesn\u2019t forsake the classics, mixing allusions to Colette, Igor Stravinsky and Henry James with Jim Morrisson, Rudolph Valentino and Arthur Murray. Flattening the hierarchy between highbrow and lowbrow, Babitz harks back to an earlier tradition of decadence without shame, while asserting that style, entertainment and intelligence are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThere\u2019s a freedom in these pieces that sends readers flipping to the end to double-check that, yes, these were crafted as articles destined for newspapers and magazines. Babitz dances freely from what is strictly business to the kind of personal scenes and candid asides that never seem to make it into print nowadays. \u201cAll This and The Godfather Too,\u201d arguably one of the best pieces in the collection, showcases this bygone style to perfection. Haunting the set of \u201cThe Godfather II\u201d on assignment, Babitz is granted now-unheard-of access to the production. She travels from the Hollywood soundstages to closed sets in Lake Tahoe to Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s offices in San Francisco to watch him cut five hours of footage into a three-hour movie. Along the way, she makes her on-screen debut as an extra and dishes on how \u201cthe huge old soundstages, the detailed sets, everything had to stop for one $10,000 hour because nobody thought to show Michael Gazzo where the commissary was.\u201d She manages to squeeze in a meditation on the lasting influence of Hollywood High alongside a critique of the \u201cghastly\u201d 1950s costumes and the disappointing spread from craft services.\n\nIronically, her talent for composing humorous work with airy asides makes it easy for the casual reader to dismiss her strength. Despite her near constant name-dropping and appreciation for insider antics, there is sincerity at the core of everything she describes. \u201cYou can find the transitory spirit of Los Angeles if you look carefully as you drive by so quickly, beyond the false fronts, the pancake makeup, and the sequins of your regrettable sister who\u2019s gone on the stage and captured everyone but you by a simple determination to sprawl indifferently out into the sunset,\u201d Babitz writes of her hometown. It\u2019s a sentiment that can be applied to Babitz, too.\n\nLauren Sarazen is a freelance writer based in Paris.\n\nI USED TO BE CHARMING\n\nThe Rest of Eve Babitz\n\nBy Eve Babitz\n\nNYRB Classics. 448 pp. $18.95\n\nAD", "description": "The collection of nonfiction writing arrives after a recent renewed interest in Babitz\u2019s work.", "authors": ["Lauren Sarazen"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fqgE4CLxL9G2KCPw_CDFFBlyzDk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HDCSI5W7XII6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
