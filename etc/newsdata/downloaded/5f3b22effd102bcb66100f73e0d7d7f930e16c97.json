You still have to pay off $4,000 within the first few months; the main difference is that the $95 annual fee is no longer waived for the first year.\n\nThis sign-up bonus is only available to new Chase Sapphire Preferred members and people who haven't received a membership bonus for at least 48 months. If you're a traveler who's been wondering if this card makes sense for you, here are some examples of how you can put the 60,000-point bonus to use for free flights.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nHow does the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card work?\n\nMany travel rewards credit cards partner with one airline. For example, the United Explorer Card will hook you up with flights through United Airlines, and the American Airlines AAdvantage MileUp\u2120 card only lets you apply those points to American Airlines flights.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred card, on the other hand, earns transferable points. The Chase Ultimate Rewards points it earns can be transferred to the loyalty programs of Chase's various travel partners, including United Airlines, JetBlue, and British Airways, just to name a few. This could make it easier (and maybe even cheaper) to find a flight than you might experience with other rewards programs.\n\n60,000 Chase points is equivalent to $750 of travel money, which can be used to book hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises, and of course, flights through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal.\n\nBy spending $1 with the card, you'll earn 1 Chase point. If you use the card to pay for designated travel purchases or at restaurants, you earn 2 points per dollar. When you look at your account, you'll see exactly how many miles you have, along with the corresponding amount in travel dollars.\n\nRead more: Chase Sapphire Preferred card review\n\nBooking flights for under 60,000 Chase points\n\nSure, you could accumulate tens of thousands of points over the years to book, say, three round-trip tickets from Los Angeles to Sydney. But where can you fly with 60,000 points from the Chase Sapphire Preferred card's sign-up bonus?\n\nYou could choose to book flights directly through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal, which you'll find after signing into your Chase account. When you redeem points from the Chase Sapphire Preferred this way, you'll get 1.25 cents per point toward travel (hence, 60,000 points equal $750 toward travel)\n\nHowever, the number of points you'll spend can differ depending on which day you buy and what time of year you travel. As a potential member, this makes it difficult to know ahead of time if you can pay for that dream trip to Italy with 60,000 travel points.\n\nRead more: The best Chase credit cards to open now\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards airline transfer partners\n\nThe alternative? From your Chase account, redeem your travel points with one of its airlines transfer partners. You can move your Chase points to airline partners at a 1:1 ratio, so one Chase points equals one mile with United, Singapore, and other partners.\n\nCertain airline partners, like Singapore Airlines and British Airways, have consistent rules about how many points you'll spend to fly to a certain destination, regardless of the date of purchase or time of year you fly. These strict numbers often result in your spending fewer points than if you went directly through Chase's portal to book a flight.\n\nAirline transfer partners can be confusing, and frankly, only some of them provide truly great deals. Let's look at some of the best deals for travelers flying economy. In some cases, you couldn't have booked these flights with the Sapphire Preferred card's original sign-up bonus of 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points.\n\nOne-way tickets for 60,000 Chase points or less\n\nNorth America to the UK and Ireland with British Airways\n\nWhen it comes to using travel points (or Avios, as they call it), British Airways charges you a number of points based on the distance between your original airport and the destination airport.\n\nFor example, the distance between New York (JFK) and London (LHR) is 3,440 miles. If you look at the chart, you'll see that this flight will cost you 20,750 Avios in economy.\n\nIf you book nonstop flights, it's definitely possible to pay for a round-trip ticket for under 60,000 points. However, many journeys to the UK and Ireland from America require at least one stop. In these cases, British Airways calculates the number of miles from point A to point B, then point B to point C, rather than directly from point A to point C. As a result, the number of miles is higher, and it can be hard to pay for a round-trip ticket with only 60,000 points.\n\nRead more: The best current credit card sign-up offers\n\nNorth America to the Middle East with Iberia Plus\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia Plus are both members of the Oneworld airline alliance, meaning their charts have a lot of similarities.\n\nThere are two main differences between the two partners. First, Iberia changes the number of points it charges depending on whether it's peak travel season or the off-season. Second, British Airways adds up the number of miles from destination to destination, which racks up points. But Iberia only considers the number of miles from point A to point C (or point D or E). This makes it much easier to book tickets to faraway places, such as the Middle East.\n\nNorth America to Southeast Asia with Singapore Airlines\n\nHave you long dreamt of backpacking around Southeast Asia? The Singapore Airlines redemption chart shows that 55,000 Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles will get you to Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, or Vietnam.\n\nRead more: Chase Sapphire Preferred vs. Sapphire Reserve \u2014 which credit card is best for you?\n\nNorth America to North Asia with Singapore Airlines\n\nSpend 48,000 KrisFlyer miles to fly one-way to Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan.
