REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe pound enjoyed its best week since 2017 last week after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar said they could see \u201ca pathway\u201d for an agreement for Britain to leave the European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nSome of that optimism has since ebbed as London and Brussels still have widely differing positions, days before crucial Oct 17-18 talks.\n\nWhile Brexit has cast a cloud over world markets since the June 2016 referendum resulted in a narrow win for Leave, some assets are particularly sensitive to headlines and will show an outsized reaction, whatever the outcome of the talks.\n\nFollowing is a graphical tour of just what\u2019s in play as the Brexit endgame commences:\n\nSILVER AND GILT\n\nSterling\u2019s exchange rate has been by far the most sensitive price to Brexit newsflow. And once again last week, Brexit optimism drove the biggest two-day pound rise in over 10 years. A negotiated deal will likely send the pound into the \u201clow 1.30s\u201d, JPMorgan says. UBS Wealth Management expects a rise to $1.35. Reuters polls predict sterling between $1.27-$1.34 if a hard Brexit is avoided but a \u201cworst case\u201d outcome of no deal will see it between $1.10 and $1.19, the poll showed.\n\nTwo respondents predicted parity with the dollar.\n\nRecent sterling gains rippled into derivatives markets, with one-month risk reversals - a ratio of bullish to bearish bets on sterling - flipping into positive territory for the first time this year and indicating a washout of negative bets. It\u2019s been positive only three times since the 2016 vote.\n\nA sterling move up would also upend excessive \u2018short\u2019 sterling bets on futures; Reuters calculations show net short bets for the pound are still nearly double their historical five-year average.\n\nGRAPHIC: Sterling near three-month high - here\n\nGRAPHIC: Sterling options - here\n\nGRAPHIC: GBP Positions - here\n\nHOME AND ABROAD\n\nSome of the biggest winners from a Brexit deal will be shares in companies that earn their living from the UK economy. Unloved for years, an index of such shares soared on Friday, rising more than the blue-chip FTSE benchmark for the first time since May.\n\nThe index, compiled by JPMorgan and tracking about 30 stocks that make all or most of their revenue in the UK, soared almost 8% for its best day since the grouping was created nearly three years ago. House builders such as Persimmon and Barrett, as well as domestic banks Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, drove the rally.\n\nSince May, the index has languished at a discount to the FTSE-100 as fears grew of a disorderly EU exit that would inflict huge damage on the British economy. The markdown widened after Johnson took over as prime minister.\n\nOn Friday, though, the index outshone the internationally focused FTSE 100 by 4.4% . To put Friday\u2019s moves into context, RBS\u2019s 11% surge was the biggest move in either direction since June 24, 2016, the day after the referendum.\n\nGRAPHIC: Brexit shocks and stock moves - here\n\nGRAPHIC: UK domestic stocks vs exporters - here\n\nMONEY MARKETS\n\nA no-deal outcome would likely force the Bank of England to cut interest rates to shore up the economy but last week\u2019s optimism washed out money market bets on a rate cut in March. No cuts are now expected until December and a Brexit deal may dampen that possibility too.\n\nAn orderly Brexit would also reduce pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates and might also boost the euro. Money market futures have trimmed chances of an ECB cut in December to 20% from 40% early last week.\n\nGRAPHIC: Britain yield curve - here\n\nBOND BULLS TAMED - OR NOT\n\nBrexit clarity would go a long way to removing some of the entrenched pessimism that has swept a whole swathe of the euro zone government bond market into negative yield territory.\n\nBrexit jitters have not only boosted demand for safe-haven German or U.S. debt but also fuelled economic growth worries in the bloc - the UK is Germany\u2019s fifth largest export destination.\n\nNo wonder then that bond yields in Germany - viewed as a proxy for the euro area - have tracked sterling closely in recent months. Goldman Sachs predicts a near-term Brexit resolution could send British bond yields at least 20 basis points higher and push up German and U.S. Treasury yields by 10bps and 5 bps respectively.\n\nJPMorgan told clients its \u2018overweight\u2019 in euro zone debt would benefit from any Sino-U.S. trade deal as well as from a Brexit agreement.\n\nGRAPHIC: Germany's 10-year bond yield vs Britain's pound - here\n\nWILL IRISH EYES BE SMILING?\n\nNo euro zone country has a higher stake in Brexit than Ireland. Not only is Britain Ireland\u2019s largest trading partner but its border with the British province of Northern Ireland has been the thorniest issue in Brexit negotiations. A disorderly Brexit risks a return to the violence that plagued border areas for decades before 1998.\n\n\u201cOne of the things you can observe is that when risks of no -deal Brexit rise, Ireland tends to underperform,\u201d said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe government has pledged 1.2 billion euros to alleviate the effects of a no-deal Brexit, allowing its budget to go into deficit. No wonder then that Friday\u2019s positive Brexit noises pushed ten-year government bond yields 10 bps lower. Its spread over Germany - effectively the yield premium investors demand to hold Irish debt - is at 144 bps, the tightest since late-July.\n\nIrish stocks likewise jumped 4% on Friday with bank shares rising as much as 11%.\n\nGRAPHIC: Ireland's 10-year bond yield gap over Germany - here\n\nGRAPHIC: Irish shares rallied last week - here\n\nEASTERN EXPOSURE\n\nBrexit will reverberate in eastern Europe too. With 900,000 nationals living in the UK, Poles are Britain\u2019s biggest immigrant group, sending home a billion euros a year in remittances. Britain is also Poland\u2019s second-biggest export market; Warsaw runs an annual trade surplus with the UK of just over 8 billion euros.\n\nNo wonder the zloty plunged as much as 4.7% against the euro and 9 per cent against the dollar on the day after the referendum.\n\nHungary and the Czech Republic are exposed to British demand for vehicles, with 0.2% and 0.35 of their respective GDP linked to \u2018value added\u2019 exports to the UK, ING Bank calculated late last year.\n\nThe longer-term threat is what Brexit means for the 2021-27 EU budget. Britain contributes around 6 percent of the budget and its departure will see average EU GDP per capita levels decline. That will push incomes in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary above the EU average and may spell cuts to their funding.\n\nGRAPHIC: Europe's economic dependency on the UK - here", "description": "Sterling, British bank shares and even German and Irish government bonds are some of financial prices most sensitive to the ebb and flow of Brexit developments as the long-running saga enters a crucial week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440781633&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1CH", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
