Authorities in Tehran denied the accusation.\n\nThe Houthis previously claimed responsibility for the attack which left two refineries owned by state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in flames.\n\nThe senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were 19 points of impact in the attack on Saudi facilities. The damage signaled the attack came from the west-northwest direction of Iraq and Iran and not south from Yemen.\n\nSaudi officials indicated that evidence suggested cruise missiles were used in the attack, the official said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate,\" the official told reporters, according to Reuters.\n\nRead more: The world's largest oil plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked ahead Aramco's plans for the biggest IPO ever\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran shortly after the attacks were reported, saying on Twitter that it was \"an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.\" He also called on other nations to publicly condemn Iran for the attacks, as the US will work to make sure \"Iran is held accountable for its aggression.\"\n\nThe kingdom produces 9.8 million barrels of crude oil a day. The Khurais oilfield, the area that was identified in the strike, produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility that can process 7% of the global supply, according to BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott.\n\nThe strike was expected to send oil prices from $5 to $10 per barrel on Monday.\n\nThe latest incident has apparently re-ignited US-Iran tensions after a string of troubling incidents in recent months nearly triggered armed conflict between the two countries. Iran was previously blamed by Saudi Arabia and the US for attacks on two oil tankers in June and July, which authorities in Tehran denied.\n\nNOW WATCH: 7 secrets about Washington, DC landmarks you probably didn't know", "description": "A senior US official told Reuters the attack on two Saudi oil facilities appears to have come from the direction of Iran, not the Yemeni Houthi group that claimed it.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/REk7P.Qk30Z._pYxl5eKTQ--~B/aD04NzY7dz0xMTY4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/d06f0cd04cc626ded6352c75f5fdcd56", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
