It dominated runways in every single city; it became so ubiquitous that it was almost a clich\u00e9.\n\nForget street wear. Sustainability was the hottest look of the day.\n\nIt started in New York on Sept. 10, when Gabriela Hearst unveiled what she said was the first carbon-neutral fashion show, which also featured upcycled prints from old collections. That was the same day the British Fashion Council introduced its Institute of Positive Fashion, which aims to create a coalition that will set standards for green businesses.\n\nTwo days later Gucci announced that its show, too, would be carbon neutral, and it would also offset all carbon emissions from its operations and supply chain.\n\nIn Milan, Missoni handed out little solar powered sun lights by Olafur Eliasson during its show, and the Green Carpet Awards capped off the city\u2019s shows on Sept. 22, touting \u201cthe best in sustainable fashion.\u201d", "description": "Every brand wants to win.
