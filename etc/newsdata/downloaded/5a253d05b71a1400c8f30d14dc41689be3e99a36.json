It is, as Carmody says, chasing the symptoms rather than the underlying causes.\n\nMeanwhile, Labor has offered voters even deeper emissions cuts, but no insight into the costs.\n\nA new generation of voters sees a global problem and wants to be part of solving it.\n\nAustralian politicians have a history of pretending away problems and hoping that something will turn up to get them off the hook. Sometimes it works, but it is a shoddy and risky game, and this time the stakes for the economy are high. Moreover, global politics is likely to make it untenable.\n\nDonald Trump may have rejected the United States\u2019 Paris commitments, but the trajectory of climate politics in the US and the other advanced economies is clear: a new generation of voters sees a global problem and wants to be part of solving it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new climate politics is coming, and when the US Congress decides to take climate change more seriously, it will insist that America\u2019s trading partners do the same.\n\nWhat is Canberra\u2019s game plan for when it does? One problem with misleading the public about the cost of renewable energy is that it creates a political barrier to cutting emissions. Voters happily agree to emissions reduction when their prime minister tells them it will be costless, but then reel back in horror when they see the true price.\n\nGovernments need to be honest\n\nThat was the lesson of Julia Gillard\u2019s mismanagement of her emissions trading scheme. Australia\u2019s middle-class voters were told there would be a carbon price, but Gillard never quite got around to making it clear that they, and not \u201cbig business\u201d, would be paying it. It blew up in her face, just as a similar stunt by Germany\u2019s politicians had blown up in their faces. Now Morrison and Labor are repeating the error.\n\nWhat is needed is a rigorously honest acknowledgement by Australia\u2019s political leaders of the costs and benefits of shifting the economy to low or zero-emission energy.\n\nThe IMF recommends that governments impose carbon prices because they are one of the least costly ways of curbing emissions. A carbon price high enough to meet Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions target would have to be on a consumption base (that is, include imports but exclude exports) to preserve the country\u2019s competitiveness.\n\nNo one said it would be easy. But If the public understands the nature of the challenge, it might be prepared to entertain a coherent, systematic response.\n\nMaybe a \u201cfact-based\u201d inquiry, like the one announced for retirement income, would help start a rational debate.", "description": "Successive governments have never been honest with voters about the real cost and benefits of climate policy.
