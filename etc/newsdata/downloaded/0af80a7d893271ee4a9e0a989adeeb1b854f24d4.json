I remember her lifting her school skirt up and these horrible black bruises were inside her thighs.\n\nGill Britt arrived at the murderers' house in Gloucester (pictured with a policeman outside in 1994) as a rebellious 17-year-old in 1978\n\n'Straight away she made it quite clear that people were doing this to her.\n\n'In hindsight, at 17, I would never got my head round it but as I've grown up and had children and had life experience.\n\n'I know that I know that those injuries were inflicted in a very abusive way.'\n\nMs Britt says the youngster was just 13 when she first showed her her injuries.\n\nAnne Marie West suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her murderous parents from the age of eight.\n\nShe would eventually escape their clutches with the help of her boyfriend Chris Davis in 1985 and would go on to testify against her parents in court.\n\nWhen she left 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester she was still unaware Fred and Rose had murdered her mother Rena and her two sisters. They were only caught in 1994.\n\nSpeaking to journalist Howard Sounes on the podcast she detailled life at the so-called 'House of Horrors' when she lived there as a rebel punk rocker teen.\n\nShe said: 'There was a lot of he shouting, a lot of effing and b'ing going on and calling the children effing b***** and so on.'\n\nNow aged 58, Ms Britt says it wasn't until the Wests' daughter Anne Marie (pictured in 2011) knocked on her door with 'horrific' bruises that she realised the extent of their sadistic, violent ways.\n\nThe presenter asked her if she knew the Wests were abusing their children, to which she replied: 'You would hear it, it was pretty obvious, you would hear her shouting out or she would be chasing them in some way it sounded like that.\n\n'You could hear her rowing with them and you hear crying or them shouting 'oww' or 'get off' and this kind of thing\n\n'We never heard Fred's raised voice, sometimes you would look at Fred when you heard Rose's and his eyes would go up into his head and mine would go up into my head and you would just walk away so he was quite aware that she was shouting and moaning, swearing and using obscene language.'\n\nRose West was convicted of 10 murders in 1995 and remains behind bars after it was ordered she would spend the rest of her life in prison.\n\nFred West killed himself at Winson Green prison in Birmingham in January 1995 while awaiting trial.\n\nRose, 65, was reportedly moved from Low Newton in County Durham to another jail over fears for her safety.\n\nThe move was made after murderer Joanna Dennehy, 35, threatened to kill her 'in a bid to become top dog' at the women's prison.", "description": "Gill Britt arrived at Fred and Rose West's house in Gloucester as a rebellious 17-year-old in 1978.
