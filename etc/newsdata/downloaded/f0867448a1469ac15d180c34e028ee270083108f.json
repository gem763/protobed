The tanks have been put in strategic areas, Bath said.\n\n\"These tanks are filled twice daily, but it is still not enough as there are many private residences and government institutions in the area.\"\n\nRand Water has threatened to throttle the water supply to about 90% if an acceptable payment plan is not presented.\n\nAn official at the municipality, who did not want to be named, told News24 that the municipality was trying to get R7m to settle this month's water account.\n\nThe municipality did not respond to written questions sent to them by News24.\n\nGeorge Mthethwa of the Department of Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs said a meeting between the MEC, the municipality and Rand Water would be held on Thursday.", "description": "The Victor Khanye Local Municipality in Mpumalanga, which provides services to Delmas, Sundra, Eloff and Rietkol, has missed its deadline for the payment of R111m in outstanding debt to Rand Water.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4648/7f68fd09855a42e282ac2781fa72419e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
