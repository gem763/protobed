They've had the best preparation according to the coach, so they'd better go out there and win, if that's the best possible preparation. We'll see how we go.'\n\nSince Jones took charge of England, they have maintained a perfect record against the Wallabies.\n\nEngland have left Tokyo for Miyazaki as Typhoon Hagibis approaches the southeast of Japan\n\nSix times his team have taken on his compatriots and six times they have beaten them, with the highlight being a 3-0 series whitewash Down Under in June 2016. However, when pressed on that bad-omen record, Cheika said: 'I don't know the relevance of it.\n\n'I don't really care, to be honest because the only relevance is Saturday. That's pretty much about it. It doesn't matter, all those different things; who's had a week off, who's had a week on, who's been resting, who hasn't. It's going to come down to who is ready at kick-off.'\n\nEngland are regrouping here in the far south of Japan after evacuating Tokyo once they had learned that 'Le Crunch' was off - and prior to the arrival of the incoming, 'violent' super typhoon which is expected to cause widespread devastation.\n\nOn Saturday, Jones's squad will return to training and he is hopeful that most of his 31 players will be available to take part.\n\nBilly Vunipola is attempting to recover hurriedly after twisting his ankle in the bonus-point win over Argentina a week ago.\n\nEngland have a perfect record against the Wallabies since Jones took over as their coach\n\nThe Saracens No 8 was unlikely to feature against France, but the England management will be desperate for him to regain full fitness in time to lead the ball-carrying charge against Australia. His participation must be considered in doubt, pending further updates.\n\nJoe Marler and Jack Nowell are the other two members of the Red Rose squad who were unable to take part in training last week, while captain Owen Farrell was struck down by illness, but had come through it and was expected to start against France, before the fixture was dramatically called off.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones has caused a stir in Australia by inviting Canberra Raiders rugby league coach Ricky Stuart into the England camp for quarter-final week.\n\nAlthough Stuart has explained that the collaboration will allow him to gain insight from an experienced coaching figure in the 15-man code, there is concern Down Under that he will also provide insight which will aid the English cause against his countrymen.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN MIYAZAKI:  Eddie Jones's national team will have a long build-up to the match after their clash with France was cancelled, due to the impending arrival of typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19601072-0-image-a-28_1570816386986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
