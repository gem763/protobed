And as a result, over the past three years, we\u2019ve watched Todd beg then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to impeach Trump, and then use BuzzFeed\u2019s fake news to assure us Trump\u2019s impeachment was guaranteed, and then break the North American speed record for spreading four lies in under a minute, and then completely buy into the Russia Collusion Hoax, and then, and then, and then, and then\u2026\n\nBasically, Trump broke Chuck Todd. In just a few short years, he went from being one of the smartest analysts on TV, to an afterthought, an asterisk; just another dishonest, left-wing operative with a TV hour to shriek about protecting \u201cour precious norms,\u201d even as he violates every journalistic norm to get Drumpf.\n\nThis Ukraine thing, though, has unglued Todd. He\u2019s entered the face-melting stage, which began last week with this bizarre rant about how Trump is destroying democracy n\u2019 stuff:\n\nI don\u2019t say this lightly. Let\u2019s be frank, a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It\u2019s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival\u2026 This is arguably a national emergency. The Founding Fathers would consider it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full video. It\u2019s hilarious.\n\nWhat this is really about, though, is Todd\u2019s emotional unraveling as the Ukraine Hoax unravels, and if you thought his \u201cdestroying democracy\u201d panic attack was unhinged, watch Todd have a Sunday tantrum because Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) dares to talk about the Democrats\u2019 documented collusion with Ukraine and Russia to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. Here\u2019s the full video. Todd\u2019s like a mailman about to run amok.\n\nBelieve it or not, that was not Todd\u2019s worst moment Sunday. Watch the below clip of him with Obama\u2019s CIA chief John Brennan, watch Todd nearly breakdown, watch how he can hardly control the shattered emotion in his voice:\n\n\u2014\n\nChuck Todd nearly sheds a tear because John Brennan \u2014 one of the originators of the collusion lie \u2014 is criticized You know who \u201ctotally fabricates information to advance his political agenda\u201d? Brennan! pic.twitter.com/2gowBLT7ZJ \u2014 Elizabeth Harrington (@LizRNC) October 7, 2019\n\n\u2014\n\nSo here\u2019s why I think Todd is unraveling.\n\nJust to be clear, this is a guess on my part, I have no inside-inside info, but I got the Russia Collusion Hoax correct from day one, so at least hear me here\u2026\n\nWeeks and weeks ago, Chuck Todd, his confederates in the elite media, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) were all certain they had the smoking gun to impeach Trump.\n\nWe know Schiff knew about this phony whistleblower complaint well in advance, and my guess is that Schiff helped to write the thing in a way where it could only lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal. It is no stretch, then, to assume if Schiff knew about the phony whistleblower in advance, all of his pals in the media, like Todd, also knew.\n\nMy guess is that Schiff oversold what he had to the media, promised them Trump would be caught red-handed withholding U.S. aid if the Ukrainians refused to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nI also believe Chuck Todd, Jake Tapper, and the usual-usual Deep State bootlickers at the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, and NBC News, all strategized with Schiff (and each other) to roll the whistleblower news out in the most damaging way possible. It was an on obvious shock and awe campaign. That was not by accident.\n\nSo imagine you\u2019re Chuck Todd, and for weeks you\u2019ve known for a fact that you Got The Goods On The Bad Orange Man This Time. And then\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t because the transcript of the call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president was a big, fat zero; a bust, a nothingburger served on a nothingbun.\n\nSo here you are\u2026 The same Chuck Todd who bought all of Schiff\u2019s lies about the Russia Collusion Hoax, and you have egg all over your frustrated face again because you bought his lies again. Instead of being a journalist, you let Schiff sucker you \u2014 again \u2014 into being a stenographer for the Democrat Party and the Intelligence Community. Yep, once again, you allowed your partisan wish-casting to get in the way of your integrity and professionalism.\n\nWorse still \u2014 at least if you\u2019re a Chuck Todd \u2014 it\u2019s all backfiring. The only person getting killed politically by the Ukraine Hoax is Joe Biden, the best shot you had at unseating Trump.\n\nThe Ukraine Hoax is burying Biden.\n\nHe\u2019s lost his lead to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who will be much easier for Trump to beat in 2020, and polls show that 57 percent of Americans want Biden\u2019s Ukraine scandal investigated by the Department of Justice.\n\nAs far as Trump, all the Ukraine Hoax did was unite the Republican Party and boost Trump\u2019s fundraising to unheard of highs.\n\nLet me put it this way\u2026\n\nThe Ukraine Hoax is unraveling so badly they are now trotting out a second whistleblower hoping for a do-over. Yes, the Julie Swetnick of this particular hoax is warming up in the bullpen.\n\nAnd so, we\u2019re finally at the point in the Roadrunner cartoon where Wile E. Chuckola grabs a hammer and starts pounding on his own head.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
