(AP) - The judge didn\u2019t mince words when it came time to sentence five North Carolina men in an illegal dogfighting operation that involved more than 150 pit bulls.\n\n\u201cEither the dogs have to be eliminated from the world or the people who fight the dogs or both, but there needs to be an intervention by the law and it\u2019s going to start here,\u201d U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle said.\n\nThe men are now using the judge\u2019s words to appeal their sentences, arguing that he should have taken himself off the case because of his \u201cdeep-seated antagonism\u201d toward people who engage in dogfighting and the pit bull breed itself.\n\nThe 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in the case Wednesday.\n\nThe five men were among a group charged in a sweeping indictment alleging various dogfighting and drug-trafficking offenses. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act and at least one other charge.\n\nBoyle handed down sentences ranging from a little under four years to nine years.\n\nDuring their sentencing hearings, Boyle made multiple statements the men\u2019s lawyers say show that his strong personal feelings about dogfighting interfered with his duty to remain impartial.\n\nAt various points, Boyle characterized people who engage in dogfighting as mentally ill and belonging to the \u201cStone Age.\u201d\n\n\u201cParticipation in this is a manifestation of some form of mental illness. If you treat animals in a barbaric and cruel and torturous way, then there\u2019s something wrong with you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge also offered his opinion about pit bulls, noting that the dogs are often bred by humans for fighting and are known for having aggressive temperaments.\n\n\u201cThere is no good aspect of them in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the breed needs to be reduced and eliminated.\u201d\n\nFour of the men\u2019s sentences exceeded federal sentencing guidelines. Boyle sentenced a fifth man, Lewis Edmond Andrews Jr., at the top of the sentencing range: nine years in prison. In addition to a dogfighting charge, Andrews also pleaded guilty to distributing heroin and aiding and abetting.\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to comment. They argue in court documents that the sentences were appropriate for the criminal conduct the men admitted to when they pleaded guilty. Federal sentencing guidelines are advisory only; judges are allowed to go above or below the guideline range, based on the circumstances of the case.\n\nProsecutors said more than 150 dogs were used in the dogfighting operation. When investigative teams searched the homes of four of the defendants, they found break sticks used to pry open dogs\u2019 jaws, canine treadmills, weighted collars, whips, heavy training chains, steroids and other medical supplies. Many of the dogs had injuries and had to be euthanized.\n\n\u201cThe court communicated its belief that regular, law-abiding people do not enjoy the blood spectacle of two dogs brutally attacking each other, sometimes for hours,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a legal brief filed with the 4th Circuit.\n\n\u201cWhen the judge\u2019s remarks are considered collectively and in context, it is clear that the judge was simply expressing the well-supported view that animal fighting is a gruesome activity that Congress has decided has no place in society,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBut lawyers for the men argue that Boyle\u2019s sentencing decisions \u201cwere driven by his emotions about dogfighting and his view that those participating in it were unredeemable barbarians.\u201d\n\nJoseph Gilbert, an attorney who represents Andrews in his appeal, said he and lawyers for the other men believe Boyle\u2019s comments during the sentencing hearings demonstrate that he should have disqualified himself.\n\n\u201cEvery judge has an obligation to recuse himself or herself whenever they feel so strongly about an issue that it might affect their ability to objectively and fairly hear the case,\u201d Gilbert told The Associated Press.\n\nUnder his plea agreement, Andrews waived his right to appeal any sentence within the guideline range. But his lawyer said Boyle\u2019s personal feelings about dogfighting made the sentencing process defective, which should prevent enforcement of his agreement to waive his appeal.\n\nBoyle\u2019s past comments from the bench have also sparked controversy.\n\nIn 2017, the 4th Circuit reversed the immigration fraud conviction of an Algerian native who entered the U.S. through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which offers green cards to citizens of countries with historically low rates of immigration to the U.S.\n\nThe 4th Circuit found that during the man\u2019s trial, Boyle expressed skepticism about the program and a \u201cnegative impression\u201d of people who participate in it.\n\nThe court found that Boyle\u2019s \u201cjudicial intervention\u201d was \u201cimproper,\u201d denying the man the opportunity for a fair and impartial trial.\n\nDefense lawyers in the dogfighting case may have a difficult time persuading the 4th Circuit to order new sentencing hearings, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.\n\nTurley said recusal is a decision largely left up to individual judges.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty for the defendants is not just the recusal case law, but the stage at which these comments were made,\u201d Turley said.\n\n\u201cThe greatest danger is when there is a question of bias during a trial or during the finding of critical facts. In this case, the defendants admitted their guilt.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The judge didn't mince words when it came time to sentence five North Carolina men in an illegal dogfighting operation that involved more than 150 pit bulls.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Denise Lavoie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/dogfighting_judge_32093_c0-576-1456-1424_s1770x1032.jpg?3edb69ca996f35d2ace7f74eb212b83c342baf24", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
