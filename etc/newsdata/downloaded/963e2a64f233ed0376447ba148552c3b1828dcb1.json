He was forced to leave his job in the White House and had other positions taken away from him, including his running of Breitbart.com. But I argued in The Daily Beast in 2018 that it would be a folly to write his obituary.\n\nNo, the White House has not invited him to return, but Bannon is determined to help Trump weather the impeachment storm and win in 2020. To implement this strategy, Bannon and two associates, Jason Miller, former communications director of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and Raheem Kassam, a former editor at Breitbart, are broadcasting on a small Virginia radio network run by John Frederick.\n\nBannon\u2019s voice can now be heard as well on \u201cWar Room: Impeachment\u201d as a podcast, on which you can hear all the programs, including the one each day that is broadcast live from 9 to 10 a.m. He is presently negotiating with other radio stations to run the program. They will broadcast daily until Trump\u2019s trial in the Senate is over.", "description": "The alt-right acid-flinger is back on the radio, trying to help re-elect the man who fired him.
