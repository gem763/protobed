It will also pose a political dilemma ahead of the 2020 election for lawmakers of both parties running in closely contested districts, mindful that this vote will be viewed as a proxy vote for the larger question of impeaching Trump.\n\nThe announcement from Democrats underscored that Pelosi has the votes for the resolution; she rarely embarks on a roll call without knowing the outcome. It also suggests the next phase of the probe \u2014 with high-profile witnesses called to testify in open session \u2014 could push a vote on whether to impeach Trump into December.\n\nFor weeks, Trump and Republicans have derided the inquiry as illegitimate while railing against the process. The White House insisted in an Oct. 8 letter that the fact that the House had not formally voted was grounds not to cooperate in the probe, although neither the Constitution nor House rules required such a vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPelosi\u2019s decision to hold a vote prompted the White House to claim vindication \u2014 with no mention of whether it would now provide the documents and witnesses the House repeatedly has requested.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nThe president\u2019s top allies in Congress immediately criticized the vote, with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) saying the Democrats\u2019 appeal to transparency is \u201crich \u2014 considering they\u2019ve spent weeks conducting interviews in secret, leaking their own talking points while locking down any and all information that benefits the president.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans coordinated their response and argued that the planned vote underscored that the process was flawed, according to GOP officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly.\n\nDemocrats said the move to formalize the impeachment inquiry marks a new phase in the investigation, reflecting the drumbeat of revelations made by witnesses who have largely corroborated the whistleblower complaint that launched the probe.\n\nThe whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office by requesting investigations by Ukraine into his political opponents. The complaint also mentioned that nearly $400 million in congressionally appropriated military assistance and diplomatic support had been delayed. The White House has at times denied any notion of a quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said the House resolution would establish that his committee will conduct the open hearings, further solidifying his role as the Democrats\u2019 point person. Republicans have complained the probe should be led by the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over the State Department.\n\nAD\n\nThe resolution also would ensure that any evidence or a report would be provided to the Judiciary Committee, which would vote on articles of impeachment before sending them to the full House.\n\n\u201cThe American people will hear firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nA member of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said the vote \u2014 and the move by Democrats to open the process \u2014 makes the Republican argument \u201cmoot the minute people see a witness taking the stand.\u201d But he was unsure it will matter in the long run to his GOP colleagues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI truly expect this to be like Lucy and the football in regard to their process concerns \u2014 they\u2019ll just say this is not enough because they can\u2019t accept\u201d the evidence against the president, he said.\n\nWord of the vote came as the investigation hit a new roadblock, with former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman failing to show for his deposition Monday. Kupperman had asked a federal judge to referee a constitutional dispute between the House and the Trump administration over whether he should testify.\n\nAD\n\nKupperman\u2019s lawsuit threatened to slow down the probe and could affect the House\u2019s ability to secure testimony from his former boss, onetime national security adviser John Bolton, who has retained the same lawyer as Kupperman.\n\nAD\n\nMany Democrats argue that Bolton could be a star witness after several individuals testified that he was furious that Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was directing a shadow policy for Ukraine.\n\nBut instead of waiting for courts to resolve the standoff, Democrats are pivoting to a new strategy and seeking to bring in lower-ranking government officials they hope can corroborate previous testimony alleging a quid pro quo. In recent days, they have fired off new letters requesting testimony from Robert Blair, a senior adviser to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; two officials with experience at the Energy Department, Brian McCormack and Wells Griffith; and two State Department officials familiar with Ukraine policy, Catherine Croft and Chris Anderson, according to three people familiar with the proceedings. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe private deliberations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts,\u201d Schiff said Monday.\n\nAD\n\nIn a major victory for Democrats, an attorney for White House senior director for Europe and Russia, Tim Morrison, said Monday that her client would testify if summoned by House investigators.\n\n\u201cIf subpoenaed, my client will appear,\u201d attorney Barbara Van Gelder said in a statement.\n\nMorrison was a key figure in the testimony provided by Ambassador William B. Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, last week. Taylor laid out a day-to-day timeline about how Giuliani took over Ukraine policy from official channels. Taylor said Morrison told him in early September that military aid for Ukraine was being held up until Ukrainian leaders agreed to publicly commit to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his family, as well as a conspiracy theory regarding the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016. Taylor later raised these concerns to senior Trump officials deputized to run Ukraine policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Morrison confirms Taylor\u2019s account, it could undercut a chief Republican complaint about the witnesses so far: that their most damning information comes from secondhand accounts.\n\nDemocratic leaders have already committed to casting the refusal by Kupperman and any others as the president obstructing Congress and thus justice \u2014 a charge that is expected to be an article of impeachment.\n\nDemocrats are not expected to call every witness who has appeared before the committee for a closed-door deposition to testify in a public hearing, but instead feature the officials whose testimony they believe presents the most compelling narrative. Thus far, Democrats have all but settled on Taylor and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch as witnesses who could sell the story to the nation.\n\nBut neither Yovanovitch nor Taylor directly interacted with the president \u2014 leaving them open to criticism from Republicans, who have denounced their most damning assertions as mere hearsay.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s always people who have talked to people who have talked to other people who think that he might have meant this,\u201d Meadows said Monday.\n\nDemocrats have countered that they already have direct evidence of the president\u2019s alleged crimes in the form of the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asks the Ukrainian president to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d when he raises the subject of still-undelivered military aid. They also point to Mulvaney\u2019s public statements acknowledging that military aid to Ukraine was being held up to secure politically advantageous investigations \u2014 an assertion he later attempted to walk back in a written statement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming evidence of the president\u2019s shakedown against Ukraine. We don\u2019t need legally to prove a quid pro quo, but the evidence is very strong as to a quid pro quo, and essentially the president\u2019s chief of staff confessed to that on national television,\u201d Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) said Monday.\n\nYet privately, some Democrats admit that their case would likely be bolstered further by Bolton\u2019s testimony. Schiff said Monday he believes the courts will rule in their favor. But the question is when.\n\nDemocratic leaders have officially committed to pursue the probe \u201cexpeditiously\u201d \u2014 a phrase rank-and-file members and staffers translate to mean that they are committed to wrap up their proceedings by the end of 2019, so as not to let impeachment bleed into the 2020 campaign season.\n\nTo date, Democrats have been successful in the courts: In recent weeks, rulings have validated House Democrats\u2019 demands for the president\u2019s financial records and the grand jury information that informed former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But both took months to advance through legal proceedings \u2014 time the House Democrats don\u2019t have to wait for Bolton and his deputies.\n\nThere is nothing preventing House Democrats from sliding Bolton into the order of public witnesses at the last minute without first engaging in a private deposition. Even if he misses the House process, there is also nothing officially preventing House Democrats from introducing Bolton as a witness before the Senate, during a likely impeachment trial.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the vote on a resolution, slated for Thursday, would affirm the existing probe and establish the scope of the next phase of the investigation.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ybE3k9tZ5yeQ9vTlJaE4gtcjtVY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UQ4LSVHZ2UI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
