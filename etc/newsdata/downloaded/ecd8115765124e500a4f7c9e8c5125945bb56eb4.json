But it\u2019s still quite trendy \u2013 the wine bars and small plates restaurants of East London are awash with the stuff.\n\nOrange wine can be expensive but it\u2019s definitely worth trying if you haven\u2019t before; in many ways, it combines the best qualities of both red and white.\n\nSince it\u2019s National Orange Wine Day today, here\u2019s a guide \u2013 reading this should help you avoid humiliating yourself if you ever need to impress someone who knows about wine.\n\nIt\u2019s got nothing to do with oranges\n\nGet that ludicrous notion out of your head right away \u2013 oranges aren\u2019t used in the production whatsoever, nor do orange wines taste particularly citrusy (although they are often quite sour).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name is derived entirely from that fact that the colour is orange, which makes sense.\n\nIt\u2019s been around for ages\n\nOrange wine was first made made nearly 6,000 years ago, in Eastern Europe, so it\u2019s hardly a new trend. It has, however, seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years.\n\nThis has happened alongside the rise of natural wine (wine produced organically, without additives). Orange wines aren\u2019t natural by definition, but most of them are.\n\nIt has a couple of other names\n\nOrange wine is also commonly referred to as \u2018amber\u2019 or \u2018romato\u2019 which means auburn in Italian. But don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 they\u2019re all the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s basically like if you tried to make red wine with white grapes\n\nWhen you\u2019re making white wine, you typically remove the skin from the grapes before fermenting; with red wine, you leave the skin on.\n\nOrange wine mixes up this process by using white grapes but leaving on the skins.\n\nThe result is a far richer and more full-bodied drink than regular white wine.This is also how it gets its colour.\n\nDon\u2019t serve it too cold or too warm\n\nBefitting its status as a hybrid between red and white wine (arguably more so than ros\u00e9), it\u2019s best served somewhere between chilled and room temperature. Wine experts recommend somewhere around 12\u00b0C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should pair it with spicy food\n\nBecause orange wine has such a strong flavour, it works well with hot foods including Indian, Moroccan and Ethiopian.\n\nMORE: This is why you should be pairing white wine with cheese\n\nMORE: Drinking red wine is good for your gut health, says study\n\nMORE: Woman\u2019s friends rescue white outfit when someone spills wine over her \u2013 by covering it in more wine\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "On National Orange Wine Day, a guide to how old orange wine is, how it's made, and how you should drink it.", "authors": ["James Greig"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88667960_1570374635.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
