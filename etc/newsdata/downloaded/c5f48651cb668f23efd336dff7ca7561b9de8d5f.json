Maryland has a throne of towels.", "language": "en", "text": "Fleet-Davis, the mastermind behind the idea, had noticed an abundance of Gatorade-branded towels that clutter the sideline during the game. He gave those towels a purpose. Fleet-Davis laid them across the bench, creating a comfy spot to sit. It\u2019s called the G Seat, a homage to the towels and the celebratory drink. Once the scorer arrives, his teammates drape towels over him, tucking them into the front and back of his jersey or tossing them across his legs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs if you're wearing a cape,\u201d Fleet-Davis said. \u201cWrap you up like a mummy maybe.\u201d\n\nSometimes teammates fan the scorer with towels, too. You\u2019re supposed to feel like a king, said McFarland, whom Fleet-Davis credited for naming the seat.\n\n\u201cYou sit down, enjoy your touchdown and sip on Gatorade,\u201d Fleet-Davis said.\n\nWhen McFarland scored later in the game, this time on an 80-yard run, he sat in the G Seat and squirted two bottles of Gatorade into his mouth at once.\n\nTwo seasons ago, the Miami Hurricanes started a wave of flashy but fun celebrations when they unveiled the Turnover Chain, an oversized gold necklace. Cornerback Malek Young grabbed an interception in the season opener, the chain slid over his head and a national trend was born.\n\nAD\n\nSideline props have long existed in college football, but Miami\u2019s 2017 rendition prompted the rapid creation of spinoff celebrations featuring robes, thrones, backpacks and spiked shoulder pads. Many accompany turnovers, but for now, Maryland\u2019s version celebrates touchdowns and doesn\u2019t require any unusual items. Since Fleet-Davis\u2019s idea came to him midgame, he stuck with what he could find on the sideline.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJust like anybody else has got their own little thing going on in college,\u201d McFarland said and then referenced Miami\u2019s Turnover Chain. \u201cJust wanted to have fun doing something, so anybody who gets into the end zone gets to sit in the G Seat.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s prolific offense has showed itself in bursts, with attention-grabbing performances to start the season against Howard and Syracuse when the team scored a combined 142 points. The unit stalled in losses to Temple and Penn State, but the offense showed progress against Rutgers. Coach Michael Locksley\u2019s system has proven to be explosive, though it lacks consistent efficiency. But the common thread through the changing regimes has been the strength of the running backs: McFarland, Leake and Fleet-Davis.\n\nAD\n\nEach running back gives the others resounding endorsements when asked about their abilities, and a glance at the sideline reveals their genuine excitement for one another\u2019s success. At most positions, but particularly for running backs, depth helps the team but limits individual accolades. That does bother this group.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the best team I've been on,\u201d Leake said earlier in the season after Maryland beat Syracuse. \u201cThese guys are amazing. They're really my brothers. We really treat it as a family out there and we do the same thing in practice. It translates to the game. It's just so fun. I can't express that enough.\u201d\n\nThat continued against Rutgers, when the Terps finally returned to their winning ways after a late-September lull. After McFarland\u2019s second-quarter touchdown that ushered in the G Seat, Leake scored twice in the third quarter, including on a 100-yard kickoff return, while McFarland earned another trip to the comfy spot, too.\n\nAD\n\nSo only running backs have enjoyed this chair created by a member of their position group, but they assured that the G Seat will welcome all touchdown-scorers.\n\nWhen asked whether the spur-of-the-moment celebration will persist through the season, Fleet-Davis said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boys said that they want to make it a tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "They call it the G Seat.
