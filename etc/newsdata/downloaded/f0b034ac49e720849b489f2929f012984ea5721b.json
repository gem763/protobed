And if that were to happen, what would become of oil prices and their impact on Saudi Aramco\u2019s already-delayed IPO?\n\nThese are things oil traders have asked without fail since U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s reinstatement of sanctions on Tehran became effective nearly a year ago.\n\nThe same questions have cropped up with increasing intensity after last week\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, which both Saudi Arabia and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notably blamed on Iran.\n\nAnd more so now as world leaders group in New York for the U.N. General Assembly \u2014 an event that could set the stage for a rare, opportunistic encounter between Trump and his Iranian counterpart and nemesis Hassan Rouhani.\n\nDiscerning the geopolitical premium in oil has never been easy, whether one owns a few hundred barrels on paper or thousands of physical drums locked away in bonded warehouses in China or floating on barges off Rotterdam in the form of offshore storage.\n\nWill Saudi-Attack-Led Rally Hold?\n\nWTI 60-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nAs what have become the main actors in the greatest oil supply crisis since the 1970s \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United States \u2014 gather under one roof this week, investors might need to make a call on whether the 7% gain in crude prices since the Sept.14 Saudi attack will stay, grow or fizzle.\n\nTo answer that, one needs to consider the multiple variables at play in the market now.\n\nJust a week ago, there appeared zero possibility for any diplomacy between the Trump administration and Tehran as Iran stood accused of a crime on Saudi soil that Yemen-based Houthi rebels readily took credit for.\n\nYet, in a shift of poles possible only in oil, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CNN interviewer Christiane Amanpour on Monday that Rouhani was willing to meet Trump in New York this week \u201cprovided that President Trump is ready to do what\u2019s necessary\u201d.\n\nTrump Could Be Appeased By Iran Offer For \u2018Permanent Monitoring\u2019\n\nFor Iran, that, of course, means one thing: the removal of the U.S. embargo that has wreaked havoc on the country\u2019s oil trade and economy. In return, Zarif was quoted by CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour saying Tehran was willing to have \u201cpermanent monitoring of Iranian nuclear facilities\u201d.\n\nSuch \u201cpermanent monitoring\u201d, whose practical meaning is yet to be decoded, could appease Trump. The president insists the main reason he canceled the 2016 nuclear deal with Iran, primarily championed by his predecessor Barack Obama, was due to a \u201csunset clause\u201d that allowed restrictions on Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing to be lifted in 10 to 15 years.\n\nAs of midnight on Monday, Trump had not reacted yet to the olive branch extended by the Iranians.\n\nIn his typical vacillating style, the U.S. president said on Sunday:\n\n\u201cNothing is ever off the table completely, but I have no intention of meeting with Iran, and that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a very flexible person.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s zeal to be known as a dealmaker is not lost on political strategists who point out that an Iran nuclear agreement would be a plum prize for the president as he heads for reelection in November 2020.\n\nRouhani himself has portrayed the image of an emissary coming to the U.N. to facilitate global peace, saying he will present a plan to secure shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and free the Persian Gulf from a flood of weapons. In the same vein, he said Iran, which denies accusations of carrying out the attack on Saudi Arabia, \u201cwill not allow anyone to violate\u201d its borders.\n\nU.K., France And Germany Turn The Screws On Iran\n\nBut the Iranian president isn\u2019t really bargaining from a position of strength.\n\nIn a blow to Iran on Monday, Britain, France and Germany \u2014 three of the Islamic Republic\u2019s staunchest allies amid its sanctions spat with Trump \u2014 joined the U.S. in accusing Tehran of the Saudi attack.\n\nThe three governments said in a joint statement on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly that \u201cthe time has come for Iran to accept a long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program, as well as regional security issues, which include its missile programs\u201d.\n\nGiven the corroboration of the three key European players of the U.S.\u2019s attempt to finger Iran for the attack, will Trump still agree to a sit-down with Rouhani that comes at the expense of waving \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sanctions on Tehran?\n\nOlivier Jakob, who heads oil risk consultancy Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, doesn\u2019t discount the possibility.\n\nDedicating a portion of his Monday note to the Trump-Rouhani enigma, Jakob said:\n\n\u201cThe main bearish risk this week, both for the flat price of crude oil and for the crude oil time-spreads, would be a Trump-Rouhani meeting in New York that goes with some waivers on Iranian crude oil exports.\u201d \u201cRecent events have made this less probable, but the U.S. President is not easily predictable. is now in stand-by, it has first to clear the Rouhani-Trump risk and after that reassess the length of repairs in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nIf indeed a sitdown between the two arch-rivals comes into play, where would it take oil prices?\n\nCould Oil Revert To Pre-Attack Prices?\n\nJohn Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said crude prices could return to pre-Saudi attack levels should the U.S. and Iran even set a date for talks. That would mean $58.34 for and $60.22 for . At Tuesday\u2019s levels, that constitutes a selloff of about $4 per barrel, or nearly 7%.\n\nSaid Kilduff:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most simplistic way of calculating the risk premium in oil now and it doesn\u2019t take into account other bearish risk like Saudi Aramco\u2019s determination in bringing production to full capacity in the shortest time possible to prove all\u2019s well with its financials ahead of its IPO.\u201d\n\nAramco says its Abqaiq crude processing plant, the main focus of last Saturday\u2019s attack, was back to producing two-thirds of the 5.7 million barrels per day that it regularly turns out, and full production would be restored in a week.\n\nIran, on its part, said in May it intends to produce at least 1.5 million bpd if it is to enter and stay in a new nuclear deal with world powers. That could be an onerous burden for a market that has completely discounted Iranian production since the U.S. sanctions came into force in November 2018.\n\n...Or Surge $10 Higher Than Today?\n\nSome, like Phil Flynn of Chicago\u2019s Price Futures Group, dispute Aramco\u2019s narrative of a galloping comeback in its production, or that the White House will easily accept Rouhani\u2019s proposed conditions.\n\nSaid Flynn:", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
