The flutelike song of the western meadowlark \u2014 the official bird of six U.S. states \u2014 is growing more rare. The continent has lost nearly 3 billion birds representing hundreds of species over the past five decades, in an enormous loss that signals an \u201coverlooked biodiversity crisis,\u201d according to a study from top ornithologists and government agencies.\n\nThis is not an extinction crisis \u2014 yet. It is a more insidious decline in abundance as humans dramatically alter the landscape: There are 29 percent fewer birds in the United States and Canada today than in 1970, the study concludes. Grassland species have been hardest hit, probably because of agricultural intensification that has engulfed habitats and spread pesticides that kill the insects many birds eat. But the victims include warblers, thrushes, swallows and other familiar birds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what was so staggering about this,\u201d said lead author Ken Rosenberg, a senior scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and American Bird Conservancy. \u201cThe generalist, adaptable, so-called common species were not compensating for the losses, and in fact they were experiencing losses themselves. This major loss was pervasive across all the bird groups.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2019s authors, who include scientists from Canada\u2019s environment agency and the U.S. Geological Survey, were able to put a number on the decline because birds are probably the best-monitored animals on Earth. Decades of standardized, on-the-ground tallies carried out by ordinary bird enthusiasts \u2014 including the annual North American Breeding Bird Survey and the Christmas Bird Count \u2014 provided a wealth of data that the researchers compiled and compared.\n\nThey then cross-referenced that with data from a very different, nonhuman source: 143 weather radars that are designed to detect rain but also capture \u201cbiomass\u201d flying through the skies, as hundreds of migratory bird species do every fall and spring. Birds look \u201csort of like big blobs\u201d in radar imagery, said co-author Adriaan Dokter, a migration ecologist at the Cornell Lab. Measurements of the blobs\u2019 size and movements showed that the volume of spring migration dropped 14 percent in the past decade, according to the study, published Thursday in Science.\n\nEarlier research has documented several threats that could be responsible for the large-scale bird decline. Agriculture and habitat loss are thought to be the primary drivers, with other factors such as light pollution (which disorients birds), buildings (which they crash into) and roaming cats (which kill them) amounting to \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts,\u201d Rosenberg said.\n\nBirds, because they are so well-monitored, should be viewed as canaries in coal mines, the authors argue \u2014 harbingers of a wider environmental malaise at a time when other creatures, including insects, are also thought to be fading but are more challenging to count.\n\n\u201cStudies like this do suggest the potential of a systems collapse,\u201d said Richard Gregory, head of monitoring conservation science at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and a professor at University College London. \u201cThese birds are an indicator of ecosystem health. And that, ultimately, may be linked to the productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems.\u201d\n\nGregory, who was not involved in the study, called its scale \u201cimpressive\u201d and said the \u201cpicture of decline and general methodology is compelling and first-rate.\u201d\n\nThe study is the largest effort yet to document a bird decline that has been detected in previous studies in Europe and elsewhere. In 2014, Gregory and colleagues reported a loss of 421 million birds in Europe over 30 years. Scientists in Germany reported this month that Lake Constance, at the border of Germany and Switzerland, had lost 25 percent of its birds in three decades.\n\n\n\nD.C. birdwatching enthusiasts use the eBird smartphone app to add their spring sightings to a national database. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nA recent United Nations report warned that 1 million animal and plant species are at risk of extinction as people log, farm and mine the natural world and as the climate warms. But in the case of most dwindling bird species, the problem is not that they are in immediate danger of vanishing.\n\nInstead, the authors say, bird populations are shrinking at rates we do not see, and so do not act upon. Conservationists refer to this as \u201cshrinking baseline syndrome,\u201d and it can have devastating effects: Passenger pigeons were once so abundant that their massive flocks darkened U.S. skies. They were driven to extinction in just a few decades.\n\n\u201cBirds are not dropping out of the sky,\u201d said Cagan Sekercioglu, a University of Utah ornithologist who was not involved in the new report, which he described as a \u201clandmark\u201d study. \u201cWhen you are young, that\u2019s your baseline. The problem is, the next generation, their baseline is lower. But they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\nLosing birds is not just about no longer seeing their vast array of shapes and hues or hearing their dizzying repertoires of songs and sounds. They provide essential \u201cservices\u201d to ecosystems, the study said.\n\nSome are \u201cseed dispersers\u201d \u2014 they eat seeds from tree fruits and then spread them across wide areas through defecation, helping create new trees; when they\u2019re not around, \u201cseed predators,\u201d such as rodents, consume seeds from fallen fruits but crack them open, rendering them unable to grow, said Sekercioglu, who has studied birds\u2019 roles in ecosystems. He cited studies finding that birds save conifer farms in the Pacific Northwest many hundreds of dollars per hectare by eating harmful insects and help Jamaican coffee farmers reduce the use of pesticides.\n\nSome birds are pollinators. Some are predators, and some are prey.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re integral to the system. It\u2019s like a very large corporation in a marketplace \u2014 they\u2019re diversified across all areas,\u201d said co-author Mike Parr, president of the American Bird Conservancy. \u201cIf that corporation starts to have problems, then it starts showing up everywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nDucks, which are among the birds whose populations are increasing, float near Theodore Roosevelt Island during the Christmas Bird Count. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe study notes some bright spots. On the rise are wetland birds such as ducks and geese, which have benefited from conservation efforts by hunting groups. Also increasing are raptors such as bald eagles, which were close to extinction before the prohibition of the insecticide DDT. Endangered species protections helped them rebound, and they remain protected under other federal laws.\n\nThose examples show that conservation policies and protections can work, the authors say. But sparrows and meadowlarks may be trickier: There\u2019s no hunting constituency to rally behind them, and their numbers aren\u2019t low enough to warrant federal protection.\n\nStill, Rosenberg said, these birds can be helped. Sustainable agricultural practices that depend less on pesticides and programs that offer farmers incentives to set aside land for wildlife should expand, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this steady intensification of agriculture and pastureland being converted to pure corn \u2026 squeezing out every last bit of that habitat, getting rid of hedgerows, trees, grassy margins where these birds used to thrive,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBut we know of lots of examples where sustainable agriculture systems can produce the food we need.\u201d\n\nParr said more conservation funding should be directed to the Central and South American nations where many of North America\u2019s birds spend most of their lives, in cooler months. Ordinary people can aid birds by keeping cats indoors, turning off outdoor lights during spring and fall migrations, and reducing the use of pesticides.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got this rapid decline in 50 years, what\u2019s it going to be in 1,000 years? We need to design a planet for the future, and we\u2019re not doing that,\u201d Parr said. \u201cI really hope this can be a wake-up call.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWe\u2019re losing birds at an alarming rate. We can do something about it.\n\nOne million species face extinction, U.N. report says. And humans will suffer as a result.\n\nNigel, the world\u2019s loneliest bird, was no victim. He was a hero.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal with all those turkeys terrorizing the suburbs\n\nMany people flee hurricanes.
