REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nA 2014 white Lamborghini Veneno Roadster sold for 8.28 million francs including commission, about 50% more than its pre-sale estimate, in heavy three-way bidding.\n\n\u201cThe top lot of the collection and rarest of all, one of only nine built and introduced for the 50th anniversary of Lamborghini,\u201d said James Knight, group chairman of Bonhams Motoring Department, as he opened bidding.\n\nThe buyer was anonymous, but the saleroom burst into applause as the hammer came down at the event in a 12th-century abbey in the grounds of Bonmont golf and country club in the village of Cheserex, 30 km (19 miles) from Geneva.\n\nGeneva prosecutors said in February that they had closed an inquiry into Teodoro Nguema Obiang for money laundering and misappropriation of public assets with an arrangement to sell the cars to fund social programmes in west African state.\n\nKnown as Teodorin, he is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled Equatorial Guinea for 40 years. Rights groups label his administration as one the world\u2019s most corrupt.\n\nA Reuters tally of official hammer prices, VAT and 15% commission, showed a total of 26.93 million francs.\n\nA 2011 Aston Martin One-77 Coupe, which Knight described as an \u201cabsolute rocket ship\u201d, went for 1.55 million francs.\n\n\u201cProceeds are for charity,\u201d he said.\n\nA black 2015 Koenigsegg One-1 fetched 4.6 million francs.\n\nA Swiss bidder told Reuters that an agent for a collector in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, had bought several supercars.\n\nA grey armoured 1998 Rolls Royce Silver Spur in need of repair - and described by Knight as \u201cperfect for someone who doesn\u2019t have any friends or has enemies\u201d - went for 86,250 francs.\n\nA 1956 Aston Martin Lagonda, owned by the late Claude Nobs, founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival, was among 50 other cars that found new owners.\n\nThe Rolling Stones, Petula Clark, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury rode in the vintage vehicle, the catalogue said.\n\nThierry Amsallem, Nob\u2019s partner and heir, attended the sale and bought a white 2007 Bentley Azure Decapotable from Obiang\u2019s collection for 112,125 francs.\n\n\u201cIt is like new, just 843 miles on it. We\u2019ll use it to drive around performers,\u201d Amsallem, chair of the Claude Nobs Foundation, told Reuters.\n\n($1 = 0.9907 Swiss francs)", "description": "A collection of 25 supercars seized from Equatorial Guinea's vice president as part of a Swiss money-laundering probe fetched nearly 27 million Swiss francs ($27 million) at an auction held by Bonhams on Sunday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435456282&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0EX-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
