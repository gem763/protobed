David Ehrlich of Indiewire called it \u201ca toxic rallying cry for self-pitying incels,\u201d invoking the term for involuntarily celibate young men that jumped from the saddest corners of the internet to popular parlance in 2014, when a self-described incel killed six people in Santa Barbara, Calif. David Edelstein echoed the idea that \u201cJoker\u201d is \u201can anthem for incels\u201d in his Vulture review, warning that the film is \u201cscary on a lot of different levels.\u201d At Slate, Sam Adams wrote that \u201cno matter how emphatic Phoenix\u2019s performance, it feels like a risk to feel too much for him, not knowing who might be sitting next to you in the theater using his resentments to justify their own.\u201d Adams could handle this movie\u2019s nuanced portrayal of self-loathing turned outward, but what about its effect on sexless losers?\n\nEvery new Joker embodies the element of chaos his audience fears. Thirty years ago, in the age of the superpredator, Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker led urban-coded henchmen with a boombox into a Gotham museum to graffiti old works of art. In the last year of the George W. Bush administration, Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker was a terrorist who inspired Batman to construct a surveillance state. Even Cesar Romero\u2019s campy, late-1960s Joker resembled a hippie. Our era fears political extremism and senseless public violence, which makes Arthur\u2019s reactionary Joker an order of magnitude scarier than Jack Nicholson shooting acid out of a boutonniere.\n\nThe perennial significance of the Joker has made him an omnipresent reference online, both for sincere fans and for ironists. It\u2019s often hard to tell the difference. In a tweet since deleted, the comedian Scott Aukerman observed that \u201cthere\u2019s almost something chilling about the character of the Joker \u2014 someone who finds the thought of crime to be funny. \u2026\u201d This bone-dry joke captures the fundamental problem of Joker discourse: He\u2019s a comic-book character no adult could take seriously, but at the same time, an ever-larger portion of our culture takes comic books seriously. This fear of other people\u2019s bad taste, of losing movies to a supermajority of grown men in \u201cDeadpool\u201d shirts, seems to be the terror that \u201cJoker\u201d most successfully evokes.", "description": "Critics seem to believe in the Joker\u2019s evil powers even more than the most die-hard comic books fans do.", "authors": ["Dan Brooks"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/magazine/06Screenland/06Screenland-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
