He was also found guilty of murdering and mutilating his 32-year-old neighbor, Maria Bruno, in 2005.\n\nLucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBruno, who was attacked while she slept, lived in the same apartment complex in El Monte as Gargiulo, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors.\n\nThen in 2008, Gargiulo attacked his 26-year-old neighbor, Michelle Murphy, stabbing her in her Santa Monica home. Murphy fought him off and Gargiulo was cut during the struggle, prosecutors said.\n\nLucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGargiulo was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstance allegations of multiple murders and lying in wait, which makes him eligible for the death penalty, prosecutors said. He was also convicted of one count of attempted murder and attempted escape, prosecutors said.\n\nGargiulo was also charged in the 1993 killing of 18-year-old Tricia Pacaccio in the Chicago area, prosecutors said.\n\nABC News' Bill Hutchinson contributed to this report.", "description": "Michael Gargiulo was convicted of two murders as well as an attempted murder.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/gargiulo-1-gty-er-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
