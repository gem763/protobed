You wanted equality, they say. This is what you get.\n\nOne advert for state pension changes featured two Labrador dogs called Wendy and Babs, parked on their bums on a beach, with speech bubbles coming out of their mouths. Relax, they told each other, they would get a pamphlet in the post that would explain it all. So insulting! Not to mention deeply patronising, writes JAN MOIR\n\nWhile no one disputes that the law has to be equalised, it is the way it has been implemented that is so awful.\n\nNever before has one great, national issue affecting so many members of the public been hush-hushed up and brush-brushed under a carpet of confusion. And the acceleration ver the past few years seems particularly unfair.\n\nThe 2011 Pensions Act hastened the increase in the state pension age from 63 to 65 for women between 2016 and 2018.\n\nMany of that number would have made plans, left jobs, shaped a retirement and a post-work life, only to have it dashed from under their pipe and slippers.\n\nDeclaration. I am exactly the WASPI demographic, but like many non-WASPI women, I knew this change was coming. Of course I did. I work in the media and am still in full-time employment.\n\nGood for me, well-read, with a comfortable life cushioned from the blows.\n\nNo surprise there were emotional scenes outside the High Court in London today, when the Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) lost their case against the Government\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, I just expected not to get my pension until I was 65, and planned accordingly.\n\nBut other women haven\u2019t been so lucky. And they have a case.\n\nFor a start, the Government\u2019s awareness campaign to warn about the rise in the state pension age was an utter joke.\n\nAround the year 2000, millions of pounds were spent on a series of baffling newspaper and magazine advertisements, many featuring Monopoly boards and cryptic messages (Iron it out Now.) What?\n\nAnother featured two Labrador dogs called Wendy and Babs, parked on their bums on a beach, with speech bubbles coming out of their mouths. Relax, they told each other, they would get a pamphlet in the post that would explain it all.\n\nSo insulting! Not to mention deeply patronising.\n\nIf men had been the target of these ads, there would have been macho, great glaciers crumbling into a roaring sea with ACT NOW in massive red letters branded onto the ice.\n\nThere would have been an ancient, whiskery caveman still looking oddly hot, his bearskin toga holding an empty porridge bowl and a voiceover saying \u2018Don\u2019t Be This Man\u2019. And they would have been run endlessly across all media.\n\nWhat did we get? A polite cough, an obscure message and ads bearing the bad news buried in the back of Woman magazine. We got childish board games and a lot of woof.\n\nIgnorance is no defence in law, but what if you worked on a farm in West Wales or were too busy to notice the faint glimmers of information and thought your pension would come along at 60, like your mother\u2019s did?\n\nOne WASPI woman is pictured outside the High Court in London before the verdict on their case against the Government was decided\n\nThat you had paid into the system all your life and just assumed that the system would be there for you when you needed it?\n\nWe were all supposed to get a leaflet \u2014 a leaflet, praise be! \u2014 informing us of the changes, but I don\u2019t recall ever receiving one.\n\nYou have to agree that the WASPI women have had rotten luck. They were born at the wrong time, into the wrong age, shaded by the wrong values.\n\nFor most of their working lives, they were toiling in the dark ages of untrammelled gender discrimination, in a society that put men first.\n\nIn terms of pay, a huge number were treated as second-class citizens. A lot were bumped out of company pension schemes when they went part-time to bring up children.\n\nAnd now, as the sun sets on their careers and jobs, the Government is finally agreeing that they are equal to men at last \u2014 but tragically not in a way that benefits them. Surely they deserve some help.\n\nWASPI women are pictured outside the High Court in London today\n\nBBC bodge the whole Naga saga\n\nNaga Munchetty is back at work after a row over her remarks about Donald Trump.\n\nThere was a dreadful fudge, with the BBC upholding a complaint against the breakfast TV presenter for offering a personal view on the U.S.\n\nPresident demanding that a group of black politicians should \u2018go back\u2019 to their own country. Only for it to be overturned by BBC Director-General Lord Hall.\n\nNaga (right) is a presenter, not a reporter, an expert or a pundit. She is supposed to be impartial and neutral, and she usually is. But what was she supposed to say when invited to give her opinion by that dope Dan Walker?\n\nHer co-host expressed incredulity about Trump\u2019s remark, then \u2014 in a very unprofessional manner \u2014 asked for Naga\u2019s views. What could she do? It might have been even sillier to throw her hands up and say \u2018No comment\u2019.\n\nAn air of calm has resumed, but why wasn\u2019t he censured, too?\n\nNaga Munchetty is back at work after a row over her remarks about Donald Trump\n\nGabby snatches the gold from Seb Coe\n\nGabby Logan has incurred the wrath of Seb Coe for daring to suggest the lack of crowds at the World Athletics Championships in Qatar is a problem.\n\nShe is right! But the pompous president of the International Association of Athletics Federations doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very easy to sit there and make all sorts of Gabby Logan-type judgments and clear off back to Match Of The Day,\u2019 he sneered, claiming these games are important for the development of athletics. Is that true?\n\nThey certainly seem to be important for Coe\u2019s organisation getting a lot of oil cash.\n\nWe all know what we can see. Which is that the World Championships are a failure. Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith won gold in the 200 metres and did a sad lap of honour in a near-empty stadium, leading to former Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis accusing the IAAF of letting athletes down.\n\nGabby Logan (above) is a terrific sports presenter who is doing her job, which is to tell the public what is going on. What the hell is Coe doing? That is the question.\n\nGabby Logan has incurred the wrath of Seb Coe for daring to suggest the lack of crowds at the World Athletics Championships in Qatar is a problem, writes JAN MOIR\n\nHats off to Lady Ann and those toff tales\n\nLawks. One\u2019s eyes were on stalks at the revelations from Lady Glenconner in her marvellous new book Lady In Waiting, which was serialised in the Mail this week.\n\nThose who had been expecting the lavender-scented memories of a privileged aristocrat were in for a shock.\n\nBorn Lady Anne Coke (pronounced Cook, here we go), she was the daughter of the Earl of Leicester and grew up at Holkham Hall.\n\nShe was just a sweet lady-in-waiting from Norfolk when she married another grand aristo \u2014 Colin Tennant of Mustique fame \u2014 in 1956.\n\nShe was a virgin, who was anxious about her wedding night. Best ask mama for some advice? Best not.\n\n\u2018All that my mother had told me about sex was: \u2018Do you remember Daddy\u2019s Labrador getting on top of Biscuit? Well, that\u2019s what happens when you get married, except you\u2019ll probably be lying down.\u2019\n\nOne\u2019s eyes were on stalks at the revelations from Lady Glenconner (pictured with husband Colin) in her marvellous new book Lady In Waiting, which was serialised in the Mail this week, writes JAN MOIR\n\nYou may not be surprised to hear that things did not go well on Lady Anne\u2019s wedding night in Paris. The next evening, Tennant took her to a brothel to watch two strangers having sex.\n\n\u2018I found it perfectly disgusting,\u2019 she writes. When asked to join in, she said politely: \u2018That\u2019s very kind of you, but no thank you.\u2019\n\nSince then, she was never able to relax in the French capital. \u2018The next time Colin and I went there, he took me to a stage show featuring a man making love to a donkey.\u2019\n\nIn every dream home, a heartache. The couple went on to have five children at a time and in a society where it was expected that the husbands would have affairs and the wives should just lump it. Not Anne.\n\n\u2018Once I knew that Colin had changed the playing field, I levelled it,\u2019 she said, finding comfort with \u2018a very good friend\u2019.\n\nShe may have led a ritzy life, but I like her quiet bravery in somehow conquering all that casual cruelty. Biscuit, anyone?\n\nNot such a jolly holiday for TV's new Stark and Hutch\n\nAre you feeling frustrated, puzzled, irritated, worried and completely gripped? Then perhaps, like me, you are watching The Capture (BBC1).\n\nFive weeks ago this ordinary-seeming police drama started off with the apparent abduction and murder of a barrister by an Army Lance-Corporal.\n\nThen it developed into a complex thriller, whirling around themes of surveillance, fake news and dark deeds by the security services.\n\nThe star of the show is Holliday Grainger (right) as DI Rachel Carey, the hot-shot baby-cop who has been fast-tracked on account of her marvellous skills, which include sleeping with her boss.\n\nAre you feeling frustrated, puzzled, irritated, worried and completely gripped? Then perhaps, like me, you are watching The Capture (BBC1) (DI Rachel Carey played by Holliday Grainger pictured)\n\nNow, as this newspaper\u2019s resident queen of crime, I have to say I am not impressed with the quality of DI Carey\u2019s police work.\n\nShe was used as a patsy in her previous case, it was her sidekick who discovered the vital bus timetable clue in this case and when she tried to arrest a major suspect, she fell over and he escaped.\n\nThe policewoman I really like in The Capture is Detective Superintendent Gemma Garland (Lia Williams), who is bleak and focused, with a ripple of pure Cruella.\n\nThe final episode is next week, but hopefully it won\u2019t be the last time we see these two promising characters. Perhaps they can form a new police duo. Stark and Hutch? Cadgy and Lacy Bra?
