And Weta Digital has constructed the most fully realized digital human yet as 50-year-old Will Smith fights 23-year-old Will Smith in a face off between a hitman and his clone.\n\nMeanwhile, Lola VFX, which has become Marvel\u2019s go-to de-aging specialist, has made great strides this year with its vaunted 2D Photoshopping-like procedure of skin smoothing and shape warping on \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d making Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Nick Fury look decades younger without the use of a young double for the first time. (For good measure, Lola also tackled puberty on \u201cIt Chapter Two\u201d to slightly de-age The Loser\u2019s Club.)\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nWhen Netflix premiered Scorsese\u2019s long-awaited three-and-a-half-hour saga at the New York Film Festival last week, ILM\u2019s costly de-aging experiment (pushing the budget to $160 million) proved effective in conveying the Oscar-worthy performances from 76-year-old De Niro, 79-year-old Pacino, and 76-year-old Pesci. Not surprisingly, the director\u2019s summary statement about \u201cloyalty, love, trust, and ultimately betrayal,\u201d represents his version of Sergio Leone\u2019s similarly-themed \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America,\u201d which also starred De Niro. Except Scorsese has replaced De Niro\u2019s opium-induced fever dream with a grittier (though no less mournful) remembrance of things past.\n\nIndeed, the key to Scorsese\u2019s de-aging strategy on \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was presenting Sheeran\u2019s criss-crossing flashbacks (mostly the \u201950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s) as an elderly man\u2019s reflection on his life. It was therefore about shaping performances with youthful massaging rather than creating younger replicas of De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about lenses and computer imagery,\u201d Scorsese said at the New York Film Festival Q&A. \u201cIt\u2019s about posture, it\u2019s about movement, it\u2019s about clarity of the eyes, everything.\u201d Which is why during his first shooting experience with Pacino, the director had him do several additional takes, jumping up from his chair in anger while watching JFK on TV with his family until he approximated the age-appropriate 49-year-old Hoffa.\n\nFor ILM, the tech challenge was to create the lightest possible capture footprint for the trio of actors. \u201cIn the first meeting four years ago, De Niro said there was no way he was going to wear a helmet camera or facial markers,\u201d ILM VFX supervisor Pablo Helman told IndieWire. \u201cHe wanted to be onset with the lighting, acting with other actors. And he said there will not be any controlled environment for re-shoots.\n\n\u201cWith helmet cams you need to do calibration and that also requires two hours of makeup,\u201d added Helman. (De Niro required prosthetic makeup only as Sheeran in his 80s.) \u201cAnd the main problem for marker technology has to do with the lighting. You need to get those faces lit or else those markers don\u2019t read. What we came up with is something that has never been used before without helmet cameras or markers.\u201d\n\nThe camera system and companion software that ILM developed captured the actors\u2019 facial performances on set, and then translated those unaltered performances to full CG versions of their younger selves with its proprietary models. ILM\u2019s special three-camera rig (termed \u201cthe three-headed monster\u201d by DP Rodrigo Pietro for its bulkiness) consisted of two witness cameras on either side of the director\u2019s camera. The witness cameras captured the most amount of geometry from the actors in the onset lighting without obstructing the principal photography.\n\n\u201cIt was slowly getting through performances and getting through takes, and moving on,\u201d Helman said. \u201cThey were never waiting for us. But the post-production process was a little bit different from any other production that I have been on. We had never really showed Marty intermediate takes. He trusted us enough so that we would finish a shot, render it with the right lighting, and we would show him the performance. And if the performance had the same feeling that he had with the original performance he selected, we moved on.\u201d", "description": "It's a de-aging VFX Oscar face-off between Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman\" and Ang Lee's \"Gemini Man,\" with Lola also contending with \"Captain Marvel.\"", "authors": ["Bill Desowitz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fti6BFASZonpkjAkzTQ3EA--~B/aD02Njg7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/indiewire_268/7b3f16f83ca7b687a3e6d7b6df3bc923", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
