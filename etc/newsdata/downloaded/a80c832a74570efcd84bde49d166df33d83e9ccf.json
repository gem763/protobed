REUTERS/Michele Tantussi\n\nThe revisions, which feed into the government\u2019s own forecasts, reflect growing fears that a slowdown in Germany, driven by a recession in the export-dependent manufacturing sector, could hamper the broader euro zone economy.\n\nThe institutes also called on Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s right-left government to ditch its budget policy of incurring no new debt if the growth outlook deteriorates.\n\nThe powerful BDI industry association welcomed the institutes\u2019 push and urged a substantial public investment programme for education, climate protection and infrastructure.\n\nBut Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said there was no economic crisis and thus no need to give up the \u2018black zero\u2019 budget policy of avoiding new debt.\n\n\u201cI stick to my position that a debate about the \u2018black zero\u2019 now is the wrong subject at the wrong time,\u201d Altmaier said. The government should instead help companies by reducing taxes and contributions to the social security system, he added.\n\nThe institutes said they expect the German economy to grow by 0.5% this year and 1.1% in 2020. That compared with their April estimates of 0.8% and 1.8% respectively.\n\n\u201cAn economic crisis with a pronounced underutilisation of the German economy is ... not in sight, although the cyclical downside risks are currently high,\u201d the institutes said, citing Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union as another risk.\n\nFor 2021, the institutes predict a mild recovery with economic expansion of 1.4%.\n\nThe government is due to publish its own growth forecasts on Oct. 17. In April, it predicted growth of 0.5% for 2019 and 1.5% for 2020.\n\n\u201cFUNDAMENTALLY WRONG\u201d\n\nThe institutes said there was no reason to take additional fiscal action now, but that the government should use its fiscal leeway if the economic downturn turns out to be worse than expected.\n\n\u201cIt would be fundamentally wrong to stick to the \u2018black zero\u2019 policy,\u201d said DIW economist Claus Michelsen, referring to the self-imposed goal of keeping a balanced budget.\n\nUnder the German debt brake rule, the federal government can take on new debt of up to 0.35% of economic output. That would be roughly 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in 2020 after special factors such as growth and the outflow of earmarked money from special purpose funds have been taken into account.\n\nThe permitted debt would rise to 8.4 billion euros in 2021 and 9.7 billion euros in 2022, according to budget experts.\n\nMerkel\u2019s centre-right party on Monday vowed to stick to its policy of no new debt, despite growing pressure at home and abroad for the government to borrow and invest. [nL5N26L4SA]\n\n\u201cThe decision to stick to the \u2018black zero\u2019 next year must not be a dogma,\u201d BDI Managing Director Joachim Lang said, adding that \u201cold concepts\u201d did not help in the face of the current economic challenges.\n\n\u201cA responsible fiscal policy must use the constitutionally allowed net new borrowing to launch overdue investments in education, climate protection and infrastructure,\u201d Lang said.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday that Germany would be able to cope with an economic crisis but added that he did not expect a downturn to be as bad as it was in 2008/2009.\n\n\u201cWe are well prepared because we have decent financial resources so if there is an economic crisis, we can take countermeasures but at the moment we\u2019re only seeing slower growth,\u201d Scholz told public broadcaster ARD.\n\n($1 = 0.9160 euros)", "description": "Germany's leading economic institutes on Wednesday slashed their growth forecasts for Europe's biggest economy for this year and next, blaming weaker global demand for manufacturing goods and increased business uncertainty linked to trade disputes.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436220356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910O2"}
