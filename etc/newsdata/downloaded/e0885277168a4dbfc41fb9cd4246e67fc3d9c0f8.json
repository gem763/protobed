Andy Robertson should be in there, too.\n\nHe and Trent Alexander-Arnold have practically rewritten the rules for full backs. They've taken that position to a whole new level. They are looking more and more like Liverpool's most important players as each week passes.\n\nManchester City's Kevin De Bruyne has created the most chances in the Premier League this season - 31 in total. The next closest? Alexander-Arnold on 30. He'd be in my England starting XI all day long.\n\nLiverpool should have had eight players on the Ballon d'Or shortlist including Andy Robertson\n\nOn the other side, Robertson seems to have an innate ability to sniff out danger. He covers such a distance and is so good at getting back.\n\nTottenham head to Anfield on Sunday knowing all this, and Mauricio Pochettino will have studied how Manchester United stifled the league leaders last week.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer used 3-4-1-2 at Old Trafford, he had his wing-backs play high, he used two fast-paced forwards in Marcus Rashford and Daniel James. It left Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip in a series of foot races.\n\nGenk also had two in attack in the Champions League on Wednesday and they caused problems, too. The Belgians had just 25.6 per cent possession but several long balls into the channels left Liverpool looking vulnerable.\n\nRobertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold are Liverpool's biggest threats to Spurs on Sunday\n\nDo Tottenham try to imitate that? In midweek, Pochettino used 4-2-3-1 and won 5-0 against Crvena Zvezda in the Champions League. He may decide to stick with that, but starting two up top could be the best way to test Liverpool's centre backs.\n\nUsing Harry Kane on his own leaves him at risk of getting gobbled up by Van Dijk and Matip. Tottenham have to turn the hosts' strength into a weakness - use that space vacated by Robertson and Alexander-Arnold, who will be back after missing the trip to Genk with illness.\n\nPose a threat with your pace and keep two up there, like United did. Pochettino has options. As well as Kane, he has Erik Lamela, Heung-min Son and Lucas Moura - and none of those three are slouches.\n\nMauricio Pochettino should take inspiration from the way United and Genk set up against them\n\nThey are all runners, and would happily use any space available to them. Liverpool's full backs are two of the best in Europe. It feels like they're in competition with one another to be Jurgen Klopp's most creative man, and that's healthy.\n\nI remember Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit being the same in front of me at Arsenal. Both wanted to be the midfield dominator, the man of the match. I sense the same in Alexander-Arnold and Robertson, but it is Tottenham's task to turn Liverpool's positives into a negative.", "description": "MARTIN KEOWN: Liverpool have seven representatives in the 30-man Ballon d'Or shortlist but really, they should have eight.\u00a0Andy Robertson should be in there, too.", "authors": ["Martin Keown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20200638-0-image-a-37_1572043480284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
