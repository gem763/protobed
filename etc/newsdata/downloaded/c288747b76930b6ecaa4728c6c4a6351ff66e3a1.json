But, as he quickly learned Saturday, he better get used to it.\n\nIn the first-ever game at Chase Center, Curry was determined to make the first shot -- but only in fitting with his style.

I'm joking, and he was completely serious.\"\n\n[RELATED: Cauley-Stein brings receipts after C-Webb's Dubs prediction]\n\nWhile the end result of Saturday's game was no laughing matter -- the Warriors were beaten handily, 123-101 -- it wasn't entirely humorless, evidently.\n\nThe two All-Star guards will be building their trust all season long, but the next time Curry tells Russell he's going to launch from way back, here's guessing he'll believe him.\n\nHow Steph Curry 'shocked' D'Angelo Russell with first preseason shot originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Building trust takes time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/y1m_Oo756UlgWJfo5._ASg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jkkV9uMeDR_DRp.YNJdSWg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/9196bce8d4ae6543ff73c4ed6631b8b9", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
