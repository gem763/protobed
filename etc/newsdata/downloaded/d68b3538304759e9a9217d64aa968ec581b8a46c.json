Hon had 49 winners to Hsieh\u2019s 26, but the Australian ended the encounter with 55 unforced errors to 29.\n\n\u201cIn the first set \u2026 I had no rhythm, I just couldn\u2019t get my game and style going,\u201d Hsieh said. \u201cBut the next two sets I got going.\u201d\n\nHsieh will next meet Nao Hibino, who advanced when her opponent, 2017 champion and sixth-seeded Zarina Diyas, retired from their match because of a lower back injury while trailing 6-1, 3-2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Defending champion Hsieh Su-wei was just a game from defeat three times as she rallied to fend off Priscilla Hon 1-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5 on Wednesday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Japan Women's Open.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
