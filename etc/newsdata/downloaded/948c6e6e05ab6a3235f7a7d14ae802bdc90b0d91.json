Mads Pedersen, the 23-year-old Danish rider who had done little of note on the global stage bar his second place at last year\u2019s Tour of Flanders, sparked the decisive attack towards the end of a long and brutal six-hour ride in relentless Yorkshire rain, and shook off the attentions of much-fancied rivals Mathieu van der Poel and Matteo Trentin to clinch his first world title.\n\nThe Dutchman Van der Poel was the pre-race favourite this morning but surprisingly he was the first of a leading quintet to crack, and looked utterly broken as he was swept up by the chasing peloton. It meant Trentin was the most high-profile rider left on the front, but the Italian seemed to have nothing in his legs as he tried to sprint for the line. Pedersen latched on to his wheel before thundering past to win by several lengths, and was mobbed on the line by the Danish team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this when we started this morning. The plan was to get me out and get [Michael Valgren] Andersen and [Jakob] Fuglsang to come from behind. But they didn\u2019t follow, so from there on it was survive, survive, survive, and then I went for it. I just hoped that when I saw the finish line all the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint. Six and a half hours on the bike, so everyone was on the limit, so anything can happen in the sprint.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

But after the disqualification drama of Friday\u2019s men\u2019s U23 race and the stunning solo ride of the women\u2019s elite edition, this had been something more formulaic. An 11-man breakaway quickly formed, packed with Grand Tour-winning quality like Primoz Roglic and Nairo Quintana, and they stayed away for much of the day.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Pedersen and the Swiss Stefan Kung led the way, before Italy\u2019s Gianni Moscon, Van der Poel and Trentin bridged across. As they approached the final 10km, Van der Poel suddenly cracked and slid away, completely drained and swaying across the road like a drunk. Moscon dropped off soon after, leaving Trentin, Pedersen and Kung to fight for a medal, and in the final metres it was the young Dane who proved the strongest.", "description": "There is a new name on top of the cycling world.
