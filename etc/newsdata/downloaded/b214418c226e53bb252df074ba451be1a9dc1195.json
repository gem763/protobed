He was tapped for the post by President Moon Jae-in in August and received agrement, or diplomatic consent, from Washington last week. He is expected to work toward strengthening diplomatic overtures to the United States amid a slew of bilateral and regional issues at hand.South Korea\u2019s General Security of Military Information Agreement (Gsomia) with Japan is set to expire on Nov. 22, and Lee told reporters in Seoul that \u201cencouraging the United States to play a constructive role is the most important task in the short term.\u201dSeoul plans to terminate the bilateral intelligence-sharing pact amid increased tensions over the South Korean top court\u2019s rulings on the wartime forced labor issue and Japan\u2019s implementation of export restriction measures on South Korea in apparent retaliation.Lee recalled speaking to high-level U.S. officials as a lawmaker two months earlier on the issue, who told him that while it is difficult to \u201cmediate\u201d between Seoul and Tokyo, Washington has to play a \u201cpositive role.\u201dLee added that renewing the Seoul-Washington defense cost-sharing agreement is also an \u201curgent\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d issue.The ambassador had been listing several important issues between Korea and the United States but brushed off concerns about any fissure in their bilateral alliance.Likewise, he noted that \u201cinternational relations are about having strife,\u201d adding it\u2019s \u201conly natural.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt is the role of diplomats to resolve any irregular tensions and find a balance\u201d with each county\u2019s interests. Lee served as Seoul\u2019s first chief negotiator to the now defunct six-party talks involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, launched in 2003 to denuclearize Pyongyang.At that time, Lee said it was his \u201cdream to hold a summit of the leaders of the six-party nations.\u201d Noting the North-U.S. and inter-Korean summits over the past two years, he added, \u201cInasmuch as the situation has changed [since then], the weight on the leaders\u2019 shoulders is that much heavier.\u201dHe likewise said there is no need to be caught up too much in the highs and lows of the denuclearization negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington, referring to the working-level talks in Stockholm earlier this month.Lee noted that North Korea sometimes \u201cneeds to use speed bumps in its diplomatic policy\u201d and said it\u2019s a part of its negotiation tactics, sometimes bringing in \u201cthunder and lightning and rain clouds before showing blue skies and sunshine,\u201d saying \u201ca strategy looking at the long term has to be set.\u201dA former career diplomat who joined the Foreign Ministry in 1975, Lee previously served as ambassador to Yugoslavia and Germany. He served as an envoy for the four-party dialogue on North Korean issues in 1997 and a foreign affairs secretary to former President Kim Dae-jung in 1999. He also previously served as a deputy director of the National Intelligence Service under the Roh Moo-hyun administration.After spending some years in academia, Lee became head of the Democratic Party\u2019s subcommittee in charge of Korean Peninsula and inter-Korean affairs in 2016 and earned a proportional representation seat in the National Assembly in 2017.Lee especially stressed that how U.S.-China relations pan out will determine the direction of Korea\u2019s future diplomacy. He added, \u201cKorea\u2019s future, history and policy all hinge upon U.S.-China relations,\u201d saying he plans during his time in Washington to expand systematic studies into this topic at the embassy.Lee also expects to coordinate closely with Moon Seoung-hyun, a former Korean ambassador to the Czech Republic, who was recently appointed as the new political minister at the Korean Embassy in Washington. The political minister post at the embassy has this time around been elevated to a vice minister-level position. This move is an attempt to give the political minister, considered a key right-hand man to the ambassador, greater berth to carry out tasks in Washington.The position has been vacant over the past five months following the leak by the former political minister at the Korean Embassy in Washington of a phone conversation between the South Korean and U.S. presidents in May.Lee said that he also previously worked with Moon during their time at the Korean Embassy in Washington as more junior diplomats.BY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joognang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
