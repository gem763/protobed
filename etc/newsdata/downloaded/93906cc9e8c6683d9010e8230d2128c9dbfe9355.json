Meyers is far from your typical boy-meets-girl love story.\n\nTortorella and Meyers are a uniquely modern couple. Both are gender fluid, using \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns and their marriage is polyamorous -- redefining what it means to be \u201chusband and wife.\u201d\n\nTheir story is laid out in Tortorella\u2019s new book \u201cSpace Between.\u201d It\u2019s a place, Tortorella suggests, where people who don\u2019t consider themselves \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d can call their own.\n\n\u201cWhen Bethany and I met in 2006, I was a boy and she was a girl, whatever that means,\u201d Tortorella said, reading from \u201cSpace Between.\u201d \u201cToday Bethany and I both identify as non-binary and prefer \u2018they/them\u2019 pronouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's still a work in progress for everyone. I still mess up sometimes, too,\u201d Tortorella said of using \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns. \u201cFor me, \u2018they/them\u2019 fully encompasses all of it that exists in my own multi-dimensional dynamic being. Right? It just feels more inclusive. It feels wider.\u201d\n\nGary Gershoff/Getty Images, FILE\n\nTortorella also spoke openly about their struggle with fame, the painful process of coming out and facing a dark battle with alcohol.\n\n\u201cWhen I started having access to the party, to the celebrity, to the free everything, it got out of control, like it does for so many people in this industry,\u201d they said.\n\nThe 31-year-old has found fame portraying the hyper-masculine tattoo artist Josh on TV Land\u2019s hit show \u201cYounger,\u201d Lyle Menendez in Lifetime\u2019s \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d and will portray a queer character battling the zombie apocalypse in the upcoming spinoff of AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nABC\n\n\u201cNightline\u201d joined Tortorella and Meyers at their upstate New York home, where Meyers discussed why they made the traditional and somewhat unexpected choice to get married.\n\n\u201cI knew that when it came to having a foundation and a family foundation, that this was the person for me to do it with,\u201d Meyers said.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to visiting each other in a hospital, god forbid that ever happens, when it comes to bringing children into the world, when it comes to health insurance, the system was built for a reason,\u201d Tortorella added.\n\nIt\u2019s what works for them. While Meyers and Tortorella are deeply committed to each other, they also each have multiple sexual partners.\n\nTortorella explained that being polyamorous didn\u2019t mean having group sex. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to create space for more than one person at any given point,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s love,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cSometimes I get a little bit jealous but jealousy is something that I often have to practice, it\u2019s a very normal human emotion.\u201d\n\nActor Nico Tortorella\u2019s marriage to fitness guru Bethany C. Meyers is far from your typical boy-meets-girl love story.\n\nTheir untraditional love story began as teenagers in a Chicago art school when Tortorella developed a crush.\n\n\u201cNico very much liked me and I did not like Nico at first,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cBut I remember talking to one of my friends and being like, \u2018I don't know who this person is, and they kind of annoyed me, but they're going to be in my life forever.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeyers also spoke about dealing with backlash from the Baptist community they were raised in.\n\n\u201cI'm from Missouri, [a] small town, pretty conservative, raised very traditional,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cI was raised knowing that if you're gay, you go to hell. I mean that was kind of the only thing that I knew.\u201d\n\nBeing bisexual, Meyers was met with hostility from their own family. They finally found peace with Tortorella.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with Nico. I mean, I love you so much,\u201d Meyers said speaking to Tortorella. \u201cNico was so respectful of everything that I wanted to do and I just feel like they saw me as an individual.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in the Midwest, Tortorella also faced resistance from their working-class Italian family.\n\n\u201cI always knew that I was different,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cWhen I first realized that even homosexuality was an option, I saw it on TV, I would go down in the basement and watch \u2018Queer as Folk,\u2019 and delete it from the queue because I didn\u2019t want my parents knowing that I was watching it.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nWith Tortorella\u2019s newfound fame came a bigger stage, and a greater sense of purpose.\n\nIn 2018, they walked the runway at New York Fashion Week in a sheer black gown accompanied by a full beard and chest hair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s political\u2026 It's not just throwing on a dress because I'm having fun. It's to prove a point,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cAnd I look good in a dress, so what's the problem?\u201d\n\nThey explained the act was \u201cboth\u201d about being provocative and making a political statement.\n\n\u201cI have a certain privilege that other people do not have and a responsibility [and a] right to raise awareness,\u201d they said. \u201cThat's part of my activism. Wearing a dress is activism for me.\u201d\n\nSean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images, FILE\n\nWhile Tortorella\u2019s fame has given them a platform for their activism, it\u2019s also been a double-edged sword, opening the door to addiction and substance abuse.\n\n\u201cOnce you're just like alone drinking alone, doing drugs alone and you're completely numb to it all, it gets really scary. You know, it gets really lonely,\u201d they added.\n\nTortorella said fellow actor Ashton Kutcher stepped in.\n\n\u201cI was working on the show that was based off his life. He was my boss at that time. I was 21 years old living in New York City. Everyone was partying,\u201d Tortorella said.\n\n\u201cI had gone to ask him for some advice and he was just like, \u2018Don't put anything up your nose.\u2019 We were all drinking,\u201d they said. \u201cI got into his face. He was like, \u2018You're high right now.\u2019 I was high. So you feel like you're invincible right? And we just started going at it. It didn't get physical. It could have.\u201d\n\nBefore quitting alcohol, alarm bells were also going off at home with Meyers.\n\n\u201cThere was a day when I was like, \u2018Hey let's just have a day together. Let's just be sober today, let\u2019s go out, let's not party, let\u2019s like, be in the sunshine,\u2019\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThen Nico turned around and grabbed a bottle of vodka out of the freezer and started drinking it, and I was like, \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t.\u2019 And that was a really scary moment for me.\u201d\n\nToday, Tortorella says their sobriety is going \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, I speak of my sobriety as fluid like the rest of who I am. I'm sober from alcohol. That was the one thing that really was the devil for me,\u201d they said. \u201cSo I gave up alcohol. I still smoke weed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s those hard times that have made them resilient.\n\nFor their traditional mom, Annie Walsh, being so different was unacceptable at first.\n\nFor Walsh, 60, seeing the child she had raised as her son in a tight black dress during Fashion Week triggered an explosive fight.\n\nVictor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cI was OK with everything to the best of my ability, and then I saw the dress,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 I mean like, at one point does it stop? Where's the line? And I realize there is no line. If you start drawing lines then you're put in a box.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was more important for me to have the love of my son,\u201d Walsh continued. \u201cWho am I to judge who [they love], who [they don\u2019t] love. [They love] everybody.\u201d\n\nOver the years, the lessons learned from Tortorella became part of their mother\u2019s everyday life. She now lives in Florida and developed a group of friends that includes a trans masseuse, gay hair stylist and a lesbian doctor -- an evolution for her that happened alongside Tortorella\u2019s journey.\n\nTortorella, their mother and their partner are each on their separate journeys, but they are bound by respect and an abiding love.\n\n\u201cI want to say, I wish I could do it all over again,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI can't change the past, [but] I can change today. Just as [they are] changing today for so many people. [They] have done that for me.\u201d\n\nToday, Tortorella is using their voice to advocate for young people who identify as gender-queer, creating a sense of belonging for others in the LGBTQ+ community, many of whom need a sanctuary to call their own.\n\n\u201cShare more. Share more than you thought was okay,\u201d Tortorella said of advice they\u2019d give their younger self. \u201cJust talk about how you are feeling more than you are, because then you can begin to feel differently.\u201d", "description": "Actor Nico Tortorella\u2019s marriage to fitness guru Bethany C.
