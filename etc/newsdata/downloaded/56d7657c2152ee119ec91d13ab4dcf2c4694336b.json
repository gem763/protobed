Although he was a state co-chair for the Trump campaign, Sondland repudiated the nominee and backed out of a high-dollar fundraiser scheduled in Seattle.\n\nThen Trump won.\n\nJust a few months after his disavowal, Sondland reversed course and gave Trump\u2019s inaugural committee $1 million, routed through four separate LLCs. A year later Trump rewarded Sondland, who had no prior diplomatic experience, naming him U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nNow Sondland, a Mercer Island native whose refugee parents ran a dry-cleaning business in West Seattle for a quarter-century, is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump. After building a successful business that gave him vast wealth and prestige as a philanthropist, Sondland, 62, is now embroiled in a scandal that risks defining his career.\n\nHe is named in the whistleblower report that led to the impeachment investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged abuse of power, and has been asked to testify before Congress this coming week.\n\nText messages released by House Democrats on Thursday show Sondland responding to another diplomat who objected to a seeming quid pro quo \u2014 linking U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine with Trump\u2019s political interests.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote veteran diplomat Bill Taylor on Sept. 9.\n\nSondland responded hours later, saying Taylor was \u201cincorrect\u201d and that the president had been \u201ccrystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d He added: \u201cI suggest we stop texting back and forth.\u201d\n\nSondland is not a household name in Seattle, or even in state GOP politics, although he is a major civic and power player in Oregon. But he has long maintained his voter registration in downtown Seattle at Hotel Theodore, part of the Portland-based boutique hotel chain he founded.\n\n\u201cAlways a quid pro quo\u201d\n\nLike many establishment Republican donors, Sondland was not originally a Trump supporter. He started out backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, donating $25,000 to his super PAC.\n\nSondland\u2019s political giving has been overwhelmingly to Republicans, with more than $420,000 going to GOP candidates for federal office since the late 1980s, versus about $25,000 for Democrats.\n\nBut he\u2019s maintained friendly ties to prominent Democrats. He was on the transition team of Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, when he took office in 2003, and Kulongoski made him chairman of the Governor\u2019s Office of Film and Television. Sondland also served as a liaison between Kulongoski and George W. Bush\u2019s White House.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn a 2016 interview Sondland decried rising partisanship and looked back fondly on his days helping a liberal governor ask for aid from a conservative president. But his language \u2014 extolling the transactional nature of politics \u2014 is striking given the controversy he\u2019s involved in now.\n\n\u201cWe would make these requests and they were done quietly, they were done with rifle precision and there was always a quid pro quo,\u201d Sondland said at an event for Portland business leaders in 2016. \u201cThe governor would help the president with something and the president would help the governor with something and it was very transactional.\u201d\n\nNow, \u201cthere\u2019s less transactional, there\u2019s less comity, there\u2019s less ability to understand what someone else needs and figure out what you need and make a deal,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because I think everyone loses in the process.\u201d\n\nSondland has not publicly addressed the Ukraine controversy and did not respond to a request for comment through the EU embassy in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nWhile Sondland\u2019s alliances and political giving have trended heavily Republican in recent years, associates described him as more pragmatic than partisan, building relationships with whoever is in power.\n\n\u201cHe was a cheerleader for incumbents, he became friends with people who were officeholders. That was his political ideology more than any bedrock conservatism,\u201d said Len Bergstein, a Portland political consultant who worked with Sondland during a long fight against a publicly owned convention center hotel in Portland.\n\nSondland became a campaign donation bundler for Mitt Romney\u2019s failed 2012 presidential campaign, in part to boost his chances of achieving his dream of a European ambassadorship, said David Nierenberg, an investment manager in Camas, Clark County, who helped lead Mitt Romney\u2019s national finance team.\n\nSondland \u201cwas not reticent\u201d about his pursuit of a diplomatic post, preferring a German-speaking nation, which would have meant a son of Holocaust refugees \u201cwould have come full circle,\u201d Nierenberg said. \u201cThis is what he wanted and long sought.\u201d\n\nOregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden vouched for Sondland, known in Oregon as \u201cGordie,\u201d as \u201ca really good fit\u201d during his confirmation hearing last June for the EU ambassador post.\n\nWyden praised the hotelier\u2019s civic involvement, noting he\u2019d known Sondland\u2019s family for years in Oregon\u2019s relatively small Jewish community. Sondland has frequently donated to his campaigns.\n\nOn Friday, Wyden issued a statement saying Sondland \u201cand any official who has knowledge of Trump\u2019s schemes to get foreign leaders to interfere in our elections\u201d should cooperate with the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has a long history of throwing his associates under the bus to protect his own skin, and I expect that any Trump official banking on this administration to protect them ought to think seriously about the prospect of major disappointment,\u201d Wyden warned.\n\nAdvertising\n\nRefugees\u2019 son to hotel magnate\n\nSondland grew up on Mercer Island, born to Jewish parents who married in Germany when his mother was 15 and then fled to escape the Holocaust.\n\nHis dad had been a fur trader, but that business didn\u2019t really exist in Seattle. Both his parents went to Seattle Community College for a year, where they learned the dry-cleaning business, his mother said in a University of Washington oral history project. They bought a West Seattle dry cleaner and ran Fauntleroy Cleaners until they retired in their 70s.\n\nThe family was \u201clower middle class,\u201d Sondland said in the 2016 interview, but lived amid great wealth on Mercer Island.\n\n\u201cYou saw some kids on their 16th birthday with the new BMW that their parents bought them and some kids had to walk to school or take the bus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt created a lot of interesting dynamics that probably followed me for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nHe went to the University of Washington and later started working in Seattle as a real estate broker. He sold apartment buildings, mainly, \u201ca lot of the little brick buildings on Capitol Hill, Queen Anne Hill.\u201d\n\nAround 1985, a broker who worked for him showed him a bankrupt hotel and asked about how to sell it. Sondland put together an investment group and bought the property himself, paying $7.8 million for the Roosevelt Hotel in downtown Seattle.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNow known as the Hotel Theodore, it\u2019s appraised at more than $52 million and is one of 14 hotels owned by Provenance Hotels, the boutique chain Sondland founded. The chain includes Seattle\u2019s Hotel Max, Tacoma\u2019s Hotel Murano and six hotels in Portland, including The Heathman.\n\nAs his wealth grew, Sondland and his wife, Katherine Durant, built an art collection valued at up to $25 million, according to federal financial disclosures. He\u2019s been a major donor to the Portland Art Museum and the Frye Art Museum in Seattle. Both museums have facilities named after Sondland\u2019s family.\n\nHe\u2019s also given to Washington politicians, including Democrats Norm Dicks and Maria Cantwell and Republicans Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Jaime Herrera Beutler in Congress, and Republican Dino Rossi\u2019s 2008 campaign for governor.\n\nWith Sondland facing intense scrutiny over his role in the Ukraine affair, his former associates fear his ambition to be a high-ranking diplomat could wind up permanently tarnishing his name.\n\nNierenberg said in the years he worked with Sondland on political fundraising, \u201che never said or did anything that gave me any question about his personal ethics.\u201d\n\nBut Nierenberg now said he feels \u201cqueasy\u201d about what he is reading.\n\n\u201cIf I were in a position to provide counsel to Gordon, I would say you are going to be testifying next week: Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\u201d\n\nNews researcher Miyoko Wolf contributed to this report.", "description": "EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a Mercer Island native now embroiled in the Trump impeachment inquiry, once described a successful political transaction as \"always a quid pro quo.\"", "authors": ["Seattle Times Staff Reporters"], "top_image": "https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10042019_tzr_tzr_215132-780x501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
