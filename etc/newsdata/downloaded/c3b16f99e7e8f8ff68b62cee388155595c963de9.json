As we head into the jobs figure, this pair of course will be highly influenced by what happens with the US dollar, which of course will be highly influenced by the employment situation. Looking at the chart, the 1.10 level above should be massive interest just waiting to happen as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. Looking at the 50 day EMA reaching towards the figure as well tells me that there is quite a bit of structure there as far as sellers are concerned.\n\nEURUSD analysis Video 04.10.19\n\nPay attention to the US bond markets as well, and demand. Demand has been relatively high, and if it picks up again, that will also drive this market much lower. To the downside, the market still hasn\u2019t filled a gap at the 1.0750 level, which will take some time to get to because of the choppy and erratic nature of this market. High-frequency trading has taken over the Euro/US dollar pair, and therefore huge moves are very rare. Ultimately, this is a market that is very negative longer term so therefore I think that it\u2019s likely to offer a nice opportunity to start selling at the first signs of exhaustion. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not going to be very quick move, but it does look like we are going to continue grinding lower. Look at rallies as a gift as far as owning greenbacks will be concerned.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Euro has gone back and forth during the trading session on Thursday, essentially going nowhere as we await the jobs figure.
