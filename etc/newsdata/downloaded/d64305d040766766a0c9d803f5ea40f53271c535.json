It will take commuters to central London in about 20 minutes, and will ultimately also serve Heathrow Airport and the western commuter belt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it has been beset by delays and cost blowouts. Although the \u00a317 billion-plus line was supposed to open last December, it will now open no earlier than late 2020, probably early 2021.\n\nThe Thamesmead project envisages not only residential development but also a revitalised town centre. The district's population is about 45,000, and Peabody owns about two-thirds of the land.\n\nThe existing housing stock dates from the 1960s in the south, and mostly from the 1980s and 1990s in the town's north and west.\n\nThe 760-hectare site is about the size of central London. There are about 75 hectares of green space, five kilometres of Thames river frontage \u2013 of which 2.5 kilometres forms part of Peabody's development site \u2013 plus seven kilometres of canals and five lakes.", "description": "The developer has inked its 50-50 joint venture with Peabody to build 11,500 homes at Thamesmead, but needs the London authorities to do their bit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4177%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_112/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7187701fced70c464eb7c0ad79ffda61001eae52", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
