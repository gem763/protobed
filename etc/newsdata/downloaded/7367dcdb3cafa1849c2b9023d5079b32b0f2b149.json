With 88 yards through two games, there was some question about whether he could reach 15,269 career rushing yards, but that looks far more attainable now.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGore\u2019s longevity is nearly unprecedented\n\nIt took the Bills cutting LeSean McCoy in the preseason, a hamstring injury to Singletary and a disappointing camp from T.J. Yeldon for Gore to take over as a starting running back at this age, but that doesn\u2019t take away from how impressive it is.\n\nAs Yahoo Sports\u2019 Eric Edholm noted, Gore could become the third 36-year-old to ever pick up 20 carries in a game and the first since Marcus Allen in 1996. He picked up 68 yards on 19 carries in last week's win over the New York Giants.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nGore\u2019s durability has been the secret to his success over the years. Not only has he continued to chug along to his 15th NFL season, but he\u2019s only missed two games since 2011.\n\nGore may only have eclipsed 5.0 yards per carry once in his career \u2014 his second season in 2006 \u2014 but he's been as consistent as they come. Even last season, he picked up 4.6 yards per carry with the Miami Dolphins at age 35.\n\nFrank Gore will carry the load for the Bills with rookie Devin Singletary out.

If he can play in 2020, that would give him 16 seasons, matching a mark set by Allen for the most seasons for an NFL running back. Playing two more seasons would be literally unheard of.\n\nNFL teams continue to get younger as they look to save money on rookie contracts, but Gore has been happy to play on dirt cheap contracts. He only made $1.105 million in 2018 and is set to make $2 million this season, so seemingly the only thing standing in the way of him and the record books is his own health and will to play.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Frank Gore is a starting running back yet again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/msPPfFA8cXiuA06nQjITdw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.8i20sQBpsHDWnLJnVEciw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a33a7ab0-dbd0-11e9-89fc-35e9b12f0e34", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
