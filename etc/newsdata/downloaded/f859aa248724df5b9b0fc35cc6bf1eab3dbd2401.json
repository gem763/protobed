Game of Thrones broke through and did that, we\u2019ll do the same.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not even remotely alike.\u2019\n\nJason Momoa plays Baba in See (Picture: Apple TV)\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see him back in action (Picture: Apple)\n\nHe continued to ET Canada: \u2018Drogo didn\u2019t even fight. I\u2019m in non-stop fights in this. The only similarity is that I\u2019m in both, but they\u2019re not alike.\u2019\n\nOkay, Jason, okay.\n\nHe played the legendary Khal Drogo in Game Of Thrones (Picture: HBO)\n\nIt was recently reported Apple spent nearly $15 million (\u00a311.6 million) per episode on See, which spans eight episodes in total.\n\nSpeaking on This Morning earlier this week with co-star Alfre Woodard about the budget, Jason said: \u2018The thing is we never wanted to shoot anywhere that we\u2019ve ever shot before on the show.\n\n\u2018We shot in Vancouver. We\u2019d go extremely far, in some of the opening villages they actually drained a lake and it was all these massive huge trees that were clear cut down that are exposed, so it looked like a world that had taken everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So they lowered that lake, we built a whole village and they filled it back up when we were gone. So they went to great distances.\u2019\n\nIf you need context, $15 million is believed to be the same budget the final season of Game Of Thrones had for each installment \u2013 which is touted as one of the most expensive TV shows ever created.\n\nSee launches on Apple TV+ on Friday 1 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
