The other 99% have to write checks back to Express Scripts, according to the contract.\n\nThe top 2%\u201315%, which Express Scripts deems \"high performers\" in the contract, have to pay back 2% of a prescription's price. The next 60% of pharmacies have to pay 4% of a drug's price, and the lowest performers concede 6%.\n\nThe other side: Express Scripts said in a statement to Axios that \"high-performing pharmacies can and do earn more money.\"\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the largest PBMs \u2014 Express Scripts, CVS and OptumRx \u2014 also own pharmacies.\n\nExpress Scripts did not make executives available for interviews and would not answer follow-up questions.\n\nFlashback: Loyal readers may remember that this is the second time Bob has gotten ahold of an Express Scripts contract. You can read his previous series here.\n\nWant to read the contract? Email bob@axios.com.
