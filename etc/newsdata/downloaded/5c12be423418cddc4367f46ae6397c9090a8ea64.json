The 27-year-old center, who had 21 goals and 51 assists last year, had bounced back.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the Capitals as a unit did not.\n\nWhile Kuznetsov\u2019s early goal opened the door, Washington struggled to close another game. After Nicklas Backstrom scored a tying goal with 30.7 seconds left in regulation, the Stars\u2019 Tyler Seguin spoiled Kuznetsov\u2019s season debut with the game-winner 43 seconds into overtime.\n\nThe Capitals let the Stars tie the score twice \u2014 at 1-1 and 2-2 \u2014 before Nick Caamano put Dallas up 3-2 with 7:57 left in regulation. The Capitals got a standings point thanks to Backstrom\u2019s goal but fell to 2-0-2 while Dallas picked up its first win.\n\nComing off an 0-for-6 power-play performance in their 3-2 overtime loss to Carolina in Saturday\u2019s home opener, the Capitals again failed to convert, going 0 for 5. With 5:33 left, the Capitals had a four-on-three advantage for 54 seconds and were set to have a five-on-three for 1:06. But they struggled even with Kuznetsov back on the first unit, and the Russian center took a costly penalty with 3:53 left to put the Stars on the power play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitals struggled mightily in the third period, failing to put a shot on goal until past the midway point after holding a 27-11 advantage entering the final frame. Dallas forward Alexander Radulov broke through for the game-tying score at 7:53 when he slipped the puck past goaltender Braden Holtby.\n\nThe Stars had tied the score at 1 on Roope Hintz\u2019s laser from the left circle early in the second. Center Lars Eller, who earned the praise of Coach Todd Reirden for his play through three games, made an ill-timed cross-ice pass at the blue line that was picked off by the Stars and led to Hintz\u2019s goal.\n\nAfter failing to covert multiple chances at the front of the net, the Capitals relied on Holtby to keep the score tied late in the second period, and he made a sharp save on Mattias Janmark\u2019s high-danger opportunity. Sliding to his right, Holtby splayed out to deny Janmark \u2014 and Washington gained a one-goal advantage moments later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDefenseman John Carlson slipped the puck past Bishop at 15:55 to put the Capitals up 2-1, with his shot from above the right circle going off Bishop\u2019s left arm and into the net on the short side. Carlson has a goal and four assists through four games.\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "His suspension complete, Kuznetsov found the net in the first period and the Caps tied it late, but Dallas prevailed, 4-3.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MhHYADYF4zR5zsyuMwXbDjCbgu4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MXRVGBXKHQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
