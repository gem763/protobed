Insist that a deeply defective claim about the meaning of Title VII\u2014namely, that any employment practice that can be applied only by identifying an employee\u2019s sex amount to discrimination because of sex\u2014is a sound textualist argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fail to reconcile that claim with the longstanding acceptance of sex-specific restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, and dress codes\u2014all of which require taking account of an employee\u2019s sex.\n\n3. Accuse any conservative justice who doesn\u2019t accept that defective claim of abandoning textualism and of being unprincipled.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, whose questioning of both sides was very evenhanded, seems to be a particular target of the browbeating. I doubt very much that he\u2019ll be influenced by it, but we\u2019ll see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGorsuch asked some questions that explored whether sex was one of \u201ctwo causal factors at work\u201d when an employer discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status. One answer to that (as another line of Gorsuch\u2019s questioning recognized) is that, as the restroom and other examples illustrate, showing that an employment practice takes account of an employee\u2019s sex is not enough to establish a violation of Title VII. A second answer, as Solicitor General Noel Francisco and others explained, is that the employer who, say, bars a male employee who identifies as female from using the women\u2019s facilities is treating that male employee \u201cthe same as a similarly situated woman\u201d\u2014that is, a woman who is barred from using the men\u2019s facilities\u2014and is thus clearly not discriminating on the basis of sex.\n\nOnce the causal question is framed correctly\u2014as a question about why the employer treats a man who identifies as a woman differently from other men\u2014it\u2019s clear that sex is not one factor among others. It simply plays no role at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe coherent textualist argument that defeats the Title VII claims is that Title VII\u2019s ban on discrimination because of sex does not impose a regime of asexuality or androgyny. Rather, to borrow the words of Justice Ginsburg that the Court unanimously embraced in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998), the \u201ccritical issue, Title VII\u2019s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d", "description": "Justice Gorsuch, whose questioning of both sides was very evenhanded, seems to be a particular target of the browbeating.
