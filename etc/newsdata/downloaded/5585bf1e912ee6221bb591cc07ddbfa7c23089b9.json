A spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) later said it was invovled in the operation.\n\nRead more: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: How an obscure Iraqi academic became the leader of the Islamic State\n\nA commander of one of the militant factions in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib said Baghdadi was believed to have been killed in a raid after midnight on Saturday involving helicopters, warplanes and a ground clash in the village of Brisha near the Turkish border.\n\nTwo Iraqi security sources and two Iranian officials said they had received confirmation from inside Syria that Baghdadi had been killed. Reuters also reported that the assault had taken place in Idlib, northern Syria, as the militant leader had been trying to flee the country with his family.\n\nA reclusive leader\n\nIt is not the first time that Baghdadi, who rose from obscurity to become the leader of Islamic State - then called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) - has been reported killed five years since he declared the foundation of a 'Caliphate' in Iraq and Syria from the pulpit of Mosul's Grand Mosque.\n\nIn April 2019, the reclusive leader served to quash rumours of his death in a video that showed him sitting on a cushion with an assault rifle, and calling for the continuation of jihad. It came after ISIS had been all but defeated in Syria and Iraq in a U.S. backed campaign.\n\nHis death overnight on Saturday was first reported by Newsweek, which cited a U.S. official saying that the White House had high confidence that the person killed was Baghdadi and that DNA and biometric testing was now underway to be sure.\n\nBaghdadi was long thought to be hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border. His self-declared \"caliphate\" will be remembered for atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of a fanatical interpretation of Islam that horrified mainstream Muslims.\n\nFrom caliph to fugitive\n\nAt the height of its power Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n\nBut the fall in 2017 of Mosul and Raqqa, its strongholds in Iraq and Syria respectively, stripped Baghdadi, an Iraqi, of the trappings of a caliph and turned him into a fugitive.\n\nU.S. air strikes killed most of his top lieutenants, and before Islamic State published a video message of Baghdadi in April there had been conflicting reports over whether he was alive.\n\nDespite losing its last significant territory, Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is due to make a statement at the White House later.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/08/98/1000x563_cmsv2_4e7abd02-87a7-50fa-b18c-21c3300845fd-4260898.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
