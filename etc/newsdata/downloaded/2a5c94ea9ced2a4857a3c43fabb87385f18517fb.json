Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nSanders claims 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical debt. That\u2019s approximately two-thirds of the 750,000 total bankruptcies per year.\n\nSanders\u2019s claim is based on a study published by the American Journal of Public Health in March. The researchers surveyed debtors and asked about factors that contributed to their bankruptcies. Forty-four percent said either medical bills or loss of work related to illness \u201cvery much\u201d contributed; 22 percent said either medical bills or illness \u201csomewhat\u201d contributed. Combining both groups of respondents, the study estimated 530,000 bankruptcies a year.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t establish that all 530,000 bankruptcies were caused by medical bills, as Sanders describes it. It is broader than that, since it measures contributions \u2014 not causes \u2014 factors in both illness and medical bills, and respondents who said either \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery much.\u201d\n\nA different study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the same question of medical bankruptcies and found that the rate was far lower: 30,000 to 50,000 a year. However, this study was limited to non-elderly people in California who were admitted to the hospital for non-birth-related reasons, so it covers only a subset of all people facing medical debt.\n\nThe research team Sanders cited once included Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who contributed to earlier versions of their study when she was a Harvard professor. Interestingly, though, Warren doesn\u2019t appear to make the same claim about 500,000 medical bankruptcies a year.\n\nWe recently gave Three Pinocchios to Sanders for this claim, and his campaign sharply criticized our fact check.", "description": "\u201cI get a little bit tired \u2014 I must say\u00a0\u2014\u00a0of people defending a system, which is dysfunctional, which is cruel \u2026 500,000 people going bankrupt for what reason, they came down with cancer?\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-washpost-wordpress-uploads/primetime/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/15183205/AFP_1LF9S5.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
