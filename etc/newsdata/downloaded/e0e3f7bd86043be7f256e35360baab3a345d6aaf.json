Nearly two in three expats in the U.S. are happy in their careers, but only about half are satisfied with their work-life balance. Overall, U.S. expats have levels of job satisfaction (65%) that are on par with the global average (64%).\n\nWorking abroad has its challenges, but the research shows it can pay off, too: A 2019 HSBC Expat survey found the average 18- to 34-year-old's earnings rose 35% (or from $40,358 to $54,484) after relocating overseas. In certain markets, the jump was as high as 51%.\n\nHere are the top countries where expats are happy with their working lives abroad:", "description": "The Expat Insider 2019 Survey says this bucket-list destination is tops for people who want to work abroad.", "authors": ["Jennifer Liu"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106114476-1567714402428gettyimages-1039021134.jpg?v=1567714456", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
