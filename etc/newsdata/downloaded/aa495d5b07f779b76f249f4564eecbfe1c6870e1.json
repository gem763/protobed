Today he met with teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg and announced a plan to plant 2 billion trees:\n\nFirst came the pledge to ban and buy back \u201cmilitary-style assault rifles\u201d and support municipalities in banning handguns. Next: Tax relief for middle-class households, and a vow to slash cellphone bills. Then promises to introduce a national prescription drug plan, to commit Canada to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, to teach every Canadian how to camp by grade 8. On Friday, a meeting with climate activist Greta Thunberg \u2014 and a commitment to plant 2 billion trees.\n\nThe story goes on to say that it\u2019s unclear if all of these new proposals are working. Some polls show the Liberal Party losing ground in the wake of the blackface scandal while others suggest that may have been a blip.\n\nI\u2019m assuming Trudeau though the meeting with Greta Thunberg might result in some positive comments from her. He did, after all, call her the \u201cvoice of a generation.\u201d But after the meeting she said Trudeau wasn\u2019t doing enough:\n\nThunberg, however, indicated that she expects more, even of leaders who welcome the movement. Scientists this week issued new dire warnings about the consequences of rising temperatures on the world\u2019s oceans and cold regions. \u201cHe (Trudeau) is of course obviously not doing enough, but this is just a huge problem, this is a system that is wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nThunberg has previously criticized Canada for approving a new oil pipeline:\n\nOne second they declare a #ClimateEmergency and the next second they say yes to expand a pipeline. This is shameful.\n\nBut of course this is not only in Canada, we can unfortunately see the same pattern everywhere\u2026https://t.co/zVbWXnLBSQ \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) June 19, 2019\n\nAsked about that tweet, Trudeau said, \u201cWe have a national climate plan that will reduce our emissions and hit our 2030 targets in a way that also includes getting a better price for our oil resources that allows us to put the profits directly into the fight against climate change.\u201d\n\nTrudeau also participated in a climate strike today in Montreal but the response from other protesters was mixed. One protester tried to throw eggs at the Prime Minister and was tackled by security:\n\nA commotion broke out during a climate change strike in Montreal after a man reportedly attempted to lob eggs at Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau\u2026 Global News has confirmed that the man in had eggs in his hands. RCMP has since confirmed one man was arrested.\n\nI don\u2019t support protesters throwing things at people. I didn\u2019t like the milk-shaking fad on the left and throwing eggs isn\u2019t any better. In the report below, you\u2019ll see some video of the incident. The reporter who was on the scene said that even before the egging she heard a protester calling Trudeau a \u201cclimate criminal.\u201d None of this seems great but no doubt Trudeau would much rather talk about being egged or disappointing Thunberg than about blackface.", "description": "\"He (Trudeau) is of course obviously not doing enough...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Thunberg-Trudeau.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
