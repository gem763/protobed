For example, you could type \u201cdoc.new\u201d (without the quotes) to create a new Google Doc or \u201csheet.new\u201d to create a new spreadsheet. Today, Google is bringing the .new shortcuts to the rest of the web. Now, any company or organization can register their own .new domain to generate a .new shortcut that works with their own web app. Several have already done so, including Microsoft, which now has \u201cword.new\u201d to start a new word document, or Spotify, who has \u201cplaylist.new\u201d to start adding songs to a new playlist on its streaming app.\n\nThe domains are designed to get users straight the action. That is, instead of having to visit a service, sign in, then find the right menu or function, they could just start creating.\n\nHowever, some of today\u2019s new domains aren\u2019t quite as seamless as Google\u2019s own. Because most Google Docs users are already signed into to Google, it\u2019s easy to jump right to creating a new online document.\n\nBut other services aren\u2019t used as often. That means Medium\u2019s \u201cstory.new\u201d doesn\u2019t let you immediately start writing your blog post, unless you\u2019re already signed in to Medium. If not, it drops you on a \u201cJoin Medium\u201d sign-up page instead. This doesn\u2019t make it necessarily any easier to use Medium \u2014 a better use case would have allowed the user to just start writing, saving their text under a temporary account, then prompt them to join Medium upon exit or clicking \u201cpublish.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s Word.new, a direct rival to Google\u2019s own doc.new, isn\u2019t yet resolving.\n\nOther participants include sell.new (eBay), canva.new and design.new (Canva), reservation.new (OpenTable), webex.new and letsmeet.new (Cisco WebEx meeting room creation), link.new (Bit.ly), invoice.new (Stripe\u2019s dashboard), api.new (launch new Node.js API endpoints from RunKit), Coda.new (Coda), music.new (create personalized song artwork for OVO Sound artist releases and more), and repo.new (GitHub.)\n\nSpotify also picked up podcast.new, which takes you to Anchor, in addition to playlist.new.\n\nConsidering the lineup, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s not as much of a gold rush for these action-based domains as they are for other top-level domains. There are some fun use cases, like Spotify\u2019s, and practical ones like Word.new, but others are less compelling because they drop you on sign up/sign in pages as they\u2019re not everyday services.\n\nAnd some are just odd land grabs. Like Ovo Sound, the record label founded by Drake, which snagged \u201cmusic.new\u201d \u2014 a domain that you would think would go to a larger streaming service. (In fact, it\u2019s somewhat surprising that Google\u2019s own music service, YouTube Music, didn\u2019t grab that one for itself.)\n\nGoogle says any company can register these domains, all of which are secured over HTTPS connections like .app, .page., and .dev domains are.\n\nThrough January 14, 2020, trademark owners can register their trademarked .new domains. Starting December 2, 2019, anyone can apply for a .new domain during the Limited Registration Period.", "description": "A year ago, Google rolled out \u201c.new\u201d links that worked like shortcuts to instantly create new Google documents.
