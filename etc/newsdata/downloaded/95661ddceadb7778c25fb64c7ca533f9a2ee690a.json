I became an MP because I wanted to make a difference, but while Brexit continues to captivate Parliament, that just hasn't been possible.'\n\nMs Allen, a committed Remainer, added: 'But more than all of that, I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace.\n\n'Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.\n\n'Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all to regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising.\n\n'In my very first election leaflet I remember writing 'I will always be a person first and a politician second' - I want to stay that way.\n\n'So, I have reluctantly come to the decision that I will not re-stand when the next general election comes.\n\nMs Allen joined the Lib Dems (leader Jo Swinson pictured in Westminster yesterday) earlier this month\n\n'I am heartbroken, but I know it is the right decision because I am no longer delivering the change that drove me into politics in the first place.'\n\nMs Allen originally quit the Conservative Party in February, along with Sarah Wollaston and Anna Soubry, to join the new Independent Group, later renamed Change UK, formed by ex-Labour MPs.\n\nThe following month it was announced that she had been appointed interim leader but she left three months later amid reports of disagreements over strategy.\n\nHer South Cambridgeshire constituency is traditionally a safe Conservative seat which she held with a majority of almost 16,000 at the 2017 general election.", "description": "Liberal Democrat MP Heidi Allen complained that Brexit has 'broken our politics' today as she announced she is quitting the Commons.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20326308-0-image-a-48_1572355735078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
