Enlund and his team noted that the yuan would need to fall to 7.30 to the dollar to neutralize the effect of existing tariffs on the economy. However, the \u201cphase-1 agreement\u201d, along with reports of a planned VAT tax cut for Chinese manufacturers, was still enough to send both the and yuan rates to their highest since August on Monday.\n\nBy 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the , which measures the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, was up 0.2% at 98.213, marking gains against higher-yielding currencies but modest declines against havens such as the yen and Swiss franc. was down 0.2% at $1.1019.\n\nAnother factor dampening sentiment was the cool reaction from the EU to the U.K.\u2019s proposals on resolving the Irish border-related elements of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The EU\u2019s top negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly told EU diplomats at the weekend that the proposals represented an \u201cuntested\u201d risk that were not acceptable, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe pound, which staged its biggest one-day rally in more than two years on Friday, fell back over half a percent against the dollar and euro in early trade in Europe Monday. By 3:45 AM ET, was at $1.2583, down 0.5% on the day, while was up 0.4% at 0.8755.\n\nA paper released at the weekend by the UK in a Changing Europe observed that, even if the U.K.\u2019s latest proposals were accepted, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals still promised a substantial hit to the U.K. economy. It said the deal could leave per capita British gross domestic product as much as 6.4% below where it would be if it remained in the EU, on a 10-year horizon. That compares with an estimated 4.9% hit from the deal negotiated by Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.", "description": "Forex - Dollar Rises as Markets Temper Hopes on Trade, Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6K0IO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
