The United States has relied on the SDF since 2015 in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nEsper also knocked Turkey\u2019s \u201cimpulsive\" decision to invade Syria as putting the Kurdish partners \u201cin harms way\u201d and a move that will \u201cfurther destabilize\u201d a region ravaged by civil war and the recent fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe oppose and are greatly disappointed by Turkey\u2019s decision to launch a unilateral military incursion into northern Syria,\u201d Esper said.\n\n\u201cThe impulsive action of [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan] to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation.\u201d\n\nEsper earlier on Friday had called for Turkey to stop their operation, warning of \u201cserious consequences.\u201d\n\nHe later said that \u201cdramatic harm is being done\u201d to the relationship between Washington and Ankara, with no indication the Turks are willing to give up their offensive.\n\nThe Pentagon chief\u2019s message echoed that of Trump, who has staunchly defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria. Critics of the plan, including lawmakers from his own party, argue he is abandoning a U.S. ally and allowing them to be attacked by Turkish forces.\n\nTrump, however, has been hesitant to give the SDF credit in the fight against the ISIS, using a portion of his campaign rally Thursday night to defend his decision to withdraw U.S. troops.\n\n\"Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, we helped the Kurds and don't forget, they're also fighting for their land ... but they're fighting,\" Trump said in Minneapolis.\n\nIn stepping back as Turkey strikes Kurdish fighters and civilians, the administration also risks losing control of some 10,000 captured ISIS fighters.\n\nNew Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, who spoke alongside Esper, said the SDF is still guarding the ISIS prisoner camps, and that U.S. forces are still working with the group in the counter-ISIS campaign.\n\nHe added that the United States \u201chas no legal responsibility for those detainees.\u201d\n\nMilley also said Turkey has conducted airstrikes with fixed-wing manned aircraft, and conducted artillery strikes, but added that ground forces have been \u201crelatively limited.\u201d", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday insisted that the United States had not abandoned Kurdish allies by pulling U.S. troops from northeast Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/espermark_080319getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
