I Disagree. Witness the Woke\u2019s New Condemnation of Ikea", "language": "en", "text": "So there you are, thinking you\u2019ve heard of the stupidest thing possible. But then I swoop in with this.\n\nDo you appreciate affordable, well-designed furniture? Are you a fan of modern, minimalist decor? Do you hanker for a hunka Ikea?\n\nWell, your favorite Swedish slinger of Lingonberry soda is in trouble.\n\nIn fact, its worse than you may imagine. The assembly-required home goods haven recently had the nerve to\u2026**Trigger Warning**\u2026serve peas.\n\nYes \u2014 it\u2019s that horrible.\n\nPeas, I said.\n\nCalm yourself\u2026\n\nIt all started when the backer of the Billy Bookcase decided to be a jerk and serve similar chicken.\n\nJerk chicken, in case you didn\u2019t know, is a marinated Caribbean dish, and the maker of your favorite fake-fur rug paired it with white rice and the aforementioned panic-inducing spherical seeds.\n\nYou see, Ikea should be sensitive to the fact that the Scotch-bonnet-peppered meat isn\u2019t traditionally teamed with dadgum green peas! It\u2019s supposed to be kidney beans in coconut milk, ya neanderthals:\n\nThis is IKEA\u2019s jerk chicken and rice and peas and no I\u2019m not eating it \ud83d\ude15 pic.twitter.com/BFPJ1CWBmR \u2014 . (@Themlotsdad) September 9, 2019\n\nShame on Ikea for feigning a penchant for diversity.\n\nLet the outrage begin!\n\nThis was as simple as Googling a pic, but pretending to be a diverse company was more important than getting it right. https://t.co/7tkk65GI9i \u2014 BeingBDub (@bebe4121) September 15, 2019\n\nYet another example of a brand with no diversity around the table. IKEA\u2026\u2026.. https://t.co/ukOU8aTLKX \u2014 Sonia Meggie \u2728 (@SoniaMeggie) September 16, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s shameful cultural appropriation, and they didn\u2019t even hire any Caribbeans to guide them in their theft:\n\nIt's literally white rice and garden peas \ud83d\ude2d @IKEA did you even Google it?! If you were confused, beans are called peas in the Caribbean. This is what happens when you try and cash in on a culture with no input from that culture whatsoever.https://t.co/Ste2tLFs6l \u2014 Eleanor Langford (@eleanormia) September 14, 2019\n\nAs you can see above, the store\u2019s repented.\n\nHow could those white people have ever thought this was okay??\n\nSomeone please tell me why ikea thought it was ok to make \"jerk chicken and rice and peas\". Dear white people: SEE CARIBBEAN PEOPLE TINGS AND LEAVE IT ALONE \u2014 Moonchild Jae\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf2 (@jaerobinit) September 19, 2019\n\nAt least one person defended the home of the Klippan loveseat, F\u00e4rgrik mug, Riktig \u00d6gla curtain rings, Fl\u00e4rdfull candle, Knutstorp chair, and \u00d6dmjuk teapot:\n\nExtremely problematic take: Ikea should be able to serve something they call \"jerk chicken\" without getting canceled for it, even if that dish is bad https://t.co/Mk6w1Y5SjQ \u2014 Kevin \ud83d\udc50 Glass (@KevinWGlass) September 16, 2019\n\nThe store can use the support; it just can\u2019t seem to catch a break with the Painfully Conscious \u2014 Ikea even made CheatSheet\u2019s list of \u201c5 Stores Where You Should Not Buy Furniture.\u201d\n\nThe SuperWoke list excoriated the furniture retailer for having the nerve to:\n\nUse wood\n\nNot be located as pervasively as McDonalds\n\nSee for yourself:\n\nHowever, the larger concerns around Ikea have more to do with environmental and other costs, not necessarily the furniture itself. \u201cCan we afford to keep shopping at places where an item\u2019s price reflects only a fraction of its societal costs?\u201d one Atlantic column asked in 2009. Seven years and counting after the article was published, it appears we can. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we should. For one, IKEA has pushed many transportation costs onto the consumers themselves, likely without them even thinking about it. The average consumer drives 50 miles round trip to make it to the assembly-required mecca, often far away from city centers so the business can avoid higher taxes. At the time the article was written, the retailer was also the third-largest consumer of wood, used in the particleboard now ubiquitous with the brand. But the bigger issue, as the Atlantic points out, is that the cheaper furniture invites us not to invest or repair the items. When a bookcase breaks or a dresser becomes unusable, we throw it away instead of repairing it, like we would an heirloom armoire. It might get recycled, or it might not. Either way, we\u2019re using more natural resources without adding lasting value. For those reasons, \u201cIKEA is the least sustainable retailer on the planet,\u201d said Wig Zamore, a Massachusetts environmental activist who worked with IKEA and supports some of the company\u2019s regional green initiatives.\n\nDid the person who wrote that article stop to think that perhaps people drive far to get to Ikea because they love it so much?\n\nPerhaps the author could\u2019ve also considered that if you open a store in New Jersey, it\u2019s far from New York; if you open one in New York, it\u2019s far from New Jersey.\n\nAll places are close to some things and far from others.\n\nOh well, who needs reason when you\u2019ve got an outrageous signaling of virtue at hand?\n\nI\u2019m keen on the Swedist store, evil Nazi peas notwithstanding.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re there, take my advice: getcha a softserve vanilla cone. Those things are delicious.\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nRespect Your Elders: Viral Video Of An Arby\u2019s Boxing Match Shows A Young Buck Find Out Old Guys Know A Thing Or Two\n\nHollywood\u2019s Rosanna Arquette Apologizes For Being White.
