In other words, the Fed is the \u201ctransmission mechanism\u201d between US economic reports and market prices, so any discussion about NFP should start with a look at the state of the US central bank.\n\nWhen it comes to the Fed, monetary policy is in flux: based on last month\u2019s and economic projections, many central bankers wanted to pause rate cuts and see how the economy performed before deciding what to do next. The only problem? The economic data has taken a big turn for the worse in recent days.\n\nA mere 72 hours ago, traders were just a 40% chance of an interest-rate cut at the end of this month, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. After back-to-back abysmal ISM surveys, though, those odds have surged to 90%! In that light, another weak NFP report may be the proverbial \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d that cements a rate cut later this month, whereas a better-than-anticipated report could open the door a crack for the Fed to hold rates steady.\n\nNFP Forecast\n\nUnfortunately for bulls, the leading indicators for Nonfarm Payrolls are pointing to another soft reading on the US labor market:\n\nThe report dropped to 135k, below estimates of 140k and down from last month\u2019s downwardly-revised 157k print.\n\nThe ISM Survey's fell to 46.3 down from last month\u2019s already contractionary 47.4 reading.\n\nThe ISM Survey's fell to 50.4, showing essentially no net growth in service sector employment after a 53.1 reading last month.\n\nThe of ticked back down to 212,500 from last month\u2019s 216,250 average.\n\nOverall these leading indicators point to another weak report, with potential for a reading below 100k. That said, the historically low initial unemployment claims figures do provide a (small) reason for optimism among bulls, as does the potential for a recovery after last month\u2019s disappointing reading. Regardless, the month-to-month fluctuations in this report are notoriously difficult to predict, so we wouldn\u2019t put too much stock into any forecasts (including ours). Most importantly, readers should note that the and (especially) the wages component of the report will also influence how traders interpret the strength of the reading.\n\nIndicators Point To Weak Payrolls Report\n\nSource: TradingView, FOREX.com\n\nPotential Market Reaction\n\nSee wage and job creation scenarios, along with the potential bias for the below:\n\nUSD: Wage And Job Scenarios\n\nIn the event the jobs and the wage data beat expectations, then we would favor looking for short-term bearish setups in , which remains in a strong medium-term downtrend and has seen a small counter-trend bounce so far this week.
