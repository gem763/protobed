His hip was pain-free, his tennis kept improving with every match, and the press-room fridge was full of his favourite French yogurts. \u201cJamie and I have been obsessed with these since we first played in Tarbes 20 years ago,\u201d he grinned, while stealing another four-pack.\n\nSo what was on his mind as he approached his 46th ATP title? In an exclusive interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Murray said he only has one big regret: living with the pain of an arthritic hip \u2013 which he now admits had been stripped of virtually all its cartilage \u2013 for almost two years.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I wish is that I had had this operation sooner,\u201d Murray said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know because no one [in tennis] had gone before. A lot of the people I had spoken to had suggested it was not really an option to play sports afterwards. But then when I spoke to the athletes who had had the operation and gone back to playing sports, they were like, \u2018Yeah it felt great. It was brilliant.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen I started speaking to Bob Bryan [the veteran doubles champion who had the same operation in August last year and made a triumphant return to the court five months later]. That\u2019s when I decided to go for it. But it was also not something that was presented to me until he had done well with it.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t really have changed that, I guess. But it would have saved\u201d \u2013 he pauses and emits a hollow laugh that embodies 18 months of agony \u2013 \u201ca bit of pain and a bit of time\u201d.", "description": "Andy Murray was in a jolly mood during his run to the Antwerp final a week ago, and why not?", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214107491-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
