That\u2019s patently not true | Zoe Williams", "language": "en", "text": "You develop a certain immunity to the news these days. You can\u2019t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament, there simply isn\u2019t time. I find it quite surprising, now, to feel depressed by the Today programme.\n\nAnd yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve, on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech. \u201cEveryone on the doorstep,\u201d the chancellor proclaimed, \u201cis saying, \u2018get Brexit done\u2019. They don\u2019t say, \u2018cancel the result\u2019. They don\u2019t say, \u2018have a second referendum\u2019. They say, \u2018get Brexit done\u2019.\u201d As a matter of observable fact, this can\u2019t be right: what about the 6 million who signed the petition to revoke article 50? Or the 16 million-plus who voted remain? Or the young voters who came of age after 2016? And on and on. Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly. He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been \u201cknocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses\u201d in Darlington, where he met a guy who said: \u201cYou\u2019re that Tory. I\u2019m going to vote for you lot.\u201d It might not get past a creative writing tutor, but at least it\u2019s not immediately falsifiable.\n\nOf course, the chancellor didn\u2019t literally mean \u201ceveryone on the doorstep\u201d. He was using a new parlance, in which \u201ceveryone\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201call the citizens\u201d but \u201call the authentic citizens\u201d. How can you tell which citizens are the authentic ones? They\u2019re the ones who agree with the proposition that we must Get Brexit Done.\n\nAt root, this is an old political trick \u2013 nicely described by the cultural theorist Stuart Hall in 2012: \u201cPoliticians always think they know what people feel. It\u2019s a fallacy, because there is no such thing as \u2018the people\u2019. It is a discursive device for summoning the people that you want. You\u2019re constructing the people, you\u2019re not reflecting the people.\u201d\n\nOur current politics deploys that technique on ketamine: slower, dumber, more intense. It is now considered reasonable to stand up and say: \u201cI\u2019ve met all the real people, and they all agree with me.\u201d The habit has spread from politicians to commentators, so it\u2019s not unusual to see 20-something rightwing thinktankers on TV current affairs programmes confidently telling everyone what \u201cthe people\u201d want \u2013 to which one is tempted to reply, \u201cmate, which people? Who have you even met, ever, in your whole life?\u201d Which of course misses the point. It\u2019s a construction, not a reflection.\n\nPlay Video 0:38 'We are leaving the EU': Sajid Javid says it's full steam ahead on Brexit \u2013 video\n\nBut where once, as Hall notes, it constructed a shared view of \u201ccommon sense\u201d, now its purpose is the obliteration of reasonable difference or dissent. If you don\u2019t adhere to the view that \u201cthe people\u201d are said to hold \u2013 no matter how extreme \u2013 you\u2019re not merely wrong. You are simply not real.\n\nThe invocation of this all-powerful imaginary \u201cpeople\u201d has put predictable pressure on those opinion canvassers of the media who think of themselves as neutral \u2013 the BBC and other broadcasters, with their ever-more controversial vox pops. There are, it transpires, some surprisingly radical views in the nation at large: among the eyebrow-raisers have been the man who told the BBC in January that it will be character building for us to run short of food, and the guy who signalled his willingness to pay even with his own life for a no-deal Brexit, should it cause him to run short of the medication he needs.\n\nSetting aside the questionable significance of these individual views, there are endless methodological questions around the sampling of \u201crandom\u201d vox pops. The notion \u2013 presented with a straight face by a BBC news presenter in Stoke last week \u2013 that a few people you corral at midday in a shopping centre represent \u201ca cross-section of voters\u201d is obviously absurd.\n\nFundamentally, though, the spectre of what any given group ought to think haunts the reporters. When they\u2019re in a \u201cleave area\u201d and someone gives the \u201cwrong\u201d answer \u2013 suggesting, for instance, that Boris Johnson should resign \u2013 they are no longer representative of the area, and the reporter has to set off in search of another person who can say the right thing for \u201cbalance\u201d.\n\nIs the rise of the unscientific vox pop a fresh take on news or just plain laziness? | Catherine Bennett Read more\n\nThere is no such thing as a neutral survey in the world of the vox pop: the TV camera brings an invitation to strike a pose, but it also reflects the expectation of the person behind the camera from the exchange and the thousand subtle ways in which they convey it. I was always struck, when I went on reporting trips to a town at the same time as other journalists, how we would all come back with a different man-on-the-street. One would always meet the people who felt displaced by immigrants; another would unfailingly meet the one who hated Jeremy Corbyn; and I would come back with a weird story about someone\u2019s daughter-in-law who was obsessed with colouring-in books, and it would turn out she had an anxiety disorder, and then it would transpire that she was on a zero-hours contract.\n\nThe point is not that they were biased and I was neutral and this paper is better than all the others: it\u2019s interesting precisely because we unintentionally and in good faith dig for the stories we\u2019re interested in. It is, in the end, not an encounter between a scientist and a specimen \u2013 but two people trying to connect. What is produced is always idiosyncratic, and only revealing insofar as you\u2019re prepared to consider what it reveals about both sides of the encounter.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that interviewing people is corrupted simply because the interviewers are human too. What\u2019s problematic is the politically expedient contention that there are opinions that are held by all members of a demographic group \u2013 from northerners, women, millennials, pensioners, all the way up to \u201cthe people\u201d. When we recognise that as a fallacy, we might finally be able to hear one another.\n\n\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist", "description": "When politicians say they speak for \u2018the people\u2019 they\u2019re using an old political trick, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453317e9c6bb2fa0d1dd7046bf6e954c9e97ab5/0_303_5026_3015/master/5026.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bd8c2ce3ea49545cf1cbe992307a6f1f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
