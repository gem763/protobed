GLOBAL MARKETS-The S&P 500 inches higher; Treasury yields dip after Powell remarks, jobs report\n\n* Fed chair Powell speaks in Zurich\n\n* U.S. jobs data disappoints\n\n* China's central bank announces stimulus policy\n\n* Treasury yields inch lower as likelihood of Fed rate cut grows\n\n* Crude prices post weekly gains (Updates to market close)\n\nBy Stephen Culp\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 posted a nominal gain and Treasury yields edged lower on Friday, as remarks from Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell firmed interest rate cut expectations and China announced an economic stimulus package, both of which helped offset weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data.\n\nThe roller-coaster week began with a flight to safety driven by trade jitters and weak U.S. manufacturing data, but positive geopolitical developments in Britain, Hong Kong and Italy, along with news that U.S.-China trade talks would continue, revived market risk appetite.\n\nThat appetite was further stoked after China's central bank said it would lower the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, in order to bolster the nation's weakening economy. the week we've seen risk assets rebound as favorable economic data and positive geopolitical developments provided comfort to investors that a broad slowdown isn't about to take shape,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz (DE: ) Investment Management in Minneapolis.\n\nBut optimism was dampened by the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which showed an increase of 130,000 jobs in August, fewer than analysts expected. underwhelming data provided another possible sign that the longest-ever period of U.S. economic expansion is losing steam and increased the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates when it meets later this month.\n\nBut Ripley believes the jobs report was not as downbeat as the headline number suggested.\n\n\"We still have an unemployment rate at 3.7% and wages are increasing at a decent clip,\" Ripley said.\n\n\"Beyond that we had favorable comments from Powell, which helped alleviate investor concern.\"\n\nIndeed, in remarks made at a panel discussion in Zurich, Powell called the jobs report consistent with a strong labor market, adding that despite trade uncertainties he does not foresee or expect a U.S. recession. Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.31 points, or 0.26%, to 26,797.46, the S&P 500 gained 2.71 points, or 0.09%, to 2,978.71 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.75 points, or 0.17%, to 8,103.07.\n\nEuropean and emerging markets extended their gains as China's stimulus announcement outweighed the disappointing economic data from the United States and also from Germany. pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.32% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.20%.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.51%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.65% higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.54%.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields edged lower following Powell's even-keel message, which cemented expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates later this month. 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 1.5517%, from 1.565% late on Thursday.\n\nThe 30-year bond last rose 28/32 in price to yield 2.0169%, from 2.054% late on Thursday.\n\nThe dollar was essentially flat against a basket of major world currencies after the jobs report reinforced the likelihood of further rate cuts from the Fed. rose 0.01%, with the euro down 0.05% to $1.1027.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.02% versus the greenback at 106.94 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2294, down 0.28% on the day.\n\nOil prices rose after Powell said the Fed would \"act as appropriate\" to sustain an economic expansion that has been hindered by global trade uncertainties. futures settled at $56.52 per barrel, up 0.39%, while futures settled up 0.97% at $61.54 per barrel.\n\nGold dipped nearly 1% after Powell's remarks helped jump-start risk appetite after the underwhelming jobs data. gold dropped 0.9% to $1,505.51 an ounce.\n\nCMCU3 lost 0.29% to $5,828.00 a tonne.\n\nThree-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to $1,783.00 a tonne.", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-The S&P 500 inches higher; Treasury yields dip after Powell remarks, jobs report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB230DM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
