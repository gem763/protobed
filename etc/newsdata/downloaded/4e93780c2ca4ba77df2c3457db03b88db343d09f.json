Kamala Harris was at a campaign event Friday when a questioner asked her about President Trump\u2019s \u201cmentally retarded\u201d actions, to which she laughed with the crowd and responded, \u201cWell said, well said.\u201d\n\nApproached by a CBS News reporter the following day, as the video was going viral, Harris condemned the language as offensive and hurtful and said that, had she actually heard the man the assembled crowd and the rest of us watching on video all heard loud and clear, she would have corrected him and asked him to not use such hurtful language. Instead, not knowing what he said, she responded, \u201cWell said. Well said.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s check in on some headlines and with some reporters to see how that story is playing out in the media. Be on the lookout for, \u201cRepublicans pounce!\u201d\n\nAn insult was lobbed at Trump at a Kamala Harris event.

There's a video of it. She backtracked after it was pointed out that it was offensive. \u2014 Is this real?

Yesterday she thought it was quite funny.@CBSNews is simply a SuperPac for the Democratic Party. \u2014 Jack Ryan (@JackRyanGTI) September 7, 2019\n\nYou see, Democratic candidates like @KamalaHarris can lie with impunity about anything that might embarrass them because she knows mainstream media outlets like @CBSNews will lie and cover for her. And because the truth doesn't get repeated, the lie is allowed to continue. https://t.co/LdgZ7IK5LD \u2014 Aldous Huxley's Ghost\u2122 (@AF632) September 7, 2019\n\nAnd he\u2019s Politico\u2019s headline, which The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel calls, \u201cweird.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris repeatedly defends response to mental health slur at rallyhttps://t.co/9kpiHnTF12 \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) September 7, 2019\n\nThis is a weird headline because she *did* condemn it, albeit after a video of the comment circulated.

If this was Trump or even Joe Biden, you'd rightfully be condemning them. This was a really bad look for Harris and should be the beginning of the end of her campaign. \u2014 Max Power (@MaxPower_007) September 7, 2019\n\nYeah, she heard it initially because she praised the question, now she\u2019s lying and pretending like she didn\u2019t hear it. This is why her campaign is collapsing: nothing but walk backs after negative press no matter the issue. \u2014 Donald Spines (@SunnyDfan4eva) September 7, 2019\n\nBS\u2026.She laughed and said \"Well said, Well said\"\u2026only after her staff got to her and let her know \"retarded\" was a big no-no did she decide to lie about hearing what the man said. #MediaBias \u2014 Henry Chinaski (@ashsoles) September 7, 2019\n\nThe other \"bad actor\" MIGHT BE THE DUDE WHO FUCKING SAID IT Christ \u2014 Quintessential (@Genuflectional) September 7, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re telling you, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy are in the CNN-mobile right now tracking him down so they can interrogate him tomorrow on \u201cReliable Sources\u201d and squeeze out an apology.\n\nDo you honestly believe she didn't hear it?
