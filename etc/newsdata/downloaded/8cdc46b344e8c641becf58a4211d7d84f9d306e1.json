Another is that a comparison of Pence and Trump\u2019s calls with Zelenskiy could potentially make the president\u2019s self-described \u201cperfect\u201d conversation appear significantly less so. \u201cThe media, Democrats are going to pick it apart,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a concern about that.\u201d \u2026 Some people close to the president have argued that publishing detailed notes from conversations with world leaders also sets a problematic precedent by watering down the strength of exerting executive privilege and opening up the administration to even more scrutiny.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence has repeatedly affirmed that his contacts with Ukraine officials have been \u201centirely focused on the broader issues of the lack of European support and corruption.\u201d A readout of Pence\u2019s September call with Zelensky shows the vice president praising Ukraine\u2019s president for his administration\u2019s \u201cbold action to tackle corruption through legislative reforms, and offered full U.S. support for those efforts.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s July 25th call with Zelensky lays at the center of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry launched last month. House Democrats accuse President Trump of pressuring the Ukrainian president into investigating allegations of corruption against former vice president and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Zelensky has repeatedly denied feeling any heat to look into the Biden family. The White House has also released the Trump-Zelensky transcript to demonstrate no wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cThere was no blackmail,\u201d Zelensky recently told reporters. \u201cWe are not servants. We are an independent country.\u201d", "description": "The White House is reportedly debating whether to let Democrats \"pick apart\" the transcript of Mike Pence's telephone call with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177954848-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
