CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook.\n\nThe issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign that targeted former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nIn response, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran an ad on Facebook taking aim at its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The ad falsely claimed that Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate falsehood as necessary to make a point.\n\nCritics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. This includes CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the policy of allowing lies ludicrous and advised the social media giant to sit out the 2020 election until it can figure out something better.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted the change Wednesday , saying the company is recognizing that advertising on social media offers an unfair level of targeting compared to other mediums.\n\nThe majority of money spent on political advertising in the U.S. goes to television ads.\n\nTwitter\u2019s policy will start on November 22.", "description": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says the policy will take effect on Nov. 22", "authors": ["Rachel Lerman And Barbara Ortutay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aU6tfoEVVy3ohQF6mr_kvw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/da920726187e2ca75f19020a19eec68c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
