Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ: ) climbed 92 cents to $28.20 on 2.3 million shares Tuesday, more than 1 1/2 times its average volume. The move, which came on no news from the drug maker targeting treatments for rare and rheumatic diseases, edged the stock out of a 2-month sideways channel.

The move, on no news from the developer of cancer therapies, positioned the stock right at the declining tops line of its 2-week wedge pattern. A follow-through breaking out of the wedge could take the stock to $89. Winnebago Industries (NYSE: ) jumped $2.04 to $40.49 on 637,300 shares Tuesday. The move, which comes ahead of next week's earnings release, popped the stock out of a 3-week wedge formation, positioning it right against lateral resistance near $41. A break through there could take the stock to the $47 level reached in June of last year. XPO Logistics (NYSE: ) gained $1.19 to $75.85 on 905,000 shares Tuesday.
