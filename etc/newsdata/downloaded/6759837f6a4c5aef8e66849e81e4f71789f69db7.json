Kardashian-West was working on a TV documentary regarding criminal justice reform when she met inmate Stewart during her tour of the D.C. jail. (Courtesy of Betsy Henthorne, attorney for Momolu Stewart)\n\nKim Kardashian-West, the reality TV and social media star turned criminal justice reform advocate, was touring the D.C. jail in July when she met a murderer.\n\nThere for the taping of a TV documentary on the criminal justice system, Kardashian-West sat down in the jail library with Momolu Stewart. She was trying to see whether the 39-year-old had developed into a different person from the angry, trouble-prone teen he was decades ago when he fired multiple shots at the head and back of an unarmed man.\n\nStewart, who was 16 when he committed the crime, in February asked the court to grant him early release under a recent law. After their meeting, Kardashian-West agreed to pen a letter to the D.C. judge overseeing Stewart\u2019s petition for resentencing.\n\n\u201cI write to humbly request your compassion and humanity in supporting the release of Momolu Stewart,\u201d she said in the two-page letter. \u201cI have been actively involved in cases across the country and in my view, Momolu is especially deserving of your consideration.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been rehabilitated and is no longer dangerous to society,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cI also have every confidence that upon his release he will continue to guide others away from a life of crime and continue on his own path to redemption and success.\u201d\n\n[Read Kim Kardashian-West\u2019s full letter here]\n\nThis month, after holding court hearings and receiving more than 40 letters from organizations and civic leaders also supporting Stewart, Superior Court Judge Robert Salerno granted the petition to reduce his life sentence.\n\nBut Salerno has yet to say whether Stewart will be released soon or have to serve additional time. That decision, Salerno said, will come after an October hearing during which people impacted by Stewart\u2019s crimes will have a chance to speak out.\n\nStewart\u2019s attorney, Betsy Henthorne, telephoned Stewart at the jail to give him the news. \u201cHe was speechless. This completely changes his life,\u201d said Henthorne, who worked on the case pro bono.\n\nStewart is the 21st inmate to have his petition decided under a 2017 law called the Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act. The District law allows inmates who committed their crimes when they were younger than 18 and spent at least 15 years in prison a chance to have their sentence cut. Under the law, they must show signs of rehabilitation behind bars.\n\nStudies have shown that the brains of teenagers and young adults are not fully mature, and the idea behind the legislation is that those who offend at younger ages should not receive adult punishments of decades in prison. So far, 19 inmates have been released under time served.\n\n[Push to allow some violent criminals a chance at early release causes U.S.attorney for the District to come out fighting]\n\nIn recent weeks, an effort to expand the law has been the subject of heated debate. City Councilman Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) wants to change the law to include people who were between 18 and 24 at the time of their crimes. The U.S. attorney for the District and the city\u2019s police chief have lobbied against the proposed change, which has yet to come to a vote.\n\nJudges handling the cases look to see whether the applicant has proved to been rehabilitated, taken educational or vocational classes, and has shown remorse and stayed out of trouble behind bars. In considering a list of criteria, they review letters from victims and their families, the inmate\u2019s prison record and reports by prison staff, among other things.\n\nStewart was one of two teens convicted in a New Year\u2019s Day murder 22 years ago. The other teen, Kareem McCraney, 39, last year became the first inmate released under the law.\n\nMcCraney, now a paralegal working with others seeking early release, recounted the crime at his resentencing hearing. He told a judge that he and Stewart had gone that day to confront Mark Rosebure, 22, at an apartment building in Southeast Washington. McCraney said Rosebure stole money from him and threatened his mother. By McCraney\u2019s account, Rosebure made a gesture to his waistband, prompting he and Stewart to pull out their weapons and shoot.\n\nProsecutors had called the crime a robbery gone bad. The teens fired nearly a dozen shots.\n\n[As a teen he killed a man. A new law has given him a second chance]\n\nWhile in prison, Stewart earned his GED in 2009 and racked up 1400 hours of educational programs including behavior modification, anger management and African studies. He also studied yoga. He has taken college courses at Georgetown University, where he met Marc Howard, the founding director of Georgetown\u2019s prison education program. Howard is working with Kardashian-West on her documentary and introduced her to Stewart.\n\nStewart, Howard said, \u201cis the perfect representation that people are greater than the worst things they\u2019ve done and that people transform over time.\u201d\n\nBut federal prosecutors \u2014 as they have done with the majority of the other applicants \u2014 opposed immediate release for Stewart. They stressed that, unlike some others who applied for resentencing, Stewart had more than one case. He had been convicted of two assault-with-deadly-weapon cases prior to the murder.\n\nAlso, Stewart was cited for 32 violations while in prison, including a 2016 possession of a weapon and drugs in his cell.\n\nProsecutors also noted that Stewart twice appealed, arguing that he was innocent of the homicide charge. He even filed a sworn affidavit that said he and another childhood friend were in New York when Rosebure was killed.\n\nAt a D.C. Superior Court hearing last month, Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Cahill said those infractions proved Stewart was not ready to be set free. Cahill said he would not oppose having Stewart released in eight to 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe government believes he needs more time to prove that he will have no more violations and no longer turns to drugs and violence,\u201d he said.\n\nHenthorne said Stewart\u2019s fictitious innocence claims were prior to her taking his case. \u201cI wish he had not done it, and he wishes he had not done it. He was desperate with a life sentence,\u201d she said.\n\nHenthorne argued Stewart has now accepted his responsibility for the murder and has devoted his time to working with youth to make sure they do not make similar mistakes.\n\nAt an August hearing, Stewart stood before Salerno and described his childhood. He spoke of how when he was 6 years old, his mother paid a man $250 to kill Stewart\u2019s father. The murder happened while Stewart and sister were in their Northwest D.C. home.\n\nStewart\u2019s mother, Gloria, then 29, told authorities she had been repeatedly abused by her husband. She was convicted of murder and sentenced to 13 years to life in prison. Stewart and his sister went to live with relatives, who he said were physically abusive.\n\nStewart told the judge he struggled with the loss of his parents, especially his father, Robert, whom he referred to as his \u201chero.\u201d Robert Stewart earned his doctorate degree in Liberia then moved to the United States, securing a job at Howard University, where he worked until his death at age 38.\n\n\u201cLosing my mother and my father caused a shift in my life. When I was a teenager, I forgot what my father stood for,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nStewart than began to cry. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand trauma and what it is to overcome trauma. I\u2019m not perfect. But I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d Stewart\u2019s mother rushed out of the courtroom sobbing.\n\nStewart also publicly accepted responsibility for the murder. \u201cI apologize to Mr. Rosebure\u2019s family. I apologize to my family. I apologize to everyone. I am guilty.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, Salerno said he was most concerned about the victim\u2019s families in Stewart\u2019s cases, which is why he set another hearing to allow them to speak.\n\nRosebure\u2019s niece, Marquieta Bagley, could not be reached for comment. But she previously said in court she did not oppose early release for McCraney, Stewart\u2019s co-defendant, if he was indeed rehabilitated and pledged to work with troubled youth.\n\nHenthorne said Stewart is a changed person with something to offer his community. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to be completely perfect while in prison,\u201d she said. \u201cThe law is about looking at the person\u2019s trajectory. Is the person the same as who they were when they committed the crime? And are they a danger to community?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA child touched an electrified railing at MGM National Harbor resort, and lives changed.\n\nFound insane in one killing, police say D.C. man killed again\n\n\u2018Aryan\u2019 and \u2018Octoroon\u2019: Couples challenge racial labels to get married in Virginia\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A judge has decided to grant the inmate, now 39, early release", "authors": ["Keith L.
