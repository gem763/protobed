He just missed a few, just missed a few, and I think he\u2019s been doing that ever since he got here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve expressed to him many times, \u2018If you stay in the strike zone and don\u2019t swing at balls, with your swing and your ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark you\u2019re going to be very successful.\u2019\u201d\n\nTexas trailed 6-4 before rallying in the seventh. Elvis Andrus had the big blow, a two-run single that put the Rangers ahead to stay.\n\nTrey Mancini hit his 30th homer for Baltimore, and Richie Martin added a three-run shot. Anthony Santander also went deep, extending his hitting streak to 11 games.\n\nDespite battling a stomach ailment, Texas rookie Brock Burke still managed to get through five innings. He was charged with six runs and six hits.\n\n\u201cI lost probably eight or nine pounds,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI definitely felt slow and not as strong as I normally did.\u201d\n\nBrett Martin (2-3) worked a scoreless sixth inning for the win, and Jos\u00e9 Leclerc got three outs for his 11th save.\n\nOrioles reliever Paul Fry (1-8) entered in the seventh and walked his first two batters, loading the bases. Shin-Soo Choo then singled in Scott Heineman, trimming Baltimore\u2019s lead to one.\n\nAfter Shawn Armstrong replaced Fry, Andrus drove in Ronald Guzm\u00e1n and Jose Trevino with a single to center.\n\nBaltimore threatened in the ninth, putting runners on second and third with one out. But Leclerc struck out Mancini and got Santander on a popup to earn a save for the second consecutive night.\n\nThe Orioles have dropped six of seven to fall to 46-94 on the season. They are 0-84 when trailing after eight innings.\n\nCalhoun, who was mired in a 2-for-22 skid, hit a two-out solo drive off Dylan Bundy in the first. Mancini responded in the bottom half with his first homer in 20 games.\n\nMartin made it 4-1 Baltimore with a three-run shot off Burke with two outs in the second. It was Martin\u2019s first homer since June 25 and No. 5 on the year.\n\n\u201cMy job is to get on base and just square the ball up anyway I can,\u201d Martin said. \u201cFortunately it happened to go out today.\u201d\n\nAfter Calhoun tied it again with a three-run homer in the third, Santander belted a two-run shot in the fifth.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to tell myself to hit the ball on the barrel today, instead of hitting the ball off the end of my bat,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cToday, I just tried to hit the ball off the barrel, and I got two good pitches to hit.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRangers: OF Joey Gallo (right wrist surgery) has taken batting practice over the past week. Woodward hopes to get him back in the lineup before the end of the season. Gallo has not played since July 23. He is batting .253 with 22 homers and 49 RBIs over 70 games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers: Jonathan Hernandez (1-0, 1.59 ERA) will serve as the opener in the third game of the series.\n\nOrioles: RHP Aaron Brooks (4-7, 5.81 ERA) struggled with his command in his last start, allowing three runs and walking four over just 4 1/3 innings in a 6-4 loss to the Royals.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Trying to break out of a slump, Willie Calhoun got rid of each of his old bats.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Todd Karpovich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/rangers_orioles_baseball_71409_c0-151-3606-2253_s1770x1032.jpg?eb5068f382a33e0a80a59260304486b00b110f48", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
