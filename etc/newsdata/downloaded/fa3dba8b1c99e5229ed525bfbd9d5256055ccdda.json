Critics of the law, however, worry the system risks exposing workers to exploitation.\n\nUnder the new system, one category of \u201cspecified skilled workers\u201d can stay up to five years but cannot bring families. A second category would allow workers to bring families and stay longer.\n\nSasaki said 205 people had been approved to receive the new visas as of the end of August and 684 had interim status while in the process getting approval. She expected the numbers to increase as understanding of the system spreads.", "description": "Japan needs to improve medical care at immigration detention centres, the head of the country's recently created Immigration Services Agency said, following widespread criticism of the care available to detainees.", "authors": ["Linda Sieg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
