Around 50 troops withdrew on Monday from the border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, which were the first targets of the Turkish advance.\n\nThe highway is also an important conduit for the limited amounts of aid leaving northeast Syria. Aid workers said humanitarian organizations are also in the process of withdrawing staff as the fighting moves deeper into Syria.\n\nAD\n\nLoveluck reported from Irbil, Iraq.
