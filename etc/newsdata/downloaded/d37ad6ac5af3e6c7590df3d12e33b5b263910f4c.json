This information is required for WHO to be able to fully assess the potential risk posed by this event.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d one international health official told the Guardian. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this disease is. The symptoms in the sister of the initial patient are different to the symptoms we\u2019ve seen in the Ebola outbreak in Congo, which could suggest it is a different strain, but we just don\u2019t know and that is what is driving the concern.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian understands that concern in Uganda, where the first patient visited, is elevated enough that it has initiated its own victim contact tracing.\n\nAlthough Tanzania has never recorded a case of Ebola, the well-publicised challenges around the recent outbreak in DRC \u2013 which has claimed almost 2,000 lives \u2013 has prompted widespread anxiety in the region over the threat posed by Ebola and similar diseases.\n\nCases of Ebola patients crossing borders during this outbreak have been rare.\n\nIn June, a family of Congolese with sick family members crossed into Uganda via a bush path. Two died of Ebola inside Uganda. And in August, a nine-year-old Congolese girl tested positive for Ebola and later died in Uganda after travelling from Congo.\n\nCommenting last week on the controversy that has surrounded the Tanzania cases, Dr Yonas Woldemariam, the WHO representative in Uganda, said: \u201cThis mysterious disease has to be investigated and samples have to be tested. We couldn\u2019t rule out any of the viral hemorrhagic fevers and the investigation will continue.\u201d\n\nThe row came as the WHO announced DRC will start using a second experimental Ebola vaccine.\n\nSince this outbreak was declared in August 2018, more than 200,000 people have received doses of a vaccine made by Merck, which will continue to be used in Congo.\n\nIn a statement, WHO said the second vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, will be used from October in areas where Ebola is not actively spreading.\n\nUsing the second vaccine \u201cwill ensure that we have potentially an additional tool to prevent the expansion of the outbreak\u201d, said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s Africa director.", "description": "World Health Organization frustrated by lack of clinical data sharing, while Tanzania insists its tests show disease is not Ebola", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63b46e38dd47b582c8d512376a39170091b0ced2/0_348_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bbceb82ecbf45854132efbfe1711b75", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
