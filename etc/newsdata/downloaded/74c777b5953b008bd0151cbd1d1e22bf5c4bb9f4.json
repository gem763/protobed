USA TODAY\n\nJoe Girardi stepped down as manager of Team USA last week, indicating he anticipated a shot at managing in MLB once again. That bet paid off, and instead of spending his summer at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, he will lead the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThe Phillies hired Girardi on Thursday, according to multiple reports, culminating the search process began two weeks ago following the dismissal of Gabe Kapler.\n\nGirardi, 55, spent his playing career as a catcher with Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals. He won three World Series rings with the Yankees as a player and returned to lead them to the 2009 title as the manager.\n\nThe Illinois native's managing career began in 2006 with the Florida Marlins, in which he went 78-84. The Yankees hired him before the 2008 season and he spent the next 10 seasons on the top step of the dugout in the Bronx. New York dismissed him following the 2017 season, when the Yankees fell in Game 7 of the ALCS. The Yankees were 910-710 under him.\n\nFormer Yankees manager Joe Girardi replaces Gabe Kapler as manager of the Phillies.

The Phillies have not made the playoffs since since 2011 and Girardi's primary task will be leading the team to October success.\n\nAccording to MLB.com, well-traveled former managers Dusty Baker and Buck Showalter received second-round interviews with the team.", "description": "The Philadelphia Phillies hired Joe Girardi as their manager on Thursday, according to multiple reports.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
