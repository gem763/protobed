Thank you for welcoming me into you inbox yet again.\n\nLast week, I talked about Zuckerberg\u2019s quest to tell us that Facebook has governing principles when he\u2019s really just building the stairs one step at a time.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox here, and follow my tweets here.\n\nThe big story\n\nPlenty of ink has been spilled on WeWork and SoftBank and WeWork\u2019s Adam Neumann, and yet it still feels like not nearly enough people are talking about it.\n\nThe startup\u2019s post-S1 saga has just been just so messy that it\u2019s understandable one could only grab a sneaking glance of headlines before having to look way.\n\nOne reason everyone is talking about it because Neumann\u2019s maneuverings have created an anthology of sketchy founder dealings that\u2019s nearly cartoon villain worthy. He\u2019s got the eccentricities of Jack Dorsey, the frattiness of Evan Spiegel and the \u201cchange the world\u201d delusions of Elizabeth Holmes. Critiques of WeWork weren\u2019t all that sparse preceding its S-1, and yet many of venture capital\u2019s talking heads had some kind of founder-friendly admiration for someone that seemed to had bent the world\u2019s heftiest venture capital fund to his will.\n\nIt\u2019s far beyond the pleasantries now, what happens to WeWork could deeply shape how late-stage venture capital operates. SoftBank was raising the second vision fund just as WeWork\u2019s shit hit the fan and now it\u2019s the fund\u2019s deepest embarrassment and a financial commitment they\u2019ve poured $18.5 billion into. If WeWork craters, that second vision could fall far short of its aspirations. Plenty of Silicon Valley\u2019s investors would be happy to see control shift to more even-handed institutional forces who did not have capital commands that could set terms with a glance. Nevertheless, there are an awful lot of unicorns that have depended on SoftBank\u2019s growth capital up to this point who would be in danger of being left high and dry.\n\nAt this point, SoftBank\u2019s sunk costs have led the desperate fund to go all-in on a sans-Neumann WeWork. They will have to shape the business on their own. They enabled Neumann and now they are left with the task of reverse engineering a disaster into a great turnaround story.\n\nSend me feedback\n\non Twitter @lucasmtny or email\n\nlucas@techcrunch.com\n\nOn to the rest of the week\u2019s news.\n\nTrends of the week\n\nHere are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context:\n\nExtra! Extra!\n\nFacebook is getting into the news game once again, paying publishers and building an Apple News-like product called Facebook News that is determined to give America access to trusted news. Facebook is doing great fresh out of the gate by giving Breitbart the distinction as a trusted news source. Kudos, Mark. What could go wrong?\n\nFacebook is getting into the news game once again, paying publishers and building an Apple News-like product called Facebook News that is determined to give America access to trusted news. Facebook is doing great fresh out of the gate by giving Breitbart the distinction as a trusted news source. Kudos, Mark. What could go wrong? Netflix keeps racking up the bills\n\nHit TV shows don\u2019t feel like they should be as expensive as building a quantum computer and yet Netflix\u2019s hefty original content spending is still chugging along. The streaming company announced this week they\u2019re raising $2 billion in debt to fund its next efforts, which may or may not include another 14 seasons of Stranger Things.\n\nHit TV shows don\u2019t feel like they should be as expensive as building a quantum computer and yet Netflix\u2019s hefty original content spending is still chugging along.

Antitrust attorneys general\n\nThis week was another rough one for Facebook, a New York antitrust investigation picked up the support of a whole lot of other states as the probe seeks out anticompetitive practices. There are now 47 attorneys general taking part.\n\nGAFA Gaffes\n\nHow did the top tech companies screw up this week? This clearly needs its own section, in order of badness:\n\nDisrupt Berlin\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s already that time of the year again, but we just announced the agenda for Disrupt Berlin and we\u2019ve got some all-stars making their way to the stage. I\u2019ll be there this year, get some tickets and come say hey!\n\nSign up for more newsletters in your inbox (including this one) here.", "description": "Hey everyone.
