Australia\u2019s banks still have advantages over their international peers, but if the outlook continues to weaken we see potential risks,\u201d said Sharad Jain, the director of financial institutions ratings at S &P Global.\n\nThe weaker outlook for the banks has seen a large number of international investors abandon the sector with a survey released on Wednesday showing fewer than nine out of every 10 hold a position in major Australian banks.\n\nPerformance of the major banks has been held back by a series of cyclical and structural changes, including the prudential regulator\u2019s \u201cunquestionably strong\u201d capital requirements which recognise that the economy relies on international funding to support growth.\n\nLower official rates further squeeze bank interest margins because hundreds of billions of dollars in deposits are already at or near zero, while lower rates also make bank deposits less attractive to customers.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison attacked the banks for \"profiteering\". AAP\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison failed to mention the changing operating environment last week when he attacked the banks, saying \u201cthey never learn\u201d and they were \u201cprofiteering\u201d for failing to pass on the full extent of the Reserve Bank\u2019s cut.\n\nIf bank credit ratings were lowered, the cost of wholesale funding raised in global funding markets could rise. This could force up borrowing rates across the economy if banks passed the extra costs through to customers or put even more pressure on dividends.\n\n\u201cWe do see the fact that banks are profitable as creating a buffer against any unforeseen developments in their earnings,\u201d Mr Jain said. \u201cGenerating returns to satisfy shareholders without taking on risky activities is something we view as positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the pressures on earnings continue, that could start to put pressure on the ratings - although we do not currently see that as an issue. It is more of a tail risk.\n\n\u201cBut if the banks continue to take cuts in earnings, the strength the banks enjoy because of their buffers and their low risk appetite, those advantages and strengths could erode as well.\n\n\u201cThe backdrop is earnings pressure from subdued credit growth, higher remediation costs and, on top of that, banks are in the process of reducing non-core banking businesses. Banks would be inclined to try to take actions, where feasible, to protect their earnings.\u201d\n\nMoody's Investors Service also welcomed the banks\u2019 decision to buttress profits in the challenging environment, adding that strong profits were positive for the credit rating.\n\nNAB executive Mike Baird said conditions were \"unprecedented\". Peter Braig\n\n\u201cBank profits are facing increasing pressure from slow loan growth, competition, low interest rates and elevated costs for regulation and customer remediation. Given these pressures, it\u2019s no surprise that banks are reluctant to pass on the full rate cut,\u201d said Daniel Yu, Moody's senior analyst for financial institutions.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we view steady profitability as credit positive.\u201d\n\nSenior bank executives speaking privately are concerned about the potential for lower returns to drive funding costs higher when they seek to raise debt abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is the return on equity over the longer term that drives the ratings on our debt issuance offshore,\u201d said a senior executive of one of the major banks.\n\nFitch Ratings also backed the banks' decision to hold back some of the cut. Jack Do, Fitch's director of financial institutions, said, \"The profitability of the Australian major banks has been and continues to be under pressure and the sector faces a number of headwinds, including the low interest rate environment. Further rate cuts are possible and would add to this pressure.\n\n\"The major banks have been under increased scrutiny over recent years which means there has been greater public and political pressure to pass on rate cuts in full.\n\n\"We believe the banks holding back some of the cuts is a business decision to alleviate pressure on [the net interest margin] and provide some protection to profitability.\"\n\nResearch house IBISWorld said the possibility of unconventional monetary policy in the form of negative interest rates loomed large over the sector and would have a major impact on its viability.\n\nFund manager Geoff Wilson said strong banks were the cornerstone of a strong economy. Supplied\n\nIBISWorld analyst Jason Aranvis said the ability for banks to protect their margins would be further eroded with many depositors taking the hint from the Reserve Bank and choosing to deploy the capital in other ways.\n\n\u201cNegative interest rate policy represents a serious threat to the profitability of the big four banks in Australia, which enjoy some of the highest margins in the developed world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe profitability of our banks has become a concern beyond our borders with research showing global fund managers are finding better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nA survey of global funds with $US1.2 trillion under management found 91 per cent of funds had zero exposure to Australian banks.\n\n\u201cRegulatory concerns, faltering housing markets and a low interest rate environment have prompted global investors to all but throw in the towel,\u201d said Steven Holden, CEO of Copley Fund Research.\n\nCopley says this is the lowest take-up since it began tracking Australian bank holdings of global funds since 2011. The research covers 430 funds which Copley says are finding more attractive investment opportunities in Singapore and India.\n\nThe ratings agencies are not specific on what is the appropriate level of bank profitability.\n\nThe major banks remain highly profitable but return on equity has drifted down from above 16 per cent in 2014 to around 11 per cent, according to last week's RBA financial stability review.\n\n\u201cThe simple answer is that banks need to balance passing on rate cuts with protecting profits - and I don\u2019t know what the right balance is,\u201d Mr Yu said.\n\nS &P\u2019s Mr Jain said if lower interest rates reduced earnings significantly, this could force management to drift into more risky areas of lending \u2013 another negative for the ratings outlook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPolitical pressures and more broadly social pressures is something the banks need to be mindful of because that is part of their franchise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be interesting to watch how they respond to it.\n\n\u201cIf current business philosophy is not sufficient to generate returns that satisfy their shareholders, they might start looking at ways of making money that could be risky to the system.\u201d\n\nFitch has a negative outlook on the Australian banks due to slowing credit growth, margin pressure, pressure on household finances and increasing regulatory requirements.", "description": "Credit ratings agencies have warned that political pressure on banks to pass official interest rate cuts on to their customers in full may undermine their AA- credit ratings and raise their cost of funding in wholesale markets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb1a1f08b925e6a9c3b87ff3e6a51bfeb0b3e600", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
