When you think of waste, don't just think of stale food, plastic shopping bags or soft drink bottles choking your roadside garbage bin. Picture all your discarded phones, old laptops, dead computers, broken printers, and other gadgets along with it. You may not consider it as waste, but that doesn't change the facts.\n\nA dismantled old printer\n\nAs per 2017 data, India generates 2 million tonnes of e-waste per year. Last year, it was expected to touch 3.3 million tonnes, and by 2020 our country will generate 5 million tonnes of annual e-waste. These are staggering numbers, not to be taken lightly at all.\n\nYour old electronics may not smell or look as gross as the overflowing trash dump festering down the road, but they're just as bad as waste. And in most cases, they can be much worse and toxic than regular waste out there.\n\nDon't Miss 44.1 K SHARES 6.8 K SHARES 5.1 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 903 SHARES\n\nIt's a huge problem that's only going to get worse, he says. I have no reason to doubt him, seeing how Kiran Panchal is the director of Just Dispose Recycling Pvt Ltd, a government authorised e-waste management facility situated on the outskirts of Mumbai.\n\nTackling India's e-waste\n\nAn e-waste processing plant can't keep up with demand these days, Mr Panchal tells me, as he gives me a tour of Just Dispose premises. The place is a beehive of activity, with assembly lines of workers tearing, stripping, dismantling and segregating electronics and their waste components.\n\nWorkers dismantling gadgets at Just Dispose\n\nI saw printers being taken apart and disposed off, with trained professionals wearing gloves and other protective gear as they systematically shredded the commonly found office device down to its bare elements.\n\nHuge dumpster sized machines stood one after the other, the likes of which I had never seen before. If it weren't for their labels, I wouldn't have guessed what they all did. A toner powder collector lets you strip a printer's toner safely in a metal box with a glass pane and glove holes for your hands to slide inside.\n\nNext to the toner powder collector stood an equally intimidating machine labelled the hard disk shredder. It had a large slit on the top, like a toaster does, allowing you to slide in old or discarded hard drives from your PC or laptop. The machine is essentially a giant mixer -- similar to the one you have in your kitchen to blitz condiments into a paste or make vegetable shakes -- with a few knobs on top that spurs it into action. After you throw a hard drive down its hatch, it churns and rumbles, and spits out spiral metal threads into a tray -- which is all that's left of the hard drive. It's a great spectacle to watch, actually.\n\nToner powder collector and hard disk shredder at Just Dispose\n\nThere's a dedicated CD-DVD shredder, which is just a giant-sized paper shredder you see in any office these days. Next to it is a heavy duty plastic shredder, where broken plastic chunks are thrown in from the top, shredded and grounded into smaller, finer plastic pellets which are easy to recycle.\n\nJust Dispose's facility also has a tape shredder (where audio cassette or video cassette tapes are stripped off and shredded down), dust collector (making sure pollutants aren't floating around in the air during product dismantling) and even a wire stripper. The wire stripper, Mr Panchal tells me, is one of the most overlooked piece of recycling equipment, since old electrical wires are one of the most common forms of e-waste out there, and separating the copper wire from its plastic insulating sheath is very important to recycle both materials.\n\nCD and DVD shredder next to heavy duty plastic shredder at Just Dispose\n\nIn case you are wondering, think of any electronics or gadget you can think of, and you'll find them stripped down to essentially just three basic components in an e-waste recycling plant -- metal, plastic and glass. They are sent forward to suppliers of components to electronics manufacturers, thus completing the cycle.\n\nMr Panchal's quite proud of the fact that no piece of e-waste that comes inside Just Dispose's facility ever goes into a landfill, as total e-waste recycling is ensured as per guidelines set by CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) which strictly prohibits disturbing ecological balance with any form of e-waste disposal.\n\nCorporate e-waste initiatives\n\nEPR or Extended Producer Responsibility where a manufacturer is held responsible for the end-of-life processing and recycling of a product or gadget is helping create corporate awareness in matters related to e-waste, according to Mr Panchal, who counts LIC Of India, Epson, Kyocera, TVS Electronics amongst their clients and partners, which are over 250 in count.\n\nCroma electronic stores -- part of the Tata Group -- also count Just Dispose as their e-waste recycling partner. When I ask him what type of products does Croma collect from customers for e-waste recycling, Mr Ritesh Ghosal, Chief Marketing Officer, Croma - Inifiniti Retail Ltd says \"Basically everything that we sell.\"\n\nReuters\n\nHe emphasizes that all the old, usable or unusable electronic items which can be refurbished or can be disposed in an environment-friendly manner is collected from the customers. This includes everything from batteries, chargers, adapters, to television sets and amplifiers. There's also remotes, DVD Player, earphones, music systems, computers/laptops, irons, trimmers, hair dryers, refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, mixers, oven, toasters, water filters, printers and much more.\n\nThat's not all that Croma does when you send them your e-waste. \"We promise to plant a tree in your name for the e-waste you dispose; which will benefit the endangered species, provide employment opportunities amongst tribals and will provide flowers, fruit, fodder, fuel and material for artisanal products to the rural communities as well,\" claims Mr Ghosal. In fact, just in the last one year itself, Croma has planted more than 1 lakh trees on behalf of their consumers, according to him.\n\nNo more outsourcing\n\nWhen I ask Mr Panchal what made him start Just Dispose over 11 years ago, when the \"concept of e-waste was alien at best in India\" according to him, as back then India was among the top e-waste dumping yards for countries like the US.\n\nHe tells me how he returned from the US just as e-waste import was banned in India, and coupled with the fact that India's own e-waste generation was catching momentum, he decided to start his own e-waste recycling plant. \"Having seen the e-waste facilities in the United States, I felt we should also have a scientific way of handling the e-waste and that's how we started in 2008,\" Mr Panchal recollects.\n\nKiran Panchal, Director, Just Dispose Recycling Pvt Ltd\n\nMr Panchal feels credit should be given to the government for creating an ecosystem, generating awareness, and making sure that everyone's responsible and answerable to policies governing e-waste in Maharashtra -- the largest generator of e-waste in the country.\n\nAs we speak, the phone rings on Mr Panchal's desk. His associate picks it up, takes down the caller's details and promises to call them back later in the day. He tells me it's a business call -- new client trying to find a solution to their e-waste problem. \"We easily get at least two such calls in a day,\" confirms Mr Panchal with a big smile. He's clearly happy, as the e-waste business continues to grow in India.\n\nWhat's more, from processing and recycling 750 tonnes of e-waste annually, Just Dispose's new facility will soon tackle an additional 1200 tonnes of e-waste per year -- in a highly automated manner, extracting even precious metals from electronic circuits and reprocessing plastic. As they say, one man's trash is another man's cash. And that tells you everything you need to know about e-waste in India in a nutshell.", "description": "India generates about 2 million tonnes of e-waste per year, and that number's only expected to grow in the coming years.
