This is only the second time in MLB history the league has seen four teams with at least 100 losses. The Tigers, Brewers, Rays and Royals all lost 100 or more games in 2002.\n\nThe Dodgers, Yankees and Astros could soon have company in the 100-win club as the Braves (96-61), Twins (96-60) and surprising Athletics (94-62) all have a shot at hitting triple-digit wins.\n\nWith the Yanks, Dodgers and \u2018Stros already in the 100-win club, this is now the third consecutive year at least three teams have reached the century mark. Before the three-year run, that had only happened five other times (1942, 1977, 1998, 2002 and 2003).\n\nThe historic winning and losing highlights the growing gap between MLB\u2019s best and MLB\u2019s worst. It\u2019s also clear that one has to do with the other as the Astros and Yankees likely would not have as many wins as they do were they not able to beat up on the bottom feeders in American League in the form of the Tigers, Orioles and Royals.\n\nAs for the Dodgers, they\u2019ve only played the N.L.\u2019s Marlins six times (winning five), so they probably would have hit 100 wins no matter what.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at ESPN", "description": "On Sunday, the LA Dodgers entered elite company while the Kansas City Royals took up residence with the dregs of Major League Baseball.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170299247-e1569249915547.jpg?fit=872%2C581", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
