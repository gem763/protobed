The time of 37.10 seconds was the third-fastest in history, beaten only by the Jamaican teams of 2011 featuring Usain Bolt.\n\nBritain, the champion in 2017, took silver ahead of Japan.\n\nJamaican didn\u2019t even reach the men\u2019s 4\u00d7100 final but won the women\u2019s race as Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce earned her ninth career world championship gold medal.

The 2017 world champion Faith Kipyegon of Kenya took a distant silver, with bronze for Gudaf Tsegay of Ethiopia.\n\nHassan is part of the Nike Oregon Project team, which was headed by Salazar until he was banned for doping offenses Tuesday. Hassan has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is now working with a replacement coach.\n\nAnother runner from the camp, Konstanze Klosterhalfen of Germany, took bronze in the 5,000 the same evening. Klosterhalfen was shoulder-to-shoulder with three Kenyans on the final lap before Hellen Obiri pulled clear to win gold from Margaret Chelimo Kipkemboi.\n\nMore history was made in the men\u2019s shot put, as four athletes beat the old championship record in a contest decided by a single centimeter.\n\nJoe Kovacs took gold for the U.S. with 22.91 meters on his final throw, against the 22.90 thrown by silver medalist and fellow American Ryan Crouser and New Zealand\u2019s bronze medalist Tomas Walsh.\n\nYulimar Rojas repeated as world women\u2019s triple jump champion for Venezuela, leaping 15.37 meters in the second round.
