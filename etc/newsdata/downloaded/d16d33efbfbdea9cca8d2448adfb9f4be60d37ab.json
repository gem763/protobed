However, its sudden jump to new highs has been fuelled by a sharp decline in short positions, with bears closing -9,599 short contacts. We\u2019re yet to see the index break to new highs, but bears fleeing could be the first steps towards such an event.\n\nAUD Large Speculative Positioning\n\nNZD Large Speculative Positioning\n\nAUD: Traders are their least bearish on the Aussie in 6 months, having reduced gross-short exposure. That we\u2019ve not see an increase of longs suggests it could be corrective behaviour as opposed to a turnaround, but worth noting none the less as prices remain near multi-year lows as bears lose interest. And this was despite that fact that Tuesday\u2019s RBA minutes saw a higher chance of a 25 bps cut next month.\n\nLarge Speculative Positioning (As % Of Open Interest)\n\nNZD: Net-short exposure hit a record high, although it was achieved on the closer of longs as opposed to initiation of fresh shorts. Still, with net and gross short exposure at record levels, it\u2019s highly possible we\u2019re at or approaching a sentiment extreme. So bears beware.\n\nAs of Tuesday 17th September:\n\nMinor changes to gold positioning saw bears remain sidelined\n\nBearish exposure on hit a 6-week low\n\nBullish exposure to hit a 6-week high\n\nGold Large Speculative Positioning\n\nGold: Despite its epic rally, bears remain hesitant to commit and bulls remain defiant. With prices holding above $1500, it\u2019s possible bulls are carving out a corrective low. So we\u2019ll continue to monitor this key level as it could prove to be the springboard for next advance, or the trigger for a deeper correction..\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: AUD/USD, XAU/USD, USD/NZD, US Dollar Index Futures.
