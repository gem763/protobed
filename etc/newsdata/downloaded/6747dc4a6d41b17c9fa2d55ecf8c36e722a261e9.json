He was a San Diego Padres draft pick but was traded to Washington, along with Trea Turner, in a three-team deal in December 2014. Ross made his big-league debut the following season.\n\nRoss was used as both a reliever and a starter in 2019. He started the regular season in a bullpen role, but enjoyed little success, sporting an 11.05 ERA through June 22.\n\nBut from July 21 through the end of the regular season, Ross was utilized in the No. 5 starter role and had his moments. He won three straight decisions at the beginning of August and held the Cleveland Indians to four hits and one earned run in a win Sept. 29.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t on the 25-man roster for the wild card game, the divisional round or the championship series, but manager Dave Martinez picked him for the World Series roster.\n\nMartinez said Sunday that he believes Ross can throw 75 to 80 pitches, after which he\u2019ll turn to the bullpen.\n\nFellow Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg expressed confidence in Ross ahead of Game 5.\n\n\u201cJoe has kind of done a little bit of everything this year,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a great competitor. He\u2019s such a great athlete. I trust his ability to prepare. I think that\u2019s one thing that having some of the struggles early on in the year with him, he really took another step as far as like preparation, doing his homework, and you just take notice of those things. That\u2019s his own journey.\n\n\u201cHe knows I\u2019m here for him but at the same time, you\u2019ve just got to let him go out and do his thing.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
