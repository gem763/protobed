I'm stunned,' Fazio told Roma TV. 'Nobody was disturbing the eyeline of the referee and we all saw it wasn't a penalty.\n\n'He had some doubts too, but now we are accustomed to getting on the wrong end of refereeing decisions. We're getting damaged a lot, both at the Olimpico and outside.'\n\nRoma striker, Edin Dzeko, added: 'The referee kept insisting it was a penalty, I told him it was his face and not the hand. You could see the mark on Smalling's face where the ball hit him. You can't give a penalty like that at the 95th minute. It's unacceptable.'\n\nEven Gladbach's official Twitter account was left bemused by the incident after posting a tweet which read: 'ERMMMMMM?'\n\nThe Bundesliga side even apologised after updating fans of their late equaliser, while hordes of football fans sympathised with Smalling and Roma's plight.\n\nRoma had earlier led through a first half strike from Italy midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo before being forced to settle for a point which leaves them a point ahead of Istanbul Basaksehir at the top of Group J.", "description": "Chris Smalling was left stunned after conceding a 95th minute penalty in Roma's 1-1 draw with Borussia Monchengladbach - despite the ball hitting him in the face.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20155276-0-image-a-9_1571954271997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
