In that match, France showed glimpses of its old flair to lead 20-3 at halftime, but then a familiar pattern unfolded as nerves took over.\n\n\u201cWe finished the match giving 14 fouls away and, by miracle, we won,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cNormally you lose when you make so many mistakes. It went our way; good for us.\u201d\n\nLopez is one of 12 changes to the French starting lineup to take on a U.S. team which lost its opening game to England 45-7.\n\nWhile France traditionally favors a running style of rugby, and should feel fairly confident of scoring tries against the U.S., Lopez sees the match as an essential opportunity to develop a kicking game France has neglected in the past.\n\nTactical kicking \u201cis becoming more and more important. The English did it to us during the (Six Nations) tournament. It\u2019s their bread and butter,\u201d said Lopez, who wins his 26th test cap. \u201cI\u2019m convinced you need to able to do everything well, and a kicking game is an important weapon to have.\u201d\n\nEven though France has swapped out its entire pack, the U.S. forwards are the ones under more pressure to perform. U.S. defensive coach Jacque Fourie was dismayed at times by the poor tackling and lack of communication against England.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big beast lying ahead of us and that\u2019s France. We need to mentally and physically be ready for that challenge. I don\u2019t think we can get any worse,\u201d said Fourie, a versatile back who played 74 tests for South Africa and won the 2007 World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe need to rock up and we need to make our tackles. If you don\u2019t make your tackles, you\u2019re going to end up behind the advantage line every time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to stop their lineout mauls, because they\u2019re going to lick their lips from what they saw against England.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s backs have looked better since Fabien Galthie - a former standout scrumhalf - joined coach Jacques Brunel\u2019s staff.\n\nFitness levels and creativity have both improved in the four matches Galthie has been involved in. For observers watching the Argentina match, the animated Galthie appeared to be the one in charge and making calls from the bench.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve certainly, over the last two months or so since he\u2019s been there, changed their style of play a little bit,\u201d said U.S. coach Gary Gold, who made five changes to the starting XV. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our work cut out.\u201d\n\nWith nearly one week between the games, Gold encouraged his players to take time away from the competition and liven up their minds.\n\n\u201cJapan is just an amazing country,\u201d Gold said. \u201cIf they want to go down to the beach or hop on a train and go and see something of Japan, they should get away from rugby. Go and have a laugh and a few coffees.\u201d\n\nThere were doubts the game at Hakatanomori Stadium would go ahead because of nearby Typhoon Mitag.\n\nBut World Rugby gave the green light on Monday, after weather information experts said the typhoon is lessening in strength and moving westward away from Japan\u2019s coastline.\n\nFrance\u2019s players will wear black armbands in memory of former French President Jacques Chirac, who led France from 1995 to 2007 and died last Thursday at the age of 86. A minute\u2019s silence will be held before the game.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nFrance: Thomas Ramos, Alivereti Raka, Sofiane Guitoune, Gael Fickou, Yoann Huget, Camille Lopez, Maxime Machenaud; Louis Picamoles (captain), Yacouba Camara, Arthur Iturria, Paul Gabrillagues, Bernard Le Roux, Emerick Setiano, Camille Chat, Cyril Baille.
