'It was never a case of one or two small blackheads.'\n\n'Over the next four years by skin got progressively worse. On bad days I wouldn't even leave the house.'\n\nRebecca John, 28, from Swindon, has praised a \u00a36 charcoal bar for dramatically improving her severe acne in just eight weeks\n\nThe mother-of-two never suffered from acne as a teenager, but everything changed after she had her second child at the age of 24.

As supportive as he was, I would never let him stay over as I didn't want him to see my face.'\n\nRebecca's acne started affecting every aspect of her life. She wouldn't have photos taken with her children on special occasions and as such, felt like she missed out,\n\n'I felt completely horrific,' she explained. 'I wouldn't go to the park with other mums and their children, and I would often ask friends to collect my children from school.'\n\n'I just felt like everyone at the school gates was looking at me, and I didn't want to embarrass my children in front of their school friends.'\n\nRebecca spotted the charcoal-based skincare range called Carbon Theory on the Boots website. Pictured, the bar\n\nShe added: 'Even my children noticed. My four-year-old son commented: \"Mummy - your face is disgusting!\"\n\nRebecca attempted to treat her acne with various treatments - both prescription and over-the-counter.\n\n'Nothing worked,' she explained. 'I tried everything.'\n\n'My GP prescribed me the antibiotic Lymecycline, but it made no difference.'\n\n'I bought various over-the-counter treatments including benzoyl peroxide but nothing ever worked.'\n\nBefore using the 'miracle' product, Rebecca told how she would never let her partner stay over as she didn't want him to see her face. Pictured, on 21 April 2019\n\nThe stay-at-home mum told how between February and July this year, her skin underwent a huge transformation.

'The Facial Cleansing bar was only \u00a36 and had received brilliant reviews'.\n\nRebecca bought the bar and started using it every day - morning and night.\n\n'It drew the toxins out of my skin,' she explained. 'I couldn't believe it. After eight weeks my skin was clear.'\n\nRebecca told how she tried to treat her acne with various treatments before finding the charcoal bar.

'I feel like a different person - I'm so much happier'.\n\nRebecca shared her photos with Carbon Theory on Instagram and has been inundated with messages from other acne sufferers - including a mum whose 11-year-old son has the skin condition.\n\n'It's actually been really lovely to hear from so many people,' she said. 'I've felt very conscious of sharing my photos, and it's been met with such a positive response'.\n\nSince her skin has cleared up, the stay-at-home mother said she feels like a different person.
