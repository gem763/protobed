In the real world, it\u2019s a humiliation.", "language": "en", "text": "In the president\u2019s telling, he brilliantly brokered a peace in northeastern Syria that allows Turkey to have the safe zone it sought while protecting the Kurds with whom the United States was allied, and keeping thousands of Islamic State prisoners locked down. \u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nIn reality, the cease-fire was brokered by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin after Russian and Syrian government forces took over the bases that Mr. Trump ordered abandoned. According to the State Department\u2019s Syrian envoy, at least 100 Islamic State terrorists are so far unaccounted for. And Turkish-led forces on Thursday and Friday continued to assault Kurdish villages, forcing thousands of civilians to flee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s world, Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has kept his word, and thus there is no need for U.S. sanctions on his government. In the real Syria, according to Mr. Esper, Turkey has put the United States and its NATO allies in a \u201cterrible situation\u201d by striking a deal that empowers Russia, Iran and the blood-soaked Damascus government of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nMr. Trump seems to believe that if he simply proclaims his alternate facts often and loudly enough, his followers will be satisfied, or at least confused. But that won\u2019t change the loss the United States has suffered in the Middle East, or prevent further disasters in the coming weeks.\n\nOne question is whether Mr. Erdogan will actually stop his offensive against the Kurds, or continue what some suspect may become an ethnic cleansing campaign \u2014 with the fleeing Kurds replaced by Arab Syrian refugees now living in Turkey. That will depend mostly on Mr. Putin and the Assad regime; Mr. Trump has ceded all U.S. leverage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA second question is whether, and for how long, the United States will be able to hold on to the oil fields it aspires to \u201cprotect,\u201d nominally from a resurgent Islamic State. Now that Russian and Syrian forces have moved into the region and occupied its major towns, that may prove difficult. Previously, de facto control of eastern Syria gave the United States a powerful bargaining chip in any settlement of the Syria war. Now Russia is likely to control the shape of any peace deal.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, Syria has been \u201ca big success\u201d and \u201cthe Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us.\u201d In the real world, the U.S. troops he yanked from the region were pelted with vegetables and trash as they drove away. It\u2019s a humiliation from which the United States will not soon recover.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "It will take quite some time for the United States to recover from this embarrassment.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pW8mTx_XzkUSO2qSoLuZpl9_bBw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/POUKF2HXLEI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
