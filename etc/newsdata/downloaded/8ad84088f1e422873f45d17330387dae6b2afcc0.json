This is part of our education, we have to come out of the \u2018boy zone\u2019 and play like a man and respect the game. They are very talented and learning to be ruthless.\n\n\u201cWe believe in our work, believe we can push over the course of the season. Our mentality is how we work every day. The players want to get better and improve.\u201d\n\nNO FIGHT\n\nAustrian Hasenhuttl accepted responsibility for the defeat, but questioned his players\u2019 desire to compete with Leicester.\n\n\u201cThe performance was a disaster, and I have to apologies and take 100% responsibility,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a team act like this, there was no fight for anything.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible to watch and everyone who stayed to watch is really a fan of this football club. Leicester were in every part of the game better than us.\u201d\n\nHasenhuettl said it was now up to him to rally the players ahead of a League Cup fourth round trip to holders Manchester City on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a proud man but the way we played today is not the way I want to see my team play. We must get our heads up and that is my job in the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe all must to do everything to pull this back.\u201d", "description": "Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers said his team were learning to be ruthless after Friday\u2019s record-breaking 9-0 Premier League win over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445011920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1U7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
