But while many distributors carry Allen\u2019s channels, two cable giants have refused.\n\nAllen says the reason is that he\u2019s black, and so he\u2019s sued for racial discrimination. An appeals court has let his lawsuits go forward, but now the Supreme Court will weigh in and could deliver a setback.\n\nThe justices will hear arguments Nov. 13 in a $20 billion lawsuit that Allen filed against Comcast, with the outcome also affecting a $10 billion case he has filed against Charter Communications.\n\nIf Allen prevails, black-owned businesses will have an easier time winning suits that allege discrimination in contracting. If Comcast wins, the bar will be high to bring and succeed with similar suits.\n\nThe question for the justices is whether Allen needs to show that race was just a factor in Comcast\u2019s decision not to offer him a contract or whether it was the sole factor.\n\nAllen said his case is about getting rid of institutionalized racism. Pursuing that claim, he said, \u201cis one of the greatest things I\u2019ve ever done in my life\u201d and \u201cone of the things I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d\n\nBut Comcast says its decision not to carry Allen\u2019s channels has nothing to do with race. Allen\u2019s content is \u201cnot particularly original\u201d and \u201cnot particularly high quality,\u201d said Comcast lawyer Lynn Charytan, and Comcast simply made an editorial decision not to carry it.\n\nA trial court dismissed Allen\u2019s suit three times before an appeals court, according to Comcast, wrongly let it go forward . The Trump administration has sided with Comcast.\n\nAllen, 58, began his route to media mogul as a child when his family moved from Detroit to Los Angeles. His mother got a job at NBC, which meant Allen hung around the studios. He would see Johnny Carson tape \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and comedian Flip Wilson rehearse for his variety show.\n\nAs a teenager, Allen began doing comedy himself, and he appeared on the \u201cTonight Show\u201d for the first time when he was 18. That led to a job as a host for reality television forerunner \u201cReal People\u201d while he was a student at the University of Southern California. Ultimately, Allen\u2019s interests turned to the business of television, and in 1993 he founded his own media company.\n\nToday his Los Angeles-based Entertainment Studios has 10 television networks, including Cars.tv, Comedy.tv, Pets.tv, Recipe.tv and JusticeCentral.tv. Last year, he bought The Weather Channel . He also has a movie distribution company.\n\nBut Comcast and Charter Communications, the nation\u2019s two largest cable providers, have passed on carrying Allen\u2019s channels. Other distributors including Verizon FIOS do carry the channels. So do the now-merged AT&T; and DirecTV after Allen sued them and they settled.\n\nComcast has called Allen\u2019s suit \u201ca scam,\u201d saying it and others that Allen filed were intended to generate media attention and timed to exploit when the companies were working on mergers. Comcast has noted that Allen originally sued Comcast but also civil rights groups including the NAACP and National Urban league, saying they had conspired to discriminate against him. Comcast has called the allegations preposterous.\n\n\u201cThis is really a run-of-the-mill carriage dispute that has been dressed by Mr. Allen in the garb of racial discrimination for purposes of his own,\u201d said Comcast lawyer Miguel Estrada.\n\nBut Skip Miller, one of Allen\u2019s lawyers, said Allen\u2019s channels are \u201cperfectly good channels\u201d and \u201cpopular programming in many areas.\u201d Miller said he cannot see any legitimate reason that Comcast and Charter would refuse to carry them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason, no reason in our opinion, other than he\u2019s black,\u201d Miller said.\n\nAllen sued Comcast in 2015, pointing to Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 . Enacted a year after the Civil War ended, the law bars racial discrimination, saying all people should have \u201cthe same right \u2026 to make and enforce contracts \u2026 as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d\n\nAllen and his lawyers argue that to sue under the law and win, he only needs to show that his race played a factor in Comcast\u2019s decision not to offer him a contract. Comcast says Allen has to demonstrate that he didn\u2019t get a contract solely because of his race.\n\nNo matter what the justices decide, Allen is prepared to make either argument and for the case to continue after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, his lawyer said. This past week he got support from the Los Angeles Urban League, which threatened Comcast with a boycott and other action if it doesn\u2019t drop the case.\n\n\u201cThis case is bigger than me,\u201d Allen said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Comedian and media mogul Byron Allen wants TV viewers to watch the channels his company produces - from one that runs \"Judge Judy\"-like shows all day to those dedicated to comedy, cars, food and pets.
