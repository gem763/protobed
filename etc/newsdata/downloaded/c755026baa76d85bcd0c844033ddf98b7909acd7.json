On Sunday, the stakes are significantly higher.\n\nWainwright was man of the match against France in the quarter-final and now he hopes to go one better \u2014 by becoming a member of the first Welsh team ever to reach the World Cup final.\n\nAaron Wainwright is relaxed about the prospect of playing in a World Cup semi-final\n\nIn a campaign that has been hit by injuries \u2014 as well as the Rob Howley betting scandal \u2014 his is very much a feelgood story.\n\nWales have enjoyed a 12-year rollercoaster ride under Warren Gatland and Wainwright has been one of the last to jump on board.\n\n\u2018Things have worked out pretty well,\u2019 said the bespectacled flanker, who has been pulling off his best Clark Kent impression in Japan.\n\nBefore university, Wainwright spent six years as a defensive midfielder in the Cardiff City FC academy \u2014 comparing his style to Roy Keane. His rugby journey only turned serious when, minutes before a university assessment, he received a call asking him to play for the Dragons.\n\n\u2018Bernard Jackman [then Dragons coach] said I was going to be on the bench for the Dragons,\u2019 said Wainwright. \u2018That was a massive step for me going from university rugby to professional rugby.\n\n\u2018At uni, we\u2019d train normally two nights a week and then do a team run between lectures.\n\n\u2018It was Championship on a Saturday and then BUCS [British University and Colleges Sport] super rugby was on a Wednesday, so the away days on a Saturday you weren\u2019t as excited because you were being beaten up by big men. Glynneath, Narberth, Bedlinog; those sorts of places are ones you don\u2019t want to go to. Up to your knees in mud.\n\n\u2018They wanted me to bulk up a little bit so I was eating loads. I went from 84kg [13st 2lb] to 104kg [16st 5lb] in a year and a half! I\u2019m still very friendly with a lot of the boys and they can\u2019t believe how far I\u2019ve come. A lot of them have wanted to come over but obviously student loans have been an issue!\u2019\n\nWithin 12 months of making his professional debut, Wainwright received a call-up from Gatland for the 2018 tour of Argentina.\n\nWainwright was the Mastercard man of the match against France in the quarter-final\n\nTwo years ago, he was running out for Cardiff Metropolitan University on boggy pitches\n\nNot for the first time, Gatland\u2019s show of faith in an unfancied youngster paid off. Winger Josh Adams is a similar case \u2014 now sitting at the top of the World Cup try-scoring charts. Classic Gatland, squeezing every last drop out of a country with a limited playing pool.\n\nWainwright\u2019s style has earned rave comparisons with Sam Warburton: quick, tough, durable and good over the ball. Injuries to Toby Faletau and Josh Navidi have made the 22-year-old an indispensable asset and, while they appear weaker on paper, they will back their iron will to match up with the Springbok pack.\n\nWales must be accurate to prevent the game from boiling down to a set-piece battle but his side have developed a mental resilience to pull off the unexpected.\n\nIt helps, too, that Wainwright has never lost a tournament game in a Welsh jersey.", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: For a young man who only made his professional rugby debut in 2017, Aaron Wainwright is remarkably relaxed about the prospect of playing in a World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/19/20222712-0-image-a-104_1572114841387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
