An example is provided by the paediatric hepatic international tumour trial (Phitt), which is seeking to test new techniques to treat children with rare liver cancers, and is part of a larger collaborative international project called the children\u2019s liver tumour European research network (Chiltern). The \u20ac7.9m funding for these projects was supplied through the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 science funding programme.\n\nThe leader of Phitt, Professor Keith Wheatley, of Birmingham University\u2019s Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, said there were around 30 new cases of childhood liver cancer diagnosed in Britain every year. The disease\u2019s relative rarity was welcome in one sense, he added. However, he also pointed out that the scarcity of cases poses problems for scientists seeking better ways to treat the condition.\n\n\u201cIf children are to have a chance of survival from early liver cancer, they often require intense bouts of chemo- otherapy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do not know exactly how much chemotherapy \u2013 which can have very toxic side-effects \u2013 to give them. The trouble is that finding the answer is difficult because we have so few patients on whom to test out different regimes.\u201d\n\nHowever, scientists recently set up international studies with hospitals in other European countries as part of the Phitt project. This will provide more patients, so scientists can set up trials involving hundreds of individuals and try out different chemotherapy regimes. It is hoped that Phitt will produce results within five years, leading to major improvements in treating childhood liver cancer.\n\nBut the prospect of studies of this kind being set up to improve treatments for other cancers has been put in jeopardy by the threat of a no-deal Brexit. EU science funding would be likely to dry up for British scientists, and while the UK government has promised to make up the loss, medical researchers would still find themselves unable to collaborate so easily with European colleagues on projects such as Phitt and Chiltern.\n\nThis point was supported by Greenwood, who said Cancer Research UK feared the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on cancer patients could be considerable. \u201cIt is going to become harder and harder to keep studies going and, even worse, to set up new studies to look at cancers that have not been tackled yet.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the problems that will afflict UK collaboration with Europe-wide cancer treatment trials, there is also likely to be serious disruption to deliveries of the tens of millions of items of medicine imported from the EU every month because of problems with setting up new border and import checks.\n\nDrugs for those needing routine hospital care would then be given priority, leaving medicines for relatively small-scale cancer trials at risk of being held up or blocked.\n\nGreenwood acknowledged that civil servants and National Health England had been working hard to try to offset the problems facing doctors and medical researchers, in particular in ensuring critically important medical supplies would be avail- able after Brexit. \u201cHowever, we remain extremely concerned that something could go wrong,\u201d she added.\n\nScientists have also voiced concerns that the free flow of researchers needed to maintain first-class projects would also be threatened by a no-deal Brexit, despite government pledges to try to ease restrictions that are likely to be imposed.", "description": "UK researchers fear being blocked from EU-wide testing of treatments for diseases including rare childhood cancers", "authors": ["Robin Mckie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f55b7b0cbd09db0422f13fb9c390479ab423d6a1/0_166_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=19a1b845b039effa754c529852957579", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
