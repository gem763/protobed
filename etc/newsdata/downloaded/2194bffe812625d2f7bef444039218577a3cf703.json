To me, that starts out with having conversations with people, listening without an agenda, figuring out what went wrong, apologizing and fixing them, keeping promises and then understanding that it will take a long time to fix,\u201d JetBlue Chairman Joel Peterson told Yahoo Finance when asked what Boeing needs to do to repair its battered image.\n\nPeterson, the author of \u2018The 10 Laws of Trust\u201d and veteran professor, added \u201cI don\u2019t think Boeing didn\u2019t make a decision they were going to do something bad, they just failed to deliver on a promise. So I think they can recover from that.\u201d\n\nDozens of grounded Boeing 737 MAX airplanes crowd a parking area adjacent to Boeing Field Thursday, June 27, 2019, in Seattle. A new software problem has been found in the troubled Boeing 737 Max that could push the plane's nose down automatically, and fixing the flaw is almost certain to further delay the plane's return to flying after two deadly crashes. Boeing said Wednesday, June 26, 2019, that the FAA \"identified an additional requirement\" for software changes that the aircraft manufacturer has been working on for eight months, since shortly after the first crash.

It\u2019s unclear when the plane will return to service, but its grounding has sent ripple effects throughout the aerospace supply chain. Whether customers will ever want to fly on the 737 Max again is also highly uncertain.\n\nBoeing incurred a massive $5.6 billion charge in the second quarter to reflect compensation to key 737 Max customers for the grounding.\n\nEven still, to Peterson\u2019s point it will take more than a few checks from Boeing to repair its damaged image.\n\nFor its part, JetBlue (JBLU) has been somewhat unscathed from the Boeing debacle as it only flies Airbus planes.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
