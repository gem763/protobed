Danny Lee Snodgress Jr.) and producer Nicholas Mira -- were also among those named in the lawsuit.\n\nThe band is not only asking for financial compensation, they also want co-ownership of the song and its royalties.\n\nAnd since Lucid Dreams was instrumental in breaking Juice WRLD to the mainstream, which allowed him to tour and perform, the band also maintain they are owed revenue from his concert tours and public appearances.\n\nMaking their case: The lawsuit identifies similarities in both songs\n\n'This was not a lawsuit the guys wanted to file. They put all of the parties on notice a long while ago and gave them every opportunity to try to resolve it. That notice was pretty much ignored leaving them with no real choice,' the band's lawyer said in a statement.\n\n'As alleged in the Complaint, this is not just a generic Emo Rap song, but is a blatant copy of significant original compositional elements of Holly Wood Died in several respects. Beyond that, everything we have to say is in the Complaint.'\n\nSo far Juice WRLD has not issued a public response to the accusations.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Rapper Juice WRLD was slapped with a $15 million copyright infringement lawsuit\u00a0from the rock band Yellowcard over his song Lucid Dreams.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/04/20067264-0-image-a-81_1571802329820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
