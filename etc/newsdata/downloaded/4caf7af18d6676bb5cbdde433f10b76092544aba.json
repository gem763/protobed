What people want \u2013 what Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants \u2013 is to move on.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are coming out of the EU on October 31. Let\u2019s get Brexit done \u2013 we can, we must and we will.\u201d\n\nHe will contrast his plans to draw a swift line under Brexit with Labour\u2019s alternative of securing an extension to Brexit talks and then going into an election on a platform of renegotiating Brexit before putting it to a referendum.\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan would turn 2020 into a year of \u201cchaos and cacophony\u201d with potentially two referendums, on EU membership and Scottish independence, the prime minister will claim.\n\nMr Johnson will warn that, three years on from the 2016 vote to quit the EU, voters were \u201cbeginning to feel that they are being taken for fools\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don\u2019t want Brexit delivered at all,\u201d he will say. \u201cAnd if they turn out to be right in that suspicion then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in democracy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done on October 31 so in 2020 our country can move on.\u201d\n\nDr Williams said: \u201cAll the circus, sideshow and now serious questions over behaviour that surround Boris Johnson should not allow him to escape attention over the reality of his determination to force an undemocratic and destructive vision of Brexit on the country.\n\n\u201cHe can say nothing coherent and credible on Ireland. He offers nothing to those worried about the supply of medicines and the price of fresh food. And he blithely ignores all the risks to our security that no-deal means.\n\n\u201cIn short, we cannot trust Boris Johnson on Brexit. Instead, let us trust the people in a Final Say referendum. Only a people\u2019s vote offers a fair and democratic way out of the crisis.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson will\u00a0lay down a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ultimatum to Brussels on Wednesday, warning he will take the UK out of the European Union without a deal if it is rejected.
