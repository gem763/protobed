Zhan told WQAD he has special needs.\n\n\"You don't do that to a handicapped child. My child is handicapped,\" Zahn said. \"He didn't even have the chance to defend himself yesterday ... at all.\"\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nThe principal of the school sent out a letter to parents following the incident, saying \"when an aggressive act occurs, we intervene as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe boy who can be seen throwing punches in the video has not been identified, but Principal Terry Hogenson said, per protocol, they interview all involved in an altercation and involve police if necessary.\n\n\"No act of aggression is dismissed or accepted within the school setting,\u201d Hogenson said.\n\nMuscatine police did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment to say whether or not they had been contacted by the district.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what led to the fight, but Zahn said it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\"I mean if they did [say] words, let's say they did, that's not a reason to do that to him,\u201d she said.\n\n\"He was walking down the hall, going to his first hour class,\" she added. \"This kid came running up behind him ... I guess he hit him. My son said 'Dude!' And next thing you know it's pow pow.\"\n\nIn the video, Coby is seen still being hit after he falls to the ground.\n\nCoby suffered a minor hematoma, a collection of blood that pools outside the blood vessels, and is recovering, according to Zahn. He returned to the school on Tuesday.", "description": "An Iowa mother is looking to press charges after a video of her son shows him getting beaten up at Muscatine High School.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/lockers-gty-er-181208_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
