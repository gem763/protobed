I think I preferred The Handmaid's Tale, the first of Atwood's Gilead novels \u2014 it was more specific and somehow more frightening.\n\nI'm very excited to begin the new Philip Pullman book \u2014 I love the Dark Materials world he has created.\n\nI started reading them nearly 20 years ago and it feels as if the story and his heroine, Lyra, are growing with me.\n\nActress and writer Katy Brand has just finished reading The Testaments by Margaret Atwood and revealed she would take the full 'Rabbit' collection by John Updike to a desert island\n\nWhile I was waiting for the Pullman to arrive, I started to re-read Wolf Hall, by Hilary Mantel, and was reminded what an absolute genius she is.\n\n\u2026would you take to a desert island?\n\nI would take the full 'Rabbit' collection by John Updike, which is a study of the whole life of an ordinary American man, Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom.\n\nThe first one is Rabbit, Run, then there are several more. I love the way he creates that mood of the American Dream without fully endorsing it.\n\nIf I were allowed a couple more, I'd take Portnoy's Complaint, by Philip Roth, which is funny and filthy and I love it, and also a couple by Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper, to cheer me up.\n\nThey are two authors who always improve my mood if I'm feeling a little bleak. And maybe I'd sneak in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 \u00be, by the comic genius Sue Townsend.\n\n\u2026first gave you the reading bug?\n\nPretty much anything by Roald Dahl. I Hoovered up his books when I was a child, and I particularly remember being so frightened by The Witches that I couldn't read it alone, even though I was desperate to finish the story.\n\nKaty Brand would take the full 'Rabbit' collection by John Updike to a desert island\n\nI would follow my parents around the house with it, so I could carry on without being by myself.\n\nI learnt to read early thanks to my grandmother, Violet Brand, who was a teacher, author and phonics pioneer, so I was pushing through books that were aimed at an audience older than me. I was very lucky in that respect.\n\nI loved the James Herriot books, and also had a weakness for Nancy Drew and Sweet Valley High. I got started on the Jackie Collins oeuvre waaaaay too young . . . but I do love her.\n\n\u2026left you cold?\n\nI find the work of Virginia Woolf difficult to get along with. I have tried several times but I just end up annoyed with it.\n\nIt always feels so indulgent and wilfully pretentious. I think I am also influenced by the notion that if we had ever met, we'd have hated each other on sight.\n\nI will try again, though \u2014 I keep hoping I will find the substance underneath the style.\n\nI'm also sorry to say I find Charles Dickens a real challenge. I don't know why \u2014 there is something about it that feels as if it shuts me out. Perhaps it's too perfectly realised and described \u2014 it feels as if there's no room for me.\n\nIt's a seriously embarrassing gap in my reading knowledge, though, so I will keep trying until I get it.\n\nI Carried A Watermelon: Dirty Dancing And Me, Katy Brand\u2019s latest book, is published by HQ, \u00a312.99.", "description": "Actress and writer Katy Brand has just finished reading\u00a0The Testaments by Margaret Atwood and is excited to begin the new Philip Pullman book.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20150280-0-image-a-12_1571946624991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
