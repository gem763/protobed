He has no idea where his home is or who his parents are. He can\u2019t even remember his own name or the name of simple household objects. The only thing he does know is that the person sitting next to him is his identical twin brother, Marcus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after, Alex relies on Marcus to give him his memory back; to tell him who he is, so to speak.\n\nMarcus acts as his twin\u2019s surrogate memory imparting all the information the teenager needs to know: from telling him about his girlfriend and his friends, to the incredibly strict rules of their house, run by their malevolent stepfather and mother.\n\nWhat begins as a story about one twin teaching the other about life soon becomes a heartbreaking tale of the secret Marcus had chosen to keep from Alex in order to build the idyllic childhood he felt his brother deserved.\n\nMarcus and Alex Lewis (Picture: Netflix)\n\nIt\u2019s here the viewer discovers their childhood was marred by abuse.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re identical twins; we\u2019re bonded, and this thing was so strong that it almost broke us apart,\u201d Marcus said in the unbelievably emotional film.\n\nHis brother Alex added: \u2018The secrets I need answers to are in Marcus\u2019s head. But they\u2019re deep in his head, so it would almost seem reckless in terms of what we are going to find.\u2019\n\nThe brothers confronted their past together (Picture: Netflix)\n\nIt soon becomes known the secrets Marcus was attempting to bury, that is, the pair were sexually abused by their mother until the age of 14.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for a curious Alex who, after being tasked alongside his brother with unlocking rooms in their house to which they had previously been forbidden, following the death of their mother, Marcus may have been able to protect his sibling forever.\n\nMarcus was attempting to protect his brother (Picture: Netflix)\n\nAlex was seeking answers (Picture: Netflix)\n\nHowever after finding a nude image of himself, Alex demanded answers and, at the age of 32, had to rebuild his life once more. Searching for answers, his brother held the key to his identity for a second time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarcus, who remembered everything, attempted to ignore his abuse and spoke not a word of the extent of it to anyone \u2013 until sitting down for this documentary. Even the men\u2019s memoir didn\u2019t dive into what they experienced as boys. Marcus\u2019s admission culminates in a teary heart-to-heart between the brothers in front of cameras.\n\nTell Me Who I Am asks the viewer a moral dilemma \u2013 do you lie in order to protect, or tell the truth and risk horrendous consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s been dubbed an \u2018important watch\u2019 by one viewer, who wrote: \u2018I was not mentally or emotionally prepared for Tell Me Who I Am on @netflix\u2026 the last 15 mins are a tough but important watch.\u2019\n\nFinding the emotional anguish in the brothers\u2019 tortured childhood, another added on Twitter: \u2018This documentary is a kick in the teeth and a dagger in the heart. I\u2019ve seen some documentaries in my time but nothing prepared me for this.\u2019\n\nDissecting the horrendous position Marcus was put in as he debated over telling his brother the truth, one added: \u2018Watched a truly staggering #Documentary on #Netflix last night. Utterly unfathomable the dilemma this guy was put in and utterly heartbreaking #tellmewhoiam.\u2019\n\n\u2018Devastated. Such a quietly disturbing, but riveting doc,\u2019 one viewer felt, after it was released on the weekend. \u2018It\u2019s so deeply upsetting on so many levels.\u2019\n\nAfter the film premiered earlier this year at the Telluride Film Festival, director Ed Perkins told Salon: \u2018It\u2019s one of those stories, that if it wasn\u2019t true, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. I thought the themes of memory and identity, truth and lies, and the blurring of fact and fiction were fascinating.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the telling of their story, the twins have been contacted by those sharing similar stories of childhood abuse.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had hundreds of letters,\u2019 Marcus said, as Alex added: \u2018We\u2019ve had meetings with people with similar stories to ours, middle-aged people.\u2019\n\nMarcus added: \u2018Every time that somebody tells you a story, you feel that you\u2019re helping them because they\u2019re speaking about it.\n\n\u2018So that kind of makes you feel useful.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
