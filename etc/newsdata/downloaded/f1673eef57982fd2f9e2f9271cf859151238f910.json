In the coming months, McCarthy said, the Army will consider a broad \u201crecapitalization\u201d of its housing program with its private partners.\n\nThe Reuters series documented housing hazards including shoddy construction, mold and pest infestations, the presence of lead-based paint and others.\n\nAlready this year, the Army has moved 1,800 families into temporary housing while repairing their homes, it said. It has been sending military personnel to inspect each home in its 87,000-unit portfolio for environmental threats, and, with its partners, has spent an extra $68 million addressing maintenance delays, the Army added. Going forward, the Army will require regular home inspections for safety hazards including peeling lead paint, mold and asbestos, it said.\n\nIn addition, the Army has hired 100 new housing inspectors and is requiring private landlords to create phone apps so residents can track the progress of maintenance work, it said.\n\n\u201cThere was a breakdown over the last decade,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThese are hard lessons learned, but we\u2019re trying to dig out quickly.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy added, \u201cBehaviors have changed.\u201d\n\nStarting in January, McCarthy said, the Army will change the way it approves incentive fee payments to its private landlords to ensure that firms do not profit from homes left in disrepair.\n\nThe Army has placed four-star General Gus Perna, who heads the Army Materiel Command, in charge of personally approving all incentive fees paid to the housing partners, which can be worth millions of dollars each year.\n\n\u201cI have one metric: Make sure our families live in the best base housing possible,\u201d Perna said.\n\nHousing problems also have plagued U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force bases, often stemming from landlord neglect, shoddy construction and lax military oversight.\n\nA recent Reuters report described how an Air Force landlord falsified maintenance records to help it win incentive fees.

Developers and property managers who oversee the homes hold 50-year contracts worth billions of dollars. But the privatization program gave families little recourse to challenge landlords, who can deduct rent from military paychecks of service members. Now, the Army is holding regular town hall meetings to let residents air concerns. Other service branches have followed suit.\n\nSome landlords have committed to new housing investments. Rhode Island-based Corvias, among the Army\u2019s top partners, recently arranged $325 million in lending to launch upgrades, McCarthy said. Some $100 million is targeted for Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the most populous U.S. base, where residents have cited mold and leaks.\n\n\u201cA lot of work remains,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe just want families to know we\u2019re going to get out of this.\u201d", "description": "Pledging to overcome a housing crisis on its installations, the U.S. Army is outlining new steps it is taking to provide better housing for families of service members while demanding accountability from private landlords and Army commanders.", "authors": ["Joshua Schneyer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438917695&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981P6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
