But outside those parameters, Giuliani argued, they could be held liable for forming a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to deprive the president of his constitutional rights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is worse than McCarthy!\u201d he declared, an apparent reference to Joseph McCarthy, the former Republican senator from Wisconsin.\n\nGiuliani has found himself at the center of the expanding investigation into Trump\u2019s request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky probe former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Last week, The Washington Post reported that the president\u2019s personal attorney had spent months subverting foreign policy officials in order to further Trump\u2019s agenda in Ukraine. Since then, he\u2019s appeared on cable news almost every night , making increasingly combative claims.\n\nOn Tuesday, he suggested that although Congress\u2019s oversight of the presidency is among the country\u2019s founding principles, he might sue members for violating attorney-client privilege and obstruction of justice over their investigation of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The former New York mayor singled out Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the probe as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and was one of three committee chairs on Monday to demand that Giuliani hand over all records concerning Ukraine and the Biden family.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse panels subpoena Giuliani for documents in Ukraine probe\n\nGiuliani also alleged that members of Congress were interfering with the president\u2019s ability to direct foreign policy under Article II of the Constitution, and echoed Trump\u2019s previous claim that Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) had \u201cthreatened\u201d withholding Democratic support from Zelensky during a September meeting. Murphy has said that he only told Zelensky that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election, and should communicate directly with the State Department rather than Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calling foreign leaders,\u201d Giuliani said on Tuesday night. \u201cThey are going to foreign capitals.\u201d\n\nAs Ingraham highlighted a Tuesday tweet from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) saying that Trump \u201cneeds to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement,\u201d Giuliani brought up another potential target for litigation. \u201cHow about the gentleman who threatened to arrest the attorney general?\u201d he asked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile it\u2019s not clear who Giuliani was referring to, multiple Democrats on the House Judiciary committee who voted to find Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt in May noted that Congress has the power to arrest or even jail officials who fail to comply with subpoenas. (In June, Democrats backed away from those efforts after reaching a deal with the Justice Department, and the measure was not brought to a vote before the full House.)\n\n\u2018Shut up, moron\u2019: Rudy Giuliani lashes out at critics, defends his Ukraine involvement\n\nWhen Ingraham tried to steer the conversation elsewhere, Giuliani offered up yet another hypothetical civil action, bringing up the anonymous whistleblower.\n\n\u201cHe might be telling the truth, but he might be lying,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cSuppose there was a conspiracy to develop that with members of Congress. That wouldn\u2019t be immune. That would be a conspiracy to violate civil rights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPressed on whether he had any evidence of such a conspiracy, Trump\u2019s personal attorney replied, \u201cI\u2019m saying, suppose there could be.\u201d\n\nFollowing Giuliani\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d the Atlantic\u2019s White House correspondent, Elaina Plott, tweeted a screen shot of a text exchange where Giuliani said he was considering filing a lawsuit \u201cto end lawless action.\u201d When asked who, in particular, he planned to sue, Giuliani responded, \u201cThe Swamp.\u201d The court case, he proposed, would be titled, \u201cTrump v The Swamp.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani says he is looking to sue The Swamp. pic.twitter.com/3D65Mg6VaO \u2014 Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) October 2, 2019\n\nAsked how he would go about suing \u201cThe Swamp\u201d \u2014 an amorphous term generally used to refer to lobbyists and special interest groups, which Trump has also used as a stand-in for Washington\u2019s political establishment \u2014 Giuliani replied, \u201cIn federal court.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump's personal lawyer told Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night that he was considering pursuing litigation against several members of Congress for \"violating civil rights.\u201d", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/s9iFPQ3WXcVue3EimDjMubtx7_g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CDMIFRHEAUI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
