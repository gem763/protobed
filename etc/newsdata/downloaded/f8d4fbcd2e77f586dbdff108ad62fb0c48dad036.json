Arsenal winter transfer targets 1/10 Arsenal winter transfer targets Josh Kroenke has promised Arsenal plan to be \u2018proactive\u2019 in the winter transfer market. But who could they sign? Getty 2/10 Wilfried Zaha Arsenal have not completely given up on prizing Wilfried Zaha away from Crystal Palace. He won't come cheap ... but for the right price Palace may be tempted to cash in, particularly if the 26-year-old fails to impress in the first half of the season. Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham. Arsenal could attempt to replicate their William Saliba deal with Saint-\u00c9tienne by signing Camavinga and then immediately loaning him back to current club, Rennes. AFP/Getty Images 4/10 Dayot Upamecano If Josh Kroenke is true to his word, and his family do back the club in the winter market, than 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano is surely the first player they will attempt to sign. Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe. Bongarts/Getty Images 5/10 Samuel Umtiti Arsenal will monitor the first half of the 25-year-old's season at Barcelona very closely. The defender's 2018/19 season was hampered by injury and Unai Emery has gone on record about how much he rates the World Cup winner. Icon Sport via Getty Images 6/10 Daniele Rugani Juventus are desperate to get rid of the defender as they scramble to balance the books ahead of this week's Italian transfer deadline. If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Fagner Conserva Another South American defender that Arsenal have preciously explored signing, that they could move for if necessary in January. Plays for Edu's former club Corinthians, which would help speed up any deal. AP 9/10 Everton Arsenal seriously explored signing the 23-year-old Brazil international this summer, but were deterred by his rapidly escalating price tag. But if they are backed by Josh Kroenke this winter, could they return for the Gr\u00eamio star? A move to Europe surely beckons for the electric forward, who won the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica top scorer award this summer.

Getty Images\n\nThe 72-year-old was then asked if he hoped Zaha would go into Sunday\u2019s contest looking to prove a point, given that the way the summer panned out suggested Arsenal \u2013 who signed Nicolas Pepe for a fee believed to be worth \u00a372million in August \u2013 did not want the Ivory Coast international enough.\n\nHodgson said: \u201cTime passed, so maybe their situation changed.\n\n\u201cMaybe when they made the offer for Wilf their situation was x, and then possibly things happened during a period of time and their situation changed and maybe more money became available. I have no idea. I can\u2019t speak for Arsenal, for their intentions.\n\n\u201cIf you really wanted to know how serious, how anxious they were to sign one of our players, they will have to answer the question.\n\n\u201cBut as far as Wilf is concerned, I think he needs to make certain that he gives his very best and shows off his talents every time he plays, because there are lots of teams out there looking for good players, and if he wants to attract one of those clubs, he needs to perform at the very highest level.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the fact it is Arsenal will change his performance enormously \u2013 I would hope not, because I\u2019m expecting his performance to be very good against all the teams we play.\u201d\n\nHodgson also said of managing Zaha so far this season: \u201cI thought he got over his disappointment very, very quickly and he has been good in both training and matches.\u201d\n\nPalace are currently sixth in the Premier League, one place and and one point behind Arsenal.\n\nHodgson was speaking a day after being awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Greenwich.\n\nHe is an alumnus of the university, having graduated from Avery Hill College in 1972 with a Certificate in Education.\n\nHodgson said on Friday: \u201cIt was very good, I\u2019m very pleased. It was a wonderful ceremony \u2013 it\u2019s just a pity I couldn\u2019t keep the gown and cap. That was my only regret, having to give them back!\u201d\n\nHodgson also has an honorary degree from the University of York, has been awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Croydon, and in 2012 was honoured with a knighthood by Finland.\n\nAnd he said: \u201cI have done pretty well over the years. My study is actually looking quite good when it comes to those things!\u201d", "description": "Wilfried Zaha was \u201cnot very close at all\u201d to joining Arsenal during the summer, Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson has said.
