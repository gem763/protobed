Additionally, a third of those studied believed that choosing what to wear is more difficult than deciding where to eat.\n\nOREGON CHEF CATERS TO STRIPPERS WITH LATE-NIGHT MEAL SERVICE\n\n\n\nRespondents also felt that choosing what to wear was more stressful than making the dinner reservation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019re all struggling to find the perfect outfit when we\u2019re dining out and feeling pressure,\u201d says Maggie Mee, head of merchandising for Trunk Club. \u201cForty-one percent of people said they felt pressure to look stylish going out to eat. Fashion and food both change with the seasons, you can easily reinvent classics with creative twists. Both should be fun, enjoyable.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, if Americans are feeling such pressure to look stylish, how are they deciding what to wear when dining out? As it turns out, they are wasting a lot of time.\n\n\n\nMore than half of those surveyed admitted that when choosing an outfit for a meal out, they stare blankly at their closet wondering what to wear. Over four in ten (46 percent) try on more than half of their closet trying to create the perfect outfit, and another 47 percent ask a friend for outfit advice because they feel so lost.\n\nBut while they're stressed about what to wear, there\u2019s a general consensus on what not to wear. Seventy-two percent agree they would never wear flip flops or sandals to a restaurant.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSo, how are people choosing where to eat?\n\n\n\nFirst off, people are thinking about what they want to wear before choosing a restaurant. Two in five revealed that what they want to wear influences where they choose to dine, and 36 percent choose the restaurant based on its dress code.\n\n\n\nMany approach their restaurant decision with concern about damaging their clothes. Over one in three (37 percent) say they worry about spilling on their outfit. Thirty-eight percent avoid wine bars while a further 37 percent avoid coffee because they don\u2019t want to deal with potential stains on their clothes.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that nearly half (47 percent) would have no idea what to do to remove a coffee stain from their clothing.\n\nThe study also revealed that one in three Americans surveyed (33 percent) struggle to find an outfit because they think their friends are incredibly stylish and feel pressure to keep up with them.\n\n\n\nThe struggle to find something to wear is so real that 32 percent admit to not feeling confident in their own style while another 31 percent don\u2019t think others will even like their outfit choices. But a solid three in 10 of the people surveyed are guilty of not liking any of their clothing options currently in their closets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAbout one in four of those surveyed admitted they\u2019ve skipped going out to meal because they couldn\u2019t find the right outfit,\u201d added Mee. \u201cNo one should miss an event because they can\u2019t figure out what to wear.\u201d", "description": "While going out to eat might seem like a simple way to enjoy a great meal with good company, a new study reveals that the entire dining out process is actually quite stressful.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/ClothesFood1Istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
