Andrew Carnegie\u2019s hearths forged the steel that became the skeleton of the railroad and the city. John D. Rockefeller refined 90 percent of American oil, which supplied the pre-electric nation with light. Bill Gates created a program that was considered a prerequisite for turning on a computer. At 55, Bezos has never dominated a major market as thoroughly as any of these forebears, and while he is presently the richest man on the planet, he has less wealth than Gates did at his zenith. Yet Rockefeller largely contented himself with oil wells, pump stations, and railcars; Gates\u2019s fortune depended on an operating system. The scope of the empire the founder and CEO of Amazon has built is wider. Indeed, it is without precedent in the long history of American capitalism. Today, Bezos controls nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United States. More product searches are conducted on Amazon than on Google, which has allowed Bezos to build an advertising business as valuable as the entirety of IBM. One estimate has Amazon Web Services controlling almost half of the cloud-computing industry\u2014institutions as varied as General Electric, Unilever, and even the CIA rely on its servers. Forty-two percent of paper book sales and a third of the market for streaming video are controlled by the company; Twitch, its video platform popular among gamers, attracts 15 million users a day. Add The Washington Post to this portfolio and Bezos is, at a minimum, a rival to the likes of Disney\u2019s Bob Iger or the suits at AT&T, and arguably the most powerful man in American culture.\n\nI first grew concerned about Amazon\u2019s power five years ago. I felt anxious about how the company bullied the book business, extracting ever more favorable terms from the publishers that had come to depend on it. When the conglomerate Hachette, with which I\u2019d once published a book, refused to accede to Amazon\u2019s demands, it was punished. Amazon delayed shipments of Hachette books; when consumers searched for some Hachette titles, it redirected them to similar books from other publishers. In 2014, I wrote a cover story for The New Republic with a pugilistic title: \u201cAmazon Must Be Stopped.\u201d Citing my article, the company subsequently terminated an advertising campaign for its political comedy, Alpha House, that had been running in the magazine. Since that time, Bezos\u2019s reach has only grown. To the U.S. president, he is a nemesis. To many Americans, he is a beneficent wizard of convenience and abundance. Over the course of just this past year, Amazon has announced the following endeavors: It will match potential home buyers with real-estate agents and integrate their new homes with Amazon devices; it will enable its voice assistant, Alexa, to access health-care data, such as the status of a prescription or a blood-sugar reading; it will build a 3-million-square-foot cargo airport outside Cincinnati; it will make next-day delivery standard for members of its Prime service; it will start a new chain of grocery stores, in addition to Whole Foods, which it already owns; it will stream Major League Baseball games; it will launch more than 3,000 satellites into orbit to supply the world with high-speed internet. Bezos worries that in the coming generations the planet\u2019s growing energy demands will outstrip its limited supply. \u201cWe have to go to space to save Earth,\u201d he says. Bezos\u2019s ventures are by now so large and varied that it is difficult to truly comprehend the nature of his empire, much less the end point of his ambitions. What exactly does Jeff Bezos want? Or, to put it slightly differently, what does he believe? Given his power over the world, these are not small questions. Yet he largely keeps his intentions to himself; many longtime colleagues can\u2019t recall him ever expressing a political opinion. To replay a loop of his interviews from Amazon\u2019s quarter century of existence is to listen to him retell the same unrevealing anecdotes over and over.\n\nTo better understand him, I spent five months speaking with current and former Amazon executives, as well as people at the company\u2019s rivals and scholarly observers. Bezos himself declined to participate in this story, and current employees would speak to me only off the record. Even former staffers largely preferred to remain anonymous, assuming that they might eventually wish to work for a business somehow entwined with Bezos\u2019s sprawling concerns. From November 2018: Alexa, should we trust you? In the course of these conversations, my view of Bezos began to shift. Many of my assumptions about the man melted away; admiration jostled with continued unease. And I was left with a new sense of his endgame. Bezos loves the word relentless\u2014it appears again and again in his closely read annual letters to shareholders\u2014and I had always assumed that his aim was domination for its own sake. In an era that celebrates corporate gigantism, he seemed determined to be the biggest of them all. But to say that Bezos\u2019s ultimate goal is dominion over the planet is to misunderstand him. His ambitions are not bound by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Before Bezos settled on Amazon.com, he toyed with naming his unlaunched store MakeItSo.com. He entertained using the phrase because he couldn\u2019t contain a long-standing enthusiasm. The rejected moniker was a favored utterance of a man Bezos idolizes: the captain of the starship USS Enterprise-D, Jean-Luc Picard.\n\nBezos is unabashed in his fanaticism for Star Trek and its many spin-offs. He has a holding company called Zefram, which honors the character who invented warp drive. He persuaded the makers of the film Star Trek Beyond to give him a cameo as a Starfleet official. He named his dog Kamala, after a woman who appears in an episode as Picard\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d but unattainable mate. As time has passed, Bezos and Picard have physically converged. Like the interstellar explorer, portrayed by Patrick Stewart, Bezos shaved the remnant strands on his high-gloss pate and acquired a cast-iron physique. A friend once said that Bezos adopted his strenuous fitness regime in anticipation of the day that he, too, would journey to the heavens. When reporters tracked down Bezos\u2019s high-school girlfriend, she said, \u201cThe reason he\u2019s earning so much money is to get to outer space.\u201d This assessment hardly required a leap of imagination. As the valedictorian of Miami Palmetto Senior High School\u2019s class of 1982, Bezos used his graduation speech to unfurl his vision for humanity. He dreamed aloud of the day when millions of his fellow earthlings would relocate to colonies in space. A local newspaper reported that his intention was \u201cto get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\u201d Most mortals eventually jettison teenage dreams, but Bezos remains passionately committed to his, even as he has come to control more and more of the here and now. Critics have chided him for philanthropic stinginess, at least relative to his wealth, but the thing Bezos considers his primary humanitarian contribution isn\u2019t properly charitable. It\u2019s a profit-seeking company called Blue Origin, dedicated to fulfilling the prophecy of his high-school graduation speech. He funds that venture\u2014which builds rockets, rovers, and the infrastructure that permits voyage beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014by selling about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year. More than his ownership of his behemoth company or of The Washington Post\u2014and more than the $2 billion he\u2019s pledged to nonprofits working on homelessness and education for low-income Americans\u2014Bezos calls Blue Origin his \u201cmost important work.\u201d\n\nHe considers the work so important because the threat it aims to counter is so grave. What worries Bezos is that in the coming generations the planet\u2019s growing energy demands will outstrip its limited supply. The danger, he says, \u201cis not necessarily extinction,\u201d but stasis: \u201cWe will have to stop growing, which I think is a very bad future.\u201d While others might fret that climate change will soon make the planet uninhabitable, the billionaire wrings his hands over the prospects of diminished growth. But the scenario he describes is indeed grim. Without enough energy to go around, rationing and starvation will ensue. Over the years, Bezos has made himself inaccessible to journalists asking questions about Amazon. But he shares his faith in space colonization with a preacher\u2019s zeal: \u201cWe have to go to space to save Earth.\u201d At the heart of this faith is a text Bezos read as a teen. In 1976, a Princeton physicist named Gerard K. O\u2019Neill wrote a populist case for moving into space called The High Frontier, a book beloved by sci-fi geeks, NASA functionaries, and aging hippies. As a Princeton student, Bezos attended O\u2019Neill seminars and ran the campus chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. Through Blue Origin, Bezos is developing detailed plans for realizing O\u2019Neill\u2019s vision. The professor imagined colonies housed in miles-long cylindrical tubes floating between Earth and the moon. The tubes would sustain a simulacrum of life back on the mother planet, with soil, oxygenated air, free-flying birds, and \u201cbeaches lapped by waves.\u201d When Bezos describes these colonies\u2014and presents artists\u2019 renderings of them\u2014he sounds almost rapturous. \u201cThis is Maui on its best day, all year long. No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.\u201d Since the colonies would allow the human population to grow without any earthly constraints, the species would flourish like never before: \u201cWe can have a trillion humans in the solar system, which means we\u2019d have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. This would be an incredible civilization.\u201d\n\nBezos rallies the public with passionate peroration and convincing command of detail. Yet a human hole remains in his presentation. Who will govern this new world? Who will write its laws? Who will decide which earthlings are admitted into the colonies? These questions aren\u2019t explicitly answered, except with his fervent belief that entrepreneurs, those in his own image, will shape the future. And he will do his best to make it so. With his wealth, and the megaphone that it permits him, Bezos is attempting to set the terms for the future of the species, so that his utopia can take root. In a way, Bezos has already created a prototype of a cylindrical tube inhabited by millions, and it\u2019s called Amazon.com. His creation is less a company than an encompassing system. If it were merely a store that sold practically all salable goods\u2014and delivered them within 48 hours\u2014it would still be the most awe-inspiring creation in the history of American business. But Amazon is both that tangible company and an abstraction far more powerful. Bezos\u2019s enterprise upends long-held precepts about the fundamental nature of capitalism\u2014especially an idea enshrined by the great Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek. As World War II drew to its close, Hayek wrote the essay \u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society,\u201d a seminal indictment of centralized planning. Hayek argued that no bureaucracy could ever match the miracle of markets, which spontaneously and efficiently aggregate the knowledge of a society. When markets collectively set a price, that price reflects the discrete bits of knowledge scattered among executives, workers, and consumers. Any governmental attempt to replace this organic apparatus\u2014to set prices unilaterally, or even to understand the disparate workings of an economy\u2014is pure hubris. In contrast to the dysfunction and cynicism that define the times, Amazon is the embodiment of competence, the rare institution that routinely works. Amazon, however, has acquired the God\u2019s-eye view of the economy that Hayek never imagined any single entity could hope to achieve. At any moment, its website has more than 600 million items for sale and more than 3 million vendors selling them. With its history of past purchases, it has collected the world\u2019s most comprehensive catalog of consumer desire, which allows it to anticipate both individual and collective needs. With its logistics business\u2014and its growing network of trucks and planes\u2014it has an understanding of the flow of goods around the world. In other words, if Marxist revolutionaries ever seized power in the United States, they could nationalize Amazon and call it a day.\n\nRead: Jeff Bezos\u2019s $150 billion fortune is a policy failure What makes Amazon so fearsome to its critics isn\u2019t purely its size but its trajectory. Amazon\u2019s cache of knowledge gives it the capacity to build its own winning version of an astonishing array of businesses. In the face of its growth, long-dormant fears of monopoly have begun to surface\u2014and Amazon has reportedly found itself under review by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. But unlike Facebook, another object of government scrutiny, Bezos\u2019s company remains deeply trusted by the public. A 2018 poll sponsored by Georgetown University and the Knight Foundation found that Amazon engendered greater confidence than virtually any other American institution. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s jabs at Bezos, this widespread faith in the company makes for a source of bipartisan consensus, although the Democrats surveyed were a touch more enthusiastic than the Republicans were: They rated Amazon even more trustworthy than the U.S. military. In contrast to the dysfunction and cynicism that define the times, Amazon is the embodiment of competence, the rare institution that routinely works. All of this confidence in Bezos\u2019s company has made him a singular figure in the culture, which, at times, regards him as a flesh-and-blood Picard. If \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d\u2014the motto of the Bezos-era Washington Post\u2014then he is the rescuer of the light, the hero who reversed the terminal decline of Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s old broadsheet. When he wrote a Medium post alleging that the National Enquirer had attempted to extort him, he was hailed for taking a stand against tabloid sleaze and cyberbullying.\n\nAs Amazon has matured, it has assumed the trappings of something more than a private enterprise. It increasingly poses as a social institution tending to the common good. After it earned derision for the alleged treatment of its workers\u2014some warehouse employees reported feeling pressured to forgo bathroom breaks to meet productivity targets, to cite just one example\u2014it unilaterally raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in the U.S., then attempted to shame competitors that didn\u2019t follow suit. (Amazon says that employees are allowed to use the bathroom whenever they want.) As technology has reshaped its workforce, Amazon has set aside $700 million to retrain about a third of its U.S. employees for roles with new demands. These gestures are partly gambits to insulate the company\u2019s reputation from accusations of rapaciousness. But they also tie Amazon to an older conception of the corporation. In its current form, Amazon harkens back to Big Business as it emerged in the postwar years. When Charles E. Wilson, the president of General Motors, was nominated to be secretary of defense in 1953, he famously told a Senate confirmation panel, \u201cI thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.\u201d For the most part, this was an aphorism earnestly accepted as a statement of good faith. To avert class warfare, the Goliaths of the day recognized unions; they bestowed health care and pensions upon employees. Liberal eminences such as John K. Galbraith hailed the corporation as the basis for a benign social order. Galbraith extolled the social utility of the corporation because he believed that it could be domesticated and harnessed to serve interests other than its own bottom line. He believed businesses behave beneficently when their self-serving impulses are checked by \u201ccountervailing power\u201d in the form of organized labor and government.\n\nOf course, those powers have receded. Unions, whose organizing efforts Amazon has routinely squashed, are an unassuming nub of their former selves; the regulatory state is badly out of practice. So while Amazon is trusted, no countervailing force has the inclination or capacity to restrain it. And while power could amass in a more villainous character than Jeff Bezos, that doesn\u2019t alleviate the anxiety that accompanies such concentration. Amazon might be a vast corporation, with more than 600,000 employees, but it is also the extension of one brilliant, willful man with an incredible knack for bending the world to his values. 2.0 After Jackie Bezos\u2019s shotgun marriage to a member of a traveling unicyclist troupe dissolved, she dedicated herself to their only progeny. The teenage mother from Albuquerque became her son\u2019s intellectual champion. She would drive him 40 miles each day so that he could attend an elementary school for high-testing kids in Houston. When a wait list prevented him from entering the gifted track in middle school, she wheedled bureaucrats until they made an exception. Over the course of Bezos\u2019s itinerant childhood, as his family traversed the Sun Belt of the \u201970s, Jackie encouraged her son\u2019s interest in tinkering by constantly shuttling him to RadioShack. \u201cI have always been academically smart,\u201d Bezos told an audience in Washington, D.C., last year. This was a sentiment ratified by the world as he ascended the meritocracy. At Princeton, he flirted with becoming a theoretical physicist. On Wall Street, he joined D. E. Shaw, arguably the brainiest and most adventurous hedge fund of the \u201990s. The firm would send unsolicited letters to dean\u2019s-list students at top universities, telling them: \u201cWe approach our recruiting in unapologetically elitist fashion.\u201d\n\nThe computer scientist who founded the firm, David E. Shaw, had dabbled in the nascent internet in the \u201980s. This provided him with unusual clarity about the coming revolution and its commercial implications. He anointed Bezos to seek out investment opportunities in the newly privatized medium\u2014an exploration that led Bezos to his own big idea. When Bezos created Amazon in 1994, he set out to build an institution like the ones that had carried him through the first three decades of his life. He would build his own aristocracy of brains, a place where intelligence would rise to the top. Early on, Bezos asked job candidates for their SAT scores. The company\u2019s fifth employee, Nicholas Lovejoy, later told Wired that interviews would take the form of a Socratic test. Bezos would probe logical acuity with questions like Why are manhole covers round? According to Lovejoy, \u201cOne of his mottos was that every time we hired someone, he or she should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool was always improving.\u201d When Bezos thought about talent, in other words, he was self-consciously in a Darwinian mode. By the logic of natural selection, it was hardly obvious that a bookstore would become the dominant firm in the digital economy. From Amazon\u2019s infancy, Bezos mastered the art of coyly deflecting questions about where he intended to take his company. But back in his hedge-fund days, he had kicked around the idea of an \u201ceverything store\u201d with Shaw. And he always conveyed the impression of having grand plans\u2014a belief that the fiction aisle and the self-help section might serve as the trailhead to commanding heights.\n\nIn the vernacular, Amazon is often lumped together with Silicon Valley. At its spiritual center, however, Amazon is a retailer, not a tech company. Amazon needed to elbow its way into a tightly packed and unforgiving industry, where it faced entrenched entities such as Barnes & Noble, Walmart, and Target. In mass-market retail, the company with the thinnest margin usually prevails, and a soft December can ruin a year. Even as Bezos prided himself on his capacity for thinking far into the future, he also had to worry about the prospect of tomorrow\u2019s collapse. At tightfisted Amazon, there were no big bonuses at year\u2019s end, no business-class flights for executives on long hauls, no employee kitchens overflowing with protein bars. Bezos was hardly a mellow leader, especially in the company\u2019s early days. To mold his organization in his image, he often lashed out at those who failed to meet his high standards. The journalist Brad Stone\u2019s indispensable book about the company, The Everything Store, contains a list of Bezos\u2019s cutting remarks: \u201cAre you lazy or just incompetent?\u201d \u201cThis document was clearly written by the B team. Can someone get me the A-team document?\u201d \u201cWhy are you ruining my life?\u201d (Amazon says this account is not reflective of Bezos\u2019s leadership style.) This was the sarcastic, demeaning version of his endless questioning. But Bezos\u2019s waspish intelligence and attention to detail\u2014his invariable focus on a footnote or an appendix\u2014elicited admiration alongside the dread. \u201cIf you\u2019re going in for a Bezos meeting, you\u2019re preparing as if the world is going to end,\u201d a former executive told me. \u201cYou\u2019re like, I\u2019ve been preparing for the last three weeks. I\u2019ve asked every damn person that I know to think of questions that could be asked. Then Bezos will ask you the one question you hadn\u2019t considered.\u201d\n\nThe growth of the company\u2014which already brought in nearly $3 billion in revenue in its seventh year of existence\u2014prodded Bezos to adapt his methods. He created a new position, technical adviser, to instill his views in top managers; the technical advisers would shadow the master for at least a year, and emerge as what executives jokingly refer to as \u201cJeff-bots.\u201d His managerial style, which had been highly personal, was codified in systems and procedures. These allowed him to scale his presence so that even if he wasn\u2019t sitting in a meeting, his gestalt would be there. In 2002, Amazon distilled Bezos\u2019s sensibility into a set of Leadership Principles, a collection of maxims including \u201cInvent and Simplify,\u201d \u201cBias for Action,\u201d and \u201cHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit.\u201d To an outside ear, these sound too hokey to be the basis for fervent belief. But Amazonians, as employees call themselves, swear by them. The principles, now 14 in number, are the subject of questions asked in job interviews; they are taught in orientations; they are the qualities on which employees are judged in performance reviews. Of all the principles, perhaps the most sacrosanct is \u201cCustomer Obsession\u201d\u2014the commandment to make decisions only with an eye toward pleasing the consumer, rather than fixating on competitors\u2014a pillar of faith illustrated by the Great Lube Scandal. About 10 years ago, Bezos became aware that Amazon was sending emails to customers suggesting the purchase of lubricants. This fact made him apoplectic. If such an email arrived at work, a boss might glimpse it. If it arrived at home, a child might pose uncomfortable questions. Bezos ordered the problem solved and threatened to shut down Amazon\u2019s email promotions in their entirety if it wasn\u2019t. Kristi Coulter, who served as the head of worldwide editorial and site merchandising, led a group that spent weeks compiling a list of verboten products, which Bezos\u2019s top deputies then reviewed. She told me, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just, like, hemorrhoid cream, or lube, it was hair color, any kind of retinol. They were so conservative about what they thought would be embarrassing. Even tooth-whitening stuff, they were like, \u2018No. That could be embarrassing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTo climb Amazon\u2019s organizational chart is to aspire to join the inner sanctum at the very peak, called the S-Team (\u201cthe senior team\u201d). These are the 17 executives who assemble regularly with Bezos to debate the company\u2019s weightiest decisions. Bezos treats the S-Team with familial affection; its members come closest to being able to read his mind. The group has absorbed the Bezos method and applies it to the corners of the company that he can\u2019t possibly touch. According to James Thomson, a manager who helped build Amazon Marketplace, where anyone can sell new or used goods through the website, \u201cAt most companies, executives like to show how much they know. At Amazon, the focus is on asking the right question. Leadership is trained to poke holes in data.\u201d Once an executive makes it to the S-Team, he remains on the S-Team. The stability of the unit undoubtedly provides Bezos a measure of comfort, but it also calcifies this uppermost echelon in an antiquated vision of diversity. The S\u2011Team has no African Americans; the only woman runs human resources. Nor does the composition of leadership change much a step down the ladder. When CNBC examined the 48 executives who run Amazon\u2019s core businesses (including retail, cloud, and hardware), it found only four women. One former team leader, who is a person of color, told me that when top executives hear the word diversity, they interpret it to mean \u201cthe lowering of standards.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s this classic libertarian thinking,\u201d Coulter told me. \u201cThey think Amazon is a meritocracy based on data, but who\u2019s deciding what gets counted and who gets to avail themselves of the opportunity? If VP meetings are scheduled at 7 a.m., how many mothers can manage that?\u201d\n\n(Amazon disputes the methodology CNBC used to tally women in its senior leadership ranks. \u201cThere are dozens of female executives that play a critical role in Amazon\u2019s success,\u201d a spokesman told me in an email. He cited the company\u2019s generous parental-leave policy, a commitment to flexible scheduling, and the fact that more than 40 percent of its global workforce is female as evidence of its pursuit of gender equity. He also said that its Leadership Principles insist that employees \u201csee diverse perspectives.\u201d) The meritocrat\u2019s blind spot is that he considers his place in the world well earned by dint of intelligence and hard work. This belief short-circuits his capacity to truly listen to critics. When confronted about the composition of the S-Team in a company-wide meeting two years ago, Bezos seemed to dismiss the urgency of the complaint. According to CNBC, he said that he expected \u201cany transition there to happen very incrementally over a long period of time.\u201d The latest addition to the group, made this year, was another white male. Bezos built his organization to be an anti-bureaucracy. To counter the tendency of groups to bloat, he instituted something called \u201ctwo-pizza teams.\u201d (Like Bezos\u2019s other managerial innovations, this sounds like a gimmick, except that advanced engineers and economists with doctorates accept it as the organizing principle of their professional lives.) According to the theory, teams at Amazon should ideally be small enough to be fed with two pizzas.\n\nIn its warehouses, Amazon has used video games to motivate workers\u2014the games, with names like MissionRacer, track output and pit workers against one another, prodding them to move faster. The two-pizza teams represent a more subtle, white-collar version of this gamification. The small teams instill a sense of ownership over projects. But employees placed on such small teams can also experience a greater fear of failure, because there\u2019s no larger group in which to hide or to more widely distribute blame. Amazon has a raft of procedures to guide its disparate teams. Bezos insists that plans be pitched in six-page memos, written in full sentences, a form he describes as \u201cnarrative.\u201d This practice emerged from a sense that PowerPoint had become a tool for disguising fuzzy thinking. Writing, Bezos surmised, demands a more linear type of reasoning. As John Rossman, an alumnus of the company who wrote a book called Think Like Amazon, described it, \u201cIf you can\u2019t write it out, then you\u2019re not ready to defend it.\u201d The six-pagers are consumed at the beginning of meetings in what Bezos has called a \u201cstudy hall\u201d atmosphere. This ensures that the audience isn\u2019t faking its way through the meeting either. Only after the silent digestion of the memo\u2014which can be an anxiety-inducing stretch for its authors\u2014can the group ask questions about the document.\n\nTaylor Hill / Getty\n\nMost teams at Amazon are hermetic entities; required expertise is embedded in each group. Take Amazon\u2019s robust collection of economists with doctorates. In the past several years, the company has hired more than 150 of them, which makes Amazon a far larger employer of economists than any university in the country. Tech companies such as Microsoft and Uber have also hired economists, although not as many. And while other companies have tended to keep them in centralized units, often working on forecasting or policy issues, Amazon takes a different approach. It distributes economists across a range of teams, where they can, among other things, run controlled experiments that permit scientific, and therefore effective, manipulation of consumer behavior.\n\nRelentless might be the most Amazonian word, but Bezos also talks about the virtues of wandering. \u201cWandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency,\u201d he wrote in a letter to shareholders this year. When I spoke with workers based at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters, they said what they appreciated most about their employer was the sense of intellectual autonomy it allowed. Once they had clearly articulated a mission in an approved six-pager, they typically had wide latitude to make it happen, without having to fight through multiple layers of approval. The wandering mentality has also helped Amazon continually expand into adjacent businesses\u2014or businesses that seem, at first, unrelated. Assisted by the ever growing consumer and supplier data it collects, and the insights into human needs and human behavior it is constantly uncovering, the company keeps finding new opportunities for growth. What is Amazon, aside from a listing on Nasdaq? This is a flummoxing question. The company is named for the world\u2019s most voluminous river, but it also has tributaries shooting out in all directions. Retailer hardly captures the company now that it\u2019s also a movie studio, an artificial-intelligence developer, a device manufacturer, and a web-services provider. But to describe it as a conglomerate isn\u2019t quite right either, given that so many of its businesses are tightly integrated or eventually will be. When I posed the question to Amazonians, I got the sense that they considered the company to be a paradigm\u2014a distinctive approach to making decisions, a set of values, the Jeff Bezos view of the world extended through some 600,000 employees. This description, of course, means that the company\u2019s expansion has no natural boundary; no sector of the economy inherently lies beyond its core competencies.\n\n3.0 In late 2012, Donald Graham prepared to sell his inheritance, The Washington Post. He wanted to hand the paper over to someone with pockets deep enough to hold steady through the next recession; he wanted someone techie enough to complete the paper\u2019s digital transition; above all, he wanted someone who grasped the deeper meaning of stewardship. Graham came up with a shortlist of ideal owners he would pursue, including the financier David M. Rubenstein, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and Bezos. The last of the names especially enticed Graham. That January, he had breakfast with his friend and adviser Warren Buffett, who also happened to be a shareholder in the Post. Buffett mentioned that he considered Bezos the \u201cbest CEO in the United States\u201d\u2014hardly an unconventional opinion, but Graham had never heard it from Buffett before. After the breakfast, Graham set out to better understand Bezos\u2019s ideological predilections. \u201cI did a primitive Google search and found nothing, as close to nothing for somebody with that kind of wealth. I didn\u2019t know what his politics were,\u201d he told me. This blankness suggested to Graham the stuff of an ideal newspaper owner. Graham dispatched an emissary to make the pitch. It was a polite but hardly promising conversation: Bezos didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of bidding for the Post, but he didn\u2019t display any palpable enthusiasm, either. The fact that he dropped the subject for several months seemed the best gauge of his interest. While Bezos ghosted Graham, Omidyar, the most enthusiastic of the bidders, continued to seek the prize.\n\nBezos\u2019s past pronouncements may not have revealed partisanship, but they did suggest little appetite for stodgy institutionalism. Like so many CEOs of the era, Bezos figured himself an instrument of creative destruction, with little sympathy for the destroyed. \u201cEven well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,\u201d he wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders. He was critiquing New York book publishers, whose power Amazon had aimed to diminish. But he harbored a similarly dim view of self-satisfied old-media institutions that attempted to preserve their cultural authority. It therefore came as a surprise when, after months of silence, Bezos sent a three-sentence email expressing interest in the Post. Graham made plans to lunch with Bezos in Sun Valley, Idaho, where they would both be attending Allen & Company\u2019s summer conference. Over sandwiches that Graham brought back to his rental, the old proprietor made his preferred buyer a counterintuitive pitch: He explained all the reasons owning a newspaper was hard. He wanted Bezos to know that a newspaper was a self-defeating vehicle for promoting business interests or any preferred agenda. The conversation was a tutorial in the responsibilities of the elite, from a distinguished practitioner. Graham didn\u2019t need to plead with Bezos. In Sun Valley, they hardly haggled over terms. \u201cWe had brunch twice, and at the end we shook hands, unlike almost any deal I\u2019ve ever made in business,\u201d Graham told me. The man who decried gatekeepers was suddenly the keeper of one of the nation\u2019s most important gates.\n\nBuying the Post was not a financially momentous event in the life of Jeff Bezos. In addition to the billions in Amazon stock he owned, he had quietly invested in Google and Uber in their infancy. The Bezos imprimatur, the young companies had understood, would burnish their chances with any other would-be investor. (Uber\u2019s initial public offering alone earned him an estimated $400 million earlier this year, far more than he paid for the Post in 2013.) But the purchase was a turning point in Bezos\u2019s reputational history\u2014and realigned his sense of place in the world. On the eve of the acquisition, Amazon\u2019s relationship with New York publishing was contentious. The friendly guy who professed his love of Kazuo Ishiguro novels and had created a cool new way to buy books was now seen in some quarters as an enemy of literary culture and a successor to the monopolist Rockefeller. Not long before the acquisition, he had written a memo, obtained by Brad Stone, titled \u201cAmazon.love,\u201d asking the S-Team to ponder how the company could avoid becoming as feared as Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. Although he never justified the purchase of the Post as a response to his anxieties about Amazon\u2019s image\u2014and, of course, his own\u2014the question must have been on his mind as he considered the opportunity. To save a civically minded institution like the Post was a chance to stake a different legacy for himself.\n\nBezos keeps the Post structurally separate from Amazon\u2014his family office monitors the business of the paper\u2014but he runs it in the same expansionist spirit as he does his company. He vowed to put every dollar of profit back into the enterprise. In the six years of his ownership, the Post newsroom has grown from 500 to just over 850. Despite his investments in the institution, Bezos\u2019s transition to Washington, D.C., was halting and awkward. It took him several months to visit the Post newsroom and try to allay rank-and-file nervousness about the intentions of the new owner. When the Post\u2019s great editor Ben Bradlee died several months into his regime, he decided to attend the funeral only after Bob Woodward explained its spiritual significance. His attachment to the paper didn\u2019t seem to acquire emotional depth until he sent his jet to retrieve the reporter Jason Rezaian from Iran, where he\u2019d been imprisoned for 18 months, and personally accompanied him home. The press hailed Bezos for displaying such a strong interest in the fate of his reporter, a taste of how media extol those they regard as their own saviors. It may have taken him a moment to realize that Washington would be a new center of his life, but once he did, he rushed to implant himself there. In 2016, he paid $23 million to buy the site of a former museum just down the block from Woodrow Wilson\u2019s old home. The museum had joined together two mansions, one of which had been designed by John Russell Pope, the architect of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. Bezos kept one of the buildings as his residential quarters and set about renovating the other for the sake of socializing, a space that seemed to self-consciously recall Katharine Graham\u2019s old salon, except with geothermal heat. Washingtonian magazine, which obtained Bezos\u2019s blueprints, predicted that, once complete, it will become \u201ca veritable Death Star of Washington entertaining.\u201d", "description": "What the Amazon founder and CEO wants for his empire and himself, and what that means for the rest of us.", "authors": ["Franklin Foer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/10/WEL_Foer_BezosOpenerRedo/facebook.jpg?1570730871", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
