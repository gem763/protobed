Seven goals in 10 games may not convey the return of a striker in a slump, but nor does it paint the whole picture.\n\nDig deep into Harry Kane's record this past year and you'll find there is a case for concern\n\nThose are Kane's stats so far this season. On the face of it, they sound typically exceptional.\n\nBut beneath the surface there is evidence of a man out of sorts. Amid the chaos currently engulfing Tottenham, it has slipped under the radar.\n\nBut dig deep into Kane's record this past year and you'll find there is a case for concern.\n\nIn 2019, Kane has scored just 14 goals in all competitions for Tottenham; that is indisputably low by his standards.\n\nNine were scored in open play while the other five came from the penalty spot. That means 35 per cent of all of Kane's goals this year have come from penalties. In 2017 he scored 46 goals excluding penalties in all competitions for Tottenham and 29 in 2018.\n\nTo put it into further context, he has four fewer goals in open play than his team-mate Son Heung-min this year, eight fewer than Wolves striker Raul Jiminez and 16 fewer than Sadio Mane.\n\nIn 2019, forward Kane has scored just 14 goals in all competitions for Tottenham\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE TOP SCORERS IN 2019 ACROSS ALL COMPETITIONS\n\nWithout counting penalties, Kane would have four goals this season in all competitions \u2013 the same number as Mason Mount, Wesley and Ashley Barnes.\n\nPenalty duties normally fall under a striker's remit so are bound to supplement goal returns each season, but there appears to be a worrying over reliance on them in Kane's situation.\n\nAnd the fact he so readily dispatches them has perhaps paved over some of the cracks.\n\nStill, this week he was described as the best striker in the world by Tammy Abraham, who revealed his intentions to try and absorb everything he can from being in Kane's presence in the England camp for their Euro 2020 qualifiers.\n\nNine goals were scored in open play while the other five came from the penalty spot\n\nBias aside, it is a statement few would even bat an eyelid at. Kane is rightfully considered among the world's elite forwards, but is he really the No 1 on recent form? Certainly not. At the moment Kane is posting numbers inferior to those of Norwich's Teemu Pukki.\n\nSo to suggest he is a better striker than say Robert Lewandowski at present, who has 15 goals from 11 games this season, would be inane.\n\nKane's shooting stats in particular make for sober reading in comparison to his Premier League counterparts. This season, his shooting accuracy is significantly lower than Abraham, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's, Alexandre Lacazette's, Pukki's, Marcus Rashford's, Roberto Firmino's and Jamie Vardy's.\n\nHis shooting conversion rate is also lower than Abraham's, Sergio Aguero's, Aubameyan's, Lacazette's, Pukki's and Vardy's. An explanation for this could be that Kane has always been considered a 'volume shooter' \u2013 meaning he gets his goals from persistent shooting.\n\nTo put it into further context, he has 16 fewer goals in open play than Liverpool's Sadio Mane\n\nBut this season, he is only taking a shot every 30 minutes \u2013 equating to just three a game \u2013 which is uncharacteristically low for Kane.\n\nAbraham, Aubameyang, Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Lacazette and Pukki are all shooting at a more frequent rate. Even Firmino, who plays as a false nine in Liverpool's attack, is taking a shot every 27 minutes.\n\nCould it be down to Kane not being in the right areas or making the right runs, or is it his underachieving team-mates failing to carve out opportunities for him? In truth, the answer is probably a mixture of both.\n\nIt feels harsh to highlight Kane's shortcomings when he's been one of Tottenham's better performers in what's been a nightmare start to the season.\n\nThere's been this nagging sense for a while that Kane hasn't quite looked the same player\n\nBut there's been this nagging sense for a while that Kane hasn't quite looked the same player of a few years ago. Last term was the first time Kane had failed to reach the 25-goal mark for Tottenham since the 2013-14 season, although two ankle injuries had played a part in that, keeping him out of action for a total of 91 days.\n\nEven in other areas of his game, though, the stats support the theory that Kane has gone off the boil.\n\nAs well as being a goal machine, Kane has always been good in his interlink play. He often, and still does, pick the ball up deep and spray the ball out to the wings to start off a move, or find himself running the channels to hold up the ball or cross for a team-mate.\n\nTottenham rely on him for goals but also need him to chip in with assists. But in 2019, he has created less than a chance a game.\n\nSo far this season, Kane is creating a shooting opportunity for a team-mate every 119 minutes \u2013 less than most of his striking counterparts.\n\nThese stats are by no means dismal, but they aren't a reflection of what we've come to expect from Kane either. This is not a slur on Kane.\n\nThere's no denying that he remains a top-class player, but it's intriguing to note just how much the stats indicate he's been on the slide since the turn of the year.", "description": "THE NUMBERS GAME - JORDAN SEWARD: Beneath the surface there is evidence of a man out of sorts.
