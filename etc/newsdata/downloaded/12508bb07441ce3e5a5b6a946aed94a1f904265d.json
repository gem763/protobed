None of those defeats will matter now with Konta continuing her fine season in the grand slams with a third successive appearance in a quarter-final.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But I know that, like with everyone, there\u2019s always going to be certain players or certain types of game styles that are just more difficult for each player to play against.\n\n\u201cObviously my record shows that I find it difficult to play against Karolina. I\u2019m just pleased I was able to basically just find a way and enjoy being out there, knowing that nothing was for certain. I could have lost that match just as easily as I would have won it so I\u2019m pleased overall at how I stayed out there and played.\u201d\n\nIt was a see-saw of a match, Konta holding two points for a double break in the first set, only to be pegged back and blown away in the tie-break.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

hold to love stopped the bleeding before three break points were engineered. Eight points in a row brought Konta level at 3-3 and another break had Pliskova suddenly feeling the heat. At 5-3 two break points were saved, the first with a sensational forehand down the line, the second with a meaty volley, and when the Czech went long Konta levelled the match.\n\nIn a nip-and-tuck final set, Konta produced a gutsy hold to love for 5-5, and then broke to 15 to serve for the match. One match point came and went, but when the second arrived and Pliskova\u2019s return floated out, Konta raised her arms in celebration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this position twice before here, in the fourth round, so to go one step further is a massive achievement for me,\u201d added Konta. \u201cNow I\u2019m hoping to go two or three steps further.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Johanna Konta enjoyed one of the biggest wins of her career by beating third seed Karolina Pliskova to reach the quarter-finals at the US Open.
