But it has also stressed it would be mindful of any side-effects such an action could have, including the impact on financial institutions.\n\n(This story has been refiled to correctly say 2017 from 2015 in the fourth paragraph)", "description": "Japan's September consumer inflation seen to hit over two-year low: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9A08Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
