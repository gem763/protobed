Josh Hawley met with the attorney general about the Trump administration's background checks proposal. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Leaked background check plan sows chaos on Hill Senators say they're unwilling to support any gun proposal until Trump endorses it.\n\nA Trump administration proposal to expand background checks on firearms is already in jeopardy unless President Donald Trump unexpectedly saves it, with the White House distancing itself and the NRA outright opposing it.\n\nA background checks proposal began circulating Capitol Hill this week as Attorney General Bill Barr and other officials met with Senate Republicans to discuss new gun safety plans. But many Republicans hadn\u2019t read the proposal, and don\u2019t plan to take it seriously unless Trump personally weighs in.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about what\u2019s floating around,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to do anything that the president isn\u2019t going to sign anyway.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the proposal, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) first inquired if Trump publicly endorsed it as his own.\n\n\u201cOnce the president does, I\u2019ll look forward to reviewing it,\u201d Young said.\n\nBarr and White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland spent a second day Wednesday meeting with Republican senators to discuss expanding background checks, but no one is taking ownership of the document discussed at some of these meetings. The proposal would expand background checks to all commercial sales and create a new entity to perform them.\n\nRepublicans discussed the mixed messages in their lunch and how most of them needed to hear from the president before weighing in on anything on Wednesday, according to attendees.\n\nBarr wouldn\u2019t directly say whether the document came from the Justice Department, but Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said after meeting with Barr that the document \"there's no question that the heart of the attorney general's idea is a mechanism for expanding background checks beyond what we have today.\"\n\nA senator who met with Barr said that the attorney general made clear he had authorization from the White House.\n\nYet the White House seemed to brush off the proposal, creating confusion and echoing a consistent theme of the Trump presidency: when it comes to the president, only Trump speaks for Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president has not signed off on anything yet but has been clear he wants meaningful solutions that actually protect the American people and could potentially prevent these tragedies from ever happening again,\" said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAs far as the document circulating on the Hill, he added: \u201cThat is not a White House document, and any suggestion to the contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nThe NRA is also not on board, with Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, calling it \u201ca non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental health system and the prosecution of violent criminals.\u201d\n\nThe release of actual paper documentation of discussions between senators and the White House rapidly accelerates the political debate over background checks. And the NRA\u2019s swift denouncement of the plan highlighted how much more difficult sensitive discussions become once they spill into the open.\n\n\u201cYou know what happens when people have a target,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who met with Barr this week. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know who leaked it, but obviously that wasn\u2019t the idea.\u201d\n\nIndeed, just hours after being first reported by the Daily Caller and obtained by POLITICO, the proposal was already taking on heavy water. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said the proposal wasn\u2019t from the White House, was \u201cmaybe\u201d from the Justice Department and \u201cwouldn\u2019t support that\u201d regardless of where the proposal originated.\n\nBarr met this week with Cornyn and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Kennedy (R-La.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) this week and on Wednesday evening met with Toomey and Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who have been negotiating with the White House on expanding background checks. They said the 45-minute meeting was positive but there were no breakthroughs.\n\n\"The attorney general's bringing back the opinions of Republicans to the president,\" Murphy said. \"This is a complicated issue and it probably needs a creative solution to get to 60 votes. I can understand why the attorney general would want to spend some time up here surveying opinion before the White House firmly lands on a proposal.\"\n\nThe next steps were unclear. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said he believed what \u201cis going to happen is AG Barr is going to come up with a recommendation.\u201d But Barr himself downplayed the expanded background checks proposal to reporters Wednesday, saying he hadn\u2019t shared \u201cany list of proposals with the senators\u201d during his visits. He added that \u201cthere are a number of different proposals that are being considered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up here just kicking around some ideas, getting perspectives so I can be in a better position to advise the president,\u201d Barr said. \u201cBut the president has made no decision yet on these issues.\u201d\n\nManchin said Barr \u201cdeserves all the credit\u201d and \u201cwants to keep this on track, while Toomey noted \u201cit\u2019s significant that the attorney general is putting a specific idea on the table.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). said he too met with Barr and that the president has \u201cgot to lead\u201d or nothing will get done. He attributed the White House\u2019s distancing from the background check proposal as a way to preserve options.\n\nBarr and Ueland are seen less as advocates and more as carrying out the president's mission of talking to Republicans to see what they can support. At the same time, former NRA staffer Michael Williams is pushing back against the efforts from within the White House, much to the consternation of those involved. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, has also reached out to several senators on the issue and has made it clear she wants to see some type of action.\n\n\"There are former NRA employees in the White House. And so for every two or three steps that they seem to be taking, it seems to be pushing them back,\" said Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.).\n\nWhile senators, White House officials and the president himself have been discussing firearm reforms for six weeks now, the first concrete proposal came out with roughly a week before a two-week recess and amid a bruising fight over spending bills in the Senate. Some senators working on curbing gun violence want far more urgency.\n\n\u201cMy preference would be that we bring the bill to the Senate floor before the recess,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n\nUnder the administration proposal, background checks would be conducted through federal firearm licensees, also known as FFLs, or a newly created group of licensed transfer agents. Sellers would choose voluntarily whether the federal firearm licensees or a transfer agent keeps records of the transactions.\n\nBoth are concessions to Republicans fearful that gun owners would object to any proposal that requires them to submit to background checks as well as a fear that the government keeps their personal information.\n\nThe plan is narrower than a universal background checks bill passed by the House and pushed by top Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nTrump has yet to comment directly on it as both his own White House staff and Barr kept the proposal at arm's length. Until they hear from Trump himself, the draft floating around Capitol Hill says far less than a tweet or a statement from the president himself.\n\n\"In the end, [Trump] is going to have make a hard decision,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nJames Arkin, Anita Kumar and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report.", "description": "Senators say they're unwilling to support any gun proposal until Trump endorses it.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine", "Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a5/03/e28658f744d48c8c4123aaff4275/190918-josh-hawley-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
