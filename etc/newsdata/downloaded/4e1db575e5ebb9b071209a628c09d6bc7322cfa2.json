And yes, I am that flunky. The Queen has very little time to herself and not time to wear in her own shoes, and as we share the same shoe size it makes the most sense this way.\u201d\n\nSome may think the palace has actually made good use of the book to dispel reports that the Queen was offended when Michelle Obama put her arm around her at a Buckingham Palace reception.\n\n\u201cThe Queen has the ability to make everyone feel so relaxed that sometimes it feels instinctive to be tactile with her, just as Michelle Obama demonstrated during the State Visit with her husband, President Obama, in 2009,\u201d Kelly writes. \u201cMuch has been made about the meeting between Michelle and Her Majesty when an instant and mutual warmth was shared between these two remarkable women, and protocol was abandoned as they stood closely with their arms around each other\u2019s backs. In reality it was a natural instinct for the Queen to show affection and respect for another great woman and really there is no protocol that must be adhered to. When fondness is felt or the host of a State Visit goes to guide Her Majesty up some steps, it truly is about human kindness and this is something the Queen will always welcome warmly.\u201d\n\nAnother anecdote concerns the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony film, in which she made a cameo appearance: \u201cThere are few occasions on which Her Majesty will agree to break protocol, but in 2011 when film director Danny Boyle approached the Royal Household, he had a request to make that we simply could not refuse. She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: \u201cOf course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked whether she would like to say: \u201cGood evening, James,\u201d or \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bond,\u201d and she chose the latter, knowing the Bond films. Within minutes, I was back in Edward\u2019s office delivering the good news to Danny\u2014I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen\u2019s only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line: \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bond.\u201d\u2019\n\nIn 2018, the luxury underwear company Rigby and Peller was stripped of its royal warrant after a tell-all book by its founder, June Kenton, revealed details of HM\u2019s bra fittings.", "description": "Angela Kelly, the daughter of a Liverpool dock worker, has been dressing the queen for 20 years.
