In the present case, Google chilled its quantum processor to almost 460 degrees below zero, the point at which atomic particles cease to move.\n\nOne scientist who reviewed the paper, Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin, compared the feat to the Wright brothers\u2019 successful first flight of an airplane.\n\n\u201cThe original Wright flyer was not a useful airplane,\u201d Aaronson told the New York Times, \u201cBut it was designed to prove a point. And it proved the point.\u201d\n\nThe technology holds immense promise for the fields of artificial intelligence and code encryption. As such, it is considered vital to national security by both the United States and China.\n\nGoogle, whose unofficial company motto used to be \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d has been caught in the middle of turbulent U.S.-China relations. In 2018 it was revealed that the company tried to build a censored version of its search engine to enter the Chinese market. This after it withdrew from China in 2010 when the company realized the Chinese government was hacking into private gmail accounts.\n\nAt the time, hundreds of Google employees circulated an internal letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in the project.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese company Huawei is currently building 5G telecommunications networks in China and throughout the world, an advance that is projected to revolutionize communications technology and bring in vast economic benefits for those involved, including in Europe and Asia.\n\nHuawei has been accused of intellectual property theft and spying on behalf of the Chinese government.", "description": "Google announced on Wednesday that it has achieved a computational breakthrough known as \"quantum supremacy.\"", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
