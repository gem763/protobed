Comparing them, nation by nation, can tell us a lot about where in the world people are sad or happy. \u2026To answer this question, I update my annual Misery Index measurements.\n\nHanke explains the evolution of the Misery Index and how he puts together his version.\n\nThe first Misery Index was constructed by economist Art Okun in the 1960s as a way to provide President Lyndon Johnson with an easily digestible snapshot of the economy. That original Misery Index was just a simple sum of a nation\u2019s annual inflation rate and its unemployment rate. The Index has been modified several times, first by Robert Barro of Harvard and then by myself. My modified Misery Index is the sum of the unemployment, inflation and bank lending rates, minus the percentage change in real GDP per capita. Higher readings on the first three elements are \u201cbad\u201d and make people more miserable. These are offset by a \u201cgood\u201d (GDP per capita growth), which is subtracted from the sum of the \u201cbads.\u201d\n\nYou can see the entire list of 95 nations (some countries don\u2019t report adequate data, so they aren\u2019t counted) by clicking here.\n\nAnd here are the nations with the best scores (remember, this is a Misery Index, so the top results are at the bottom of the list).\n\nProfessor Hanke comments on Thailand\u2019s first-place results and Hungary\u2019s second-place results.\n\nThailand takes the prize as the least miserable country in the world on the 2018 Misery Index. It\u2019s 2018 rank of No. 95 out of 95 countries is a stunner. \u2026Hungary delivered yet another stunner, making a dramatic improvement from 2017 to 2018. It comes in at No. 94 as the second least miserable country in the world. While the European Union and the international elites have thrown everything they can throw at Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, it\u2019s easy to see why he commands a strong following at home.\n\nKeep in mind, by the way, that Hanke\u2019s list is a measure of annual economic outcomes.\n\nSo a relatively poor country can get a very good score. Indeed, they should get comparatively good scores according to convergence theory.\n\nAssuming, of course, that they have decent policy.\n\nHowever, if you look at the nations with the most miserable outcomes, you can see that many countries don\u2019t have decent policy.\n\nHere\u2019s Hanke\u2019s analysis of the world\u2019s worst performers.\n\nVenezuela holds the inglorious title of the most miserable country in the world in 2018, as it did in 2017, 2016, and 2015. The failures of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s socialist, corrupt petroleum state have been well documented\u2026 Argentina jumped to the No. 2 spot after yet another peso crisis. Since its founding, Argentina has been burdened with numerous economic crises. Most can be laid at the feet of domestic mismanagement and currency problems (read: currency collapses). To list but a few of these crises: 1876, 1890, 1914, 1930, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1985, 1989, 2001, and 2018.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, if you look at the actual Misery Index numbers, Venezuela is in first place by an enormous margin. Chalk that up as another \u201cvictory\u201d for socialism.\n\nMoreover, I\u2019m not surprised to see that Jordan, Ukraine, and South Africa are doing poorly. Sadly, there\u2019s not much hope for improvement in those nations.\n\nIt\u2019s also not a surprise to see Brazil on the list, though there may be room for optimism if the new government can adopt meaningful reforms.\n\nP.S. Professor Hanke noted that Arthur Okun created the first Misery Index. Okun also is famous for his explanation of the equity-efficiency tradeoff. Okun supported redistribution in order to increase equality of outcomes, but he was honest and admitted that this would mean less prosperity. Too bad international bureaucracies such as the OECD and IMF don\u2019t share Okun\u2019s honesty.", "description": "Looking through an economic lens, what\u2019s the best country in .10/03/2019 6:47:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
