The market determines. We had six contracts, so I\u2019d have to say no. It\u2019s worth what the market pays.\n\nWhat did you think it would go for? We guided at $4 million and I thought it would go in the early 4s.\n\nFor them to say 'Potts Point' may be a bit too much, but they can say 'Paddington'. \u2014 Real estate agent Catherine Dixon\n\nWhat was surprising about it?\n\nWe had six contracts out on it. All had up to $6 million to spend. I was surprised by the six contract holders and the 80-odd groups we had through \u2013 there were $5 million to $8 million properties on the market around Potts Point and Darling Point and no one was looking at those.\n\nI\u2019ve got something off-market in Darling Point I tried to offer and they all said \u201cNo way.\u201d Potts Point is a bridge too far, even in the post-lockout era.\n\nIt\u2019s especially [the case with] downsizers. These are people who have downsized from $9 million-$10 million properties. They\u2019ve sold big houses in Bronte, Vaucluse, Tamarama. They were people who specifically wanted to live close to the city. Buyers are looking for a half-way point where they\u2019ve got established shops. The [successful] buyers came from Vaucluse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor them to say \u201cPotts Point\u201d may be a bit too much, but they can say \u201cPaddington\u201d. It\u2019s gentrified and doesn\u2019t have the craziness of Potts Point and is busier than Elizabeth Bay. But there is nothing we can offer there. There\u2019s only one unit in every blue moon.\n\nThat area around Paddington and Woollahra village, if they can get a downsizing property that is not a house and is without stairs, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going for. I could sell 10 of those apartments.\n\nIt would be good to have $6 million and only have to spend $4 million because there\u2019s really no choice.\n\nDownsizing buyers from Sydney's outer eastern suburbs were keen to go close \u2013 but not too close \u2013 to the city.\n\nThere\u2019s a hierarchy of streets in Paddington, but this isn\u2019t one of them. This is at the end of Glenmore Road, where it meets Cascade Street. It is not one of the high-end streets such as Windsor Street or Paddington Street.\n\nThey were prepared to buy the property they wanted in the suburb they wanted but didn\u2019t need to have it in one of the high-end streets.\n\nIf the lockout laws remain in place in King Cross \u2013 they\u2019re starting to open up again in Darlinghurst \u2013 if they stay in place for the next five years, then the next stop for many of those moving to Paddington, the generation of late 40s, 50-year-olds, will go to Potts Point, but at the moment they won\u2019t go there. Maybe in five years\u2019 time they will go to Potts Point. But they just won\u2019t go there at the moment.\n\nDo you reckon we\u2019ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?\n\na) Next week. I\u2019m going to sell one of the off-market apartments in the building to the left-over buyers. I\u2019ve got enough buyers and we\u2019re now getting to the end of the year and running out of time. These people are ready to buy. The owner is ready to sell. I\u2019ll just slip them in.", "description": "If you've sold a house in Vaucluse, Paddington is an okay next step. But Potts Point?
