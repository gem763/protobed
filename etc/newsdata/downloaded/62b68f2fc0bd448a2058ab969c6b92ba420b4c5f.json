Prior to this date, the Kazakhstan Chamber of International Commerce and subsequently the Kazakhstan Civil Court (\u201cCivil Court\u201d) confirmed that a force majeure event had occurred which, under Kazakhstan subsurface use law, can be the basis for the Zharkamys Contract validity period to be extended for a period of 630 days. In May 2017, the Kazakhstan Court of Appeal (\u201cCourt of Appeal\u201d), pursuant to an appeal filed by the Ministry, ruled that the force majeure event was not recognized and reversed the decision of the Civil Court. The Company referred the case to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court (\u201cSupreme Court\u201d) and in November 2017 the Supreme Court ruling overturned both the Civil Court and the Court of Appeal rulings and referred the case back to the Civil Court for further review by a new panel of judges. In March 2018 the Civil Court ruling confirmed that the force majeure event had occurred. In April 2018 the Ministry appealed the Civil Court ruling and in May 2018 the Court of Appeal upheld the Civil Court ruling that the force majeure event had occurred. The Ministry did not appeal to the Supreme Court within the six months permitted by Kazakhstan law. The Company has submitted an application to the Ministry for the 630 day extension and expects the exploration period to the Zharkamys Contract to be extended during 2019.\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nThe following is a summary of abbreviations used in this news release:\n\nCA$ Canadian Dollars\n\nUS$ United States Dollars\n\nThe TSX does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\n\nFor further information, please contact Don Streu, President and CEO or Sandy Quilty, Vice President of Finance and CFO at 403-201-9694.", "description": "", "authors": ["Condor Petroleum Inc."], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/515424?filename=515424.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
