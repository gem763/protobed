Nigeria is also working with Russia to construct a nuclear power plant.\n\nNigeria\u2019s This Day provided some details of the meeting between Buhari and Putin:\n\n[The joint statement] said both leaders signed statements to work together to improve efficiency of Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, which it described as the backbone of the economy, in a way that will see to rehabilitation of epileptic oil refineries through establishment of framework for a joint venture between Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Russia-based leading oil company, Lukoil. Stating that NNPC and Lukoil will work towards prospection of oil in deep offshore, the statement said Nigeria and Russia also agreed to revive and solidify the venture between the NNPC and Russia\u2019s gas giant, Gazprom, for the development of Nigeria\u2019s enormous gas potential and infrastructure. It also said Buhari raised the issue of uncompleted and abandoned Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Mill, requesting for the return of Russia to the project on a government-to-government relationship for the completion and commissioning of the plant and was promptly accepted by Putin. The statement added that the Russian government agreed to support the development of Nigeria\u2019s rail infrastructure by constructing 1,400 kilometres track from Lagos to the South-south city of Calabar.\n\nBuhari and Putin agreed to revive a lapsed military cooperation agreement and make it possible for Nigeria to obtain more Russian military hardware and training, including a dozen Russian Mi-35 attack helicopters. This month, Nigerian officials said they thought Russia\u2019s experience at fighting the Islamic State in Syria could help Nigeria defeat Boko Haram, the local ISIS affiliate.\n\nTwo Russian Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable bombers arrived in South Africa on Wednesday as part of Russia\u2019s plan to increase its footprint in Africa, recovering from the diplomatic collapse that followed the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.\n\nBuhari was one of dozens of African leaders invited to Sochi by Putin to discuss increased trade, security cooperation, and debt relief. Putin announced at the meeting that Moscow will forgive about $20 billion of African debt.\n\nRussia\u2019s plans to build nuclear power plants in African nations have been criticized as debt traps that will lure the Africans into buying expensive infrastructure that is not well-suited to their needs. Nigeria is the only African nation aside from South Africa that meets the international guidelines for building a nuclear plant.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday his country embraces the opportunity to \u201cwiden and deepen\u201d cooperation with Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the experience, capabilities and modern technologies of Russian companies can be used to further develop the country\u2019s oil and gas sector,\u201d Novak said, pointing to Nigeria\u2019s need for outside investment to bring its oil refineries up to capacity. Among other problems, Nigeria\u2019s oil infrastructure has often been sabotaged and looted by insurgents.", "description": "Nigeria and Russia sign security and economic cooperation agreements, including oil and gas development and military hardware purchases.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177744815-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
