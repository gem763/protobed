On the one hand, it puts brands who continue with business as usual into the shade, while on the other it highlights eco-conscious designers.\n\nMarni fell into the latter category on Friday at its spring/summer 2020 show. Creative director Francesco Risso said after the show that he would not join the hundreds of thousands of people protesting around the world, but that he was striking in his own way.\n\nHigh-octane glitz for Versace as J-Lo brings the house down Read more\n\nHis show proved to be a vehicle for the second part of a collaborative art project that started with his menswear show in June, in which guests sat under a suspended ceiling of plastic bottles that his team had collected. For Friday\u2019s show, the same bottles had been recycled into a set of palm tree leaves by the artist Judith Hopf, with cardboard trunks repurposed from mechanical pulp and old clothing. They were, he said, \u201cpieces we will keep and treasure \u2013 they aren\u2019t pieces we are going to waste. I hope they are going to have their own life.\u201d\n\nHe extended the repurposing idea to the collection itself. Fabric that appeared on prom dresses looked like taffeta but was actually made from recycled plastic bottles. Other outfits comprised fabric from the archives that the brand will remake in limited editions to be sold.\n\nRisso said he was in Brazil when the Amazon rainforest fires started last month, an experience which left him \u201ccrying for weeks\u201d and inspiring an energy in him that reminded him of the protest songs of Brazilian musicians Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. \u201cThey were so joyous and political and it\u2019s the lure of nature that for us it\u2019s the only possibility to connect with our own tribes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest What the collection had in credentials it somewhat lacked in accessible takeaways.

What the collection had in credentials it somewhat lacked in accessible takeaways. Marni is usually a brand that can be relied upon to deliver tension between eccentricity and everyday clothes, whereas this collection did not balance the scale.\n\nMany will see it as problematic for a fashion house to be presenting another new collection of clothes while simultaneously despairing at the state of the environment, but credit should still be given to a brand addressing the issue when so many are not.\n\nRisso said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to proclaim myself as doing something sustainable because it\u2019s easy to promote that word and not really be sustainable, but we are starting \u2013 this is our joyous process.\u201d", "description": "Francesco Risso unveils collection as Milan fashion week coincides with Global Climate Strike", "authors": ["Scarlett Conlon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206d1e07b10f5fca405f8726285bb8b4e713c0d1/0_102_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64dfccf55abb741224146c5d2e0ecee6", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
