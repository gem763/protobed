(AP) - Talk about sweet charity.\n\nAll this month Old King\u2019s Coffeehouse on Route 28 is donating the proceeds from sales of specially crafted pink iced doughnuts to a local nonprofit organization that helps cancer patients and survivors.\n\nWith their rounded shapes and caramel tips, the doughnuts look so much like women\u2019s breasts that customers have taken to calling them \u201cbooby\u201d doughnuts.\n\nThe eye-catching look is intentional, said Mark Corliss, who opened Old King\u2019s Coffeehouse with his wife, Kate Corliss, in June.\n\n\u201cYou need something to help attract attention,\u201d said Mark, who also owns Spilt Milk Tattoo in Hyannis.\n\n\u201cPeople take pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have had a blast with it.\u201d\n\nSo far this month the coffeehouse has sold 2,050 of the pink doughnuts priced at $3 apiece, said Kate, who manages the coffeehouse.\n\nThe fundraiser for the Cape Wellness Collaborative ends Thursday, she said.\n\nThe \u201cbooby doughnuts\u201d pay tribute to breast cancer patients and survivors who make up a sizable portion of the collaborative\u2019s clientele.\n\n\u201cAll of us at the CWC are so grateful for the booby doughnuts,\u201d said Harwich musician Sarah Swain, who founded the collaborative in 2014.\n\nThe nonprofit organization provides a variety of wellness services including massage, acupuncture and nutrition counseling to people going through or recovering from all types of cancer treatment, including prophylactic surgery.\n\n\u201cI lost my mother to ovarian cancer, my grandmother to breast cancer, and I myself have undergone a bilateral mastectomy after going (through) genetic counseling and finding out that I carry a high-risk gene,\u201d Swain said via email.\n\nThe doughnut sale is not only raising awareness about breast cancer but also is \u201chelping us get the word out to our community that there is a local cancer charity where all of their dollars will stay here on Cape Cod,\u201d Swain said.\n\nThe collaborative offers \u201cservices insurance companies don\u2019t cover that can really help people,\u201d Mark said.\n\nHe\u2019s no stranger to helping people with cancer, regularly volunteering his time to tattoo realistic-looking nipples for women who have had breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomies.\n\nIn the last six years, the number of tattooed sets has come to about 700, Mark said.\n\n\u201cWorking with so many breast cancer patients over the years has inspired him to do this fundraiser,\u201d Swain said. \u201cHe is an amazing community connector.\u201d\n\nThe pink doughnut was Mark\u2019s idea, said Kate, who has a background in the restaurant business.\n\n\u201cThen he gave me the creative freedom to run with it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe doughnut comes with a strawberry jam filling, pink French vanilla glaze and caramel chip in the middle.\n\nMore than 12 local businesses, including Shoreline Pools, Whalen Restoration Services and Old Yarmouth Inn, have either purchased doughnuts or made a monetary contribution to the Cape Wellness Collaborative, Mark said.\n\nLinda Basinsky, shift supervisor at Old King\u2019s Coffeehouse, said she brought the doughnuts to a mammography appointment at the Cuda Women\u2019s Center on Wilkens Lane in Hyannis.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like a \u2018thank you\u2019 for what they do,\u201d Basinsky said.\n\nSome people blush when they hear someone order a \u201cbooby doughnut,\u201d Basinsky said.\n\nBut that was not the case with a police officer who recently placed an order, said fellow shift supervisor Meaghan Golden.\n\n\u201cHe ordered \u2018a medium dark roast and one booby doughnut,\u2019\u201d Golden said. He said it was to \u201csupport the cause.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2BNKGQj\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Cape Cod (Mass.)
