Where there is pollution, we want to protect our consumers.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a city your skin, your hair is challenged more than if you were living in a rural area, so you need more shampoos, conditioners, skin care, hydrating creams, anti-UV, etc. Urban life means more socialization, and more socialization means more beauty consumption.\u201d\n\nMillennials want to match their online looks in the real world\n\nHe also insisted that a trend among millennials to digitally enhance their looks on social media, such as Instagram and Snapchat(TICKER:SNAP), is not making beauty products redundant but actually boosting business. \u201cThe more you make yourself look really great online,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more you have to work on yourself when you go out, because if, when people meet you, they discover that you are completely different from what they thought, then you have a problem.\n\n\u201cIf they want to use filters to look better online, they have to do something in real life also to look better, and that is why they use more cosmetics, more makeup, more skin care, more everything.\u201d\n\nHollywood star Kirsten Dunst signed up as L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand ambassador\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al, which has just signed film star Kirsten Dunst as a brand ambassador, has been embracing innovation itself, and Agon can see a day when consumers 3D-print their lipstick and buy beauty ranges for their pets.\n\nRead: Kourtney Kardashian comes to Capitol Hill to lobby for cosmetics bill\n\nAgon spoke to MarketWatch in Vancouver, Canada, ahead of a keynote speech to the Consumer Goods Forum, and the company has since posted its half-year results.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al saw a 12.1% rise in half-year operating profit to \u20ac2.8 billion ($3.1 billion) on the back of a 10.6% increase in reported sales to \u20ac14.8 billion.\n\nDisappointing results\n\nDisappointing makeup sales in its key U.S. market, though, caused the company to miss some analysts\u2019 second-quarter growth targets, wiping 4.1% off the shares on the day of the earnings report. This is after a good run that had seen the shares lifted more than 96% over a five-year period, compared with a 53% rise by the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% .\n\nNorth America contributes 25.7% of group sales, less than the 28.4% of sales that come from Western Europe.\n\nRead: These \u2018global champions\u2019 may be your best bet for long-term stock investing\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything to restimulate the [U.S.] market: repositioning and innovating,\u201d Agon said in a follow-up call, after the financial update. \u201cInternally we are perfectly on plan for this year for the group - this first half is one of the best we have ever had. There are bright spots and less bright spots, so pretty normal.\u201d\n\n\u2018Immune to crisis\u2019\n\nBack in Vancouver he made the investment case for the business, saying it is attractive because of the diversity of its product range and its geographical spread. \u201cWe are the No. 1 beauty company, but mostly because we cover all channels, all categories, all geographies, all consumer needs, all psychographics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would say that the beauty business is pretty immune to crisis. That is why, by the way, as you know, the price-to-earnings ratio of a company like L\u2019Or\u00e9al is pretty high. It is at 31 right now because investors and analysts acknowledge the fact that, whatever happens, L\u2019Or\u00e9al will be able to keep growing, keep developing, and keep increasing its profitability.\n\nRead: Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s cat Choupette could inherit part of his fortune\n\nL\u2019Oreal\u2019s main rivals are Est\u00e9e Lauder EL, -1.22% , Coty COTY, +0.76% COTY, +0.76% and Shiseido 4911, +2.19% .", "description": "The boss of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the world\u2019s largest beauty company, admitted in an interview with MarketWatch that pollution is good for business.
