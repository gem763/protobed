With high emission levels, their average size could increase 80 percent, and more extreme heat waves could more than double in size, it predicted.\n\nThe study, published Oct. 7 in the journal Environmental Research Letters, was partly funded by the Climate Observations and Monitoring Program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Program Office.\n\nPredictions about the growing size of heat waves could help utilities plan for the future, according to the researchers.\n\n\u201cHeat wave size is another dimension of extreme heat that people don\u2019t necessarily think of,\u201d Lyon said in a NOAA news release. \u201cIt\u2019s a different vantage point from which to view them and assess their impacts.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that the length and severity of heat waves could increase substantially, which came as no surprise to the researchers.\n\n\u201cAn increase in attributes like magnitude and duration is consistent with expectations of a warming climate,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cWhat is new in our study is the way we calculated them, which allowed us to consider size as a new heat wave dimension.\u201d\n\nMore information\n\nThe World Health Organization has more on climate change and health.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
