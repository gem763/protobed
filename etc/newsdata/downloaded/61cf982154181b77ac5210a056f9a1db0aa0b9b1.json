But the not so fun part is when we have to go out and buy gifts for our family during the insane festive season.\n\nBut how do you survive festive shopping in a mall without going crazy or broke? Simple! You shop online, which is why sales like Amazon\u2019s Great Indian Festival is a boon that we all need. After having a successful run at the start of the month, the sale will be back with it\u2019s \u201cCelebration Special\u201d in collaboration with millions of sellers, artisans and brands, making it the perfect time to do some Diwali shopping.\n\nHere are a few items that you cannot go wrong with when it comes to buying gifts for the loved ones:\n\n1. Samsung Smart Watch:\n\nAccessories are one of the easiest lists to choose from. You can get earrings for your sister or a watch for your brother.
