The paper also reported similar scenes in Indonesia after the Krakatau volcano erupted in 1883 and Mount Pinatubo blew in 1991.\n\nHaze occurs annually during the dry spell between July and October due to open burning in Indonesia and to lesser extent, parts of Malaysia.\n\nPart of the problem is caused by big corporations and farmers, who use a slash-and-burn technique to clear land for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations.\n\nThis summer\u2019s haze has been the worst in years and Indonesia last week arrested nearly 200 people for the fires which have caused air quality to plummet, thousands of schools to close, and some flights to be cancelled.\n\nJakarta has deployed thousands of troops as temporary fire fighters and used dozens of water-bombing aircraft to battle blazes.\n\nThe Indonesian authorities have also sealed off multiple plantations where land was spotted burning, warning that owners could face criminal charges if they were found to have started the fires without permission.\n\nOn Monday, several parts of southern Thailand, including the popular holiday destination of Phuket, also reported air quality reaching \u201cunhealthy\u201d levels due to the drifting pollution from Indonesia.", "description": "The skies over an Indonesia province have become so polluted by widespread forest fires that they began to glow a post-apocalyptic red over the weekend.", "authors": ["Nicola Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/39XWqHO51NQENox2GzAfKQ--~B/aD00NDk7dz03MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/1e1a8ddbe5c060c6916f8d7d3093cf43", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
