The game\u2019s new Switch port allows players to go from one to the other, like magic. On this week\u2019s Kotaku Splitscreen, we talked about how great that feels.\n\nFirst up, I talk about all of the Gears 5 multiplayer modes, and Jason describes his time with The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening, which is great except for its lacklustre Chamber Dungeons mode.\n\nKirk is playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 and he also beat Telling Lies. Next, we get into the news of the week (33:53), including new discoveries in P.T., Destiny\u2019s five-year anniversary, and esports\u2019 quest to get into the Olympic Games.\n\nWe close with off-topic talk (48:58) about Derren Brown\u2019s \u201cSecret,\u201d Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, Succession, an NFL story from Jason, and Kirk\u2019s music pick of the week.\n\nRead an excerpt below.\n\nI had to restart it because they released a Definitive Edition and they fixed all the stuff in the back half. I was into the final act; I was 80 hours into the game, but I would rather see the better version of the ending. That means I had to start over, and that just stopped me, because that\u2019s a lot of time to replay into a game that\u2019s really big and thick.\n\nSo this game coming out on Switch, which they announced at the Direct... it was a really unexpected thing, and the game was out that day. So I got a code for it. I don\u2019t know if I would have bought this having already played the game so much and played it on PC, but man, I am in a perfect position to take advantage of this game on Switch because it has cross-save with Steam.\n\nJason: And it works really well. It\u2019s just immediate.\n\nKirk: Holy shit, it\u2019s incredible. I\u2019ll talk about how the game plays a little bit, but the fact that you can just pick it up and it\u2019s like, boom. Load your save! And then you play, and then you quick-save and it saves it, then close the game and then load it on PC and I\u2019m right where I left off. That is amazing. That is the dream. This is the first time I\u2019ve had that for this kind of game on the Switch.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t play or look as good on the Switch; it\u2019s not even close. Obviously, I think this game really benefits from having a mouse and a keyboard, so the controller stuff is just really finicky, but also it just doesn\u2019t look that great. Still, it looks pretty good. It looks fine. Especially because I already know the game, because I already played it.\n\nI\u2019m almost an ideal person for this kind of a Switch port, because I know the game. I know where I\u2019m going. It\u2019s easier for me to find my way around, and I know who to talk to and what to do. Figuring all of that out on a smaller screen with a controller might be a pain, if someone\u2019s never played this game and just played it on Switch. Then again, it might be fine, because it\u2019s a really good game.\n\nAnyway, I think that that\u2019s just amazing. The cross-save thing feels like magic, and that\u2019s exciting. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m really going to play the game all the way through, because I don\u2019t have that much time, but it\u2019s cool to have the option.", "description": "Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a big, chewy role-playing game that benefits from a mouse and keyboard, but sometimes, you just want to lie down on the couch and play a game on the Switch.
