But contrary to what some are saying, no channels have been unverified yet, and owners who received a warning email can appeal it.\n\nThe flap illustrates the growing distrust of the YouTube community, and willingness to assume the worst in light of unclear communication.\n\nYouTube has endured several conflicts with creators this year, with some complaining about harassment and hate speech, and others arguing that the platform's rules about removing advertisements \u2014 a process called \"demonetization\" \u2014 are random and poorly explained. Creators counts on ads as their main source of revenue.\n\nCEO Susan Wojcicki has defended unpopular speech on the platform, arguing that openness does more good than harm.\n\nVerification has been important for channel owners because it helps their videos appear more prominently in search results, according to The Verge, although it's no longer clear if that will be the case.\n\nThe latest incident started Thursday morning, when YouTube explained that it was making some changes to how it signifies verified channels. It also said that it would only verify channels if they needed to be distinguished from channels with a similar name.\n\nTo be verified, channels must now have a prominent channel name that represents a well-known or highly searched creator, artist, brand or public figure, as well as a demonstrated need to differentiate themselves from other channels with a similar name. [emphasis added]\n\nA spokesperson also clarified that channels representing well-known brands, such as media companies or musicians, might need verification even if they don't have 100,000 followers, which was a previous criterion.\n\nIn other words, YouTube is making verification a lot less common, and less a badge of honor or sign of popularity than a simple way for users to avoid confusion.\n\nAlmost immediately, people incorrectly started complaining that check marks identifying verified accounts were disappearing:\n\nYouTube tried to clarify, saying that nobody was unverified on Thursday.\n\nIn addition, many popular YouTubers started expressing outrage over the notes they got saying that their channels were going to be unverified.\n\nBut their complaints ignored the fact that YouTube is basically getting rid of verification for almost everybody \u2014 except for channels that might be confused with others, such as musicians' channels that might be confused with fan channels.\n\nYouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWATCH: Google to pay $170 million to settle YouTube case", "description": "The flap illustrates the growing distrust of the YouTube community, and willingness to assume the worst in light of unclear communication.", "authors": ["Matt Rosoff"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105959173-1560219107347gettyimages-684238732.jpeg?v=1566313229", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
