But it was ultimately used by Twitter's ad-targeting system, which allows advertisers to tailor their audiences according to \"the advertiser's own marketing lists (e.g., email addresses or phone numbers they have compiled).\"\n\n\"When an advertiser uploaded their marketing list, we may have matched people on Twitter to their list based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes,\" the company wrote. \"This was an error and we apologize.\"\n\nThe FTC settled with Twitter in 2011 over allegations that it had deceived customers and put their personal privacy at risk.\n\nThe top social media companies in the country have faced a barrage of privacy scandals over the past several years as consumers become more wary of how their information is being collected and used for advertising purposes. While Facebook has dealt with the highest-profile hacks and breaches, companies like Twitter and Google have faced scrutiny over how they collect and utilize user data.\n\nThe U.S. currently have a comprehensive federal privacy law, but lawmakers in the House and Senate are working to draw up legislation that would define for companies what they are required to disclose about their data collection practices and how they can utilize information the information they collect about users.", "description": "Twitter on Tuesday disclosed that it \"inadvertently\" misused\u00a0used users' phone numbers and email addresses\u00a0for ad targeting purposes, even though\u00a0users gave that information to Twitter to boost their account security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/twitter_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
