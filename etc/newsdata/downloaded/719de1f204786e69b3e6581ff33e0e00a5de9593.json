But he also reminded B\u00f6hmermann of the menial but necessary tasks that came with membership and would be expected of him, such as campaigning, door-knocking, talking to ordinary voters and putting up posters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward very much to the fact that you\u2019ll now be by our side fighting for a strong social democracy,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThere are inevitably fears within the party that this is another one of B\u00f6hmermann\u2019s \u201cgags\u201d and that its decision to let him in could backfire.\n\nA glimpse at his leadership bid speech, launched under the hashtag slogan #Neustart19 (new start \u201819), \u2018dare to be more democratic\u2019 - suggests they are right to be wary.\n\nIn it he refers to social democracy as \u201cGermany\u2019s Amazon\u201d which could ill afford to decline outside help. \u201cWe need to save the red lung of Germany, whether it likes it or not,\u201d he said.\n\nB\u00f6hmermann boasts that he has three times as many Twitter followers as the rest of the party leadership put together. He says his biggest problem is not having a female partner to stand alongside him for the co-leadership and appeals for candidates to come forward. He says there are plenty of other examples of television personalities entering politics, most notably Steffen Seibert, the spokesman of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was previously a prominent news anchor.\n\nIndeed, there are also examples of comics who have realised their political ambitions, such as Beppe Grillo of the populist 5 Star Movement in Italy and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky. In the US, Donald Trump was a reality TV star before becoming president.\n\nRonald Mormann, chair of the district chapter in Saxony-Anhalt, which finally agreed to accept B\u00f6hmermann\u2019s membership after weeks of internal debate, said the party was prepared forgive B\u00f6hmermann for his previous acidic criticisms of it.\n\n\u201cBut satire can get away with a lot, and Germany\u2019s oldest party is capable of enduring a lot. German social democracy has fought for 156 years for people to be able to express their opinions openly,\u201d he said. But he also reminded B\u00f6hmermann: \u201cWe are a party, and not a satirical performance.\u201d\n\nB\u00f6hmermann has said he will follow December\u2019s leadership contest closely, but predicted it would not go well. \u201cI estimate that by the spring of 2020, the SPD will already be looking for a new leader, and my team and I will then be even better prepared ... then it will work out,\u201d he said.", "description": "Jan B\u00f6hmermann says he will be ready by next contest to lead Social Democratic party - which he predicts will soon", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cea6466227af4aa426134699b09c104e2b31dfb/0_422_2832_1698/master/2832.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9cbb67b1daa933b79e0a7474c4c73c5"}
