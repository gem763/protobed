Meeks, a Democrat, represents New York\u2019s 5th Congressional District in the House of Representatives.\n\nDear anonymous:\n\nThis month marks a year since you published an op-ed in the New York Times claiming that within the Trump administration there exists a defiant resistance, working to curb this president\u2019s worst inclinations and holding together the \u201csteady state.\u201d\n\nIn the time since, President Trump has given cover to Saudi Arabia after it murdered a U.S.-based journalist, continued to enrich himself and his family by welcoming foreign delegations at his hotels, dangled pardons in front of officials who may break the law while carrying out his border policies, and obstructed the investigations into Russian interference in our elections.\n\nMost recently, Trump has solicited a foreign government to interfere in our elections by pressing it to pursue baseless allegations and dig up dirt on a political opponent. And he made this request using the weight of the presidential office and the leverage of U.S. military aid.\n\nWe know this because a whistleblower in the intelligence community was duly alarmed by the request, saw the administration act to bury the evidence, and filed a complaint. That complaint almost didn\u2019t make it to Congress, as required by law, because the acting director of national intelligence first brought it to one of the subjects of the complaint \u2014 the Justice Department \u2014 which again attempted to bury it.\n\nThere is no telling whether you, the author of the anonymous op-ed, are still in the administration. It may well be that you\u2019re among the many who\u2019ve been pushed out or left willingly under this administration\u2019s historic rate of personnel turnover. Regardless, last year you wrote that \u201cmany Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump\u2019s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\u201d\n\nThat strategy is clearly no longer working \u2014 if it ever did.\n\nAnd how many of you are left? With each passing day, the Trump administration trades patriots for sycophants who will support anything this president says or does to stay in his good graces.\n\nThose of you who are still there, it is time to come out of the shadows. Our nation does not need covert agents of democracy. It needs intrepid whistleblowers willing to step forward and defend the institutions this president has dragged into the dirt with him.\n\nLast September, you wrote: \u201cThe root of the problem is the president\u2019s amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making.\u201d I could not have said it better myself. It is foolhardy to assume you can tame or manage Trump. His worst inclinations are his primary inclinations.\n\nNow, suffering no consequences from the Mueller investigation, the president has become more emboldened to entrench himself in corruption. In June, he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that he sees nothing wrong with inviting foreign intervention in our elections. His call with the president of Ukraine was simply him following through.\n\nThe pattern is always the same. The president denies, he discredits, he admits, he distracts. He does this always with an air of indignation, because deep down he clearly believes he is entitled to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Through words and deeds, Trump has made that explicit.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes him dangerous. When asked about inviting foreign interference, Trump\u2019s defense wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d never do such a thing. His defense was that he\u2019d never do it in a way that gets him caught.\n\nUltimately, that is what, if you\u2019re still on the fence, should bring you over. Because whatever you, anonymous patriot, think you\u2019re able to influence, whatever you think you know is happening in the White House, there is probably much, much more. It\u2019s a risk none of us can afford.\n\nWhile House committees continue to conduct their congressional oversight responsibilities to uncover whatever they can, it is time for you \u2014 yes, you \u2014 to come forward and tell us what you know. Do not allow this president to intimidate you into silence. There is too much at stake.\n\nAt the conclusion of your op-ed, summing up the late Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R) farewell letter, you wrote: \u201cAll Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap, with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, Republicans, lifelong neutral public servants alike: We must all put country over party, before a time comes when we can no longer recognize the country we\u2019ve allowed it to become.", "description": "Put country above party and show yourself.", "authors": ["Gregory W.
