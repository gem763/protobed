Schutt cleaned up the tail in the last three balls of the West Indies innings, her 3-24 reducing the hosts to a moderate 180.\n\nEllyse Perry's ton helps Australia wrap up ODI series in West Indies Read more\n\nIn reply, Australia reached their target with eight wickets to spare with Alyssa Healy (61 off 32 balls), Lanning (58 not out) and Ellyse Perry (33 not out) getting among the runs to complete a 3-0 series sweep.\n\nLanning\u2019s half-century makes her Australia\u2019s top run-scorer across all three formats of the game and the skipper said it was pleasing to close out the ODI series.\n\nAustralian Women's Cricket Team \ud83c\udfcf (@AusWomenCricket) Another milestone for Meg Lanning who moves past the great Karen Rolton to become the greatest run scorer across all formats in the history of Australia's women \ud83d\ude4c#Megastar #WatchMe pic.twitter.com/TXqIrWQOHM\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, we spoke about heading into today that we finish off the job and stick to our game plan the way we want to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe bowled first today which was different to the first couple of games and I though we bowled pretty well, obviously Megan with the hat-trick there at the end was great.\n\n\u201cTo finish off so dominantly with the bat I think is really pleasing as well. I think we\u2019ve got that dominant and brutal nature now and we want to make sure we don\u2019t let teams back in and we keep playing the way we want to.\n\n\u201cI think the good thing is we have so many contributors in our side, everyone\u2019s really hungry to do well and I think we\u2019ve seen that throughout the series.\u201d\n\nThe win earned Australia another two crucial ICC Championship points and a four-point lead ahead of second-placed England.
