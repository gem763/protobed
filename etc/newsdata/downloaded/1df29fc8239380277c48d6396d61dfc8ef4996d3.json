Many of them dismissed proposals to create economic opportunity outside the handful of \u201cknowledge economy\u201d hubs in the nation\u2019s largest metropolitan areas as inefficient transfers to lagging places.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats\u2019 long-standing hold on urban America meant the party came to represent the winners of the \u201cknowledge economy\u201d \u2014 the largest, richest metropolitan areas \u2014 and the party\u2019s leadership hailed from states home to the nation\u2019s most successful \u201csuperstar\u201d cities. Many of the party\u2019s political strategists encouraged a blindness to the economic and social problems confronting much of the country by urging candidates to spend their time and energy mobilizing their urban base rather than courting hard-to-reach and hard-to-get rural voters. Campaigning outside the country\u2019s cities has not been a priority for Democratic candidates and their strategists, let alone having something to say to these communities.\n\nBut while few prominent Democrats demanded solutions to address regional inequality, the party\u2019s intellectual infrastructure also didn\u2019t provide them for a long time.", "description": "", "authors": ["Clara Hendrickson", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
