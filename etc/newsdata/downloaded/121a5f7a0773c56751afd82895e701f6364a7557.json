Shame on them, absolutely disgusting.\n\n'Taking the p*** out of dogs like rescue dogs that are petrified of fireworks and thinking it's OK and that they are not going to get any backlash... Let's hope they are told and they buck up their idea, insensitive p*****!'\n\nAnother commented: 'That is properly atrocious?! Gobsmacked,' while one wrote: 'It's sad they don't realise they are causing this.'\n\nA photo of Cheltenham Fireworks' advert was shared widely on social media, where it provoked a furious backlash\n\nOne Facebook user called it 'very, very sad' while another blasted the company for having 'no consideration for livestock or wildlife'.\n\n'Is it not enough that your product causes fear and alarm and psychological distress to animals domestic and wild?' asked another.\n\n'The effects upon those with PTSD, elderly and of a fearful disposition can be severe. But you advertise the distress you cause! Vile!'\n\nLaura Stewart, a dog walker from Stroud, told Gloucestershire Live: 'I was absolutely sick when I saw it. It's something that terrifies both dogs and people and to actually take the mick out of it is awful. They just don't care about people's animals at all.'\n\nOne Facebook user called it 'very, very sad' while another blasted the company for having 'no consideration for livestock or wildlife'\n\nWes Reid, 47, from Tewkesbury, told the publication the billboard is in 'very poor taste' and 'crass and most inconsiderate'.\n\nLee Hicks from Cheltenham Fireworks hit back, arguing: 'Firstly, we did not intend to offend anyone in any way shape or form with our advert,\" he said.\n\n'The idea came about because we are pet owners ourselves and we are more than aware of the distress loud noises can cause to not only animals but people too.\n\n'As our Staffy has got older she has become less tolerant to fireworks, but with caring for her in the correct manner has improved her overall wellbeing during the firework season.\n\n'Every year we get bombarded by social media haters for trying to run a professional business. The power of social media can be overwhelming and quite upsetting.\n\nTypically supermarkets and other general retail outlets sell fireworks in the October to November period and for New Year, but do not sell at the other periods in most areas\n\n'We are a specialist firework company with a licence to sell fireworks all year round and pride ourselves not only on the quality of our products but the advice we give on safely enjoying fireworks.\n\n'After all, it is a tradition than thousands of people enjoy every year and have done since 1605.\n\n'I would like to give a heartfelt apology to my wife and family for the upset this has caused to them with personal abuse they have received and secondly for those who have taken offence from our advert.'\n\nFemail has reached out to Cheltenham Fireworks for comment.\n\nTypically supermarkets and other general retail outlets sell fireworks in the October to November period and for New Year, but do not sell at the other periods in most areas.\n\nHundreds of thousands of fireworks are sold each year in October and November and in the run up to New Year's Eve\n\nSainsbury's is understood to be the first major retailer to carry a year-round ban. The Co-Op confirmed it has not sold fireworks in its stores for the past five years.\n\nUsing or buying fireworks illegally can result in a \u00a35,000 fine or imprisonment for up to six months.\n\nCeva Animal Health said they surveyed pet owners about the worst time of years for their animals.\n\nAbbie King, product manager from Ceva said: 'Bonfire Night is a very challenging night for our pets, due to the unpredictable, loud sounds of fireworks and the unusual smells from bonfires and sparklers.\n\n'Our survey has now shown that Bonfire Night is the most distressing occasion for pets during the year and 81 per cent of pet owners are unable to calm their pets.\n\n'As much as everyone loves to join in the festivities over the winter months, it\u2019s important that owners take their pet\u2019s mental health into consideration and take the appropriate steps to make them feel as relaxed as possible.'", "description": "The controversial poster campaign from Gloucestershire-based Cheltenham Fireworks featured the slogan: 'We don't sell pet ear defenders but we do sell fawking good fireworks!'", "authors": ["Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20274540-0-image-a-179_1572258360169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
