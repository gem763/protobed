(Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump had a simple explanation for the loose $20 bills jutting out of his back pocket as he boarded Air Force One this week: He\u2019s a good tipper.\n\n\u201cI do like leaving tips at the hotel. You know, I like to carry a little something,\u201d he told reporters aboard the plane Wednesday when asked about the money captured in a shot by a Reuters photographer. \u201cMaybe a president is not supposed to do it, but I like to leave a tip at the hotel, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d\n\nFor Trump \u2014 who has responded to accusations that he profits from the presidency by claiming that he is instead losing billions \u2014 the explanation was met with a predictable mix of praise, skepticism and surprise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the haters will enjoy making fun, but I\u2019ve personally witnessed @realDonaldTrump tip basically everyone in existence while playing golf, eating meals etc.,\u201d Doug Stafford, chief political strategist for Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), tweeted Thursday. \u201cIt is a nice gesture that I\u2019m quite positive is not often done by people in anywhere near his position.\u201d\n\nFormer White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman said her experience with Trump, dating back to 2003, was quite different.\n\n\u201cI have never seen Donald Trump tip,\u201d said Manigault Newman, who had a falling out with the president after she was fired last year. \u201cI can honestly tell you, I\u2019ve never seen him tip.\u201d\n\nThe episode on Air Force One stands out as a rare instance in which Trump revealed something new about his personal habits, telling reporters that he doesn\u2019t carry a wallet or credit cards and instead keeps a loose wad of cash in his back pocket for tipping purposes. Presidents have long been scrutinized over how they treat the servers, waiters and maids they come across, as voters analyze the brief interactions between the country\u2019s most powerful person and the low-wage workers they represent.\n\nWhether presidents leave a tip \u2014 and how much they give \u2014 is often viewed as a tangible signal of how they view the country\u2019s working class.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that Trump\u2019s willingness to occasionally hand out cash to his employees existed long before he became president.\n\nWorkers at Trump\u2019s golf clubs \u2014 including many undocumented immigrants \u2014 have said Trump handed out tips from $20 to $200 to employees he encountered as a businessman. The housekeepers who cleaned Trump\u2019s villa at his Bedminster golf course in New Jersey noted that he kept stacks of $20, $50 and $100 bills on his nightstand for that purpose.\n\nIn 2016, Trump\u2019s former butler at his Mar-a-Lago resort told the New York Times that Trump would regularly take out a wad of cash from his pocket and give $100 bills to his groundskeepers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Hispanic and you\u2019re in here trimming the trees and everything, and a guy walks up and hands you a hundred dollars,\u201d said the butler, Anthony Senecal. \u201cAnd they love him, not for that, they just love him.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign, said Trump made sure to leave a tip behind at the hotels where he stayed in 2016.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was on the campaign he was always diligent about tipping housekeeping staff at hotels and it struck me how considerate that was,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nBut evidence of the president\u2019s miserliness also abounds.\n\nOver the years, several contractors have sued him for not paying them, a business strategy Trump proudly touted in his 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they\u2019ll take the shirt right off your back,\u201d Trump wrote in the book.\n\nTrump\u2019s longtime personal driver, Noel Cintron, filed a lawsuit against Trump\u2019s company last year alleging he was owed him more than $200,000 in unpaid overtime wages. Cintron said he worked for Trump for more than 20 years and received a raise only twice. He alleged in the lawsuit that he worked more than 3,000 overtime hours for which he was not paid. The Trump Organization denied any wrongdoing, saying last year that Cintron was paid generously for his services.\n\nTimothy O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer and executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion who is critical of the president, said Trump may have become more generous over time.\n\n\u201cAmong hotel workers in Atlantic City, back when he was running things down there, he was considered a cheap tipper,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard, anecdotally, that in his later years, at some of the hotels he operates in D.C. and New York, he\u2019s become a more generous tipper.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s critics say that even if he leaves tips to help individual workers, his broader policy agenda is harmful to those trying to make ends meet. For example, Trump opposes raising the federal minimum wage, and last year his Labor Department proposed a regulation to allow restaurant owners to pocket the tips of their workers.\n\nSeeking to boost public awareness of Trump\u2019s tipping practices, the Trump campaign blasted out a tweet Thursday highlighting news coverage of the president\u2019s comments.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama\u2019s tipping also garnered media interest. In 2013, Obama left a 52 percent tip while dining at an Upstate New York diner, according to the website TMZ, which obtained a copy of the receipt.\n\nTrump seemed to be in a good mood Wednesday aboard Air Force One as he talked to reporters about his tipping. He was enamored by the photo that captured the $20 bills peeking out of his back pocket as the wind whipped up his suit jacket.\n\n\u201cI do! I do!\u201d Trump said when asked if he regularly carries cash. He took a wad of bills out of his pocket showed it to reporters.\n\n\u201cBoy, that\u2019s a good picture,\u201d he said. \u201cHey, I\u2019d like a piece of that picture.\u201d\n\nDavid A.
