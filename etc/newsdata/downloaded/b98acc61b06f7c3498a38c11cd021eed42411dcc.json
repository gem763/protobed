From what I\u2019ve been told it was a 10 year old 3 on 3 tournament where a player slashed a ref. My source tells me the ref responded in a physical way (some are saying self defence) & this happened.

Actions like this have no place in our game.\"\n\nIt also said the tournament is an opportunity for players to enjoy the game of hockey with their friends.\n\n\"For that reason, we are especially disappointed to see an act like this occur.\"\n\nLethbridge is approximately 200 kilometres southeast of Calgary.", "description": "An assault charge has been laid against one man and is pending against a second person after an attack on a referee and a coach at a youth hockey tournament in Lethbridge, Alta.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5276278.1568049069!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lethbridge-hockey-fight.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
