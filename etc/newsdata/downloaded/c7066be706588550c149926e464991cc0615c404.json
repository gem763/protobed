Liverpool lacked that mentality yesterday. They did not turn up at Old Trafford looking like a team that had won their last 17 Premier League games. They didn\u2019t swagger in there like champions in waiting.\"", "description": "The usual Liverpool front three were a man down on Sunday as Divock Origi replaced the Egyptian in the starting XI", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664748.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
