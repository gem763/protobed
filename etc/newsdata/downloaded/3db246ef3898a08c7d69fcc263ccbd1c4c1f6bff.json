She handed it over.\n\nIn one of the messages, sent just 16 minutes before the woman met with the officers at the hospital, she called the encounter \u201cborderline rape,\u201d KCTV reported, and said she had \u201cthe bruises and statements to prove it.\u201d In other texts sent to a friend in the hours after the 30-year-old woman woke up \u2014 still drunk, naked and confused in the Lawrence, Kan., apartment of her then-boyfriend\u2019s best friend \u2014 she expressed regret and made jokes about what had happened.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gross \u2026 he\u2019s actually really good at sex though,\u201d she texted. A short while later, she texted the same friend: \u201cGet here fast. I\u2019m literally about to have a breakdown.\u201d She told police she\u2019d sent those messages to \u201cdownplay\u201d what had happened, and couldn\u2019t remember typing some of the messages sent right after the alleged attack. Her friend told police the woman\u2019s reactions made her believe she had been raped, KCTV reported.\n\nThose texts later became the heart of a police investigation into the woman and a criminal charge filed in January for allegedly making a false report of rape.\n\nAfter more than a month of criticism from sexual assault advocates, though, the Douglas County District Attorney\u2019s Office on Monday dropped three felony charges for interfering with an officer by falsely reporting a felony crime. The county\u2019s top prosecutors says he still believes in the \u201cmerits of this case\u201d in a statement obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut attorneys for the woman, whom The Post is not naming as an alleged victim of sexual assault, say there\u2019s overwhelming evidence she was indeed assaulted.\n\n\u201cOur client did not \u2018fabricate\u2019 the bruises on her arms, on her legs, and on her neck,\u201d her attorneys told the Kansas City Star in a statement last month. \u201cOur client did not \u2018fabricate\u2019 the results of her examination, which revealed her additional, sensitive injuries.\u201d\n\nIn September 2018, the woman told police in Lawrence she couldn\u2019t remember exactly what had happened two nights before, when she\u2019d been very intoxicated. She recounted falling in and out of consciousness as her boyfriend\u2019s friend allegedly led her back to his apartment, the Star reported. She didn\u2019t remember how she had arrived at the apartment, but she did remember asking to leave. She told officers she woke up while the friend was having sex with her, remembering how the man held her down even as she told him \u201cno.\u201d After waking up a second time during the attack, she said she pushed him off, but blacked out again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter telling three officers her story, she walked into the hospital where nurses took swabs for a rape kit and documented bruises on her neck, arms and legs. Hospital staff documented vaginal injuries, court records said.\n\nWhile the woman endured the invasive exam, officers with the Lawrence Police Department chatted about her story. Within 90 minutes of first speaking to the alleged rape victim, and before interviewing the accused man or the witnesses who had seen him leave with the visibly intoxicated woman, the officers decided she had lied.\n\n\u201cWe discussed it and none of us believed this was a legitimate claim of rape,\u201d one of the officers testified, KCTV reported. The TV station also reported that none of the officers who interviewed the alleged rape victim regularly worked sex crimes, and the only one with any trauma-related training had just one week of instruction on taking reports from abused children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLawrence police and the Douglas County District Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately return requests for comment late Monday.\n\nThe Kansas officers\u2019 quick judgment set in motion a cascade of controversial law enforcement actions. Police asked the woman to recount her story two more times and then launched an investigation into the 30-year-old graduate student, rather than her alleged rapist. Officers interviewed the accused man, who has not been named in local media reports or police statements because he was never charged. They also collected text messages sent between the man and his friends, which the woman\u2019s lawyers pointed to as proof that she did not lie.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got on the road and she was so f---ed up I was like hell Na,\u201d the man accused of sexual assault texted a friend the night of the alleged attack.\n\n\u201cShe looked f---ed up yo,\u201d one of his friends responded in a text, KCTV reported. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even look tipsy.\u201d\n\nDespite those messages and the woman\u2019s story of being attacked, police decided to arrest her in January. Police told the student someone had sent them an anonymous note about the rape, but officers couldn\u2019t decipher what it said. They asked her to come into the police department to help them read it.\n\nWhen she arrived, police handcuffed her and told her she was being arrested for filing a false report, the Star reported. She asked what the arresting officers wanted her to say, and one told her he wanted to hear the truth.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis happened,\u201d she said to an officer, the Star reported.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors indicted the woman on three felony charges for filing a false report. Douglas County District Attorney Charles Branson said he suspected the woman had sought out consensual sex to punish her boyfriend, and then reported the rape out of regret. Branson refused to test the woman\u2019s rape kit, against pressure from the woman\u2019s defense attorneys, and dismissed the injuries she suffered.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care if the thing is tested,\u201d Branson told the Star last month. \u201cThose artifacts, bruising and hemorrhaging, can be there with normal consensual intercourse. So the fact that there\u2019s that evidence there doesn\u2019t do anything to determine the manner in which the intercourse occurred, whether it is consensual or non-consensual.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter local media heavily scrutinized the case, Branson filed a motion this month to place a gag order on the defense lawyers and defendant. It was the first gag order his office had requested in three years, KCTV reported.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Branson withdrew the criminal charges.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe in the merits of this case and are confident the facts would be borne out at trial, the cost to our community and the negative impact on survivors of sexual violence cannot be ignored,\u201d Branson said in a statement. \u201cWe are concerned this case, and the significant amount of misinformation surrounding it, could discourage other survivors from reporting their attack.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what information in media reports the district attorney disputes. Most reports relied heavily on the probable cause affidavit and other materials produced by Branson\u2019s office because of the gag order.\n\nThe woman\u2019s lawyers said Monday that the facts of the case did not support prosecution, and the charges should never have been filed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that our client can finally put this nightmare behind her,\u201d attorneys Cheryl Pilate and Branden Bell said in a statement shared with The Post late Monday night. \u201cInstead of blaming the media for spreading \u2018misinformation,\u2019 the DA should take a long, hard look at its own practices, admit that it got it wrong and give our client the apology she deserves.\u201d", "description": "A 30-year-old graduate student told police she had been raped by a classmate.
