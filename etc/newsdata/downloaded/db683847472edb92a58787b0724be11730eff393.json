He doesn\u2019t spend most of his days sitting in on other people\u2019s phone calls,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd State formally approves Javelin sale: The State Department formally approved a potential $39.2 million sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles and related equipment to Ukraine, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced Thursday.\n\nNews of the approval broke earlier this week, but Thursday\u2019s announcement represented the formal notification to Congress of the approval.\n\nThe sale, which is now subject to a 30-day congressional review period, would include 150 Raytheon-made Javelin missiles and 10 launchers, as well as related equipment and support.\n\nThe United States first sold Ukraine 210 Javelin missiles and 37 launchers in 2018.\n\nPENTAGON CONFIRMS NORTH KOREAN TEST WAS BALLISTIC MISSILE: The most recent North Korean missile test was a short- to medium-range ballistic missile \u201cfired from a sea-based platform,\u201d a top Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder told reporters that North Korea launched the missile from its southern Wonsan Bay, and the missile flew about 280 miles into the Sea of Japan, also called the East Sea.\n\nThe test: North Korea announced earlier Thursday that it had successfully tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile a day prior, according to its state media outlet KCNA.\n\nRyder said the Pentagon has \u201cno indication that it was launched from a submarine, but rather, a sea-based platform.\u201d\n\n\u2018Unnecessarily provocative\u2019: Top Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said later in the briefing that Defense Secretary Mark Esper spoke with his Japanese counterpart in a call earlier Thursday.\n\nThe two agreed that tests are \u201cunnecessarily provocative and not helpful in an effort to get the North Koreans back on a diplomatic path,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\nThe test came a day after the State Department announced that Washington and Pyongyang would hold talks on curtailing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program following a months-long stalemate and multiple missile tests.\n\nMORE THAN 20 SOLDIERS INJURED DURING PARACHUTE TRAINING EXERCISE: More than 20 soldiers were injured, with some requiring hospitalization, after being blown off course during a parachute training exercise Wednesday night.\n\nThe incident occurred during a paratrooper training at Camp Shelby in Mississippi, Col. Bobby Ginn said during a press conference Thursday. He said 87 jumpers landed in trees next to the intended drop zone.\n\nThe injuries: Ginn said 23 paratroopers were sent to Forrest General Hospital for treatment, and four remained at the hospital Thursday afternoon.\n\nOne soldier had to undergo surgery for a broken back but is \u201cexpected to recover well,\" according to a Facebook post from the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment.\n\nAll of the paratroopers were accounted for on Thursday. The camp \u201chad a few jumpers remaining that were so high in the trees that they required significant recovery support,\u201d according to the Facebook post.\n\n\u201cAs I have said before, service as a paratrooper requires a level of toughness that most do not understand. Despite the difficulty of this training jump, the battalion performed well and will recover well to continue our training mission,\u201d Lt. Colonel Matt Meyer shared on the battalion\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe have systems and professionals who are trained and ready to address situations like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exercise included soldiers with the 4th Brigade Combat Infantry Division in Alaska, NBC News reported. It was part of a larger training exercise called \u201cArctic Anvil 2019,\u201d Ginn said.\n\nHe added that the incident is under investigation.\n\nICYMI\n\n-- The Hill: Coast Guard officer connected with mass killing plot pleads guilty\n\n-- The Hill: Top diplomat to Ukraine reportedly texted 'it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign'\n\n-- The Hill: House questions Volker as impeachment probe ramps up\n\n-- The Hill: Who is Kurt Volker and why is he important?\n\n-- The Hill: Pence defends Trump's calls for Ukraine to investigate Biden\n\n-- The Hill: Opinion: Only a serious response will reverse Iran's growing aggression\n\n-- The Hill: Opinion: Bring back the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency", "description": "Happy\u00a0Thursday and welcome to\u00a0Overnight Defense.\u00a0I'm Ellen Mitchell, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/espermark_080319getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
