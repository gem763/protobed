REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, who will form a minority government, failed to win a seat in either Alberta or Saskatchewan, the heart of the struggling oil industry. The party received just 13.7% of the vote in Alberta and 11.6% in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Liberals will govern after taking 33.1% of the national popular vote, less than the Conservatives, who won 34.4% nationally and swept all but one seat in the two provinces. The Conservatives, who enjoyed the open support of some in the oil industry, won 69.2% of votes in Alberta and 64.3% in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe national results leave Canada\u2019s energy sector, already hit by slumping capital investment and weak oil prices, worried about being ignored by decision-makers in the east.\n\n\u201cThere will be greater alienation and it\u2019ll be a challenge for Justin Trudeau,\u201d said Lori Williams, a political science professor at Calgary\u2019s Mount Royal University.\n\nThe term \u2018Wexit,\u2019 alluding to a western Canadian version of Brexit, was trending on Twitter after the vote on Monday night.\n\nIn his victory speech early on Tuesday, Trudeau appealed directly to Alberta and Saskatchewan, calling them \u201can essential part of our great country.\u201d\n\nBut the prime minister\u2019s need to rely on New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, who remains firmly opposed to a pipeline expansion to the Pacific coast and \u201cfossil fuel subsidies,\u201d may undermine the cause of the oil and gas industry.\n\nWhen teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg marched with thousands of protesters in Alberta last Friday, a truck convoy of oil and gas workers staged a smaller counter-rally.\n\nMistrust of the Trudeau name runs deep in the province after former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the current leader\u2019s father, tried to impose more federal control over the energy sector in the 1980s.\n\nRight-leaning leaders, federally and provincially, are on a war footing, taking up the western cause in hopes it will help them defeat Justin Trudeau in the next election. Minority governments rarely last more than 2-1/2 years in Canada.\n\n\u201cThere is a fire burning in the Prairie provinces,\u201d Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe told reporters on Tuesday. He said he wanted to meet Trudeau with a proposal to extinguish the fire, \u201cand I\u2019m asking him not to show up with a gas can.\u201d\n\nMoe challenged Trudeau to discuss restructuring equalization payments, which redistribute wealth among Canadian provinces, and sealing a \u201cnew deal\u201d with the two provinces to get pipelines built. Alberta and Saskatchewan do not receive any equalization payments because of their oil and gas wealth.\n\nAlberta Premier Jason Kenney said on Twitter he spoke to Trudeau on Tuesday morning and underscored that the \u201cdeep frustration expressed by Albertans is very real.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the frustration and alienation in Alberta continues, it will pose a very serious challenge to national unity,\u201d Kenney told reporters later.\n\n\u2018HATRED OF THE WEST\u2019\n\nThe sense of western alienation is most acute in Alberta, where the provincial economy has been struggling since the 2014/15 global oil price crash and unemployment is higher than the national average.\n\nBusiness has slowed and costs for equipment have doubled over the past four years at the John Deere dealer in Bassano, Alberta, a small town southeast of Calgary, said employee Gary Lee, 64, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed that so many people voted with their hatred of the West,\u201d Lee said. A minority Liberal government aggravates the sense of isolation already felt in rural Alberta, he said.\n\nEnergy sector growth is being stifled by long delays in building new oil export pipelines like the government-owned Trans Mountain expansion project, which the Trudeau government bought last year for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion), and TC Energy Corp\u2019s Keystone XL.\n\nConservative leader Andrew Scheer on Tuesday blamed Trudeau for making the country \u201cmore divided than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau has attacked our energy sector, has ignored the concerns of Alberta and Saskatchewan,\u201d he said.\n\nLevels of satisfaction in Alberta and Saskatchewan with the direction of the country and of the federal government are \u201coff-the-chart bad,\u201d said Frank Graves, president of polling company EKOS Research.\n\n\u201cSaskatchewan and Alberta are really the two most angry (provinces),\u201d Graves said. \u201cThis is visceral discontent with the country they\u2019re living in right now.\u201d\n\n($1 = 1.3089 Canadian dollars)", "description": "Canada's federal election on Monday left the country's western oil patch without any representation in Ottawa, furthering a sense of alienation in a region already deeply frustrated with the government's energy and pipeline policies.", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444590124&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0MS", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
