They beat an ideal. They beat a legend. Perhaps even a myth. They beat a halo. They beat a dream. They beat an idea. They beat the most powerful mind-game in sport.\n\nThey beat gods. They beat a haka. They beat beauty. They beat a meticulously manicured accumulation of invincibility. And when they had vanquished all that, they beat a team, too.\n\nThey beat Jonah Lomu trampling on Mike Catt and turning him into roadkill at Newlands in 1995. Not because they erased the memory of it but because they gave English rugby glorious memories of its own to cherish for ever more.\n\nEngland's Mark Wilson celebrates at the full-time whistle with crestfallen All Blacks around him\n\nEngland's players stood in an unusual V-formation to face New Zealand's pre-match haka\n\nThey beat a record that told us New Zealand had conquered England in 15 of their last 16 meetings. They beat a statistic that told us New Zealand had not lost a World Cup match for 4,403 days.\n\nThey beat the most dominant team in the wide world of sport. They beat New Zealand. But they beat the All Blacks, too. No one else's nickname is used to intimidate an opponent in world rugby but New Zealand's is.\n\nWe have all allowed ourselves to fall in thrall to it. It lionises them. It sets them apart. It needed an Australian iconoclast, Eddie Jones, to dismantle it and dance on what was left of it.\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones was on the losing side as Australia coach in the 2003 RWC final\n\nMaybe this is what it will feel like when a new kid finally demolishes Roger Federer. There were certainly similarities to the 7-1 humiliation that Brazil suffered at the hands of Germany in Belo Horizonte three years ago.\n\nA little bit of the Beautiful Game died that day and England shattered something here in Japan, too, and rose out of the ruins with a shot at being the new kings of rugby.\n\nWhere does it stand in the pantheon of achievements in English team sport? Up there with the best. Up there with winning the men's football World Cup in 1966 and rugby World Cup in 2003. Up there with England's women winning Commonwealth Gold in netball for the first time last year.\n\nUp there with England's men winning the Cricket World Cup for the first time a few months ago, also against a valiant New Zealand side. Those teams were pathfinders. Because of the All Blacks' aura, these England players are too.\n\nEngland beat New Zealand in a dramatic Cricket World Cup Final at Lord's in July of this year\n\nWhen the destructive might of Typhoon Hagibis tore into Japan a fortnight ago, England moved out of its way. Faced with sport's equivalent last night, they faced it down.\n\nThat is why it felt as if England had won the World Cup last night. That is why even if they do win it next Saturday, what happened last night will still be hard to beat. Sometimes, a victory and the manner of it transcends the competition but the fact remains that last night will mean so much more if England lift the Webb Ellis Cup for only the second time in their history.\n\n'To be the man, you have to beat the man,' Maro Itoje had said last week and England did that. They beat the man. They beat the deity. But now there is one more step. One more match between them and immortality. The All Blacks are down but the final still lies ahead.\n\nEngland's Maro Itoje threw down the gauntlet before the match, and delivered magnificently\n\nOne thing is sure: England will go into that final against Wales or South Africa bursting with confidence. When the horn sounded to signify the 80 minutes were up and referee Nigel Owens signalled the end of the game, several England players stood with their hands on their heads as if they could not grasp the magnitude of what they had done.\n\nTheir 19-7 victory condemned New Zealand to their first World Cup defeat for 12 years but the scoreline did not tell even half the story.\n\nThe numbers involved during England's win against New Zealand on Saturday\n\nEngland did not just beat New Zealand. They demolished them. Their pack was so dominant, Itoje and Sam Underhill played so magnificently, that they made the All Blacks look ordinary.\n\nThey made New Zealand's ball-handling look ragged and shoddy. It was supposed to be a match-up between the best attack in the world and the best defence but in the end, it was no contest.\n\nWhat a night for Jones and what a night for the Rugby Football Union. They hired Jones for what happened here last night. They paid him the big bucks for that. They poured money into him and his regime for exactly this: for getting past the All Blacks, for debunking them and destroying them. For trying to make England the gold standard again, just as they were in the days of Martin Johnson and Jonny Wilkinson.\n\nJones has managed the arc of this team to perfection. His mantra since they arrived in Japan on September 8 is that they have to get better and better as the tournament goes on and that is exactly what they have done. This is not a team whose cycle will end here, either. This is a team who have plenty of youth on their side.\n\n'Give us another week, mate,' Jones said, when he was asked to assess where the evening stood in English rugby history. 'We're not historians. We don't know. But we know we can play better next week and we are going to have to play better next week.\n\n'We're ready for a good week. We have got the right focus. We wanted to be the best team in the world. We are not the best team in the world yet.'\n\nThe promise and class of the team was most evident in the performances of Itoje and Underhill, who dominated the lineout and were too quick for New Zealand at the breakdown.\n\nThey forced turnover after turnover and rattled the All Blacks out of their stride. Even when England gifted their opponents a second-half try, they were never truly threatened. England had two tries disallowed. Even though the decisions were harsh, England merely shrugged them aside.\n\n'Time to Prune the Roses,' the headline on the front page of the New Zealand Herald had said yesterday. It spoke of a confident expectation of victory. It spoke of an assumption of superiority. Well, I'm sorry, mate, but not last night.\n\nEngland seemed to disconcert their opponents when they lined up in a 'V' shape at the haka\n\nEven before the match started, when England's players stood around the haka in a 'V' shape, as if they were trying to surround it, they seemed to disconcert their opponents.\n\nIt was a night where the intensity never seemed to drop. A night when England's players stepped up together. A night when Itoje played like Superman, when Underhill thudded into Brodie Retallick with one of the tackles of the tournament, when George Ford showed nerves of steel, when Beauden Barrett ran with feet of clay.\n\nIt all felt a little bit like magic. Not the kind of magic you get when tourists climb on the Disney Resort Line outside the England team hotel wearing giant Mickey Mouse ears.\n\nThere was nothing Mickey Mouse about this. This was the real deal. This was as magical as it gets in English sport. The kind of magic that will last for lifetimes.", "description": "OLIVER HOLT - MAIL ON SUNDAY CHIEF SPORTS WRITER IN YOKOHAMA: England\u00a0beat an aura. An ideal. They beat a legend.
