He knew it was a gift to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd Ritter continued pursuing comedy even after \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d came to an end in 1984. He also starred in films such as 1990\u2019s \u201cProblem Child\u201d and 2003\u2019s \u201cBad Santa,\u201d among others. In addition, he starred in the sitcom \u201c8 Simple Rules\u201d from 2002 right up until his passing.\n\nAnd Ritter happily delivered the laughs in his home, too.\n\n'THREE'S COMPANY' ACTOR PETER MARK RICHMAN REVEALS WHAT IT WAS LIKE WORKING WITH SUZANNE SOMERS, SOPHIA LOREN\n\nBOB CRANE\u2019S SON SLAMS \u2018HOGAN\u2019S HEROES\u2019 REBOOT IN THE WORKS: \u2018LEAVE IT ALONE\u2019\n\n\u201cHe had a real dedication to making his children laugh,\u201d said Jason. \u201cIt became hard when I was a teenager and I\u2019d be mad at him, and he could just make me laugh and forget about it\u2026 He was such a loving dad. He came to all my plays in high school.\u201d\n\nJason also told the outlet that, as an actor, he hopes to carry on his father\u2019s teaching in his own work.\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m making my dad proud \u2014 I\u2019m just trying not to embarrass him,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to live as honestly and simply as possible. That\u2019s what he would\u2019ve wanted. Of course, I wish things could have been different.\u201d\n\nBack in 2017, Ritter\u2019s \u201cThree Company\u201d co-star Suzanne Somers told Fox News she vividly remembered the last time she ever spoke to the star.\n\nGEORGE MICHAEL\u2019S WHAM! BANDMATE ANDREW RIDGELEY SAYS SINGER\u2019S DEATH \u2018HIT ME LIKE A PUNCH TO THE GUT\u2019\n\n'SAVED BY THE BELL' STAR TIFFANI THIESSEN EXPLAINS WHY SHE\u2019S NOT RETURNING FOR REBOOT\n\nSomers was shocked when Ritter unexpectedly reached out to her a month before his sudden death. Since she was famously fired by ABC in 1982 after she asked for a pay hike, Somers never heard from any of her co-stars, including Ritter.\n\nShe reflected on that moment, as well as the many lessons she learned in Hollywood, in a new memoir, titled \u201cTwo\u2019s Company.\u201d She described getting a surprise phone call from Ritter while getting her hair done at a beauty parlor.\n\n\u201cI go to the phone. I said, \u2018John?\u2019\u201d Somers told Fox News. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey babe,\u2019 and I knew his voice right away. And then he said, \u2018I forgive you.\u2019 I had a moment of, \u2018Uh, you forgive me?\u2019 And then I thought, \u2018Be the grownup.\u2019 And so I said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019\n\n\"And he said, \u2018I\u2019m doing a show called \u2018Eight Simple Rules\u2019 and there\u2019s a dream sequence and I want to have a nightmare, and in my nightmare, you... are in the dream.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d love to work with you again, but\u2026 This isn\u2019t the way I want to come back, a nightmare. Really?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018DALLAS\u2019 STAR PATRICK DUFFY CREDITS \u2018MAN FROM ATLANTIS\u2019 FOR HELPING HIM NAB ROLE OF BOBBY EWING\n\nZACHARY QUINTO ON THE LOCH NESS MONSTER MYSTERY, LEONARD NIMOY FRIENDSHIP\n\nTheir brief conversation would spark a possible collaboration that never came to be.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we find an actual project?\u2019\u201d said Somers. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t we do something together?\u2019 He said, \u2018All right. That\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll look.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll look.\u2019 And a month later, he died. So there was resolution, which feels good. We probably would\u2019ve found a project, which would\u2019ve worked. I always thought Jack Tripper should\u2019ve married Chrissy Snow anyway and that should be the spin-off. I\u2019m glad I had that resolution with him. Really glad.\u201d", "description": "John Ritter\u2019s son has been reminiscing about his late father.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-83550061.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
