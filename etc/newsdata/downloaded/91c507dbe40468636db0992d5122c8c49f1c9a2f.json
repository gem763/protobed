Many will buy on the basis that cheapest is best.\n\nHorse sense: Make sure activities such as pony trekking are not excluded from policies\n\nLike most insurance, travel cover is fraught with pitfalls. High excesses are commonplace \u2013 the first part of any claim that must be met. Pastimes as harmless-sounding as pony trekking may not be covered if you have an accident.\n\nOther potential issues include upper-age limits on cover and restrictions for those who suffer with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart conditions, diabetes and cancer.\n\nUNDERSTAND THE COVER\n\nIt is vital to know exactly what you will be covered for before you buy and set off on your travels.\n\nHannah Maundrell, editor of comparison website money.co.uk, says: \u2018Lots of people book holidays this month. Yet most do not bother with travel insurance or they buy it in a hurry. It is not just what might happen on holiday, but your airline could go bust before you travel or you could fall ill and have to cancel. It makes sense to protect your trip from the day you book.\u2019\n\nMaundrell says it is essential to read the terms and conditions of any travel cover before purchasing it, particularly key issues such as compensation for flight delays or needing to cancel a holiday.\n\n'When terror struck, we wanted to come home' History student Oliver Newman, 19, from Chester, and his girlfriend Aukse Baranauskaite, 23, were glad they had travel insurance when they were caught up in last month\u2019s terrorist attack in Berlin. Oliver and Aukse, both studying at Manchester Metropolitan University, were just two days into a week-long break when on December 19, a terrorist drove a lorry into a crowded Christmas market \u2013 killing 12 and injuring more than 50 people. Attack: Aukse and Oliver were in Berlin when a terrorist struck the Christmas market killing 12 Oliver says: \u2018We had just returned from the Christmas markets to our hotel when I noticed eight missed calls on my phone. It was my parents who told me what had just happened. It was a really strange time and people were in shock. It was eerily quiet and we just stayed in our hotel.\u2019 The couple decided they wanted to return home immediately so they rebooked their flights to Manchester the next morning. This cost them \u00a3150. Although their travel policy with Marks and Spencer Money did not cover the cost of the rebooking, the insurer agreed to meet the cost as a gesture of goodwill. Oliver says: \u2018I am glad we had the insurance. The policy cost \u00a320 for the six-day break.\u2019 Cover in the event of a terrorist attack remains a grey area. Standard travel policies will usually not meet claims relating to or resulting from acts of terrorism. But as Oliver found, an insurer might help as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nAGE AND MEDICAL EMERGENCIES\n\nIt is essential that a policy covers the cost of medical emergencies. Claims can easily stretch to tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds, particularly if you have to stay in hospital.\n\nThe European Health Insurance Card, which is free and available online, is useful for travel in Europe.\n\nIt allows you to get emergency medical treatment on the same terms and cost as residents. But this does not always mean treatment will be free and it only applies to procedures carried out at state-run hospitals. The card should be acquired alongside a comprehensive travel insurance policy.\n\nOlder travellers and those with medical conditions need to ensure any cover purchased is watertight.\n\nKevin Pratt, consumer affairs editor at comparison website MoneySupermarket, says: \u2018There are no hard and fast rules on the maximum age that an insurer will take on board a customer. It depends on the provider but some start to take a closer interest once someone passes the age of 50. When it comes to medical conditions, it is important to disclose everything and expect to pay more depending on the condition.\u2019\n\nSome packaged bank accounts offer travel insurance as a \u2018free perk\u2019 but check the cover is suitable before relying on it.\n\nFor example, the maximum age on travel insurance via NatWest\u2019s Reward Silver account is 70.\n\nWHAT IT COSTS\n\nA couple, both aged 55, can purchase an annual multi-trip policy for worldwide travel, excluding the US, for around \u00a333. This is available from website annualtravelinsurance.\n\nThe policy offers \u00a320million of medical cover, with a \u00a3250 excess. It also covers lost or stolen baggage up to a value of \u00a31,000 and up to \u00a31,000 for cancellations, both with a \u00a3195 excess.\n\nMost policies allow you to adjust the excess you pay. The higher the excess, the lower the premium.\n\nA couple of the same age, but both taking medication for high blood pressure, should expect to pay at least \u00a350 for a similar policy.
