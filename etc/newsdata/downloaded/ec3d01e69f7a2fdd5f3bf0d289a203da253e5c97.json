That compared with a 2% decline in August.\n\nChina\u2019s vast industrial sector has come under pressure amid trade tensions and tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States. Profits have slowed visibly since the second half of last year, though the sector has seen some transitory rebounds as Beijing steps up support measures.\n\nThe decline in profits contrasted with the slight improvement in the manufacturing sector in September, with factory surveys and better-than-expected industrial production growth pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand.\n\nBut factory gate prices, considered a key barometer of corporate profitability, fell at the steepest clip in more than three years as economic growth ground to a fresh near 30-year low in the third quarter.\n\nFor January-September, industrial firms earned profits of 4.59 trillion yuan, down 2.1% year-on-year, and worse than the 1.7% reading in the first eight months.\n\nThe drop was mainly due to factors such as a decline in the ex-factory price of industrial products and slowdown in sales growth, said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician with the NBS.\n\nProfits for state-owned firms slipped 9.6 percent in the first three quarters of the year.\n\nThe most impacted sector was the oil, coal and other fuel processing industries, where profits fell 53.5 percent in the January-September period.\n\nProfits for the non-ferrous, electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing and alcoholic beverages sectors all bucked the trend though, recording rising profits.\n\nU.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal for their presidents to sign next month, as the world\u2019s two biggest economies try to end a more than a year-long trade war that has disrupted global trade.\n\nChina\u2019s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2% this year and cool further to 5.9% in 2020, a Reuters poll showed, underlining the challenges faced by Beijing even as it steps up stimulus amid a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\nIndustrial firms\u2019 liabilities increased 5.4% from a year earlier to 66.49 trillion yuan at end-September, compared with a 5.0% increase in August.\n\nPrivate sector profits rose 5.4% in January-September, slowing from 6.5% growth in the first eight months.\n\nThe data covers companies with more than 20 million yuan in annual revenue from their main operations.\n\n($1 = 7.0647 Chinese yuan renminbi)", "description": "Profits at China's industrial firms contracted for the second straight month in September as producer prices continued their slide, highlighting the toll a slowing economy and protracted U.S. trade war are having taken on corporate balance sheets.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445366748&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q02U", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
