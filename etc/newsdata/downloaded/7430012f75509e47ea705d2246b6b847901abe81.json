Notably, this July the BMI hit a level it had only seen a handful of times over the past ten years, Lee said.\n\nRather than consolidating gains, Bitcoin saw a stark drop in price after the BlockTV interview, plunging below $7,800 and eventually settling around $7,400. As of press time, the coin is trading around $7,380 \u2014 down over 7% on its 24-hour chart,\n\nReading the Misery Index\n\nAs previously reported, Lee has in the past interpreted high BMI optimism levels as something of a mixed-signal.\n\nThis April, his reading had emphasized that while positive sentiment was always necessarily a part of the run-up to a bull market, the main \u2014 and arguably more-modest takeaway \u2014 was that Bitcoin had truly bottomed at $3,000 in crypto winter.\n\nBack when the index was launched in March 2018, Lee had outlined that in most instances, when the indicator is low, buying opportunity is at its best, and vice versa.", "description": "Having made a big move at the start of 2019, Bitcoin price now needs to consolidate its gains, argues Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYWIxMDEzYjY4NWIxMzQyM2E3MDVkNmQ1Y2NjMTQzYTYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
