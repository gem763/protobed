Ukraine has had no such luck.\n\nWhen the story of a whistle-blower in the U.S. first broke, it received little attention in Ukraine. Though the country looks to the U.S. for support, the political workings of Washington are a far-away mystery to most Ukrainians. Even the trial of the Trump-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who long operated in Ukraine working for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, received comparatively little coverage because of the large number of high-level officials from the Yanukovych government who have fled to Russia to avoid justice. But that view of the scandal over the Trump-Zelensky phone call changed after the announcement of an impeachment investigation.\n\nRead: Paul Manafort, American hustler\n\nNow Ukraine looks as if it will be at the center of the 2020 presidential election, and this will not be an issue Zelensky can just walk away from, despite his best efforts so far. Throughout their conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to investigate \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine, a problem he had previously shown little interest in, and an apparent euphemism for investigating Biden\u2019s son.\n\nThe situation creates a difficult balancing act for Ukraine, with Trump pushing for an investigation of the younger Biden, and Democrats likely to request cooperation over the July phone call, which now forms the basis of their impeachment investigation. Even if Zelensky\u2019s team wants to do something to appease Trump, it cannot risk alienating Democrats in case they win the presidential election. Seeming to favor either side risks turning Ukraine into a partisan issue in which it is seen to be an ally of one side or the other.", "description": "Foreign policy in the United States was historically seen as having a bipartisan consensus on many of the most significant issues.", "authors": ["Ian Bateson", "Tom Mctague"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74FLM-1/facebook.jpg?1569537682", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
