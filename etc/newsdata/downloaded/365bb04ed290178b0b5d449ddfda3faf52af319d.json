The province has suffered daily airstrikes since the end of April as the regime of President Basha al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, attempts to retake the province and reassert control over the entire country after eight years of conflict.\n\nThe province is home to about three million people, half of whom have been displaced from elsewhere in Syria. Aircraft have regularly fired missiles and dropped barrel bombs on the province, targeting civilian areas including hospitals and schools, according to the nonprofit Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations\n\nSome civilians took advantage of the rare lull in violence, worried that the cease-fire would soon collapse.\n\n\u201cWe came to the town because there is no way we can come here when the airstrikes are happening,\u201d said Obeida Omar, a local resident who went back to his house in a town close to the front lines to pick up some of his children\u2019s clothes. He has been living with his family of four in nearby groves to escape the airstrikes.\n\nAirstrikes on Idlib have killed scores of people during the conflict, including many children, and forced some half a million people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. Many of those fleeing their homes have moved into ramshackle tent encampments or in olive groves and orchards near the Turkish border, which for years has been closed to refugees trying to escape the conflict.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s emergency relief coordinator, Mark Lowcock, has called on the Security Council to take meaningful action to protect civilians in Idlib.\n\n\u201cThose who stay behind are cowering in basements or in what\u2019s left of their homes,\u201d Mr. Lowcock said in a briefing to the Security Council.\n\nThe Assad government and its Russian allies have launched almost daily airstrikes since the end of April in the area, despite an agreement last September between Moscow and Ankara to maintain a cease-fire in the area.\n\nRussia says its strikes are in response to militants violating the agreement and using the area to launch attacks at a Russian base and government-held areas.\n\nTurkey and Russia met last week to discuss Idlib, but details of the negotiations, as well as the future of the area, remain unknown. Ankara fears an all-out Syrian government offensive in Idlib would push hundreds of thousands of Syrians to seek refuge in Turkey. On Friday, hundreds of Syrians tried to storm the Turkish border as they attempted to flee the conflict.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. on Saturday said it targeted al Qaeda leaders in northern Idlib who were responsible for attacks threatening its citizens and allies.\n\nMore than 50 militants were killed after U.S. airstrikes hit their base, The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U. K-based monitoring group, said. The Russian military accused the U.S. of jeopardizing the cease-fire by failing to inform Moscow and Damascus of its intention to carry out the airstrike.", "description": "A fragile cease fire in northwest Syria held, months after the United Nations warned a humanitarian crisis was developing in the last rebel stronghold fighting against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.", "authors": ["Nazih Osseiran"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103179/social"}
