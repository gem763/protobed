Xhaka took off his shirt and headed straight down the tunnel.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wrong but we are going to speak inside about that situation,\u201d Emery told the BBC. \u201cI want to be calm but, really, he was wrong in this action.\u201d\n\nIt had started so well, with goals in the opening nine minutes.\n\nArsenal defensive duo Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz scored inside 106 seconds.\n\nBut it started to go wrong in the 32nd minute when Luka Milivojevic netted a penalty that was awarded after a VAR review. Palace winger Wilfried Zaha had initially been booked for diving.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand the referee and VAR reaction,\u201d Emery said. \u201cFor me there is no confusion. It is not a good decision.\u201d\n\nJordan Ayew\u2019s fourth goal in eight games brought Palace level before further VAR drama as Sokratis was denied a late winner when the review spotted a foul by Calum Chambers moments earlier.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka appeared to swear at his team's own supporters after being substituted on Sunday when a two-goal lead was surrendered against Crystal Palace to draw 2-2 in the Premier League.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/britain_soccer_premier_league_36316_c0-137-4723-2892_s1200x700.jpg?c9ebc11e19125cbd0f44ecf2fefb94bddaba7cf2", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
