I really do think that.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see a way in for him at the moment. It\u2019s a lot of money to spend and it would be interesting to ask Frank now if he would sign him at this moment in time if he hadn\u2019t signed him before?\n\n\"I can't see a way in for him\"@chris_sutton73 says Frank Lampard would not have signed Christian Pulisic given the choice. Do you agree?

I think that\u2019s been good so far, so I just want to continue to work hard.\n\n\u2018I want to be starting. I want to be starting every game. I\u2019m working hard in training. I want to be there. I hope everyone can see that, I hope I can make a case for myself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not just going to throw a fit and give up ever, so if I\u2019m on the bench it doesn\u2019t mean the gaffer doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a part of the team, I\u2019ve just got to keep pushing and earn my spot.\n\n\u2018I did the best I could with the minutes I got. I tried to help the team. I guess I\u2019m happy but I\u2019m going to keep working harder, and I\u2019m never going to stop trying to get more minutes.\u2019\n\nLampard, meanwhile, assured Pulisic that he would be an important member of Chelsea\u2019s team after the emphatic victory over Southampton.\n\nThe Blues boss said: \u2018Christian coming on with a great assist for the goal. Those players, absolutely we need them as the games come thick and fast.\n\n\u2018At the moment we are going well and keeping a similar core of the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But we are going to need everyone and that means training at a level and being happy as a complete group when we come away and get a result like this.\u2019\n\nMORE: Virgil van Dijk confident Mohamed Salah will return from injury to face Manchester United", "description": "Christian Pulisic would not have been signed by Chelsea had Frank Lampard been manger at the time, according to Chris Sutton, who says the USA international faces a 'major problem'...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179383372_1570540737.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
