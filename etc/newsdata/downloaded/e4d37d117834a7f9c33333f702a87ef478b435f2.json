This is the bit where democracies are so evolved and self-assured they sell their freedom of speech to totalitarian regimes. I know! But kind of logical, when you think about it. There was basically nothing left to flog.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve missed the saga of the NBA\u2019s travails in China, have no fear. It isn\u2019t going away any time soon, with last weekend\u2019s development being groups of fans wearing masks and \u201cStand With Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts standing in protest at the Brooklyn Nets pre-season finale at the Barclays Center, in a show of support unlikely to be looked on fondly by the People\u2019s Republic. Tuesday night\u2019s opening NBA games were duly blacked out by China\u2019s state broadcaster.\n\nChinese state TV blacks out NBA season opener after threat of 'retribution' Read more\n\nFirst, though, a recap of the story: earlier this month, the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. In fairly short order, the Rockets stated that his views did not reflect those of the team, while the NBA informed the world it was \u201cregrettable\u201d Morey\u2019s tweet had caused offence. You know you\u2019re in dangerous territory when you\u2019re reduced to nodding along with Ted Cruz, but the Texas senator declared: \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale and the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.\u201d Suggesting there may yet be one bipartisan issue left in the US, the Democratic hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke was soon voicing similar sentiments. Alas, none of these were really what the Chinese government wanted to hear, leading to the state threatening to cut ties with the NBA. Some Chinese companies have pulled sponsorship.\n\nSlightly changing tack, the NBA mounted a grimly mealy-mouthed defence of Morey, with the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, explaining: \u201cI understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d Over to Chinese state television. \u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nLeBron James says Daryl Morey wasn't 'educated' before Hong Kong tweet Read more\n\nAs for who should give a toss what they believe, unless you\u2019re Chinese and have no choice \u2026 enter LeBron James. Given what a powerful voice the Lakers star has been for civil rights in the US, there was a certain amount of disappointment that he opted to say of Morey: \u201cI believe he wasn\u2019t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke. Just be careful what we tweet \u2026 even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d\n\nThough James walked back the statement almost in real time, given the reaction to it, it wasn\u2019t quick enough for rightwing pundits, who continue to jump on it, as well as the failure of other stars to speak out in support of the protesters. Yes, those who for so long lacerated sports stars for getting political are now demanding to know why they aren\u2019t. Athletes who have been told shut up and play are now told to speak out, and criticised if they don\u2019t. Suddenly, the last thing anyone seems to want them to do is \u201cstick to basketball\u201d.\n\nSilver himself has found slightly more of a backbone, revealing he resisted Chinese demands to fire Morey. China denies this version, and CCTV stated he will face \u201cretribution sooner or later\u201d for it. As for how this huge and deepening mess will play out for the NBA, it isn\u2019t clear, though it would be nice to think politicians and pundits may grasp that it\u2019s not actually up to LeBron James to sort out China.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hong Kong supporters distribute T-shirts outside the Staples Center before the Lakers v Clippers NBA season opener.

We saw glimpses of this in the Beijing Olympics, where promises to the IOC about freedom to protest were broken once the event was under way. But it apparently wasn\u2019t alarm-bell ringing enough for the IOC not to award Beijing with the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nWill it be enough for Fifa? Like the IOC, Fifa loves an authoritarian regime in which to locate their quadrennial mega-event \u2013 it makes things so much easier on a lot of levels \u2013 and the chatter that the 2030 World Cup may just end up going to China is getting louder with every month.\n\nUS senator Rick Scott says 2022 Winter Olympics should not be held in China Read more\n\nMeanwhile, the tale should also be cautionary for the Premier League and its bigger clubs, which have ever-increasing commercial and even physical presences in China. If athletes or management staff or even banner-toting fans should speak out visibly on this, or other current or future Chinese issues, it feels reasonable to assume some version of the NBA saga could take place.\n\nForms of self-censorship for commercial gain in China are already being \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d by other entertainment businesses. According to a recent Buzzfeed report, some showrunners on Apple\u2019s new original programming slate were instructed by Apple leadership to avoid negative portrayals of China. The video game company Blizzard suspended a player for voicing support for Hong Kong protesters.\n\nAll sorts of sports are may find their businesses getting sucked into this nasty business because, instead of staying the irrelevance they may prefer, the question is moving centre stage: what price market access?", "description": "Sticking to the principle of freedom of speech can be uncomfortable when commercial gain in China is at stake", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff254edc775e6c99e9e5aa48715bc159be3697f9/241_9_2247_1349/master/2247.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=78bce653052656ed321f5e09834db91e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
