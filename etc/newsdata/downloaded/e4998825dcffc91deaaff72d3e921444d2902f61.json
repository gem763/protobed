Japan's Nikkei stock index\n\nrose 0.04% and Australian shares advanced 0.29%.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell 0.16% in Asia on Friday,\n\nthough that followed a 0.80% increase in the S&P 500 on Wall\n\nStreet overnight on hopes that future Fed rate cuts will support\n\ncorporate profits. \"The bounce on Wall Street is not a definitive sign. It's\n\nactually pessimistic for stocks that two-year yields are falling\n\nthis much. It shows the bond market hasn't gotten on board with\n\nthis positive growth story,\" AMP's Oliver said.\n\nThat sentiment was underscored by a frail performance of\n\nworld stocks in recent weeks, hurt by political uncertainty in\n\nthe United Stated and Hong Kong, geopolitical tensions in the\n\nMiddle East, Brexit and a drumroll of weak global data.\n\nIn Asia, excluding Japan, equities were on course for the\n\nthird weekly decline, their worst performance since four weeks\n\nof declines ended Aug. 16.\n\nU.S. Treasury prices fell slightly but two-year yields\n\nremained near the lowest in two years due to growing signs the\n\nUnited States is feeling an economic chill from its trade war\n\nwith China.\n\nThe dollar traded near a one-month low versus the yen, while\n\nit was stuck near a one-week trough versus the euro as traders\n\nincreased bets that the Fed will have to cut rates further to\n\nkeep growth in the U.S. economy on track.\n\nData due later on Friday are forecast to show the U.S.\n\neconomy added 145,000 new jobs in September, more than an\n\nincrease of 130,000 in the previous month.\n\nHowever, some traders are braced for a disappointing result\n\nafter the surprisingly soft data earlier this week on U.S.\n\nmanufacturing, job creation, and the services sector.\n\nThe two-year yield , which tracks expectations for\n\nU.S. monetary policy, rose slightly to 1.3941% in Asia but was\n\nstill close to a two-year low of 1.3680%.\n\nTraders see a 85.2% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25\n\nbasis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday,\n\naccording to CME Group's FedWatch tool. FEDWATCH\n\nThe Fed has already cut rates twice this year as\n\npolicymakers try to limit the damage caused by the bruising\n\nSino-U.S. trade war.\n\nThe dollar edged lower to 106.85 yen JPY=EBS , close to a\n\none-month low of 106.48 yen reached on Thursday. The euro\n\nEUR=EBS was a shade higher at $1.0942, also near a one-week\n\nhigh.\n\nFor the week, the dollar was down 1.01% versus the yen and\n\noff 0.3% against the common currency.\n\nU.S. crude rose 0.11% to $52.51 a barrel. Oil futures\n\non Thursday touched the lowest in nearly two months as weak U.S.\n\neconomic data increased concerns that excess supplies will push\n\nprices lower.\n\nFor the week, U.S. crude futures were on course for a 6.1%\n\ndecline, which would be the worst performance since July 19.\n\nSpot gold , a safe-haven asset that investors often\n\nbuy during times of heightened risk, rose 0.17% to $1,507.20 per\n\nounce, on course for a 0.73% weekly gain.
