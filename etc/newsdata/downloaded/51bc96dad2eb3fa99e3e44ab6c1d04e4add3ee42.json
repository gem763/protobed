Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said it 'seemed inevitable' Cooper would be replaced given the downward trend.\n\nMould said: 'The cigarette maker, like many of its peers, has bet on smokeless products for the future of its business.\n\n'Unfortunately regulatory and political pressure has been so intense that the shift to next generation products has been problematic.'\n\nWhile the company says it is experiencing the 'biggest consumer shift in our history' as smokers look for alternatives to tobacco, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC, said the industry actually faced an 'existential crisis' after the US threatened to ban e-cigarettes. This is the area where the industry has been seeking growth.\n\nUnusually, Imperial is also looking for a chairman to replace Mark Williamson, a search which has been under way since February.\n\nHe said Cooper \u2013 who grew up in Kingston upon Thames and went to the local grammar, Tiffin Girls' School \u2013 had worked 'tirelessly' during her 20 years at the company.\n\nWilliamson pointed to the \u00a310billion in dividends paid out while she was boss.\n\nThe company has faced questions about its accounting policies and a spokesman said that it was looking at improving the 'transparency' of its financial disclosure. Shares rose 0.6 per cent, or 10p, to 1840p yesterday.", "description": "Alison Cooper, 53, has run the Gauloises and John Player Special maker Imperial Brands for nine years and will depart once a successor is found.
