Palacek in September reached an undisclosed settlement with Pozner, who testified he was subjected to repeated harassment by people who believed the shooting never happened, causing him to fear for his safety.\n\nFetzer said he will appeal the ruling, calling the award \u201cabsurd,\u201d according to CBS News.\n\n\"Mr. Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened,\" Pozner said in a statement. \"He has the right to express his ignorance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr. Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror,\u201d he added.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of several against figures who have denied the shooting, including Alex Jones and his Infowars website, who have been sued by parents of Sandy Hook victims after claiming the children were \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d", "description": "A jury in Wisconsin ruled that a retired college professor who co-authored a book titled \u201cNobody Died at Sandy Hook\u201d must pay $450,000 to the father of a child killed in the 2012 Newtown, Conn., mass shooting,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sandyhook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
