So Brown's NFL career is on pause and possibly could even be over.\"\n\nFox insider Jay Glazer wouldn't say Brown's career is over but did agree that, at the very least, he is going to be unemployed for a while.\n\n\"There were only a couple teams who showed interest in Antonio Brown before he signed with Pats, that list will probably be whittled down to zero for the foreseeable future,\" Glazer wrote.\n\nThe release came after the latest set of allegations in which a woman accused Brown of sending her intimidating text messages. That woman, an artist, was at the center of earlier allegations in which she accused Brown of sexual misconduct after he hired her to complete a mural in his home.\n\nMatt York/AP The NFL allowed Brown to play in the Patriots' Week 2 games against the Dolphins. However, there was some speculation that he would have been placed on the commissioner's exempt list and not have been permitted to play moving forward due to the latest allegations.\n\nAs Will Brinson of CBS Sports noted, the NFL's personal conduct policy specifically forbids \"stalking, harassment, or similar forms of intimidation.\"\n\nThe text messages attributed to Brown were considered by many to harassing and intimidating.\n\nBrown's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, released a statement saying Brown looks forward to joining another team.\n\n\"It's unfortunate things didn't work out with the Patriots,\" Rosenhaus wrote. \"But Antonio is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL. He wants to play the game he loves and he hopes to play for another team soon.\"", "description": "Antonio Brown was likely headed to a suspension or a spot on the commissioner's exempt list for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy.", "authors": ["Cork Gaines"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d853d272e22af6f551a271e-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
