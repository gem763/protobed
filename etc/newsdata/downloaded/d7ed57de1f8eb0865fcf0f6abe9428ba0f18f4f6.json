We have lost too much of our traditional manufacturing, we can't just stand by and let Alcoa and Portland sail into the night quietly, and we won't,\" he said.\n\n\"As an employer they are too big to fail for the region.''", "description": "Coal-fired generators have called for \"sufficient notice'' before an aluminium smelter is allowed to exit the National Electricity Market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2095%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_4%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ecb47d02be75b849fea36b9e00006676d64f959b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
