Clockwise \u2013 yeah that way.\u2019\n\nThe presenter replied: \u2018I know clockwise, darling.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the pastry slowly made its way through the roller, Henry \u2013 who told Paul Hollywood to \u2018shut up\u2019 in the episode after getting a Hollywood Handshake \u2013 prompted her to go \u2018a bit faster\u2019.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re quite bossy. Wouldn\u2019t be your girlfriend,\u2019 Sandi joked as the pair fell about laughing.\n\nAlthough the episode was filmed months ago, it comes amid speculation that Henry and Alice were in a relationship.\n\nThe rumours were first sparked when they were spotted leaving sweet comments on each other\u2019s Instagram photos.\n\nAlice then shared snaps of them spending time together away from the Channel 4 cameras.\n\nHowever it seems the claims, which originated in The Sun, aren\u2019t true.\n\nAfter reports about their rumoured romance were published, Alice took to Instagram to share a picture of her hanging out with Henry, Michael and David.\n\nShe captioned the image: \u2018But how many couples can you see\u2026?\u2019 along with a picture of a face palm emoji.\n\nIn addition to Alice\u2019s cryptic response, Digital Spy reports that they have learned the rumours that Henry and Alice are dating are categorically untrue.\n\nSorry to sink your festival buns, Bake Off fans, but it looks like #Halice won\u2019t be a thing any time soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFestival week saw the tent say an emotional goodbye to Michael, who was sent packing by the judges.\n\nThe Great British Bake Off airs Tuesdays at 8pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
