He is in a module that everyone in it is protective custody for varying reasons and never allowed to have contact with each other or anyone,' Lauri explained.\n\nShe also shared disturbing images of her son's injuries with the publication.\n\nThe upsetting, graphic photos show multiple stitches on Josh's face, and 20 staples in a major laceration in his chest.\n\nAccording to his mom, this is not the first time that Waring has been roughed up behind bars.\n\nTroubled: 'I am horrified, sad, brokenhearted, disgusted and appalled by my son\u2019s condition!'

'I do not believe any longer that these are simply mistakes.'\n\n'I believe that certain deputies are facilitating these incidents to cause harm, and even death, to my son due to his litigation against the county,' she continued.\n\nShe also alleged that Josh has even been in shot with 'several rounds of pepper-balls by a deputy into his cell while he was sleeping.'\n\n'A dead man can\u2019t talk,' Lauri exclaimed. 'A dead man can\u2019t litigate! Josh\u2019s life is in danger! This torture must stop!
