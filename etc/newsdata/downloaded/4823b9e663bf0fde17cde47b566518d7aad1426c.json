For the past year, D\u0103ncil\u0103's government has faced protests and international condemnation over concerns that the country is backsliding on rule of law and combatting corruption.\n\nALDE leader C\u0103lin Popescu T\u0103riceanu said his party was breaking ties with the PSD to form an alliance with Pro Romania and back Mircea Diaconu, an actor and former MEP, to become president in the upcoming November election.\n\nPro Romania largely consists of former PSD members who defected from the Social Democrats over disagreements with former leader Liviu Dragnea. The new party fared well in May\u2019s European Parliament election, securing spots for two MEPs, including outgoing European Regional Commissioner Corina Cre\u021bu, who also joined Pro Romania after leaving the PSD.\n\nNext steps\n\nT\u0103riceanu also said he would resign from his job of president of the Senate at the beginning of the next parliamentary session in September. The ALDE leader initially wanted to run for president as the ruling coalition's sole candidate, but the PSD instead decided to back Prime Minister D\u0103ncil\u0103 for the job.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Ramona M\u0103nescu, one of ALDE's four Cabinet members, said she would not resign despite the political consequences. T\u0103riceanu said he would exclude from the party anyone who does not follow his decision.\n\nAccording to the Romanian constitution, the prime minister must now call a confidence vote within 45 days.\n\nShould the opposition call for a confidence vote earlier, T\u0103riceanu said his party would do what any opposition party does and vote against the government. The National Liberal Party (PNL), an opposition group, said earlier Monday that it would put forward such a motion, but did not say when. The PNL is aiming for early elections.\n\nMihai Fifor, the interim internal affairs minister, said the PSD would negotiate with all political groups in order to remain in power, Romanian media reported. He added that the PSD ending up in the opposition \"could be an alternative.\"\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103 said that if a vote of no confidence were to pass, her party would \"obey the vote of the parliament.\"\n\nROMANIA NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "The ruling Social Democrats say they will negotiate for support to continue governing.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu", "Matei Rosca", "Nick Ashdown"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1163552591-1024x628.jpg"}
