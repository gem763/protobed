She said that it felt like being \u201cinterrogated\u201d as she was asked detailed intimate questions and quizzed over her mental health.\n\nEarlier this year, Warwick University\u2019s vice-Chancellor apologised over the institution\u2019s handling of the Facebook rape group chat scandal. The admission came after an independent review found the incident had left a \"legacy of mistrust\" at the university.\n\nProf Stuart Croft said the university has overhauled its disciplinary procedures following the backlash from students, staff and alumni over the incident and its aftermath.\n\nAn independent review it commissioned into its handling of the case described how Warwick\u2019s director of press and media had initially been appointed to handle the complaints process.", "description": "Sexual violence and harassment cases at universities have trebled in three years, as victims reveal their claims are being investigated by novices.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2018/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000011321301-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqejMVNjZ2Bv6EA7I5e4mELy5twttbUiN55rbZOKJP4mY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
