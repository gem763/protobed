China Narrows Scope for Trade Deal With U.S. Ahead of Talks\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Chinese officials are signaling they\u2019re increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by President Donald Trump, ahead of negotiations this week that have raised hopes of a potential truce.\n\nIn meetings with U.S. visitors to Beijing in recent weeks, senior Chinese officials have indicated the range of topics they\u2019re willing to discuss has narrowed considerably, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nVice Premier Liu He, who will lead the Chinese contingent in high-level talks that begin Thursday, told visiting dignitaries he would bring an offer to Washington that won\u2019t include commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy or the government subsidies that have been the target of longstanding U.S. complaints, one of the people said.\n\nThat offer would take one of the Trump administration\u2019s core demands off the table. It\u2019s emblematic of what analysts see as China\u2019s strengthening hand as the Trump administration faces an impeachment crisis -- which has recently drawn in China -- and a slowing economy blamed by businesses on the disruption caused by the president\u2019s trade wars.\n\nPeople close to the Trump administration say the impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t affecting trade talks with China. Any attempt to portray anything different is an attempt to weaken the U.S. hand at the negotiating table and, they argue, would be a miscalculation by the Chinese.\n\nBut China, beset by its own escalating political crisis in Hong Kong, was drawn into the Washington furor after Trump last week called for a Chinese investigation into his Democratic rival Joe Biden and the former vice president\u2019s son, moments after threatening another escalation in the trade spat.\n\nTrump insisted on Friday that there\u2019s no linkage. Yet the president\u2019s latest comments suggest why Chinese leaders, already frustrated with what they see as the president\u2019s impetuous conduct in the trade talks, may see room to take advantage.\n\nChina\u2019s leadership \u201care interpreting the impeachment discussion as a weakening of Trump\u2019s position, or certainly a distraction,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China\u2019s elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\u201cTheir calculation is that Trump needs a win\u201d and is willing to make compromises on substance as a result, he said.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly he would entertain only an all-encompassing deal with China. People close to him say he remains firm in that view.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had good moments with China. We\u2019ve had bad moments with China. Right now, we\u2019re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal,\u201d Trump told reporters on Friday. \u201cBut what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re negotiating a very tough deal. If the deal is not going to be 100% for us, then we\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with the state of play say contacts that resumed over the summer after a breakdown in May have focused on how to resume negotiations and avoid further escalating the tariff wars that have unnerved financial markets.\n\nYet those talks have centered more on a timeline for implementing a limited deal rather than the substance of provisions where the two sides are at odds.\n\nDiscussions have focused on what U.S. administration officials view as a three-phase process, people familiar with the talks said. The sequence would involve large-scale purchases of U.S. agricultural and energy exports by China, implementing intellectual-property commitments China made in a draft agreement this year and, finally, a partial rollback of U.S. tariffs.\n\nBloomberg News reported in September that Trump\u2019s team was discussing a potential limited agreement that includes those elements. That could clear the way for broader negotiations next year. Yet if China insists it will not engage in any discussions on industrial policy, those plans could be scuttled.\n\nHopes have always been limited that China would agree to give up its economic model in a trade deal with the U.S. A draft agreement reached in April before talks broke down included few substantive commitments from China to abandon the sort of industrial policies the Trump administration and others before it have complained about, according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nThat draft focused on securing more transparency from China on the extent of its subsidies. It included a commitment essentially to disavow Made in China 2025, Xi Jinping\u2019s plan for Chinese domination of key 21st century industry such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric vehicles, though it lacked a schedule for removing Chinese government subsidies that fueling the plan.\n\nOne reason for that is U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer\u2019s focus on what he views as pragmatic demands for Chinese change, rather than shriller calls for a wholesale abandonment of Beijing\u2019s industrial policy some hawks believe should be required of Beijing.\n\nLighthizer declined to comment on the state of negotiations through an aide. While he\u2019s unlikely to accept any Chinese offer that doesn\u2019t address industrial subsidies or policy, people close to him say he may be willing to embrace \u201csequencing\u201d a deal and an \u201cearly-harvest\u201d agreement as long as broader talks continue.\n\nStill, people close to the administration say Trump\u2019s trade chief probably would need some kind of commitment resembling a concession on subsidies and industrial policy to sell the agreement at home.\n\nA possible model is last month\u2019s U.S. deal with Japan on agriculture, digital trade and a limited number of industrial tariffs, which was presented as the first phase of a longer negotiation.\n\nAny such deal would leave the fate of a major Trump administration demand hanging in the wind, putting the president on the defensive at home ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nAddressing issues such as industrial subsidies \u201cwere the whole reason this case started in the first place,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, a former U.S. trade official who heads the National Foreign Trade Council, a lobby group that\u2019s critical of Trump\u2019s trade wars. \u201cAt a minimum the administration will have a lot of explaining to do if those drop off the table.\u201d\n\nDavid Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury representative in China now at the Brookings Institution, says China\u2019s push to narrow the discussions is more evidence that both sides are hardening their positions on a broader deal.\n\nThe U.S. and China increasingly have reasons to strike a \u201cmini deal\u201d and avoid an escalation, he said. China needs agricultural products such as pork that Trump wants it to buy so he can placate American farmers. And even people in the White House concede there\u2019s a U.S. incentive to hold off on further tariffs to avoid a worsening economic slowdown going into 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny kind of negotiation where both sides\u2019 so-called concession is something that they need,\u201d Dollar said.", "description": "China Narrows Scope for Trade Deal With U.S. Ahead of Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF030BP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
