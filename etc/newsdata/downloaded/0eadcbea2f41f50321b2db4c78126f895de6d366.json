It\u2019s done. It was actually finished the moment this man announced he wanted to run for president. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio finally signed the euthanasia order for his 2020 presidential bid. He pulled the plug on it this weekend. This was a vanity project. Billy had no chance to win. His agenda too left-wing. No one knew who he was\u2014and really no one cared. He registered a whopping zero percent in 2020 polls, and everyone knew it. He has no name recognition, no national constituency, and he\u2019s in a field with deeper and more well-known Democrats who could mount a national run. There was no way he was going to overtake Biden, Warren, Harris, or even Buttigieg. It got to the point where even those who aren\u2019t known for their political advocacy, like comedian Billy Crystal, mocked the mayor\u2019s run, noting that he\u2019s not going anywhere so just come back and do your job in the city (via Fox News):\n\nHollywood legend Billy Crystal slammed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s struggling 2020 presidential campaign \u2026 and said the mayor should return to Manhattan and fix its problems. \u201cDe Blasio, what are you doing in Iowa? You\u2019re going nowhere, come back and clean up this city,\u201d Crystal said on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The New York crowd applauded as Colbert shook Crystal\u2019s hand and responded, \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d Crystal joked.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one wanted this clown to run in the first place. When there\u2019s braindead-level support for your presidential aspirations in your backyard, it\u2019s time to call it a day. De Blasio finally has\u2014but The NY Post decided to mark the occasion by running an \u201cobituary\u201d (via NY Post):\n\nTomorrow\u2019s cover: Here lies Bill de Blasio's failed presidential campaign https://t.co/EGGmZyTSmW pic.twitter.com/Cf3i25N6Xd \u2014 New York Post (@nypost) September 20, 2019\n\nNow here\u2019s the question: When a candidate craters in public and nobody cares, does he make a difference? Well, maybe these: De Blasio\u2019s departure probably raises the IQ of the Democratic field by a few points, plus the New York hotel industry \u2014 which pretty much financed his campaign \u2014 can lay down its checkbook for a while. And now Kaiser Wilhelm has New York to kick around some more \u2014 or, as he puts it, \u201cI\u2019m going to continue my work as mayor.\u201d Oh, goody. Surely the Park Slope Y appreciates the heads-up, because nothing spiffs up a gym like police security details hanging around all morning. And if there are not enough vagrants splayed out on subway car benches, a rested and re-energized Bill de Blasio quickly can chum up some more. Plus the city hasn\u2019t been punked by Andrew Cuomo in months; the governor will be delighted to see his old sparring partner climb back into the ring. So happy days are here again, and the skies above are clear again \u2014 except for those subway bums. Plus collapsing public housing, people shooting at cops, a barely functional public school system, a wife grinding up tax dollars to fuel a make-work mental health project, and so on and so forth. Geez, no wonder the man ran for president.\n\nOuch. Talk about being stabbed, shot, and then being set on fire.", "description": ".09/23/2019 15:11:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/dee2d2d2-0928-44d8-a6b8-cd5c3ad020e4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
