Posing as Republican, he tried to infiltrate Trump\u2019s administration as Secretary of State,\u201d says the commercial, referring to the president\u2019s past consideration of Romney to be his secretary of state.\n\n\u201cNow his cover\u2019s blown \u2014 exposed by news reports as a Democrat secret asset,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cSources say Romney\u2019s plotting to take down President Trump with impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe commercial concludes with a call to action.\n\n\u201cTell Romney, quit colluding with Democrats on impeachment,\u201d the narrator says, as the senator\u2019s office phone number flashes on the screen.\n\nA Romney spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe Club for Growth, which vocally opposed Trump in 2016 and spent millions of dollars on negative ads against him, has since transformed itself into a pro-Trump outfit and is investing a relatively small amount to air the commercial. It will spend just $25,000 on TV and $15,000 on digital, according to a person familiar with the media buy. It remains to be seen whether other conservative groups will go after the Utah senator.\n\nRomney, who was the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, is one of the few congressional Republicans who has shown a willingness to speak out against the president. Trump has fired back, recently taking to Twitter to call Romney a \u201cpompous \u2018ass.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 72-year-old Romney, however, has told friends he cares little about what the president has to say about him. Instead, Romney is moving forward with an aggressive plan to aid Republicans in 2020 Senate races.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ce/53/06e7a4e44e4dba58e13fc22ca6bf/20191016-romney-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
