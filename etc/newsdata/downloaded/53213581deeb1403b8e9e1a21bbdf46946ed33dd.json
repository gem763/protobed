Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help, in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nCurious about your thoughts on good duffel or weekender bags. I liked the North Face duffel you included with your recent luggage recommendations, but I am wondering if you have more options, including some less sporty styles?\n\nTaking bae upstate to see the leaves change? I love it. Yes, a Rimowa would be overkill; you need something you can toss in the trunk with ease. If you aren\u2019t ready to pony up for the Louis Vuitton Keepall, I can recommend some affordable (and durable) options that will do the job.\n\nFilson Medium Rugged Twill Duffel Bag The Filson Medium Rugged Twill duffel bag will easily fit everything you need for a weekend of apple-picking or skipping rocks on Long Island, without taking up too much space in a car or on a train. If your weekend plans require plane travel, that\u2019s also just as easy since the duffel is designed to fit in carry-on compartments, according to Filson. It comes in a handful of colors beyond the classic tan, including olive green, navy, and a gray called cinder. Plus, it\u2019s water-resistant, has solid leather handles, and Filson will even monogram the leather if you buy it from the brand! We love a monogram. $395 at Filson Buy $395 at Backcountry Buy\n\nJ.W. Hulme Classic Duffel If your weekend away includes grass tennis courts, gin martinis, and skeet shooting, the new Classic Duffel from J.W. Hulme will do the trick. The bag is beautiful, functional (it\u2019s carry-on appropriate and comes with a shoulder strap), lined with micro-suede, and has a U-shaped zippered entry to the main compartment for easy access. You can also get it monogrammed for an extra $10. Throw it in the back of your old Land Rover and hit the road. (If you like the look but want to spend $100 less, J.W. Hulme makes a slightly smaller Continental Duffel that has a similar design.) $995 at J.W. Hulme Buy\n\nPrada Logo Plaque Holdall I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t offer at least one extravagantly priced, excellent option. Another nylon duffel, Prada\u2019s black Holdall is an investment worth making. It is something you can pass on to the kids; until then, it will fit perfectly on the PJ from Teterboro to Miami. $1,870 at Farfetch Buy\n\nWhat are good black shoes for a not-cool person who doesn\u2019t like the look of black sneakers? I tried the Dr. Martens shoes you wrote about, but I can\u2019t pull off the bulky shoe look.\n\nHey! I am sure you are cool in your own way :). TBH, I never thought of Dr. Martens as bulky, but I am happy to provide some different options. It is literally my job.\n\nI think you should dip into the Clarks pool. The low-top Wallabee in black beeswax leather is a classic worn by all my guitar-playing British heroes, but also by, like, my Dad. If the shape throws you off, get a pair of Desert Boots in black suede. They are super-wearable and eternally cool.\n\nTricker's Bourton Full-Grain Leather Brogues Some Tricker\u2019s brogues are perfect for every occasion and will last forever. I like the slightly chunkier sole, which makes them feel more substantial. They might seem too bulky for you, but I say try them on before ruling them out. $645 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nOur Legacy Camion Boot These zip-up Our Legacy boots also really speak to me. Black leather, Vibram sole, minimalist \u2026 seems like they could work for you? Just don\u2019t try to wear them with khakis or something. $490 at Matches Fashion Buy $505 at End Clothing Buy\n\nWhile we\u2019re talking shoes: What kind should I wear with a slim pair of black jeans? I\u2019ve worn Dickies exclusively for the last year, and I\u2019m feeling lost with fabric in the vicinity of my ankle.\n\nConverse Chuck Taylor All Star '70 Hi, White $85 at Zappos Buy\n\nConverse Chuck Taylor All Star '70 Hi, Sunflower $85 at Zappos Buy\n\nI mean, almost anything? You can never go wrong with a pair of Converse Chuck Taylor \u201970 high-tops. Coke white, of course \u2014 or sunflower if you need a little color.\n\nAdidas Originals Men's Gazelle Sneaker, Collegiate Navy As you know, my household is checks over stripes forever. But, I don\u2019t expect everyone to be as brand loyal as myself, and to those who are not, I say: Get a pair of suede Adidas Gazelles in collegiate navy to wear with your skinny black jeans. From $78 at Amazon Buy From $78 at Amazon Buy\n\nSid Mashburn Playboy Chukka Boot Maybe you are trying to swag out a bit. I love these navy suede Playboy Chukka boots from Sid Mashburn. Your classic British-army shape with a crepe sole. Go off. Not ready to go full-on blue suede boots? The black pair of Desert Boots above offer a more neutral take on the look (and come at a lower price). $375 at Sid Mashburn Buy\n\nVisvim Black Christo 2-Tone Sandals If you have had your biweekly pedicure (or are confident enough to do the socks and sandals thing), stunt on \u2019em with a black-and-navy pair of two-tone Visim Christo slides. A sandal with a Vibram sole, you love to see it! These are OG, accept no imitations. $730 at SSENSE Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
