An estimated 80 percent of the population will experience it at some point, and it costs at least $50 billion in health care costs each year.\n\nBack pain is a complicated problem, and there are dozens of causes. Accidents, injuries, and degenerative disk diseases are major culprits. Back pain can also directly result from health conditions such as osteoporosis or kidney disease.\n\nLifestyle plays a role too. Back pain can be brought on by things you do or don\u2019t do on a regular basis, such as lifting heavy objects, being sedentary, and wearing high heels. But the most common daily habit that contributes to back pain is sitting.\n\nBeing in a seated position can place a lot of pressure on the joints, muscles, and lower disks in the spine. In fact, up to 90 percent more pressure is placed on the back when we sit than when we stand. This is mainly because of how the majority of us sit\u2026we tend to slouch.\n\nTo compound matters, \u201cergonomic\u201d chairs that are contoured to the body and designed to make sitting more relaxing and comfortable, are actually making the health of our backs worse in the long run.\n\nGet My FREE Joint Pain Report The Drug-Free Joint Cure\n\nFor thousands of years, chairs had very simple designs and were built primarily with wood. Rarely did they have cushioned seats or even arm rests. They were flat, firm, and perfectly proportioned to fit the body.\n\nBut then about a hundred years ago, new materials began to emerge and chair manufacturers got creative. Wood was replaced with steel, aluminum, plastic, and lots and lots of cushioning and fancy designs.\n\nSure, today\u2019s soft, fluffy chairs may feel great, but they\u2019re terrible for the spine and joints\u2014and our backs are paying the price.\n\nReduce Back Pain with Proper Posture\n\nThe sensible solution to eliminating back pain associated with sitting, is to not sit so much. But with desk jobs so prevalent, this is easier said than done. Therefore, if your job requires lots of sitting\u2014and especially if you suffer back pain from sitting for long hours\u2014here are some tips and tactics you can implement to reduce the stress on your back.\n\nWhile sitting, keep your arms parallel to your spine . Don\u2019t let your shoulders roll in front of your chest. In other words, don\u2019t slouch!\n\n. Don\u2019t let your shoulders roll in front of your chest. In other words, don\u2019t slouch! Support your lower back by sitting on the harder, firmer edge of the chair\u2019s seat. This goes against traditional thinking that you should sit all the way back so that your spine rests against the back of the chair. But sitting on the edge actually keeps your pelvis from tucking under your spine\u2014a gateway to slouching. Sitting on the edge also allows you to position your legs so that your knees are below your hip sockets, at more of a 120-degree angle. This angle also helps to align your spine properly.\n\nThis goes against traditional thinking that you should sit all the way back so that your spine rests against the back of the chair.

If your chair is too soft (and most these days are), create a perch out of a pillow wedge or a rolled-up blanket, sweater, or yoga mat. Place it a few inches from the edge of the seat, then sit on the front of this \u201cperch\u201d so that your hips/pelvis tilt slightly forward. This position also elevates your sitting (sitz) bones, which, again, prevents slouching. In addition, using a perch makes it easier for your knees to bend at a comfortable\u2014and back friendly\u2014120-degree angle under your seat.\n\nso that your hips/pelvis tilt slightly forward.

If you are sitting at a desk, make sure to keep your eye level aimed at the center of your computer screen. The average head weighs about 10 pounds, so any slight angle downward puts strain on your neck and upper spine.\n\nThe average head weighs about 10 pounds, so any slight angle downward puts strain on your neck and upper spine. Don\u2019t sit for too long. Our bodies weren\u2019t designed to sit for extended periods of time. We were actually built to be in constant motion. A good rule of thumb is to change positions, or get up and move around, every 20-30 minutes throughout the day. A good way to make sure you do this is to drink a lot of water. Not only is staying hydrated important for overall health, it makes you have to go to the bathroom\u2014which forces you to get up and move!\n\nOn a final note, if you are able to get a standing desk, that\u2019s another option to consider. With back pain such a common issue, it\u2019s important to do everything in your power to prevent it. If you simply sit less during the day, you can eliminate one of the biggest risk factors associated with back pain.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
