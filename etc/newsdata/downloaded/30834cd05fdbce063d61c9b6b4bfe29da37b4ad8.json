Benioff took specific issue with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), the law that shields Facebook and other social media platforms from legal liability. Benioff called Section 230 \u201cthe most dangerous law on the books right now,\u201d calling for it to be \u201cabolished.\u201d\n\nCNN reports that during a recent interview with CNN reporter Poppy Harlow, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once against expressed his distaste for social media platform Facebook and called for the company to be broken up. Benioff has long been a critic of Facebook, famously stating at one point that Facebook is the \u201cnew cigarettes\u201d and should be regulated as such.\n\nIn his most recent interview, Benioff stated: \u201cIt\u2019s addictive, it\u2019s not good for you, they\u2019re after your kids, they\u2019re running political ads that aren\u2019t true \u2026 and they\u2019re also acquiring other companies and co-mingling [data those companies have on their users] into theirs,\u201d referencing Facebook\u2019s acquisition of image-sharing app Instagram.\n\nBenioff added: \u201cAnd I think at that point, because they\u2019re now doing that, that they probably should be broken up. Because they\u2019re having an undue influence as the largest social media platform on the planet.\u201d Benioff also stated that shortly after his comments comparing Facebook to cigarettes he had received a call from Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg but declined to say what sort of conversation took place between the two.\n\nThe Salesforce.com CEO took specific issue with Section 230. He said, \u201cthe most dangerous law on the books right now,\u201d saying that in his opinion, it should be \u201cabolished.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a world where very advanced technologies are at our fingertips, and where we can do magical things,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cBut that also means that trust must be our highest value. And you have to ask yourself: Is trust your highest value? If it\u2019s not your highest value, then what is it?\u201d\n\nBenioff specifically took issue with Facebook\u2019s recent decision to run political advertisements from the Trump campaign which allegedly contained false claims. Benioff stated that there was \u201cno question\u201d he would run such advertisements if he was in control of Facebook.\n\n\u201cI think this is extremely important in the age of social media, because they have the information of who those persuadables are, and various political organizations are targeting those groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the insight from the 2016 election. It\u2019s a very vulnerable moment right now.\u201d\n\nRead more of Benioff\u2019s interview with CNN here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
