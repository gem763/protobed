Biden and his son, Hunter, over a Ukrainian gas company that paid the younger Biden $3 million. Democrats say Mr. Trump should be impeached for withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nThe whistleblower, reportedly a CIA analyst, has sought to remain anonymous as allowed by law. The person said the complaint was based on information from other government employees, some of whom were allegedly listening to the president\u2019s call as standard procedure.\n\nThe president said he outfoxed Democrats by releasing a transcript of the phone call last week.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s where I fooled them: They never thought in a million years that I\u2019d release the conversation,\u201d the president said.\n\nChairman Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which expects to hear from the whistleblower in closed-door testimony, said Mr. Trump is trying to bully the person.\n\n\u201cThis is a blatant effort to intimate witnesses,\u201d the California Democrat told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an incitement to violence.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
