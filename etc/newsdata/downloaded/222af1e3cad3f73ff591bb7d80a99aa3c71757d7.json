People should be informed of its true meaning.\u2019\n\nThe swastika used by the far-right is rotated degrees and is usually a black character within a white circle on a red background.\n\nThe word itself comes from Sanskrit meaning \u2018conducive to wellbeing\u2019 or \u2018auspicious\u2019, while in Hinduism it symbolises prosperity and good luck.\n\nFans of the curry house said it was \u2018pathetic\u2019 that they were forced to defend themselves (Picture: Lily\u2019s Vegetarian Indian Cuisine)\n\nThe swastika at Lily\u2019s is red on a white background, and is part of a welcome sign hung above the door before a visit from Mayor of Tameside.\n\nCouncillor Leigh Drennan visited the restaurant last night as part of the pre-Diwali celebrations.\n\nIn a bid to shake off the Swastika\u2019s negative connotations, a post on Lily\u2019s Facebook page reads: \u2018The symbol that is used in this sign is a religious Hindu symbol. It is an ancient symbol of spirituality and represents auspiciousness and good luck.\n\nManagement said the symbol has been recognised since 3000 BC, long before the Nazi regime (Picture: Lily\u2019s Vegetarian Indian Cuisine)\n\n\u2018It has been recognised as this symbol since 3000 BC and still represents this for many Hindus around the world today.\n\n\u2018We have been made aware that some comments have been circulating that imply we have this symbol up for other reasons and would like to make it clear that this isn\u2019t the case.\u2019\n\nLily\u2019s Vegetarian recently celebrated winning a Manchester Food and Drink Festival award for Neighbourhood Restaurant of the Year, just a year after being awarded Vegetarian Offering of the Year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
