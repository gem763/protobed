This includes respecting electoral mandates of their constituencies.\"\n\nMr Morrison's speech comes a week after US President Donald Trump told the United Nations that \"the future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots.''\n\nMr Morrison said he had ordered the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to conduct a \"comprehensive audit of global institutions and rule-making processes where we have the greatest stake''.\n\nThese are expected to include economic bodies such as the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the United Nations.\n\n\"We will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them,\" he said.\n\n\"This will not only include our international efforts to support global peace and stability and to promote open markets based on fair and transparent rules, but also other global standards that underpin commerce, investment and exchange.\n\n\"When it comes to setting global standards, we\u2019ve not been as involved as we could be. I\u2019m determined for Australia will play a more active role in standards setting.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina statements 'a compliment'\n\nMr Morrison used a speech in the US last week to again push for reforms to the World Trade Organisation and to argue that China should not be afforded developing nation status, which entitles it to concessions under WTO rules.\n\nOn Thursday night, Mr Morrison said his statements about China were a \"compliment not a criticism\". China had benefited from a rules-based order and it should play by the same rules as its developed competitors.\n\n\"China has in many ways changed the world so we would expect the terms of its engagement to change too,'' he said.\n\n\"That's why when we look at negotiating rules of the future of the global economy, for example, we would expect China's obligations to reflect its greater power status.''\n\nMr Morrison again stressed the importance of the US maintaining a strong presence in the region and he confirmed a secret meeting in New York last week of the Foreign Ministers of Australia, India, Japan and the US \u2013 the quadrilateral dialogue.\n\nThis was the first meeting of the \"quad\" at a ministerial level since the dialogue was rekindled about three years ago. Mr Morrison also announced he would be visiting Japan and India in January and he said he would work harder on the relationship with South Korea.\n\nMalcolm Turnbull was the last prime minister to visit India, doing so in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Morrison stressed however, that Australia was not choosing between China and the US and her strategic allies.\n\n\"Deep US engagement in the Indo-Pacific is essential for maintaining stability and prosperity,'' he said.\n\n\"But even during an era of great power competition, Australia does not have to choose between the United States and China.\n\n\"China is our Comprehensive Strategic Partner.\"\n\nMr Morrison suggested China's rise needed to be accommodated, not viewed through the prism of conflict.\n\nRelations with the US and China could be kept \"in good order by rejecting the binary narrative of their strategic competition and instead valuing and nurturing the unconflicted benefit of our close association\".\n\nMr Morrison also announced Australia and 15 regional neighbours hoped to conclude the regional free trade deal \u2013 the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \u2013 when they meet in Thailand next month on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.\n\nThat, he said, would draw India more substantially into the Indo-Pacific economy.", "description": "Scott Morrison has announced an audit of Australia's role in international organisations, warning globalism poses a threat to sovereignty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1969%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/eb96a418232d664d6c345ce929d10084a7253888", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
