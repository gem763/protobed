It\u2019s Keanon Lowe, who played for the Oregon team that made it to the national championship game in 2014. (Oregon lost but Lowe caught a TD pass for the first score of the game.) After graduating, he joined the staff of the Philadelphia Eagles and later the San Francisco 49ers thanks to his relationship with former Oregon coach Chip Kelly, who had moved on to the NFL after 2012. Kelly was fired by the Niners in 2016 but Lowe was set to remain with the team \u2014 until he got a phone call informing him that his best friend from high school had died of an overdose. Lowe went home, for good.\n\nTaylor\u2019s death forced Lowe to reassess his own life. The NFL suddenly didn\u2019t have the same appeal. Taylor had always looked out for others. Lowe decided he would rededicate himself to the same mission. He moved home and helped coach at Jesuit High during Trey\u2019s senior season\u2026 \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing my best friend justice,\u201d he said, \u201cby giving away all my energy to all these kids and people that need it.\u201d\n\nHe phrased it this way years later in an interview with the Oregonian: \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m coming back. I\u2019m going to lead. How can I lead the community if I\u2019m not there?\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually he was hired as head football coach at Parkrose High School in Portland, Oregon. On May 17 of this year, a student named Angel Granados-Diaz walked into Parkrose in a trenchcoat concealing a shotgun and entered a classroom. Reportedly Granados-Diaz never actually pointed the gun at anyone else. His plan, based on statements he had made to others beforehand, was to commit suicide in front of the class. But one never knows what a desperate man might do with a weapon in hand when he has homicide on his mind.\n\nApparently by pure chance, Lowe was in the classroom looking for a different student when Granados-Diaz walked in. Some reports after the incident claimed that Lowe tackled Granados-Diaz; possibly he simply talked Granados-Diaz into handing over the gun. There were no cameras in the classroom \u2014 but there was one in the hallway that captured this extraordinary scene, released to the media for the first time yesterday. Somehow it was Lowe, not Granados-Diaz, who emerged from the classroom with that shotgun.\n\nBreaking News: video of Coach Keanon Lowe disarming Parkrose High School gunman Angel Granados-Diaz.

You say you want to do all this. You say you want to be here for the kids. Well, prove it, right there, in that instant.'\u201d He proved it. And that\u2019s why, in all probability, you never knew that there was almost a school shooting at Parkrose High in Oregon in May until you saw this clip. Lowe was there.\n\nGranados-Diaz was sentenced to 36 months probation last week, which will require mental-health and substance-abuse treatment. He\u2019s alive and hopefully he\u2019ll eventually be well. Asked what Granados-Diaz said to him while the two were embracing, Lowe told the Oregonian, \u201cHe didn\u2019t really say anything. I just held him and told him that I was there to save him.\u201d", "description": "\"You say you want to be here for the kids.
