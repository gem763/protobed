Disloyalty to me - and, later, disloyalty to Boris.\"\n\nThe latest revelations come after another extract published on Saturday accused the pair of behaving \"appallingly\" during the 2016 referendum campaign.\n\nMr Cameron called the poll after promising it in the Conservative Party's election manifesto.\n\nHe campaigned for Remain, but lost the vote by 52% to 48%, and resigned as prime minister shortly after.\n\nMr Cameron writes that when deciding whether to back Leave or Remain in the campaign, Mr Johnson was concerned what the \"best outcome\" would be for him.\n\n\"Whichever senior Tory politician took the lead on the Brexit side - so loaded with images of patriotism, independence and romance - would become the darling of the party,\" he says.\n\n\"He [Mr Johnson] didn't want to risk allowing someone else with a high profile - Michael Gove in particular - to win that crown.\"\n\nThe former Tory leader adds: \"The conclusion I am left with is that he [Boris Johnson] risked an outcome he didn't believe in because it would help his political career.\"\n\nHe also says during the Leave campaign Mr Johnson, who has repeatedly said the UK must exit the EU on 31 October, privately raised the possibility of holding another referendum after fresh negotiations with the EU.\n\nHe criticises Mr Johnson's use of the Vote Leave campaign bus emblazoned by the much-criticised claim that leaving would mean \u00a3350m a week extra for the NHS.\n\n\"Boris rode the bus round the country, he left the truth at home,\" writes the former prime minister.\n\nImage copyright Carl Court Image caption Leave-supporting politicians and footballer Sol Campbell with a Vote Leave poster in 2016\n\nAnd of Mr Gove - a cabinet minister both now and then - he said: \"I couldn't believe what I was seeing.\n\n\"Gove, the liberal-minded, carefully-considered Conservative intellectual, had become a foam-flecked Faragist warning that the entire Turkish population was about to come to Britain.\"\n\nDuring the run-up to the EU referendum, Mr Gove claimed Turkey and four other countries could join the EU by 2020, increasing the UK's population by up to 5.23 million by 2030.\n\nHowever, it was the behaviour of his then employment minister and current Home Secretary Priti Patel that \"shocked\" him the most, he says.\n\n\"She used every announcement, interview and speech to hammer the government on immigration, even though she was part of that government,\" he writes.\n\n\"I was stuck though: unable to fire her, because that would make her a Brexit martyr.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Cameron said the behaviour of Priti Patel, his former education minister, shocked him the most\n\nThe prime minister, Mr Gove and Ms Patel are yet to respond to the criticisms of them contained in Mr Cameron's book.\n\nIn an interview with the Times published on Saturday, Mr Cameron said he was \"hugely depressed\" about the 2016 referendum result and he knew \"some people will never forgive me\".\n\nBut he defended his decision to call the poll, arguing the issue of the EU \"needed to be addressed\".\n\nImage copyright Red Sky Shepherds Huts via PA Media Image caption The former PM famously wrote his memoirs in a shed - which allegedly cost \u00a325,000\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson has told the Mail on Sunday that if he cannot negotiate a new deal with the EU by the 31 October deadline, the UK will break out of its \"manacles\" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk on Halloween.\n\n\"Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country,\" he said in an interview with the paper. \"We will come out on 31 October and we will get it done.\"\n\nThe prime minister is due to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Luxembourg this week as negotiations aimed at securing a deal continue.\n\nDavid Cameron as PM\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMr Cameron became the Conservative Party leader in 2005. Five years later he was voted into Downing Street as the UK's youngest prime minister in almost 200 years - aged 43.\n\nHis six-year tenure - firstly in coalition with the Liberal Democrats and latterly with a majority government - was dominated by his desire to reduce the deficit, and the introduction of austerity measures with his Chancellor George Osborne.\n\nBut when he pledged in his party's 2015 manifesto to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, the focus shifted.\n\nMr Cameron backed Remain during the 2016 campaign and, on the morning of the result after discovering he had lost, he announced he would be stepping down, saying: \"I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\"\n\nThe former PM had remained silent until this weekend about both of his successors at the helm of the Tory Party - Theresa May and Boris Johnson.\n\nBut his allegedly fractious relationship with Mr Johnson has been well documented since their days together at Oxford University - most notably as members of the infamous Bullingdon Club.", "description": "The former PM claims Boris Johnson did not believe in Brexit during the 2016 referendum campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16211/production/_108814609_boris-cameron.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
