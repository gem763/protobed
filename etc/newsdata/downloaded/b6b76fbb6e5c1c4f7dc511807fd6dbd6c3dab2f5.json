There was blood on the deck, panic in our throats.\n\n\u201cWhat had begun as a romantic gesture was turning into a horror movie and the rocks were getting closer and closer. But just as things were getting really desperate, the rope snapped and we roared away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether we\u2019d have died or not if we\u2019d crashed into the rocks but it certainly wouldn\u2019t have done wonders for my good looks.\u201d\n\nThe story ends on a tongue-in-cheek note that sums up the way Tottenham, Liverpool and England star Peter, 38, views life in his book I, Robot, How to be a Footballer 2 \u2013 out Thursday.\n\nOf course, the Sardinia episode is not the only holiday disaster the Crouches have suffered \u2013 then laughed about.\n\nPeter says of a jaunt a few years later: \u201cWe were en route to our villa in Malia, Crete, when we bumped into David Bentley, who I played with at Spurs.\n\n\u201cWe ended up having an absolutely mental night out with all three of us dancing on a table at one point and then me dancing on the bar.\n\n\u201cAbbey was looking up at me dancing on the bar \u2013 that\u2019s quite a long way up for her to look \u2013 when she lost her footing and fell on to these hard steps, literally breaking her back.\n\n\u201cShe actually fractured it when she landed and we were told she had broken her coccyx. She was in agony.\n\n\u201cWe rushed back to the villa and the next thing I remember was the sight of Abbey, who at this point was throwing up into a bucket with her naked arse in the air having cream massaged into her buttocks by this nurse.\n\n\u201cAbbey was in a lot of pain and I\u2019m not proud to admit I was in tears laughing. But actually, Abbey was laughing too and she accepted it was all just a bit of a drunken chaos.\u201d\n\nPeter quit the pitch in July and has started a new career in punditry.\n\nHe works for BT Sport as well as presenting his own podcast for the BBC and co-hosting entertainment sports show Back Of The Net with Gabby Logan and John Bishop for Amazon. But now that he has hung his boots up, he reveals he may have done it sooner if not for Abbey.\n\nPeter says: \u201cI came off injured during a cup game for Stoke against Nottingham Forest and called Abbey.\n\n\u201cI was just like, \u2018I\u2019m done, that was it\u2019. I felt off the pace. I hadn\u2019t played for a little while and having played at a top level, to then be getting a chase around at Forest, I was like, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m done, I can\u2019t do this any more\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut Abbey just picked me up again. She said, \u2018Don\u2019t be so stupid, it\u2019s only one game\u2019, and I changed my mind.\u201d\n\nDespite her support, Peter admits model Abbey, 33, has limited footie knowledge, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s true to say she doesn\u2019t know much about football.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really have any concept of whether it\u2019s a big game or a small game or a memorable moment or not.\n\n\"I would come home and if I\u2019d scored a hat-trick, or an own-goal and had a nightmare, it was the same reaction.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d be, \u2018Oh, I had a nightmare today, I broke my nail\u2019 and there was certainly no, \u201cOoh, Pete, you\u2019re amazing\u2019. But it\u2019s what I needed. It kept my ego in check and it\u2019s the same now I\u2019ve stopped playing.\n\n\u201cI might still be away working on TV covering matches but the second I walk in she\u2019ll just talk to me about the kids. If I talk about football she\u2019s not really listening.\n\n\u201cBut I respect Abbey\u2019s opinions on everything. If I\u2019ve got any work stuff to discuss or anything else, I\u2019ll run it by her and she always likes to say she\u2019s always right. Which obviously isn\u2019t true. Although she is right a lot.\u201d\n\nHaving a model wife is also handy for getting tips on how to look good \u2013 especially if you are a 6ft 7in beanpole like Peter, who has compared his own arms with linguine.\n\nHis main challenge post-retirement appears to be staying in shape.\n\nPeter says: \u201cAbbey makes me a green juice every morning as I don\u2019t eat enough veg and so far so good.\n\n\"I\u2019ve not been training properly for three months but up until now there\u2019s been no discernible difference to my body. Running bores me so I\u2019m avoiding that but I might to start to play more tennis.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nRetirement also means Peter has more time to spend with kids Sophia, eight, Liberty Rose, four, Johnny, who turns two in January, and four-month-old Jack.\n\nHe says: \u201cI was always hands-on, even when I was playing. But it\u2019s even better now. And what\u2019s nice now is I can take them to school and pick them up.\u201d\n\nMind you, Peter suffers the same kind of parenting headaches as the rest of us.\n\nHe says: \u201cI took Sophia to summer camp and when I got there she didn\u2019t want me to come in. I said, \u2018Why not, Sophia?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Oh Daddy you\u2019re too tall. I don\u2019t need you to come in\u2019.\n\n\"So I was like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s a bit much\u2019. So she was hiding me away because all the kids are like, \u2018Oh my God, your dad\u2019s so tall\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut once the footie-mad boys learned who Sophia\u2019s dad was, it was a different story. \u201cOnce the boys got wind I was her dad, she was like \u2018Dad, can you come in today?\u2019. I went from embarrassing dad to cool dad in 24 hours.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest change in Peter\u2019s life now is he can finally look forward to a big family festive season \u2013 the first football-free Christmas since he was 16.\n\n\u201cTwenty-two years I\u2019ve been training Christmas Day, playing Boxing Day, playing the 28th,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a hotel New Year\u2019s Eve, New Year\u2019s Day game. But finally, this year I\u2019ll be able to actually spend it with my family.\u201d\n\nAnd what in particular is he looking forward to doing this Christmas? \u201cGetting absolutely hammered.\u201d", "description": "The footie star, who's now a pundit, says a trip to Sardinia turned nasty when a boat he and Abbey had hired ended up in jeopardy", "authors": ["Nick Mcgrath", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571974.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS177102422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
