Under Russian regulations, the decision only took effect after 10 days to give prosecutors time to appeal, which they chose not to do.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two Russian national team soccer players have been released from prison after a court granted them parole.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/russia_players_paroled_57061_c0-242-3760-2434_s1770x1032.jpg?731111463bd7df3aa8bc0ba3dcc180adaea7d5d7", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
