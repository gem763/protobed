Mr Johnson is also expected to address MPs on Thursday evening.\n\nBoris Johnson will reportedly table a motion for a general election on Monday (Getty Images) More\n\nMr Johnson has also written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: \"This Parliament must get Brexit done now or a NEW Parliament must get Brexit done so the country can move on.\"\n\nHe said in the letter: \u201cIn our meeting yesterday you suggested that we propose a new timetable for getting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) through Parliament.\n\n\u201cThis Parliament has, with your encouragement, voted repeatedly for delay. The vote on Tuesday was Parliament\u2019s last chance to get Brexit done before 31 October and it voted, again, for delay.\n\n\"I am extremely sceptical this habit will change and many will doubt that this Parliament will do anything other than waste more time and then, in January, ask for yet another delay.\u201d\n\nI have written to Jeremy Corbyn: this Parliament must get Brexit done now or a NEW Parliament must get Brexit done so the country can move on pic.twitter.com/PekfFRsR9F \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 24, 2019\n\nIt concluded: \u201cThis Parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new Parliament that can make decisions.\n\n\"Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of Parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\n\n\u201cYou have repeatedly said that once the EU accepts Parliament\u2019s request for a delay until 31 January, then you would immediately support an election. I assume this remains your position and therefore you will support an election next week so the voters can replace this broken Parliament.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn (PA) More", "description": "Boris Johnson has said he will give MPs more time to debate his Brexit deal in the Commons if they agree to a general election on December 12.The Prime Minister announced the bid for a general election amid speculation the EU will grant a three-month Brexit extension.", "authors": ["Katy Clifton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qTrDsiJ6xMAklERAnb0gLg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/aad257b3c19cd634c7032561f7120e06", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
