FIFA can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.'", "description": "Gianni Infantino has called for 'new, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football' in the wake of the abuse suffered by England players during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Press Association Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/18/19752422-0-image-a-10_1571159963736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
