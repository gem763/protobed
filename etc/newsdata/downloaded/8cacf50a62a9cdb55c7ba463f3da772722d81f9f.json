The alarm was raised when cleaning staff could not gain access to the building.\n\nThe police established a security cordon and asked the public to avoid the area while they attempted to make contact with the man in the museum, but the situation has been brought under control, as eyewitness video from the scene shows.\n\nAccording to unnamed police sources cited by French news outlets, the man wrote messages on the walls in Arabic, which referred to the museum and hell. This has yet to be confirmed by officials.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s motives remain unclear and authorities currently believe they are dealing with someone suffering from mental illness, rather than it being an act of terrorism, according to statements made by the local prosecutor\u2019s office and cited by French media.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
