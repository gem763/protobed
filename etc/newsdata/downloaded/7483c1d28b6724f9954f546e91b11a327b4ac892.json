It takes a turn as the viewer hears the sound of gunshots in the background, and kids start running and screaming. That\u2019s when the children start using their new school supplies to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cThese new sneakers are just what I need for the new year,\u201d says a boy running for his life down a hallway.\n\n\u201cThese scissors come in handy in art class,\u201d whispers a girl, who clutches a pair of shears as a weapon while hiding behind a door. A classmate arms himself with colored pencils.\n\nSandy Hook Promise/YouTube\n\n\u201cThese new socks \u2014 they can be a real life-saver,\u201d chimes in another girl, who ties a tourniquet on the leg of a fellow student who\u2019s bleeding heavily.\n\nBut the most gutting scene may be the one of a girl cowering in a bathroom stall, who texts \u201cI love you mom\u201d to her mother. \u201cI finally got my own phone to stay in touch with my mom,\u201d she says through her tears \u2014 as the ominous sound of footsteps approaches her hiding place.\n\nSandy Hook Promise/YouTube\n\nThe spot ends: \u201cIt\u2019s back-to-school time, and you know what that means.\u201d\n\nAnd a message that school shootings are preventable when you know the signs links to the Sandy Hook Promise website.\n\nNicole Hockley, a Sandy Hook Promise co-founder whose 6-year-old son Dylan was killed during the Sandy Hook shooting, told MSNBC\u2019s Stephanie Ruhle on Wednesday that the PSA is meant to \u201cshock parents, and say this is not what school should be about. We need to take action to prevent these.\u201d\n\nHockley added that her surviving son, who is in 10th grade, practiced active shooter drills or evacuation drills in school every day last week. \u201cI want people to be outraged by this new normal of school shootings and school violence,\u201d she said.\n\nThe PSA struck a nerve with audiences, leading Sandy Hook Promise to trend on Twitter TWTR, +0.00% early Wednesday. Viewers called the PSA \u201cpowerful\u201d and even \u201ca real punch to the throat,\u201d with many admitting it had made them cry.\n\nThis new Sandy Hook PSA is a real punch to the throat. Ooof. https://t.co/Mw0hywDQDL \u2014 J Herskowitz (@jherskowitz) September 18, 2019\n\nI saw this. I have a young teen. He's on the spectrum.\n\n\n\nYes. It scares me. Yes, this made me cry. How do I let him be a kid if I have to teach him there's a chance he'll be shot?\n\n\n\nYou fucking tell me that. How?https://t.co/6cXAvBry4p \u2014 Name isn't blank (@ohmyword1) September 18, 2019\n\nKatie Couric tweeted that 2018 was the deadliest year of gun violence on record, with 94 shooting incidents, including the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting in Parkland, Fla., according to data from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. (Its K-12 School Shooting Database documents every instance in which a gun is brandished, or is fired, or a bullet hits a school property for any reason.)\n\n2018 was the deadliest year on record with over 94 incidents of gun violence, including Parkland. This PSA from @sandyhook Promise shows the heartbreaking reality of what students go through and brings attention to Sandy Hook Promise\u2019s impactful Know the Signs programs. https://t.co/6QkdBJpBoU \u2014 Katie Couric (@katiecouric) September 18, 2019\n\nJoe Biden, the former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate, included the ad in a Twitter post while calling out Senate Republicans\u2019 \u201cinaction on gun violence.\u201d (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he won\u2019t bring legislation to the floor absent a signal from the White House as to which gun-control measure or measures President Trump is definitively amenable to, a posture for which his chamber\u2019s minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have expressed impatience.)\n\nAnother school year is starting. Another month of Senate Republicans\u2019 inaction on gun violence. This powerful ad from my friends @sandyhook captures the physical and emotional consequences of that inaction. https://t.co/16jaVm4QNG \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 18, 2019\n\nBut critics of the Sandy Hook Promise message argued that such graphic images were emotionally manipulative, complaining that \u201cusing mass murder to further political agendas is about as sick as it comes.\u201d Others complained that the video frightened them or argued that it could be used to inspire copycat shooters.\n\nSandy Hook Promise should NOT use graphic images of a school shooting to get PR attention. Remember, that\u2019s how the media creates copycat shooters! @sandyhook \u2014 JT Lewis (@thejtlewis) September 18, 2019\n\njeeeesus christ that's heavy-handed. it's a good point they're making but god damn my heart hurts \u2014 mishter shquidward (@mr_shquidward) September 18, 2019\n\nThere have been more mass shootings \u2014 283 \u2014 than days this year, according to a tabulation by the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, including the rampage in Odessa and Midland, Texas, on Aug. 31; the Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, shootings within a day of each other in early August; and a shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building in May.", "description": "The \u201cback-to-school essentials\u201d spot sees kids using scissors and skateboards to protect themselves from an active shooter.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR543_sandy__ZG_20190918120409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
