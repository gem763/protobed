Once retrieved from its dusty alcove, the car sparked a multimillion dollar legal battle for its ownership.\n\nToday, 50 years after it was built, the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe prototype finally sits in its rightful place -- a museum founded by its current owner.\n\nA car with a mission\n\nAs the name suggests, the car was created by American automotive entrepreneur, Carroll Shelby , who wanted to beat Italian designer Enzo Ferrari.\n\nHe had already done so as a driver with Aston Martin, winning the prestigious FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1959, a series that the \"prancing horse\" was otherwise dominating.\n\nShelby at Le Mans in an Aston Martin, 1959.

They fared well during their maiden year, 1964, with a standout win in their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans -- \"The Superbowl of racing,\" Simeone calls it. But although they outclassed Corvettes, Lolas, Porsches, and Alfas, the Daytonas still finished the championship behind the mighty Ferrari GTOs.\n\nIn 1965, Shelby finally took first place -- the first ever American racing team to do so -- taking 9 of 12 events in their class, with crucial wins in yet more historic races, such as the 24 Hours of Daytona itself, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, and the grueling 1,000-kilometer race at the Nurburgring Nordschleife, a 14-mile forest road track that racing hero Jackie Stewart would later nickname \"The Green Hell.\"\n\nShelby had beaten Ferrari. The legend of the Cobra Daytona Coupe was born.\n\nEnter the \"CSX2287\"\n\nThe car that Shelby had built in Venice remained the only one made in America. Five more were sent as frames to Modena, Italy -- right under Ferrari's nose -- where the bodywork was completed expertly and quickly.\n\nThe CSX2287 on fire at Daytona.

After winning the 1965 championship, the car, somewhat retired from radcing, had still a lot of speed left in it, and got a chance to prove it.\n\nSpeeding on salt\n\nOn November 6, 1965, the CSX2287 had not been raced for months, but the opportunity presented itself to haul it to the Bonneville Salt Flats to race against the clock and write history.\n\nOver four days, the car set 23 national and international speed records, reaching a top speed of 187 miles per hour.\n\nThe CSX2287 at the Bonneville Salt Flats, driven by five-time land speed record holder Craig Breedlove.

Shelby then sold the original Daytona -- at this point little more than a tired old prototype -- to Jim Russell, founder of a toy car company called Russkits, for $4,500.\n\nAnd that's where the weirdest part of the story begins.\n\nThe wall of (engine) sound\n\nThe Daytona soon landed in the hands of eccentric music producer Phil Spector , 26 years old at the time. He scribbled the car's records with house paint on the doors -- ridiculously exaggerating them -- and started driving it around Los Angeles.\n\nThis wasn't the first time the car was seen outside a track, as Shelby himself did several test runs in Marina del Rey with a manufacturer's plate.\n\nBut lightning quick as it was, it cost Spector so many tickets that his lawyer eventually suggested he get rid of it. Added to that, it was far from a smooth ride and became hot as hell after just a few miles.\n\nThis was no Sunset strip cruiser, but an angry thoroughbred racer, after all.\n\nSpector wanted to fix these issues, but the cost was so high that he was allegedly offered to scrap it for $800 instead. Luckily he knew better, and sold it to his bodyguard, George Brand, for $1,000.\n\nBrand gave the car to his daughter, Donna O'Hara, who then did the unthinkable -- she hid it away in a California storage unit.\n\nHidden treasure\n\nPrecisely as to why O'Hara made the conscious decision to just store the Daytona, dutifully paying the rent every month for 30 years, nobody knows.\n\nOver the years, interest mounted around the car and she received several offers for it, but always refused. \"She would rebuff anybody who presented themselves as interested in the car,\" said Simeone.\n\n\u201c Carroll Shelby himself went to see the car, but she wouldn't even open her door for him \u201d Fred Simeone\n\n\"Carroll Shelby himself went to visit her to see the car, and she wouldn't even open her screen door to talk to him. It was widely known she had it, but it was also widely known that you couldn't communicate with her... people had given up going for it.\"\n\n\"A very realistic offer\"\n\nAs a result, the CSX2287 remained untouched from 1971 to 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 26 The car in its current condition.

At the time of purchase, in 2001, the only car that I didn't have that fit all those criteria was the Cobra Daytona Coupe, so I really wanted it very badly,\" he says.\n\nWhat happened next is the darkest part of the story -- \"I hate to tell it, this is a happy story and the bottom of it is a downer. She [O'Hara] willed the proceeds of the sale to her mother and then set herself on fire. That was after the deal had been done.\"\n\nA difficult aftermath\n\nThe owner's shocking demise sparked a legal battle around the car that lasted for months. \"The aftermath of the sale was more difficult than the sale itself, because when word got out among the motoring community that the car was discovered and was being purchased by a private party, a lot of people desperately tried to buy it, and asked a judge to put it up for public sale,\" says Simeone.\n\n\u201c The aftermath of the sale was was more difficult than the sale itself \u201d Fred Simeone\n\nEven Phil Spector, through his lawyer Robert Shapiro -- famous for having been one of O.J. Simpson's defense lawyers -- claimed ownership by saying he never actually sold the car to his bodyguard, but only gave it to him for safekeeping. (Spector was convicted of second-degree murder in 2009 and is currently in prison .)\n\n\"Everybody was gonna wanna have a story,\" says Simeone, \"But the judge concluded rightfully that it had already been sold legitimately.\"\n\nModern legend\n\nIt's difficult to say how much the car is worth today, 14 years after that sale.\n\nThe other five Daytonas -- those produced in Italy -- are all in the hands of private collectors, with one sold at auction in 2009 for $7.5 million. It's safe to assume that the CSX2287 would fetch significantly more, since it's the first prototype, it's the last Daytona to have been in competition and -- unlike the others -- it's still in its original state with no parts replaced and no repainting done.\n\nThe CSX2287's interior today, in its original, unrestored condition.

The rest of the paint was dull but intact and all we had to do was get rid of the oxidation, and it came out very decent. The only things that we had to replace ended up being brake lines and a few bits of wiring.\"\n\nPhil Spector's five years of ownership did not mess it up too much either. \"He just had upholstery put it, that's all, and he put some writing on the side of the car, with house paint, but we were able to get that off,\" says Simeone.\n\nThe cars runs well, even on its original tires, and has been driven many times for shows and demonstrations, even though it's no longer raced.\n\n\"We get into a little trouble with some people who think it should, but it's pointless and we'd risk damaging it. We want to preserve it for future generations,\" added Simeone.\n\nA place in history\n\nThe CSX2287 was the very first car -- and one of only seven so far -- to be included in the National Historic Vehicle Register , putting it in the same class as American icons like the Statue of Liberty and the Space Shuttle.\n\n\u201c It was constructed on a shop floor and designed on a sheet of butcher paper \u201d Michael Gessler\n\nIt was also named Car of the Year in 2014 at the International Historic Motoring Awards , the Oscars of classic automobiles -- the first ever American car to even get nominated for the award.\n\n\"It was constructed on a shop floor and designed on a sheet of butcher paper, right at the end of an era when something could be built so simply and win on an international level,\" said Mark Gessler, president of the Historic Vehicle Association\n\nStrikingly designed and with a history that reads like a Hollywood script, this car is the stuff of legend.\n\n\"The iconic forerunner of a winning breed,\" as Simeone defines it, which kick-started America's short but glorious dominance in road racing.", "description": "The Shelby Daytona Cobra Coupe's extraordinary story includes beating Ferrari, bursting up in flames, and spending three decades in a storage unit.", "authors": ["Fred Simeone", "Michael Gessler"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150501111132-shelby-daytona-tease-super-169.jpg", "published_at": "2015-05-01"}
