Suarez has never been whistled by Barcelona supporters, and the club have rarely struggled defensively so much at the start of a season \u2013 still no clean sheets after six games.\n\nIt was after just six minutes when Messi made the first when he curled the corner to the near post and Antoine Griezmann timed his run perfectly ghosting in between Gerard Moreno and Ruben Pena to glance a backward header beyond Sergio Asenjo.\n\nLionel Messi is treated for a thigh injury just before he was taken off at half-time\n\nAntoine Griezmann opened the scoring for Barcelona with his strike on nine minutes\n\nBarca looked set to run riot when Arthur Melo added a second with just 14 minutes played\n\nSanti Cazorla then pulled a goal back for Villarreal on the stroke of half-time at the Nou Camp\n\nIt was Messi's first gift to Griezmann since he's joined and the two celebrated together with no confetti side show this time from the French forward.\n\nMATCH FACTS Barcelona (4-3-3): Ter Stegen; Semedo, Pique, Lenglet, Firpo; Arthur, Busquets, Roberto ( De Jong 63); Griezmann, Suarez (Fati 78), Messi (Dembele 45) Subs not used: Neto, Tobido, Alena, Vidal Goalscorers: Griezmann 6, Arthur 15 Booked: Firpo, Roberto, Busquets, Griezmann Villarreal (4-2-3-1): Asenjo; Quintilla, Torres, Albiol, Pena; Anguissa, Iborra, Ontiverros (Ekambi 57), Cazorla (Bacca 77), Chukwueze; Moreno (Gomez 68) Subs not used: Fernandez, Mori, Morlanes, Ratiu Goalscorers: Cazorla 44 Booked: Albiol, Anguissa\n\nOn the quarter-hour it was two with Arthur Melo scoring from 30 yards out.\n\nSergio Busquets rolled the ball to him and with no back lift the Brazilian hit the back of Asenjo's net \u2013 the keeper caught out by the pace on the shot. Barcelona were 2-0 up without having played too much football.\n\nThe tackles were flying in and Sergi Roberto was booked for going through Cazorla. It would be the former Arsenal midfielder who looked to have brought Villarreal back into it a minute before half time.\n\nFrom Arthur-distance and with Griezmann on his heels ready to dispossess him he left Marc-Andre ter Stegen flapping at fresh air with a left-foot shot that flew past him.\n\nIt was the 10th goal Barcelona had conceded in the league so far this season.\n\nTheir other concern was the sight of Messi down off the pitch needing treatment on his left thigh midway through the first half and Ousmane Dembele came on at the restart.\n\nThe French connection in Barcelona's attack almost clicked immediately. Dembele raced down the right and crossed but Griezmann missed his kick coming in at the far post.\n\nDembele then managed to spin away from Javier Ontiveros and cross from Suarez but he scuffed his shot from close range.\n\nMessi needed treatment on his left thigh after going down early in the first half\n\nBarcelona looked like they might need another goal as Villarreal pressed. Cazorla threaded the ball through to Chukwueze but he delayed his shot and the chance was gone.\n\nTer Stegen then set pulses racing by charging out of his area to dive head the ball out for a throw before Chukwueze could reach it. He then had to get down to his left to save from substitute Moi Gomez.\n\nBarcelona were shuffling over the finish line as opposed to bursting the tape. No-one looked more off the pace than Suarez.\n\nWhen he was taken off with 10 minutes left there were whistles for the fifth highest goalscorer in the club's history \u2013 it was an unwanted first for Barcelona's No 9.\n\nLuis Suarez looked way off the pace before being replaced by wonderkid Ansu Fati\n\nHis replacement was Ansu Fati \u2013 still 16 \u2013 and he immediately flashed a shot over Asenjo's bar. He then went down in the box under minimum contact but penalty appeals were waved away.\n\nIf Messi's exit had almost put Barcelona's fire out, Fati had them smoking again. Every time he touched the ball there was anticipation from the Nou Camp and trepidation from Villarreal.\n\nWith Messi clearly not fit and Suarez struggling for form Barcelona will hope they can find a way to prevent the teenager playing the under-17 World Cup at the end of next month and missing the first Clasico of the season.", "description": "Barcelona got the victory but it wasn't a night for putting all their troubles behind them: Lionel Messi went off with an injured thigh and Luis Suarez was whistled by the Nou Camp.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/22/18888482-0-image-a-9_1569361108887.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
