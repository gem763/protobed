The medal record? \u201cI\u2019m not a number person.\u201d\n\nBiles scored 15.066 on the beam after a near-flawless routine, opting for a simpler dismount than the double-double she performed earlier in the championships.\n\nThat dismount is a sore point for Biles, who introduced the double-double to competition this season and feels the International Gymnastics Federation didn\u2019t reward it with a high enough difficulty rating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth the one-tenth (extra difficulty point). I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just not,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen her score was announced, guaranteeing the medal record, Biles leaped up from her seat with a broad smile and punched the air.\n\n\u201cI was really excited. I thought it was going to be at least a 14.8, 14.9, but to see 15, I was like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s pretty crazy,\u2019 so I was very proud,\u201d she said.\n\nChina took silver and bronze with Liu Tingting on 14.433 and Li Shijia on 14.3, respectively.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise by a full point, scoring 15.133 despite a step out of bounds on one pass, and blew kisses to the audience after finishing her routine. Her U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee took silver, her third medal of the championships, while Angelina Melnikova took bronze for Russia.\n\nBiles\u2019 winning routine came after a long wait when Brazilian gymnast Flavia Saraiva requested an inquiry into her score, during which time Biles sat on the edge of the floor.\n\nBiles has won five events at these world championships after team gold Tuesday, individual all-around gold Thursday and vault gold Saturday.\n\nA fifth place on uneven bars Saturday ended Biles\u2019 chances of winning a medal in all six events, which she did last year in her comeback world championships after a sabbatical in 2017.\n\nBiles hasn\u2019t confirmed whether she\u2019ll continue to compete after next year\u2019s Olympics, so this could be her last world championships. Blowing kisses to the crowd wasn\u2019t meant as a goodbye to the world championships, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a good floor routine, farewell to just the end of this world championship chapter here in Stuttgart,\u201d she said.\n\nOf her 24 career world medals, 18 are gold, against 12 of 23 for Scherbo.\n\nEarlier, Russia\u2019s Nikita Nagornyy won the men\u2019s vault for his third gold medal of the championships. He\u2019s the first European man to win the vault since 2010.\n\nNagornyy scored an average 14.966 from his two vaults, beating his friend and Russian teammate Artur Dalaloyan into second place. The bronze went to Ukraine\u2019s Igor Radivilov.\n\nThe 38-year-old Romanian Marian Dragulescu, a four-time world champion, secured qualification for his fifth Olympics by placing fourth.\n\nBritain won its second gold of the championships as Joe Fraser scored 15 points to win on parallel bars. Ahmet \u00d6nder was second for Turkey, with Japan\u2019s Kazuma Kaya third. Max Whitlock won Britain\u2019s first gold medal Saturday on pommel horse.\n\nArthur Mariano won gold for Brazil on the high bar, scoring 14.9 ahead of Tin Srbic for Croatia. Dalaloyan took the bronze to end the championships with four medals.", "description": "The gymnast made history and broke her own record by winning 25 world medals at the competition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da341902100002a0dacd750.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
