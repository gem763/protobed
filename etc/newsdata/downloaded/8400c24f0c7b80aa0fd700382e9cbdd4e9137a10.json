Make necessary bookings ahead of time such as blood tests and vaccinations. Emigration laws tend to be quite strict, and the last thing you want is to be forced to leave your pet behind because you failed to schedule a microchipping procedure.\n\nFind a pet relocation specialist to enquire about travel rules and regulations to be on the safe side. Get as much information as you can from specialists, as Google wont be a sufficient source of information this late in the game.\n\n(Photo: iStock)\n\nMicrochip your pet\n\nAny pet parent's worst nightmare is losing their baby - imagine while on the move! Microchipping your pet is of the utmost importance and a prerequisite for emigration.\n\nWhoever finds the animal will be able to locate the owner from the chip - so even if your precious disappears, you can be certain that it will be found and returned.\n\nGet the correct vaccinations, blood tests and health certificates\n\nEvery international destination requires up-to-date documentation about rabies and other blood tests, which can also help save your pet's life.\n\nOther countries demand that you test the animal within a specific period of entry for dogs and cats - specifically the Rabies Neutralising Antibody Titre Test (RNATT). Your pet travel specialist will be able to confirm whether the governing authorities of your destination require health certification and can help you attain them in time.\n\nOften a licensed vet will have to test a pet upon 10 days of entry to complete the \"veterinary certification\"\n\nFind the best airline and flight route\n\nChoosing an airline that has pet policies in place is important to ensure your pet's safety. Your designated pet travel specialist will be able to assist you with finding the most suitable airline for your furry family member.\n\nFlying to an international destination can take a long time and you want your pet to be as comfortable as possible, so invest in a safe and specialised travel crate for your pet.\n\nWATCH: New York's Ark airport terminal, exclusive to animals, going to the dogs\n\n(Photo: iStock)\n\nConsider quarantine periods\n\nCountries like China, the United Kingdom and Europe at large have stripped away their quarantine regulations and pets are welcome at any time, but other destinations still require pets to be quarantined for a short time upon arrival.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have a quarantine period of 10 days, while Mauritius has the longest period - 30 days. The thought can be frightening, but professional associations like the International Pet Animal Transportation Association (IPATA) and other animal relocation specialists are there to help you make sense of this necessary ordeal to protect both you and your pet - as well as other people's pets.\n\nKnow the ins and outs of international pet travel and enjoy a fresh start with your favorite companion.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing-up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
