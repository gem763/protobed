And Trump\u2019s geographic flubs have often been much more substantial than a slip of the tongue.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim Wednesday that the border wall was being built in Colorado (which borders New Mexico but not Mexico) is merely the latest example of him failing pretty simple geography or at least geography that you\u2019d expect a president to know.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike \u201c57 states,\u201d it might have just been a momentary mix-up \u2014 one that we probably shouldn\u2019t read too much into! \u2014 but it\u2019s hardly alone.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called Belgium \u201ca beautiful city,\u201d even though it\u2019s a country.\n\nHe also tweeted about violence in Paris and then declared, \u201cGermany is a total mess-big crime.\"\n\nMan shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2016\n\nHe has reportedly expressed surprise that Nepal and Bhutan were countries, rather than parts of India, and he also pronounced them \u201cnipple\u201d and \u201cbutton.\u201d\n\nThere was the time he pronounced Tanzania, \u201cTan-ZAY-nee-uh,\u201d like Tasmania (or the cartoon \u201cTaz-Mania\u201d). It\u2019s pronounced \u201cTan-zuh-NEE-uh.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s troubles with Africa didn\u2019t stop there. One of his most famous flubs was referring to the country of \u201cNambia\u201d \u2014 twice. Aides clarified that he was referring to Namibia, not Zambia or Gambia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s other flubs or potential flubs in this arena include referring to Paradise, Calif., as \u201cPleasure\u201d twice during the wildfires there. He has referred to the Persian Gulf as the \u201cArabian Gulf.\u201d (That might have been deliberately provocative \u2014 a dig at Iran \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t appear to be U.S. government policy; the White House still refers to it as the Persian Gulf.)\n\nThe French newspaper Le Monde has reported that Trump accused the leaders of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of being responsible for the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The leaders apparently deduced that he had mixed up \u201cBaltic\u201d with \u201cBalkan.\u201d (The Baltics border the Baltic Sea in northern Europe, while the Balkans are much further south, near the former Yugoslavia.)\n\nTrump reportedly did this despite first lady Melania Trump hailing from Slovenia, which used to be part of Yugoslavia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s most persistent struggle with European geography, though, has to do with the United Kingdom. Trump has repeatedly suggested that the \u201cUnited Kingdom,\u201d \u201cGreat Britain\u201d and \u201cEngland\u201d might be interchangeable and that one or the other might have simply fallen out of favor in contemporary usage.\n\n\u201cI have great respect for the U.K., United Kingdom. Great respect,\u201d Trump said in August 2018. \u201cPeople call it Britain. They call it Great Britain. They used to call it England, different parts.\u201d\n\n\"I have great respect for the U.K. United Kingdom. Great respect. People call it Britain. They call it Great Britain.

Trump then insisted that he knew the difference, but \u201ca lot of people\u201d don\u2019t:\n\nAD\n\nTRUMP: You have different names \u2014 you can say \u201cEngland,\u201d you can say \u201cUK,\u201d you can say \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d so many different \u2014 you know you have, you have so many different names \u2014 Great Britain. I always say: \u201cWhich one do you prefer? Great Britain? You understand what I\u2019m saying?\u2019 MORGAN: You know Great Britain and the United Kingdom aren\u2019t exactly the same thing? TRUMP: Right, yeah. You know I know, but a lot of people don\u2019t know that. But you have lots of different names. The fact is you make great product, you make great things. Even your farm product is so fantastic.\n\nDuring the same trip, Trump disclosed that he had quizzed new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the differences.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have been with, I guess I would start out by saying England, right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, I asked Boris, where\u2019s England? What is happening with England? They don\u2019t use it too much anymore, we talked about it. It was very interesting.\u201d\n\nThe White House has also mixed this up, tweeting that Trump was departing the U.K. even though he was leaving England for Scotland. For those unfamiliar, England is the largest state in both the U.K. and Great Britain. \u201cGreat Britain\u201d incorporates Wales and Scotland, while the \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d adds those two and Northern Ireland. (There are many other intricacies, but those are the basics.)\n\nAD\n\nEven residents of the U.K. apparently mix these things up from time to time. And politicians are hardly immune from such flubs. There is a long history of world leaders, for example, referring to the continent of Africa as a \u201ccountry.\u201d Trump\u2019s failures, though, are particularly conspicuous given he leads a party that was so joyous that the last guy misspoke about the number of states in the United States.\n\nThere are many times during the Trump presidency where we could have asked, \u201cWhat if Obama did this?\u201d In this case, we pretty much know the answer.\n\nAD", "description": "His flub on Colorado and the border wall wasn't the first.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yEKffnW4XW5jXTelGQqzsOYP8-w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I4RYSYCLHEI6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
