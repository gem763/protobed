This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and 'packing' - how things fit together. Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour.

Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water. Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae grows on the plastic.

They also looked at other sub-lineages across various locations in Africa to see how closely they were related.\n\nThe researchers then combined genetics with geology and climatic physics, to paint a picture of what the world looked like 200,000 years ago.\n\nGeological evidence suggests the homeland region once housed Africa\u2019s largest ever lake system, known as Lake Makgadikgadi which was double the size of modern Lake Victoria.\n\nAnd climate computer model simulations indicate that \u201cthe slow wobble of Earth\u2019s axis\u201d brought \u201cperiodic shifts in rainfall\u201d across the region.\n\nProfessor Axel Timmermann, a climate scientist at Pusan National University in South Korea, said: \u201cThese shifts in climate would have opened green, vegetated corridors, first 130,000 years ago to the northeast, and then around 110,000 years ago to the southwest, allowing our earliest ancestors to migrate away from the homeland for the first time.\u201d\n\nProfessor Hayes said: \u201cWe observed significant genetic divergence in the modern humans\u2019 earliest maternal sub-lineages that indicates our ancestors migrated out of the homeland between 130,000 and 110,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe first migrants ventured northeast, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled southwest. A third population remained in the homeland until today.\u201d\n\nResearchers believe that the humans who migrated southwest flourished and experienced steady population growth. They say this could be due to an adaptation to marine foraging.\n\n\u201cThese first migrants left behind a homeland population,\u201d said Professor Hayes.\n\n\u201cEventually adapting to the drying lands, maternal descendants of the homeland population can be found in the greater Kalahari region today.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "Scientists have pinpointed a fertile river valley in northern\u00a0Botswana\u00a0as the ancestral home of all human beings.\u00a0 The earliest anatomically modern humans\u00a0(Homo sapiens) arose 200,000 years ago in a vast wetland south of the Zambezi river which was the cradle of all mankind, a new study has revealed.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/20/10/breaking-news.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
