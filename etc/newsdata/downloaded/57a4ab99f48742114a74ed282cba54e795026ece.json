It's like living a nightmare, I feel so alone - I don't feel in control in any way.\n\n\"I've been to the police, and to the letting agency but it seems no-one knows what to do. The tenants have had an eviction notice, and that's it.\n\n\"Now, I feel like I'm stuck with no help - I can't even afford the plane fare home.\n\n\"Living in Spain was supposed to be my dream, but it couldn't be any further from that.\"\n\n(Image: HELEN FRANCE/ CATERS NEWS)\n\n(Image: HELEN FRANCE/ CATERS NEWS)\n\nLetting agent Compass Property Services helped Ms France find the tenants originally, but faced difficulties when they tried to evict them from the property.\n\nThe company's owner Peter James said: \"Helen signed with us in September 2017 and requested that we find a long term tenant, which we did in January 2018.\n\n\"Yet the tenants quickly stopped paying the bills and it was decided to inform the tenant that if they did not pay the outstanding bills then a letter of termination would be served.\n\n\"This was done when the tenant came to pay the rent but refused to pay for the electricity.\n\n\"A letter of termination was given on the spot giving the tenant one month's notice to vacate, as stated in the rental agreement.\n\n\"During the one month's notice we was in talks with Helen's solicitor and provided all the necessary and requested documents required for the solicitor to start the legal eviction process just in case the tenants did not vacate on the specified date.\n\n\"This is an example of the worst case scenario of what can happen - Spanish law and procedures are different than that in the UK.\n\n\"Any eviction process has to go through the courts via a solicitor and we assist the solicitor by providing any documentation that they may need.\n\n\"Unfortunately Spanish law leans heavily towards the tenant rather than the owner.\n\n\"This is a horrible on-going situation in which we will help in any legal way that we can.\n\n\"On average, 97 per cent of tenants are good, honest people but you do get the odd tenant that is not all that they seem.\n\n\"Anyone looking at buying abroad needs to make sure they have full understanding and aren't going in blind - they need to have their eyes wide open.\"", "description": "Single mum, Helen France, from Rotherham, said her dream Spanish home in Alicante was turned into a 'living nightmare' after squatters robbed her and left her with a \u00a350K debt", "authors": ["Kaisha Langton", "Image", "Helen France", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571726.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-SQUATTERS-TOOK-OVER-MY-HOLIDAY-HOME.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
