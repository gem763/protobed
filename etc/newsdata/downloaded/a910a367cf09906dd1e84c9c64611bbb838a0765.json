I got the street credibility. The videos, the music, the protection - all of the above.\"\n\nThe testimony in federal court in Manhattan was a dramatic turnabout for a performer who had gone out of his way to portray himself as a legitimate gang member. He told the jury he decided to cooperate only a day after his arrest last year on a racketeering indictment naming him as a member of the gang - a move that has put him at risk behind bars and prompted rap icon Snoop Dogg to label him a \"snitch\" in a recent Instagram post.\n\nSupport: Nicki Minaj shows love for Tekashi 6ix9ine following arrest: 'I am praying for you'\n\nOn trial are Aljermiah Mack and Anthony Ellison, described by prosecutors as two high-ranking members of a gang that terrorized city streets with drug-dealing and gunfire. They say that after a falling out with 6ix9ine, Ellison took revenge by abducting and robbing the rapper.\n\nRapper Daniel Hernandez, known as Tekashi 6ix9ine, performs in Milan, Italy, Sept. 21, 2018. More\n\nBoth defendants have denied the charges, with an attorney for Ellison portraying the alleged kidnapping as a publicity stunt.\n\n6ix9ine, 23, was a social media phenomenon with millions of followers on Instagram before becoming an ascendant name in hip-hop. He had a multiplatinum hit song, \"Fefe,\" with Nicki Minaj, which peaked at No. 3 on the pop charts, and \"Stoopid,\" featuring the incarcerated rapper Bobby Shmurda.\n\nWith prosecutors referring to him by his legal name, Daniel Hernandez, 6ix9ine testified on Tuesday that he was a high-school dropout and deli worker when he launched his rap career. He said he began inviting gang members to be extras in his videos for \"Gummo\" and other hit songs, he said, \"because I wanted the aesthetic to be full of Nine Trey.\"\n\nProsecutors showed the jury portions of the videos so that 6ix9nine could identify various gang members, some seen on tape flashing guns and hand signs, and explain lyrics to songs that he said were often meant to taunt \"somebody I didn't get along with.\"\n\nWhen the videos blew up on the internet, \"I knew I had a formula,\" he said.\n\n6ix9ine admitted in a guilty plea this year that he joined the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and helped try to kill a rival gang member.\n\nWith the plea deal, 6ix9ine can gain leniency at sentencing from what otherwise would have been a mandatory minimum 47 years in prison if he admits all crimes and testifies truthfully when summoned.\n\nHe's to return to the witness stand on Wednesday.\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Tekashi 6ix9ine testifies for prosecution, Snoop labels him a 'snitch'", "description": "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine\u00a0is testifying against two reputed members of a violent New York City street gang as Snoop labels him a \"snitch.\"", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z2zSdqmz_tSGsiSNVF2.xQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/c61ee514681774ef4fd6341f2aec81a0", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
