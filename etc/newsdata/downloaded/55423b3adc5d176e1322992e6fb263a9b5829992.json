That\u2019s just his style.\u201d\n\nAfter spinning from contact with Hamlin with 40 laps remaining, Logano approached Hamlin in the postrace pits. They civilly exchanged words for a minute before Logano gave Hamlin a shot in the right shoulder. Hamlin went after Logano but was stopped by No. 22 crew chief Todd Gordon and PR representative Kyle Zimmerman as a scuffle erupted between their teams.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI understand him coming over and talking, and I was standing there and having a discussion with him,\u201d Hamlin told reporters in the postrace bullpen. \u201cEverything was fine. I think he didn\u2019t get me agitated enough. So he said something and then pokes a little bit and then runs away trying to get me to come (after him) so he could hide behind his guys.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in the 2019 playoffs that Logano has angered Hamlin, who called the Team Penske driver \u201can idiot\u201d after the Oct. 6 race at Dover International Speedway for racing hard while 24 laps down.\n\nThey openly feuded during the 2013 season (starting after the Daytona 500), including a similar scuffle between their teams after the March 17, 2013 race at Bristol Motor Speedway. A week later, Hamlin suffered a broken back while racing Logano for the lead on the last lap at Auto Club Speedway.\n\nDuring an interview with NBCSN\u2019s Parker Kligerman, Hamlin openly mocked Logano\u2019s mannerisms in saying, \u201cHe probably would say, \u2018Oh, short-track racing!'\u201d and added, \u201cSo that\u2019s Joey. Scared.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Joe Gibbs Racing driver said short-track racing was the simple explanation for how they got together shortly after a Lap 456 restart in which Logano started on the outside lane in fourth with Hamlin in fifth on the next row in the inside lane.\n\nAfter being squeezed into the wall, Logano picked up a tire rub on his No. 22 Ford. He spun without making contact and brought out a yellow that helped him make a pit stop and rally for eighth after dropping to 19th with 40 laps left.\n\n\u201cWe got together, and he cut a tire, which is very unfortunate for him but was not malicious by any means, but it just happened,\u201d said Hamlin, who finished fourth. \u201cI got tight off the corner, we made contact. It was going to be nothing more than a rub, but it looked like he cut a tire there. That part was unfortunate. We\u2019re in tight confines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be contact here and there. (Brad Keselowski) was beating the shit out of my rear bumper all day long. Jacking me sideways. Cutting me off. It\u2019s just part of this whole thing. You got to just understand. Logano\u2019s got to understand that not everything goes his way.\u201d\n\nNASCAR officials met after the fracas with Team Penske competition director Travis Geisler, No. 22 crew chief Todd Gordon and an unnamed Penske crew member who grabbed Hamlin. A spokesman said any penalties could be issued as early as Monday.\n\nSaid Hamlin\u2019s crew chief, Chris Gabehart, who helped separate the drivers: \u201cIt\u2019s just hard racing at Martinsville. Logano wanted to talk about it then he kind of walked away and took a cheap shot and Denny wasn\u2019t good with that. We\u2019re all good and we\u2019ll go to Texas and race.\u201d\n\nHamlin said he thought things with Logano were settled.\n\n\u201cI mean, we did talk,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cYeah, I told him that it was my fault. I came up the racetrack. We made contact obviously.\n\n\u201cBut the end part is his fault. We can have (another) discussion. I had a discussion with him over two to three times about him blocking me and what is he doing at Dover and this that the other thing. That\u2019s a discussion that men have, but he handles it differently because he\u2019s immature.\u201d", "description": "Hamlin takes issue with how Logano approached him in postrace altercation that led to a scuffle between their teams.", "authors": ["Nate Ryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ld2dLrWd_drNyXksFv3i6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RiKkupzEXaeB_yKf1KXKYA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/fe9149d08e5d53afdb5cc685500bbafa", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
