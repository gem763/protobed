Ms Guiffre also claims she was forced to have sex with Brunel several times. Brunel denies both allegations.\n\nHis lawyer Corinne Dreyfus-Schmidt said Mr Brunel \"firmly contests accusations in the press\" and \"will reserve his statements for justice officials.\"\n\nOn Monday Ms Dreyfus-Schmidt, said that her client has notified the Paris prosecutor's office that he is at the disposition of judicial officials.\n\nHe did so before French officials opened a full investigation into the Epstein case.
