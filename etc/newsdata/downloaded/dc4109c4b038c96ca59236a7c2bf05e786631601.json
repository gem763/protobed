He says that the BBKTC and its subsidiaries should be placed under administration and that criminal charges should be considered against some of the custodians of the entities.\n\n\u201cThe basis upon which the financial information of the BBKTC has been presented warrants a reasonable conclusion that the financial affairs of BBKTC have been conducted in a reckless manner,\u201d reads one of the conclusions contained in the document.\n\nPapadakis writes that representations contained in management reports had been made with \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d of their veracity.\n\nThe report details how a large web of companies, most of them wholly owned by the BBKTC, were mismanaged over a number of years.\n\nVarious management reports and unsigned financial statements show that the BBKTC had 11 sources of income over the eight years ending 2013, and that they earned a total of R929 million.\n\nPapadakis mentions loans being made to one of the directors without there being any evidence of repayment, reckless loans being made to related entities and discrepancies between management reports and annual financial reports for most of the council\u2019s subsidiary companies.\n\nBy the end of 2015, outside the holding group, BBKTC owned R154 million in shares in six other companies, including free-to-air television company Siyaya.\n\nNorth West Premier Supra Mahumapelo established the commission of inquiry into the traditional leadership disputes in respect of the Bakgatla Ba Kgafela community in 2016.\n\nIt was chaired by Judge George Maluleke, until his death in August 2017. Advocate Sesi Baloyi then took over from him.\n\nAnother company that raised the commission\u2019s eyebrows when the report was presented, was BBK Financial Services. It was offering financial services, allegedly under another company\u2019s licence, but was not registered with the Financial Services Board (FSB).\n\nAccording to the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services (Fais) Act, this amounts to an offence under section 36, offences and penalties, reads the report.\n\nJabhile Mbele, FSB head of Fais registration, told City Press that the company was not listed on their system.\n\nQuestions sent to Kgosi Nyalala Pilane went unanswered. BBKTC spokesperson Nonnie Letsholo said it was too early to comment.\n\n\u201cWe are unable to respond to your questions as the matter is before the commission, which has not yet made its findings. Once the commission is concluded it will consider representations from all stakeholders. It will therefore be premature to make any comments at this stage.\u201d\n\nThe commission received another report last week, from auditors SizweNtsalubaGobodo, which confirmed a number of matters contained in the Papadakis report.\n\nThis document, compiled by the company\u2019s Itumeleng Serithi, details how a temporary pass-through account held by Johannesburg-based law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, received more than R1.5 billion in deposits, including from three major transactions. However, it was then drained of funds until it was left with a balance of R60.\n\n\u201cBBKTC have not accounted for the majority of transactions processed from the escrow account,\u201d Serithi states in his report.\n\nThe commission is sitting in Rustenburg and is expected to conclude its work at the end of this month.\n\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER", "description": "The traditional council should be placed under administration and those in charge of its companies face criminal charges \u2013 forensic report.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5487/db7af7c6a8de4a4faf0cfeb0abe0e325.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-25"}
