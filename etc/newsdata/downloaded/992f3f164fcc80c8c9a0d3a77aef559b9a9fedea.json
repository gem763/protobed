She spoke in private\u2014to her lawyers, to her kids, to police, to investigators. But when reporters reached out for interviews, she declined. The mother of five didn\u2019t want to talk about her son, Gemmel Moore, about how he was found dead from an overdose in the West Hollywood home of political donor, Ed Buck, about how Los Angeles prosecutors failed to press charges for two years and 52 days. Part of that was distance\u2014Nixon lives in Texas\u2014but mostly, she\u2019s just a private person. Gemmel was too.\n\n\u201cIf he could come back, he would say, \u2018Ma, I don\u2019t have any privacy anymore,\u2019\u201d Nixon said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, the first time she\u2019s spoken publicly since Moore\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m under a microscope.\u201d\n\nNixon was at the West Hollywood Park Auditorium, just blocks from where her son had been found two years earlier. Moore was the first of three men to overdose\u2014two fatally\u2014in Buck\u2019s apartment since 2017.\n\nLast week, Buck was arrested on a federal criminal complaint that accused him of injecting low-income black men with lethal doses of methamphetamine as part of a sexual fetish. The wealthy 65-year-old, who has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic politicians across California, faces 20 years to life in prison if convicted of the charge of administering drugs resulting in a death. He\u2019s also charged in a state complaint with running a drug den. His attorney has in the past denied he played any role in the overdoses.\n\nAt the press conference, Jasmyne Cannick, a journalist and activist who has investigated Buck, asked Nixon: \u201cWhen you found out Ed Buck was arrested, how did you feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt\u2014finally. Finally. Finally,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cWe had been screaming for so long and no one listened. Finally someone listened. Finally.\u201d\n\nThe press conference unfolded just hours after Nixon\u2019s attorneys, Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk, filed a second amended complaint in their wrongful death civil suit against Buck, the County of Los Angeles, L.A. County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, and assistant DA Craig Hum. The new document added two claims against Lacey and Hum, accusing them of conspiracy to deprive constitutional rights and violation of civil rights.\n\nAccording to Nixon and her advocates, they personally identified, interviewed, and vetted seven men who had stories of forced injection by Buck, along with three witnesses who saw it happen. The attorneys allege that beginning around Sept. 13, 2017, they escorted these men to be interviewed by the Sheriff\u2019s Department and lodge complaints. All seven of the men\u2014six of whom were black, one of whom was white\u2014recalled being solicited for sex by Buck and then injected with crystal methamphetamine. According to the lawsuit, neither Lacey nor Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva read or even heard about these complaints. On July 26, 2018, Lacey declined to prosecute Buck.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the federal charges includes the accounts of all of these men shows that the county failed in its obligation,\u201d Turk told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take seriously the complaints of black gay men... The fact that it took two years to investigate their claims is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nAt the press conference last week, Lacey claimed that the district attorney\u2019s investigation did not have sufficient information to charge Buck until recently, when a third overdose victim came forward and provided credible testimony. Nixon found the claim offensive.\n\n\u201cI was so happy that the feds came in and snatched [the investigation] from Jackie Lacey,\u201d Nixon told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI want to say a whole lot, but I\u2019ll be nice. Jackie Lacey dragged her feet. It appalled me when I watched the press conference. I didn\u2019t even watch it all the way through, I was so appalled. She tried to take credit for our work. It was our whole team that did this. If we had let it die, we wouldn\u2019t have been here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nixon, Moore and many of the victims they escorted to authorities had already reported Buck\u2019s behavior to police even before then.\n\n\u201cGemmel told me about Mr. Buck years ago, back in 2016,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe story just seemed so crazy, I didn\u2019t believe it. But then when he called me crying, I knew something was wrong. So I did tell him to go to the police station and the hospital. He went to the police station. They told him to get out.\u201d\n\nNixon and Moore were originally from Los Angeles. But a few years back, Nixon, a mother of five, moved to Texas to be closer to her sister. Moore decided to stay in Los Angeles. \u201cI would talk to Gemmel all the time. We were close. He had visited a couple times. Every couple of months,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was here right before he came back here and was murdered.\u201d\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Nixon received a phone call from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cI immediately knew something was wrong,\u201d she said. The day before, Moore had flown to Los Angeles from Texas on a flight paid for by Buck. He died hours after arriving. \u201cThe coroner told me my son was found naked, dead on the mattress at Edward Buck\u2019s house,\u201d his mother recalled. \u201cThe name didn\u2019t click. I called around to his friends and they\u2019re the ones that said \u2018Ed buck.\u2019 Then it clicked.\u201d\n\nNixon spoke to Moore\u2019s father and tried to figure out what they could do.\u201dI kept calling the coroner, the Sheriff\u2019s Department, asking them to investigate because I knew something was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery parent knows their child, and Gemmel was scared of needles.\u201d\n\nNixon went on to describe Moore. \u201cHe loved to cook,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish you could have met him. He was hilarious. He had so many jokes. I know he was working in the legal field. He had a lot of aspirations. He was just trying to figure it out.\u201d\n\nNixon brought several of Moore\u2019s close friends to the press conference: Cory McLean, Jerome Kitchen, and David Cunningham. Cunningham, a prominent West Hollywood activist, has been pushing for an investigation into Buck since Moore\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe main reason Ed Buck was able to elude any justice is because he was a white man,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cIn order for people from our community to feel safe, we have to turn predators...I was a sex worker before. I was addicted to drugs. I walked this life with Gemmel, and the Gemmel I knew would never use drugs.\u201d\n\nThe federal complaint filed last week painted a disturbing picture of Buck, whom the victims interviewed by prosecutors called \u201cDr. Kevorkian.\u201d It described a man willing to risk the lives of his sexual partners for thrills, even after Moore\u2019s death. Timothy Dean, the second man to die in Buck\u2019s home, was found in January. And the third man\u2019s overdose, which triggered Buck\u2019s arrest, happened Sept. 11.\n\nFederal authorities have made clear Buck could face further charges. Nixon said that\u2019s what she has been asking for all along.\n\n\u201cMy son died here,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen all the cameras go away, I have to deal with the fact that my son is not here. I can\u2019t touch him. I can\u2019t hug him. I can\u2019t talk to him. My son died here. My child, that I birthed out of my body. All I have is memories. You may see me looking like I have it all together. I am dying. A piece of me died.\u201d", "description": "Gemmel Moore was the first of three men to overdose in the political donor\u2019s apartment.
