They even call him 'Tekashi Snitch 9ine.'\"\n\nSnoop Dogg posted a picture on Instagram calling 6ix9ine a \"snitch\" - and Meek Mill commented on it calling him a \"ratgoon\".\n\nTekashi 6ix9ine has evaded jail time on previous charges, including child sex offences in 2015.\n\nIn 2018, he was charged with six offences including racketeering, carrying a firearm, assault with a dangerous weapon, and conspiracy murder charges.\n\nRacketeering is when people use criminal actions to repeatedly take money from others.\n\nHe initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, before entering a plea bargain with the US government later on - that's when he started giving evidence against former fellow gang members.\n\nThat could dramatically reduce his prison time.\n\n\"Whether or not he is going to be given leniency with his sentencing remains to be seen,\" Lisa Evers tells Newsbeat.\n\n\"It's a big deal because he's looking at 47 years to life in prison.\"\n\nShe adds: \"Once he comes out [of prison], he may be given a new identity, but how's he going to be given a new identity with that 69 tattoo on his forehead?\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Two members of the Nine Trey Bloods gang are found guilty after 6ix9ine testified against them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/116AA/production/_109083317_gettyimages-1026079268.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
