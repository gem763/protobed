The \"cone of uncertainty\"\n\nfor the storm appeared to have been crudely altered with a black marker to indicate that the state was within the potential track.\n\nOn Monday, The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that the NOAA rebuke defending Trump was the result of threats from Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to fire top agency employees unless they sided with the president.\n\nThe newspaper said Ross, \"phoned Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, from Greece where the secretary was traveling for meetings and instructed Dr. Jacobs to fix the agency's perceived contradiction of the president.\"\n\nThe department denies the events described in the story took place.\n\n\"The New York Times story is false,\" a spokesman said in an emailed statement to NPR. \"Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\"\n\nDespite the denial, Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, called for Ross to resign.\n\n\"His direct attacks on the scientists and federal employees, whom he threatened to fire for doing their jobs by accurately reporting the weather, are an embarrassing new low for a member of this Cabinet which has been historically venal and incompetent,\" Beyer, a Democrat who sits on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said in a statement.\n\nBeyer accused Ross of \"rampant corruption\" and added that he \"does not deserve the trust of the American people or a place in the Cabinet and he should be dismissed immediately.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the issue is causing frustration among meteorologists and forecasters attending a national conference in Huntsville, Ala., this week where there are rumors of a potential protest, according to WBHM reporter Mary Scott Hodgin.\n\n\"In recent years, too many things are politicized, that shouldn't be. Gravity is gravity. Heat is heat,\" Alan Sealls, a meteorologist from Mobile said.\n\nNOAA's McLean is expected to address the conference on Tuesday.", "description": "It \"was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political,\" the agency's acting chief scientist wrote.", "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/09/ap_19252729944824_wide-872d1329790b4071655d76fef07fc7d2c6346add.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
