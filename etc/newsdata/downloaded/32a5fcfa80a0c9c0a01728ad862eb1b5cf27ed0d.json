Tutankhamun show breaks French visitor record", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "A vast touring show of treasures linked to Egypt\u2019s boy-king Tutankhamun has attracted more than 1.3 million visitors in Paris, becoming the most-visited exhibition in French history.\n\nThe show, based at a vast space at La Villette before it arrives at the Saatchi Gallery in London in November, has beaten France\u2019s previous record of 1.2 million visitors in 1967 for a much smaller Tutankhamun exhibition at the Petit Palais.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An ancient statuette of Ptah.

More than 130,000 tickets had been sold before doors opened in March.\n\nBut French cultural commentators said the record-breaking turnout also testified to an enduring fascination with the Egyptian pharaoh\u2019s tomb as well as the notion of life after death.\n\nThe show features the largest number of Tutankhamum treasures ever to leave Egypt and it will be the last time they can be seen on tour before they are permanently displayed at the vast new Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The guardian statue.\n\nOne key attraction in the exhibition is the guardian statue that guarded the burial chamber. The 150 objects on show include a gold inlaid miniature coffin that contained the king\u2019s liver after it was removed during the mummification process, a gilded wooden bed with carved lion feet, probably made specially for Tutankhamun\u2019s funeral, and a gilded wooden shrine showing intimate scenes of royal domestic harmony.\n\nThierry Vincenti, the head of IMG France which organised the Paris show, told French radio: \u201cThe fact that the Grand Egyptian Museum being built at Giza will host these artefacts at the end of the tour is important. There is a sense of this being the last time people would be able to see these objects on tour.\n\n\u201cWe hoped to get 1 million people. To beat that and get this turnout is exceptional,\u201d he said.\n\nThe current Tutankhamun exhibition, and the previous 1967 Tutankhamun show are now Paris\u2019s most visited exhibitions. A blockbuster display dedicated to the impressionist painter Claude Monet at the Grand Palais in 2010 attracted about 911,000 visitors.\n\nThe Tutankhamun tour, which began in Los Angeles, marks the upcoming centenary of the discovery of the young pharaoh\u2019s tomb, considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time.\n\nThe British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the tomb of the 18th-dynasty monarch in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor in 1922. The tomb was untouched and included about 5,000 artefacts.", "description": "Display heading to London has had 1.3 million visitors, beating 50-year-old record held by previous Tut show", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a896ed190ac834160256793e35a6346b0555d0b/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=579dc4b26e7aca83597ab32e80310843"}
