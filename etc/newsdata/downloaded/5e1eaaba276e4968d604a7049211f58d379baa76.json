The spinner was seen repeatedly wiping his glasses between deliveries.\n\n\u201cExperience tells me, when you\u2019re doing well people try and pick holes in you,\u201d Langer told reporters. \u201cI was there, I know the truth, they were talking about Chris Rogers who was here four years ago and that is actually the truth.\n\n\u201cChris Rogers is a great mate of the squad and that\u2019s what it was about. People can make of it what they like, we can\u2019t do anything about what people make of it.\n\n\u201cI think everyone in this room, everyone around the world has seen the great spirit the World Cup and this series have been played in. There\u2019s been great spirit throughout... People can make of it as they like but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nWhile Smith is the leading scorer in the series with 671 runs in three tests, team mate David Warner has struggled, scoring only 79 runs in eight innings with three ducks. However, Langer said he was not worried about the opening batsman\u2019s form.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine... Davey hasn\u2019t had a great series, there\u2019s no secrets about that. But he\u2019s also a world class player,\u201d Langer added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said throughout the whole series if Davey has one good innings it will help us win the Ashes. He probably hasn\u2019t been through this lean run before, so it\u2019s going to be a good test of his character and we know what a great player he is.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a huge World Cup, he had a huge IPL... He\u2019s a world class player, he\u2019s a match winner. He\u2019s been brilliant around the group since he\u2019s been back.\u201d\n\nThe final test at the Oval in London begins on Thursday.", "description": "Australia's Steve Smith was impersonating their bespectacled former opening batsman Chris Rogers by donning glasses after winning the fourth test at Old Trafford and not mocking England spinner Jack Leach, coach Justin Langer said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428410759&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891UE", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
