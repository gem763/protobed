In 1991, her immediate family managed to get out of the shattered capital, Monrovia, and survived, but a dozen relatives starved to death.\n\nCivilians were attacked, child soldiers recruited and ethnic groups were targeted in that war, setting a pattern for many of the wars that were to follow on the African continent. Hundreds of thousands of people died.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rustonlyn Dennis giving a speech during her electoral campaign.

But decades later, a thorough reckoning has still not been had. The recommendations of Liberia\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), published in 2009, have never been implemented, and former rebels and their associates have held some of the country\u2019s highest offices.\n\nThe country\u2019s president, George Weah, appears to be changing tack, however, writing to parliament in September to ask for advice on implementing the TRC recommendations including setting up the war crimes court that activists have long demanded, and telling the UN the country needs \u201cclosure\u201d on the wounds of 14 years of war \u2013 though he stopped short of openly supporting the establishment of the war crimes court.\n\nDennis has been instrumental in pushing for a resolution on a bill calling for the establishment of such a court, hailed as one of Liberia\u2019s first steps towards addressing the legacy of the civil wars.\n\n\u201cI feel all those souls that were lost \u2013 we should account for it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold perpetrators accountable, we will have another war. People fought the war because of corruption, nepotism and greed. These things are happening again.\u201d\n\nDennis says she has faced threats from former warlords because of her fight to bring perpetrators of past human rights violations to justice.\n\nMomentum has built, with groups such as the Traditional Chiefs Council gradually coming on board. One of the recommendations of a recently held three-day National Economic Dialogue was to set up the court. At least 52 lawmakers signed the resolution, giving it the requisite support of two-thirds of the House of Representatives. However, recently the Speaker refused to include it on the House agenda, saying that members needed more time to consult their constituents.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest After prolonged civil war, Liberians set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

Rustonlyn Dennis, politician\n\nAlthough he said he was at a loss to understand why there was such clamour for the court now and not before, he said: \u201cIt is important to bring closure to the wounds from the 14 years of Liberia\u2019s brutal civil war \u2026 we need to agree on a mechanism that will guarantee the sustenance of peace, stability, justice and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nReturning to Liberia from the UN general assembly, however, Weah appeared to backtrack, saying that he had merely informed the UN about the calls for a court, not supported one himself. \u201cI have never one day called for the war-crimes court,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should we focus on the war crimes court now, when we did not focus on it 12 years ago?\u201d\n\nTo win the 2017 election, Weah relied on the support of Prince Johnson, a warlord-turned-senator who was involved in the killing of the brutal former military ruler Samuel Doe on camera. Fear of upsetting Johnson, and his many supporters, may have been the reason Weah did not act sooner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince Johnson, a former warlord and supporter of President George Weah. Photograph: Thierry Gouegnon/Reuters\n\nJohnson argues a war crimes court would be illegal, though he has said he supports Weah\u2019s request for advice on it from the legislature.\n\nPeople claiming to speak on behalf of Prince Johnson have issued threats to Dennis. She says \u201csince then, there has been this unknown or unlicensed black vehicle that is always tailing me.\u201d\n\nJohnson denied any involvement in phone calls to Dennis, adding that he is now a preacher and \u201cvehemently condemn[s] any form of violence against people\u201d.\n\nDennis says she has also received more direct threats from other high-profile figures.\n\nNevertheless, she says it is a cause worth fighting for.\n\n\u201cI just want to walk in light, I just want to walk in justice, and I stand for justice,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the time to be afraid is over, I think they [the warlords] should be afraid now.\u201d\n\nProtests in Liberia over George Weah's failure to tackle corruption Read more\n\nIt would help the country economically, she says, because nobody wants to invest in a \u201ctotally lawless\u201d country. The economy has sunk since Weah took over in 2017.\n\nIf there is no accountability, she says, history will repeat itself.\n\n\u201cHow sure are we that another group of people will not rise up again for political power? If we don\u2019t set a precedent, there will always be bloodshed, there will always be killing, there will always be murders.\u201d", "description": "Pressure is increasing in the west African country \u2013 yet to recover from 14 years of civil conflict \u2013 for a war-crimes tribunal to bring \u2018closure\u2019", "authors": ["Ruth Maclean"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/796623d45527938ac29568a3688a7a6ebc08ac42/0_174_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a72f3e95be6be186089ec7110d7d619b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
