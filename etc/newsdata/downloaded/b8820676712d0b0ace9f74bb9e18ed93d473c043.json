Photo: Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images\n\nDespite the fact that his stage four pancreatic cancer was in \u201cnear remission\u201d a few months ago, which rendered him able to begin work on Jeopardy!\u2019s new season, Alex Trebek revealed in an interview on today\u2019s Good Morning America that he has to undergo another round of chemotherapy due to the cancer relapsing. \u201cI was doing so well. My numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer. So we were all very optimistic,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I lost about 12 pounds in a week, and my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed.\u201d At the urging of his doctors, Trebek realized undergoing chemo again was the best option to address the \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d or \u201cfatigue\u201d that he was soon plagued with on a near-daily basis.\n\nThe host also revealed that he\u2019s very open with his fellow Jeopardy! staff about his health. \u201cI realize that there is an end in sight for me, just as there is for everyone else. One line that I have used with our staff in recent weeks and months is that when I do pass on, one thing they will not say at my funeral is, \u2018Oh, he was taken from us too soon,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cHey guys. I\u2019m 79-years-old. I\u2019ve had one hell of a good life. And I\u2019ve enjoyed it. The thought of passing on doesn\u2019t frighten me, it doesn\u2019t. Other things do, the affect it will have on my loved ones \u2026 it makes me sad. But the thought of myself moving on, hey folks, it comes with the territory.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping for an even speedier recovery, despite those poignant words making us weepy.", "description": "Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek revealed he has to undergo another round of chemotherapy for his pancreatic cancer.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-alex-trebek.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
