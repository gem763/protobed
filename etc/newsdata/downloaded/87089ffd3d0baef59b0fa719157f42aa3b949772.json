He was outed as less of a progressive hero than Ted Cruz. For citizens of the free world, that\u2019s bad news. For sportswriters, it\u2019s almost a relief. We can start covering Silver like a sports commissioner, not like our pal.\n\nThe limp statement the NBA sent out Sunday about Daryl Morey\u2019s Hong Kong tweet brought an end to one of journalism\u2019s longest honeymoons. Silver is no longer \u201cbasketball\u2019s righteous chief,\u201d as Lee Jenkins once dubbed him. Silver is a guy who is fatally compromised by the very condition of being a sports commissioner. Like every commissioner before him.\n\nRelated Everything You Need to Know About the Daryl Morey Controversy\n\n\u201cIf you look at his demeanor\u2014and we now have six years\u2014revenue has always been number one,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst told me.\n\n\u201cNow, perhaps that label will present itself. But it\u2019s not because it\u2019s a shift. It\u2019s because he got unmasked a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between reporters and league commissioners ought to be adversarial, or at least skeptical. Silver earned a lot of journalistic goodwill because he was less terrible than contemporaries Roger Goodell, Bud Selig, and Gary Bettman. He had a way of rising above their drabness and attaching noble ideas to a commissionership.\n\nSilver has his own progressive highlight reel. He figured out how to pry the Clippers from Donald Sterling\u2019s claws. He stood next to Jason Collins on a float in New York City\u2019s Pride Parade. Silver came out in favor of legalized sports gambling four years before the Supreme Court opened the doors for states to adopt it. He thinks NBA players might need more rest.\n\nIn 2015, when Colin Kaepernick was still a gainfully employed quarterback, I went to Princeton to watch Silver talk at a symposium called \u201cPolitical Expression and Activism in Today\u2019s NBA.\u201d Silver didn\u2019t say anything terribly provocative. But it was still amazing to listen to a sports commissioner interact with, or at least seem aware of, a notion Silver once referred to as \u201cthe evolving social consensus.\u201d\n\nAs a result of such outreach, a couple of things happened. One is that Silver became almost inextricable from the game of pro basketball. \u201cWe believe in the NBA and we believe in Adam Silver,\u201d LeBron James said during the Sterling affair. These aren\u2019t the same things, though it was often hard to remember that.\n\nSilver also took on a friendly, un-commissioner-like form. He didn\u2019t seem like a boss. He seemed like a resident of NBA Twitter who wrote some good blogs and made it big. Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn once said of his journalistic tormentor Red Smith: \u201cIn me, he felt he had stumbled upon the ultimate stuffed shirt.\u201d One of Silver\u2019s greatest political feats is that he\u2019s almost never called a stuffed shirt.\n\nThe thing is, Silver is a stuffed shirt. Only a stuffed shirt (in this case, a lawyer and longtime David Stern apparatchik) gets to be a commissioner. We were reminded of this on Sunday, as Chinese interests cited Morey\u2019s tweet as a reason to pull away from the NBA and the Rockets. The league, facing one door marked \u201cFree Expression\u201d and another marked \u201cBillions of Dollars,\u201d had to make a choice.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s first statement was so hedged and word-salady that it was indecipherable. Here Silver\u2019s progressive highlight reel worked against him. If Silver is the guy saluting inclusion and sitting in on symposia, then he knows just what it means to grant the Chinese government the right to be \u201cdeeply offended.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, he is a much better listener than Stern is,\u201d said Windhorst. \u201cBut as a businessman, I would argue that he\u2019s even more focused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Stern felt that power and control were 1A and 1B with revenue,\u201d Windhorst continued. \u201cI think Adam is willing to cede some power and control as long as revenue is number one.\u201d\n\nSuch a clear understanding of Silver\u2019s values makes so much of the writing about him sound ridiculous. Last year, a GQ story about a league headphones sponsorship somehow morphed into a tale of Silver\u2019s zest for player empowerment. (\u201cIt\u2019s important that our players are allowed to be their authentic selves,\u201d Silver was quoted as saying.) The year before, the magazine declared, \u201cThe NBA has established itself as almost a perfect professional league.\u201d There is no perfect sports league any more than there is a perfect American business.\n\nMost writing from NBA pros isn\u2019t so credulous. But Silver has been granted a wide benefit of the doubt that his colleagues in other leagues haven\u2019t. Imagine NFL players gaining new power within the league, and Goodell declaring, at that very moment, that the players were \u201cunhappy.\u201d He would have been ripped as a paternalistic asshole. Yet I had more than one NBA writer argue to me that Silver was taking a menschy interest in his workers\u2019 mental health.\n\nThe Silver reckoning was going to come sooner or later. The smart money was on it arriving during the NBA\u2019s coming CBA war, when Silver would be put in the position of arguing that everybody\u2019s favorite players deserved less money. The reckoning came early and from multiple angles. This week, you had writing from NBA regulars like Chris Mannix paired with blasts from Brian Phillips and Drew Magary.\n\nWhen thinking about how to properly cover Silver, Ted Cruz offers a useful example. Some U.S. senators are better than other senators. Journalists ought to note the distinctions. But a senator, like a sports commissioner, deserves scrutiny merely because he is the kind of person who desires to be a senator. \u201cI have always said Adam Silver is the greatest commissioner in sports,\u201d LeBron James once said. Never forget that is a mighty low bar.", "description": "The NBA leader has been closely scrutinized in the aftermath of the league\u2019s Daryl Morey\u2013incited conflict with China.
