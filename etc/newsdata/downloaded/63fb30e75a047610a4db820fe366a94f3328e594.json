Over the last few months, they have found backing from two very different kinds of polls.\n\nOne theory holds that Mr. Trump is fundamentally like any other president. This would be good news for his chances in 2020: Many presidents have gone on to win after having approval ratings like Mr. Trump\u2019s today, and many presidents have won after a midterm drubbing. The state of the economy could be pivotal; if it stayed strong, he would have a real chance to win. His approval rating could rise, like that of prior presidents, once voters began to assess his presidency in comparison with the alternative. His relative advantage in the Electoral College could put him over the top.\n\nAnother theory holds that President Trump and this polarized era are unique. In this view, Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular, and opinions of his presidency are entrenched. The economy cannot save him from defeat. After all, his approval ratings are poor despite low unemployment; nothing short of fundamental changes in his conduct could improve them. In this view, the 2018 midterm election, when Democrats won the national House vote by almost nine percentage points, would be a harbinger of the general.\n\nOf course, the truth could be somewhere in between (and probably is). But these two theories have different consequences for how to think about the campaign in 2020.", "description": "Is the president basically like other presidents, or is he uniquely divisive?", "authors": ["Nate Cohn"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/upshot/up-polls/up-polls-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
