But while BDSM is a big party look this season, with designer halters and bondage straps all the rage, this performative steaminess couldn\u2019t be further from the humdrum reality for exhausted middle-aged couples, whose love lives have been eroded by toil, domestic drudgery and the cruel passage of time.\n\nThe truth is that, across the board, British people are having less sex, with the greatest reduction among cohabiting couples and those over 25, according to a study in the BMJ this year.\n\nWhen the lusty beginnings of a relationship are a distant memory, says the sex therapist Cate Campbell, \u201cpeople can think: \u2018This is really boring sex,\u2019 and that they should be swinging from the chandeliers.\u201d But there are more subtle options for maintaining the physical closeness necessary to keep things interesting. Think of it not so much as spicing up your sex life as refreshing the fundamental ingredients.\n\n\u201cMost couples that see me in middle age have got into a rut,\u201d says Campbell. They have often ended up having what she refers to as \u201cdeficit sex ... Over time, if they think their partner doesn\u2019t like something, they cut it out.\u201d This is done without discussing the matter, relying on assumptions, she says. The cumulative effect is that \u201cyou only have a few moves left. It\u2019s horrifying when you think about it, but just saying this to couples can really change things for them.\u201d\n\nThe first step, therefore, is to sit down and talk, but even the seasoned relationship and family therapist Armele Philpotts concedes that sex is the hardest thing to talk about. \u201cIt\u2019s really personal and we feel so vulnerable,\u201d she says, adding that talking under the guidance of a therapist, \u201cmakes it a little bit easier\u201d.\n\nFor discussions with your partner, remaining fully clothed works best \u2013 with debriefs during or immediately after sex avoided. \u201cIn no other category in life,\u201d says Major, who is head of service quality and clinical practice at the relationship support charity Relate, \u201cis it possible to humiliate somebody as easily.\u201d\n\nMy mid-life adventures in online dating Read more\n\nAsking caring questions is a good start, says Philpotts. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to try that we\u2019ve never done? Is there anything that since childbirth, for example, is uncomfortable? How has your body changed from when we first started making love?\u201d\n\nIf you have a gripe, own it, says Major. \u201cMake it about you rather than being critical of a partner. It\u2019s about saying: \u2018I\u2019ve noticed maybe I need a bit more of this or less of that.\u2019\u201d Also key, she says, \u201cis not putting yourself under pressure because you think you should be getting out a gimp mask\u201d.\n\nWhat if one partner requests a kink the other finds horrifying? \u201cIf your partner suggests anal sex, for example,\u201d says Major, \u201ca lot of people, if they\u2019ve not experienced that, might think it\u2019s disgusting and it will hurt. But I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with any suggestion providing you ask the right way and you\u2019re prepared to be turned down or try a compromise.\u201d Equally, nobody should feel guilty if they don\u2019t want to \u201cdo certain types of sex, and nobody should be made to do it; that would fall under domestic abuse\u201d.\n\nThere are many ways to approach the situation, she says. \u201cTalk about it, or try it a little bit, go half way. People have different sexual needs in terms of quantity, too, so it\u2019s always a compromise; making sure each partner gets most of their needs met, some of the time, or some of their needs met most of the time. Be kind; be realistic \u2013 we\u2019re all getting older.\u201d\n\nLaying the groundwork requires maintaining connection. \u201cIntimacy is bigger than sex,\u201d says Major. \u201cI would say intimacy can start in the morning and I don\u2019t mean with a shag. Even if you\u2019re very busy, a text to say: \u2018Thinking about you\u2019 or: \u2018Looking forward to seeing you tonight\u2019. It can be tiny things \u2013 a touch of the hand, asking how their day was.\u201d It boils down to being nice to each other. \u201cIf you feel someone\u2019s kind and loving towards you, it makes it much easier to have those conversations when things might not be going too well in the sex department.\u201d\n\nA common complaint she hears is that a client comes home exhausted only \u201cto find your partner shoving their hand between your legs. Some people need a bit of a buildup.\u201d In her 25 years of providing sex therapy, she says, the main requirement hasn\u2019t changed much \u2013 most people want to \u201cfeel connected with somebody and not just be confronted with: \u2018I want to have sex with you, even though I might have been distant or horrible to you all day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to have a tactile routine,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAlways say goodnight properly, kiss and have a cuddle. And do the same in the morning.\u201d Going to bed at the same time is optimal. \u201cWith so many couples, one goes up the stairs and the other stays down watching porn when they could be in bed together.\u201d\n\nShe advises exercises to help break out of restrictive routines, such as: \u201cWithout trying to arouse your partner, move their hands wherever you want them to go. If you want more of something or something different, just move your partner\u2019s hands. You might end up doing very different things \u2013 it\u2019s a very different lovemaking session because you end up far away from the usual moves.\u201d\n\nTen years into a relationship, says Campbell, desire is no longer automatic. \u201cIf you think about the early stages, you\u2019re up for it all the time. But beyond 10 years, you\u2019d rather have a cup of tea. However, if you choose to engage in sexual behaviour, you might often become aroused and go for it.\u201d This is one reason why sex therapists recommend scheduling sex. It may not be spontaneous, but neither, in fact, were the hot, panting sessions of your dating years. \u201cYou knew you were going to have sex \u2013 you prepared for it, shaved your legs and all of that,\u201d says Campbell.\n\nScheduled sex doesn\u2019t have to come with pressure or promises. Book an hour together, says Campbell, \u201clay or sit together naked, or have a bath together (the taller partner lies against the back of the bath with the other one between their legs lying back against them). Just chat and if you want to get sexual then you can.\u201d But just as importantly, she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve connected\u201d.\n\nYou could start by sharing memories of the best times you have had sex, says Philpotts. \u201cWhat was it that you particularly liked? If we only talk about what\u2019s not going right, that can feel demoralising.\u201d\n\nAnother game Campbell favours is to say: \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know about you. Whether that\u2019s a sexual something or not.\u201d Or there\u2019s the classic sex therapy exercise of exploring each other\u2019s bodies. \u201cWhen was the last time you just lay naked together? Have you ever looked behind their ears, knees, nape of their neck? Or just look at one another\u2019s hands in great detail \u2013 this has led to sex for a lot of people. It\u2019s so intimate just looking at someone\u2019s hands, turning them over and touching them, smelling them. Just get to know them again. It\u2019s kind of symbolic of the whole relationship.\u201d\n\nPhilpotts says that in sex-therapy circles, there\u2019s a whole discourse about challenging the idea that once you\u2019re settled into a marriage, \u201cyou might as well get your slippers out\u201d. Whereas sex when you are younger and less experienced can be more mechanical, she says, as you get older \u201cyou know each other better, there\u2019s more trust, you\u2019re more comfortable with your body\u201d. That bond and intimate knowledge of each other, she says, can pave the way to sex getting \u201cbetter and better right through to your 80s\u201d.", "description": "British people are having less sex \u2013 especially co-habiting couples.
