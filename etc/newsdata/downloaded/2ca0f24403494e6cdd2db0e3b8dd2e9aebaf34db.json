He wears a floppy baseball hat, an oversized red-and-white T-shirt and sings into a microphone while pressing down on the plastic buttons of a toy guitar.\n\nStephen Lewis says he was always meant to be an artist. (Submitted by Stephen Lewis)\n\nAlmost 30 years later, the Fredericton musician, who fronts the band Stephen Lewis and the Big Band of Fun, is one of many New Brunswick musicians who are making it on a professional scale.\n\nFor him, the key to making it as a musician in a small province is \"directly correlated to not quitting.\"\n\n'Everyone's got problems'\n\n\"If you quit, then that's final,\" said Lewis. \"I don't think that I personally have made it, and I don't think anyone really makes it because there's always more to the story.\n\n\"Everyone's got problems. And at the end of the day, if you're an artist and you have food in your fridge, then it's a good day.\"\n\nFreelance journalist Jerry-Faye Flatt asks New Brunswick musicians how they define success. Video producer: Alex Vietinghoff 4:08\n\n\n\nGreg Webber is a Fredericton High School music teacher who also fronts the band Kill Chicago. He echoed Lewis's sentiment.\n\n\n\n\"I honestly think that to make it as a musician in New Brunswick, is probably to just make music in New Brunswick. And if you're able to get up every day and still create music and play it \u2026 then I think you've made it.\"\n\n\n\nWebber, who's participated in multiple projects over the years, said the New Brunswick music scene is special because it's not competitive.\n\n\n\n\"It's very small, it's welcoming \u2026 and I think people work really hard to keep it that way.\" Greg Webber is a Fredericton High School music teacher who also fronts the band Kill Chicago.

But here they do, not only do they mix, but they thrive,\" Lewis said.\n\n'Don't be lazy'\n\nPenelope Stevens said she doesn't think it's difficult to be a musician in New Brunswick, but it's hard to be a musician in general. If you want to be a musician, she said, you have to work hard for it.\n\nPenelope Stevens is a visual artist, musician and arts administrator. (J.W Deveaux Photography)\n\n\"Don't be lazy,\" Stevens said. \"And don't think that it's hard because you live here. It's hard because it's hard. And you can do it or not, but don't be lazy.\n\n\n\n\"There's no inherent value to art that can be exchanged for money easily. Like if you go into a trade and you become an electrician, then there's a pay grade that you just automatically achieve. That doesn't happen in art, but especially not in music.\"\n\n'We have a supportive community'\n\nKelly Waterhouse plays in eight different projects in the Fredericton area. She said making it as a musician is relative, but if you want to make a career out of creating music you have to be versatile.\n\n\n\n\"You need to accept as many different kinds of projects as you can,\" said Waterhouse.\n\n\n\n\"And learn to read music because you can get paid a lot more.\"\n\nKelly Waterhouse says the music community is very supportive in Fredericton. (Alex Vietinghoff for CBC)\n\nLewis said the difficulties of being a musician are balanced out by the supportive music community in Fredericton.\n\n\"It's challenging. But on the big positive side of it, and this has been outlined so much by The Capital Project,\" said Lewis, referring to a music documentary that appears on CBC Gem about the music community in New Brunswick.\n\n\"We have a supportive community, like no other community, especially with music and arts.\"", "description": "Four New Brunswick musicians who are making it on a professional scale reflect on what success looks and feels like for them.", "authors": ["Jerry-Faye Flatt Is A Fourth-Year Journalism", "Communications Student At St. Thomas University Who Adores All Things Art.
