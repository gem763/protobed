Our current policies on fact-checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\"\n\nWATCH: AOC GETS TESTY WITH FACEBOOK CEO WHILE INTERROGATING HIM ON FACT-CHECKING\n\nThe employees listed the potential consequences of the policy remaining as is, including increased \"distrust in our platform\" threatening to \"undo integrity product work.\"\n\nThey then proposed holding political ads to the same standards as other ads, restricting their abilities to target certain users and implementing a spending cap for politicians.\n\n\"We want to have this conversation in an open dialog because we want to see actual change,\" the letter continued. \"We are proud of the work that the integrity teams have done, and we don\u2019t want to see that undermined by policy. Over the coming months, we\u2019ll continue this conversation, and we look forward to working towards solutions together.\"\n\n\"This is still our company.\"\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recently grilled Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill. She started her fact-checking questions by asking whether she could target predominantly black ZIP codes with misinformation about an election. When Zuckerberg said no, she pressed him on whether she could lie about Republicans voting for her \"Green New Deal.\"\n\n\"I mean, if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m trying to understand the bounds here -- what\u2019s fair game,\" she said.\n\nZuckerberg said he didn't know the answer at that moment, prompting her to ask him if he understood why his approach was problematic.\n\n\"Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\" she asked. Zuckerberg replied that he thought lying was wrong.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That\u2019s different from it being, in our position, the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied,\" he said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, apparently not satisfied, suggested he was equivocating: \"So you won\u2019t take down lies or you will take down lies?\" she asked. \"It's a pretty simple yes or no.\"\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.", "description": "Hundreds of Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives saying they oppose the social network\u2019s policy of letting politicians lie in advertisements.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
