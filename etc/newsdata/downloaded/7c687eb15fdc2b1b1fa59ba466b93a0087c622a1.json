They\u2019re about race.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cAnd we\u2019re told the suspect remains at large, but authorities now believe they have a credible description of the perp,\u201d said her co-anchor, host Phoebe Waller-Bridge. \u201cThe suspect, described as a white male \u2026\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWoo!\u201d Kenan Thompson interrupted. \u201cLove it!\u201d Nwodim shouted. Waller-Bridge and another co-anchor, played by Alex Moffat, looked confused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what are you two celebrating?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOh, nothing. We\u2019re just glad that we know what the criminal looks like,\u201d Thompson replied. He leaned toward Nwodim, dropping his voice to a hushed tone: \u201cAnd he ain\u2019t one of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Nwodim agreed with a smirk. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d\n\nWaller-Bridge attempted to continue the newscast, noting that viewers should call the police with any information. \u201cYes,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHelp us catch this white criminal.\u201d\n\nThe quiet brilliance of Kenan Thompson\n\nMoffat\u2019s anchor then reported on a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme targeting wealthy Miami residents. \u201cThat\u2019s one of y\u2019all, for sure,\u201d Nwodim said as Moffat detailed the \u201cegregious white-collar crime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right there in the name,\u201d Nwodim teased. But her glee turned to disappointment when the screen flashed to a photo of the suspect. \u201cAnd look at that,\u201d Moffat said smugly. \u201cHe\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nThe competition escalated from there, with Moffat visibly allowing that a Fort Lauderdale Cracker Barrel vandal would mean a loss for his and Waller-Bridge\u2019s makeshift team, and Thompson responding to a report about a shopper attacking a man who stepped on his Nike Air Jordan sneakers with a tight-lipped grimace. Even the station\u2019s weatherman (Chris Redd) got in on the game while tracking the path of a hurricane dubbed Chet. \u201cNow that\u2019s a white man\u2019s name if I\u2019ve ever heard one,\u201d he said with a grin.\n\nThe kicker, which found Waller-Bridge and Moffat conceding defeat after a report about \u201ca man dressed as the Joker,\u201d concluded the sketch with a timely chef\u2019s kiss that added \u201cMid-Day News\u201d to a roster of sharp racial sendups from SNL\u2019s increasingly diverse writing staff. (In a tweet, senior writer Bryan Tucker credited Redd, Nwodim and SNL co-head-writer Michael Che \u2014 the first black person to hold that title \u2014 with writing \u201cMid-Day News.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d incorporates new voices both on-screen and behind the scenes, the show\u2019s ability to subvert racial stereotypes in unexpected ways has led to some of its strongest sketches, often overshadowing \u2014 or elevating \u2014 SNL\u2019s political humor.\n\nOne obvious example is \u201cBlack Jeopardy,\u201d the recurring sketch that quizzes characters, played by carefully chosen guest hosts, on black culture. When Tom Hanks hosted ahead of the 2016 presidential election, SNL tweaked the sketch\u2019s typical clueless white person format, instead tapping Hanks to play a MAGA hat-wearing conservative who could relate to many aspects of black culture \u2014 to the surprise of his fellow contestants. (The sketch has amassed nearly 44 million views on YouTube.)\n\nForget Trump and Clinton. \u2018Black Jeopardy\u2019 is SNL\u2019s best political sketch of 2016\n\n\u201cBlack Jeopardy,\u201d created by Che and Tucker, pushed its racial humor to a new level last year, tapping host Chadwick Boseman to appear in character as Black Panther. The Marvel superhero drew laughs as he unpacked the nuances between African American culture and that of his fictional sub-Saharan African nation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen comedian and former SNL scribe John Mulaney hosted in March, the standout sketch (with apologies to \u201cBodega Bathroom\u201d) was \u201cCha Cha Slide,\u201d a four-minute masterpiece that, at first glance, looked as if it would riff on the inherent awkwardness of a white guy attending a predominantly black wedding. Instead, the sketch revealed, little by little, that Mulaney\u2019s character, \u201ca software engineer from Indianapolis,\u201d may have been the blackest person at the event, at least in spirit.\n\nThe sketch, penned by Tucker and writer Sam Jay was made even funnier by the fact that it cast Mulaney \u2014 who once joked about getting \u201carrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert\u201d \u2014 as a Howard University alum who pledged a black fraternity and knew even the unofficial steps to DJ Casper\u2019s classic dance single.\n\nJay, one of seven writers who joined SNL in 2017, told Vice News that year she wanted her work on the show to incorporate themes the show had overlooked in its four-decade-plus history, such as the \u201curban culture stuff that they may not necessarily have their pulse on, gay culture \u2026 just who I am,\u201d she said. Bowen Yang, the gay Chinese American comic who was hired as a featured player after writing for SNL last season, has already brought queer culture to the show in memorable ways from the \u201cGP Yass\u201d skit he co-wrote last year to his lively turn as a tariff expert for the Chinese government \u2014 the latter of which brought the phrase \u201ctrade daddy\u201d into our lexicon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018We actually built our wall\u2019: SNL\u2019s Bowen Yang shines as Chinese trade representative on \u2018Weekend Update\u2019\n\nOf course, as the impeachment inquiry against President Trump builds, the pressure is on for SNL to smartly lampoon the chaotic state of American politics. That these sketches break through the noise and find longevity amid a continual onslaught of forgettable celebrity guest stars points to an audience who want more than just regurgitation of last week\u2019s news.\n\nWatch more:\n\nRead more:\n\nAnd this week\u2019s \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 cold open celebrity guest star is \u2026 Matthew Broderick as Mike Pompeo\n\nAidy Bryant broke character on SNL.
