Viliame Mata, Leone Nakarawa and Semi Radradra are among the world\u2019s very best, and Peceli Yato and Josua Tuisova aren\u2019t too shy, either.\n\nWith the halves perhaps too often the crux for Fiji, Ben Volavola has come on hugely as a fly-half, while Frank Lomani\u2019s accuracy at nine is welcome. The set piece should be stronger, too, with Eroni Mawi promising and Campese Ma\u2019afu and Manasa Saulo experienced. Peni Ravai is a prop who has played international sevens, which should give some idea of his skill set, though he\u2019s held his own in the Top 14 for a number of seasons now.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Coaching Fiji is never particularly easy, with a squad flung far and wide often assembled for much too short a time, and off-field meddlings and problems all too prominent. McKee, therefore, has done an excellent job, guiding Fiji to that triumph over France and improving all who have passed through his squad.\n\nThe New Zealander\u2019s charges have looked a little short of their best in the lead-up to the tournament, but he\u2019ll be confident they put it together in Japan.\n\nKey Player\n\nBen Volavola. There is no doubting the ability of Fiji\u2019s squad in broken field and the potential ferocity of their defence, but their World Cup hopes may rest on the comparatively slender shoulders of Sydney-born pivot Ben Volavola. Somewhat maligned four years ago, he has bounced around the globe since and further honed his game, making fewer errors and learning to better appreciate the simplicities of the game.\n\nWith such potency throughout the side, Fiji hardly require a maverick at fly-half. If Volavola can be the eye in the middle of a particularly destructive storm, Fiji can beat anyone.\n\nPast Record\n\nAustralia/New Zealand 1987 \u2013 quarter-finalists (one win)\n\nEurope 1991 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (zero wins)\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 eliminated at the play-off stage (two wins)\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (two wins)\n\nFrance 2007 \u2013 quarter-finalists (three wins)\n\nNew Zealand 2011 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nPrediction\n\nAustralia\u2019s resurgence has decreased Fiji\u2019s chances of a quarter-final berth, but facing the Wallabies first-up is no bad thing. If Fiji catch the Australians cold, they should blow away Uruguay and survive the rigours of Georgia to advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nFixtures\n\nSaturday 21 September \u2013 Australia vs Fiji (5.45am), Sapporo\n\nWednesday 25 September \u2013 Fiji vs Uruguay (5.45am), Kamaishi\n\nThursday 3 October \u2013 Georgia vs Fiji (6.15am), Higashiosaka\n\nSunday 13 October \u2013 Wales vs Fiji (10.45am), Oita\n\nOdds\n\nFiji to win the World Cup: 500/1", "description": "Ever the entertainers, Fiji\u00a0head to the 2019 Rugby World Cup with perhaps their most complete side ever.
