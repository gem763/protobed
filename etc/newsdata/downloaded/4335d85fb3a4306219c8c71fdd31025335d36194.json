In a week full of strange and unusual album teases, Lady Gaga enigmatically responded to the endless, years-long barrage of crazed \u201cWHERE\u2019S LG6??\u201d tweets by announcing the title of her next album. In the most confusing music-release announcement since \u201cQueen of Jordan\u201d Sherri Shepherd said, \u201cMy single \u2018My Single Is Dropping\u2019 is dropping,\u201d Lady Gaga tweeted on Tuesday afternoon:\n\nI\u2019m calling my next album ADELE. \u2014 Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) October 1, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the tweet.\n\nSo what could it possibly mean? Let\u2019s examine our options. The first is that this is simply Gaga expressing a level of standom and affinity toward fellow pop powerhouse Adele and not really naming an album after her. It would be like the ridiculously high-exposure equivalent of me tweeting, \u201cI named you after the bravest person I ever knew, Ally Maine Alter,\u201d or like Drake getting a tattoo of C\u00e9line Dion. The second theory is that Gaga has some other tragic relative we don\u2019t know about named Adele; maybe she\u2019s Joanne\u2019s late third cousin twice removed or something, to whom she\u2019s devoting the album. The third is that it\u2019s a play on \u201cAdele Dazeem,\u201d and really she\u2019s naming it IDINA. The fourth option is that Miss Gaga, mistress of chaos, simply wants to ruin everyone\u2019s SEO forever.\n\nHere\u2019s what we do know about LG6 so far: Sophie, BloodPop, and Boys Noize have been tied to it, with rumored collaborators including Cupcakke, Diplo, and even Rihanna. This lineup means Gaga is most likely returning to a dancier, poppier mode. If that were the case, calling her album ADELE would be the exact sort of meta-postmodern pop-commentary mindfuck angle that would make it a perfect spiritual follow-up to 2013\u2019s ARTPOP and would fit in perfectly with the Enigma era. Or maybe it\u2019s all just trolling in the deep. After all, this isn\u2019t the first time Gaga has punk\u2019d us with album news:\n\nRumors I\u2019m pregnant? Yeah, I\u2019m pregnant with #LG6 \u2014 Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) March 12, 2019\n\nWhether the album is ADELE or not, we\u2019re clearly all just willing pawns in Gaga\u2019s game of five-dimensional chess.
