They\u2019re reinforced by Fox News. And \u201csmear\u201d or not, as Democrats call this one, they often stick. On this one, honestly, I share my conservative friends\u2019 concerns, even if they have their facts wrong. Sure, Joe and Hunter Biden did nothing illegal, and Hunter was not a government official. Meanwhile, President Trump and his family have used the office of the president as an A.T.M., beyond his numerous moral and ethical failings.\n\nBut why would a Ukrainian gas company give Hunter Biden millions of dollars for a board seat in an industry he knew nothing about if they weren\u2019t trying to curry favor with his father, the vice president? This is anthropology 101 \u2014 generalized reciprocity, where a gift of real value is made, with an expected return gift of uncertain or unspecified value at an undetermined time in the future. That we so easily accept this kind of payola to politicians is part of the reason it\u2019s near-impossible to hold Mr. Trump accountable.\n\nAnyway, fair or not, the Biden smear is certainly portrayed as truth on Fox News\u2019s talk shows. Most of us around here seldom see that network\u2019s news programs, which have been more evenhanded in their recent coverage of the president. When we get up in the morning to go to work, it\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on the air. In the evening, by the time we are done wrangling kids and supper, it\u2019s Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.\n\nAnd the local culture goes much deeper than Fox News, which doesn\u2019t create the reality of conservatives here so much as reinforce it. To my devout conservative neighbors, liberals are tearing America apart. Mr. Trump is the only conservative with the courage enough to stand up to their way.\n\nThey see the hand of God in this, and many truly believe he is the \u201cchosen one.\u201d To them, Democrats are amoral and spiritually empty. Where evangelical Republicans worship God and see Jesus as the only path to him, Democrats have banned Jesus from the public sphere at great cost to society and the potential salvation of millions.\n\nTo rural white conservatives, their culture is being rubbed out right before their eyes. Compared with that, Mr. Trump\u2019s sins \u2014 Ukraine and all \u2014 are trivial, while the Democrats are unrepentant and persist in their wrongdoing.\n\nSo, yes, the dismal rural economy, brought on directly by the president\u2019s actions, may prompt independents and some Republicans to vote for a Democrat, because they will see it in their economic interests to do so.", "description": "To conservatives in this part of rural Iowa, the president is a beleaguered hero who is always Making America Great Again.", "authors": ["Robert Leonard"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/opinion/14leonard1/14leonard1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
