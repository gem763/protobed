But my favorite moments always happen in Memphis where reporters still sit on press row. I enjoyed seeing Warriors coach Steve Kerr and former Lakers coach Luke Walton interact with the officials. They offered a good dose of friendliness, playful sarcasm, frustration and words unsuitable for print.\n\nWhat are your predictions for the NBA Finals this season?\n\nJeff Zillgitt: I went Bucks-Clippers with Clippers winning the title. But as history has proven, I'm much better at telling you what and why it happened rather than telling you what will happen. Predictions are not my thing.\n\nMedina: Eastern Conference champion: Sixers; Western Conference champion: Clippers; NBA champion: Clippers.\n\nWhat is the most bizarre story, experience, situation, you have come across?\n\nZillgitt: The 2011 NBA lockout was pretty bizarre, waiting on New York City sidewalks or hotel lobbiesfor someone to give us a morsel of information that usually wasn't very helpful. Though, (then-NBA commissioner) David Stern and (then-NBPA executive director) Billy Hunter provided great theater at times. Gregg Popovich was jogging on a city street when he stopped to talk to a bunch of reporters waiting outside a hotel. Two cameramen got into a fight in the street later that night. One night one side offered to buy dinner during a break in negotiations -- NBA wanted Chinese; NBPA wanted barbecue. They couldn't even agree on dinner.\n\nMedina: I enjoyed talking with Kevin (Durant) on and off the record about the game, the league, the media and everything else. I learned a lot and he was always very considered, open-minded and analytical. The most interesting moment entailed his blowup in regards to the inquiries about the Knicks trading (Kristaps) Porzingis and if this was a sign KD is going to the Knicks. ... you knew where Kevin stood on things. Yet he is a very complex man that it became difficult to sift through what makes him tick.\n\nWhat teams do you think will surprise us this season or in the next few seasons?\n\nZillgitt: Hawks are on the rise. Exciting young talent. Exciting old talent (Hey Vince!). Great job in Atlanta by general manager Travis Schlenk and coach Lloyd Pierce.\n\nWhat player do you feel has the most pressure this season?\n\nZillgitt: It's the Houston guys -- [James] Harden and [Russell] Westbrook -- for sure.\n\nDo you think the Lakers make a trade for a [point guard] or overall playmaker before the trade deadline?\n\nMedina: The Lakers are in win-now mode, so nothing is ever off the table. They also want more depth in their bench. The only move I see them making entails pursuing Andre Iguodala. The Grizzlies will eventually shop him. They are just waiting for the right time (IE: when they have the most leverage leading into the trade deadline).", "description": "In an NBA Reddit AMA on Wednesday, USA TODAY reporters Mark Medina and Jeff Zillgitt answered readers' questions about the 2019-20 season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc3d4d4f6ddd063143b663256e30ab5bf8a652d5/c=0-50-2872-1666/local/-/media/2019/10/25/USATODAY/usatsports/waukee-bucks-at-houston-rockets-e1572009694346.jpg?width=2872&height=1616&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
