In recent years, the EU has partnered with Libya\u2019s coast guard and other local groups to stem the dangerous sea crossings.\n\nRights groups, however, say those policies leave migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers rife with abuses.\n\nThe humanitarian aid group Sea-Eye has said that gunmen on Libya-flagged speedboats threatened the crew of its rescue ship Alan Kurdi and the migrants it was rescuing on Saturday, firing shots into the air and water.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman Gorden Isler told The Associated Press that the incident shocked the rescue crew but that they managed to bring all the roughly 90 migrants on board.\n\nThe gunmen on the speedboats fired \u201cwarning shots\u201d and pointed mounted guns at the rescuers and the migrants, some of whom had jumped into the water, before pulling away.\n\nThe ship later headed north, toward Europe, Islaer added.", "description": "Libya's coast guard said Monday it intercepted dozens of Europe-bound migrants off the country's Mediterranean coast the previous day.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19251614520124-e1572277344221-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
