News\u2018 Instagram wondering why the Hemsworth brothers didn\u2019t meet her in \u201cSydney or Bondi\u201d. Sorry to break it to ya Linds, but Bondi is Sydney. Also, I\u2019m not sure she quite understands that @enews isn\u2019t the Hemsworth brothers\u2019 actual account.\n\nI mean, the Hemsworth brothers should probably take her up on the offer. If you\u2019ve seen Lindsay Lohan\u2019s Beach Club, you\u2019d know that LiLo sure knows how to party on the beach.\n\nThe former child star, who I secretly still adore, hasn\u2019t done much acting in recent years, apart from her reality show and her recent appearance in the 2019 film Among The Shadows. But her latest gig on The Masked Singer has brought her to Australia, where she\u2019ll undoubtedly pick up an Aussie accent, and hopefully a Hemsworth brother.\n\nChris and Liam haven\u2019t responded to Lindsay\u2019s prayers, but over 250 other commenters have, asking which brother she\u2019d prefer and telling her to \u201cshoot her shot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Lindsay realises she commented on E! News\u2019 account instead of Chris or Liam\u2019s.\n\nHonestly, I think Lindsay is just living her best life at this point. She\u2019s 33-years-old, she\u2019s made more money than I could ever dream of and partied harder than any of us. The entertainment industry chewed her up and spat her out, and now she just wants to relax.\n\nShe cops more shit than most people in the entertainment industry, and it\u2019s really quite unfair. I just want to see Lindsay thrive.\n\nThe girl just wants to kick back, marry a Hemsworth and enjoy her life.\n\nDon\u2019t we all Lindsay? Don\u2019t ???? We ???? All ????", "description": "Lindsay Lohan reached out to the Hemsworth brothers in the comments section of an E!
