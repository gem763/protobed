Elijah Cummings is a gut punch to Democrats \u2014 personally and politically \u2014 as they ramp up their impeachment drive of President Donald Trump.\n\nCummings possessed a preacher\u2019s oratorial skill with the common man\u2019s touch \u2014 the exact rhetorical powers and gravitas that Democrats will need to unite their caucus as they consider a move as divisive as impeachment.\n\nAnd Democrats are acutely aware that whoever takes the helm of the House Oversight Committee, one of three panels leading the investigation into Trump, will become a crucial messenger on impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe can never forget the role that he has played in searching for the truth,\u201d Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a close friend of Cummings and fellow civil rights icon, said Thursday morning. \u201cMembers will be much more determined to pick up where Elijah left off. There can be no slowdown, or turning back.\u201d\n\nCummings has been absent from Capitol Hill for weeks, sidelined with long-lingering health issues. But he spoke by phone on a near-daily basis to other investigators, including House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), even from his hospital bed, up until this week. Cummings had previously notified Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he might not be in Washington for the next few weeks, but seemed hopeful to return in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s created a really big hole for all of us,\u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) added. \u201cHe had so much more he could have given.\u201d\n\nWith Cummings absent, Pelosi tapped Schiff, a close ally, as the point person in Democrats\u2019 investigation into Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Had he been healthy, it\u2019s possible that Cummings, not Schiff, would be in that role.\n\nBut Cummings\u2019 colleagues acknowledged that his skill set \u2014 his soaring rhetoric, his mastery of committee rules and procedures, his relationships with Republicans \u2014 will be missed amid the caucus\u2019 impeachment push.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible blow to lose it, I mean just terrible,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said of Cummings\u2019 voice, forcing back tears. \u201cHe was careful about how he used it but he wasn\u2019t shy about using it either.\u201d\n\nIn the interim, Pelosi has tapped Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) to lead the Oversight panel, though few expect her to take the role permanently. So far, there are only whispers about who will take the gavel, with some lawmakers and aides floating Oversight members like Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), a fellow member of the Congressional Black Caucus, or Connolly, another skilled messenger, to assume the post.\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney More\n\nSome have speculated about the possibility of bringing in a caucus heavyweight, like Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, to fill the vacancy and lead the panel, though he is unlikely to back the idea, multiple aides said.\n\nBut the question of who will replace Cummings will soon become a weighty debate \u2014 and potentially, an intraparty clash \u2014 within the caucus over who will become one of the most public-facing figures of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t bring that voice back,\u201d said Clay on Thursday, who declined to comment when asked whether he's seeking the post. \u201cIn his legacy, I will take some of the lessons that I learned from him and convert that into my everyday work.\u201d\n\nThe late Oversight Committee chairman checked all the boxes for Democratic leaders: he was a partisan warrior but beloved by lawmakers in both parties; a star inside the caucus and on TV; a commanding force on the committee dais; and a brutally effective cross-examiner who could make even the toughest witness cringe.", "description": "The death of Rep.
