You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis is a massive market with a huge number of providers vying for your money. They don\u2019t all offer the same depth or quality of cover or customer service though.\n\nResearchers like Fairer Finance rate specific car insurance policies from Aviva, Axa, DialDirect, More Than, smart, John Lewis, Mercedes-Benz and Swiftcover particularly highly, for example.\n\nBut what about cost?\n\nThe price of insurance is based on risk. In other words, the car insurance quote you\u2019ll get is based on your own personal circumstances.\n\nThese can include somewhat unexpected details like gender (sorry gents, it may be illegal to discriminate on sex but you statistically have more powerful cars and drive more often than women) , where you live and your occupation.\n\nAge is an obvious factor because you\u2019re probably more experienced if you\u2019re older, as is the type of car.\n\nIf it\u2019s pricey there\u2019s more chance of it being pinched, for example and if it\u2019s powerful you\u2019re more likely to get into an accident.\n\nThese reasons, and others are why everyone pays different amounts for their cover.\n\nCar insurance for young drivers\n\nYounger and learner drivers tend to pay a lot more for car insurance based on experience, and because many buy special policies.\n\nFor new drivers, aged 20 to 24, MoneySuperMarket puts the average annual premium for a fully comprehensive policy at a whopping \u00a3966.\n\nBut the advent of telematics has been a godsend for this group, as well as those in other higher risk demographics.\n\nCar insurance with a \u2018black box\u2019\n\nA black box or just a phone app linked to your car allows your insurer to monitor how safely you drive.\n\nAs a careful driver even the youngest motorists aged 17 to 24 could save an average of more than \u00a3150 on their premiums by selecting a telematics policy, MoneySuperMarket has found.\n\nSpecialist car insurance\n\nIf you drive something special or your circumstances aren\u2019t typical, you may find a standard policy either won\u2019t cover your needs at all or will, but at a hefty additional charge.\n\nClassic cars \u2013 often more valuable and harder to repair \u2013 are a good example and you may need a dedicated classic car policy, especially if the vehicle is more than 15 years old or worth more than \u00a315,000.\n\nThen there are multi-car policies, designed for homes with more than one car registered to them. This kind of policy could cover you for up to five cars and could save a whole household a significant amount of cash each year.\n\nElsewhere, business car insurance (though this should be provided by your employer) and European car insurance (there are several countries in Europe where you may need additional cover) may also serve your needs.\n\nWhat will it cover?\n\nIt\u2019s always important to read the policy details, no matter how long-winded or dull they may be. The onus is on you to know what you\u2019re signing up for and what isn\u2019t included in your policy.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen on specific details, such as the availability of UK breakdown cover, you can also head to the rankings pages of researchers like Defaqto.\n\nIncidentally, among the providers who include this as standard, they give five stars to specific policies from 1st Central, Aviva, Dial Direct, Hastings Direct, NFU Mutual, One Insurance, Post Office Money and Tesco Bank.\n\nThey can also help pick out the best policies that include cover for other circumstances as standard like replacing personal possessions stolen from or along with your car, replacing child seats after an accident, legal expenses and the dreaded effects of picking up the wrong pump because it\u2019s a cold wet Tuesday and you just lost concentration for a split second\u2026\n\nWe may earn some commission if you click on a link in this article and buy a product or service, but we never allow this to influence our coverage.", "description": "Electric, hybrid, petrol or diesel, all for yourself or driven with others.
