As recently as the 1990s, organized labor\u2019s big day was an important milestone on the political calendar, particularly for Democrats.\n\nBut in recent decades, America\u2019s working class has had precious little celebrate. In contrast to the conditions that prevailed in the aftermath of the Second World War, when the incomes of lower quintiles surged by roughly 40%, five times faster than the top echelon during the past four decades, those in the bottom 80% have enjoyed no consistent gains. Meanwhile union membership \u2014 the key to working class political power \u2014 has plunged from 28% in 1954 to 11% today.\n\nThe devastation extends beyond economics. A detailed 2017 study, \u201cWhen work disappears: manufacturing decline and the falling marriage-market value of men,\u201d shows that when towns and counties lose manufacturing jobs, fertility and marriage rates decline while unmarried births and the share of children living in single-parent homes rise. More of the working class, both white and minority, are also experiencing elevated rates of obesity, and rising incidents of what the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton call \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d\n\nA constituency up for grabs\n\nClearly, the working class has reasons to be alienated, and from both mainstream political parties. They have certainly been volatile. Working class whites were critical to the election of President Trump in 2016 but dissatisfaction with the president, particularly among working class women, helped Democrats to an impressive win in the mid-term election.\n\nAs recently as the 1960s, working class voters \u2014 then by far the largest part of the electorate \u2014 formed the core of the Democratic Party. That is certainly not the case anymore; roughly 40% of union members, including a majority of white males, voted for Trump, the best GOP Presidential performance since Reagan. When Trump lambasts free trade and China, he may alienate much of the corporate elite but the message appeals to people and communities that lost, according to one labor backed group, 3.4 million jobs between 1979 and 2017 to the Middle Kingdom.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won all the states with the largest percentage of working-class votes, while Clinton easily captured those with the most \u201ccreative class workers.\u201d Trump does best with those who work with their hands, in factories, the logistics industry and energy; these working class voters, notes a recent study by CityLab report, are those who repair and operate machines, drive trucks and operate our power grid.\n\nMore important, Trump has a case to make with these workers, as real wages for blue-collar workers, even in services, are now rising for the first time in decades. His policies on energy clearly favor well-paid , often unionized people who operate the nation\u2019s wells as well as factory workers who benefit from lower energy prices. Of course, if Trump\u2019s blunderbuss trade policies backfire, he may lose some of this support.\n\nThe Precariat and the new Left\n\nSome progressives suggest it\u2019s time to abandon the working class, and rely instead on educated millennials, minorities and professionals as well as globally oriented businesses. And to be sure, white working class voters are in decline, down 5 percent as a share of the vote just since 2014, but they still constitute two-fifths of the total.\n\nBut others, notably Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, see potential in the growing numbers of people who work not as long-term employees, but on short-term contracts, with few benefits and no union representation. Research reveals that 20 to 30 percent of the working-age population in the United States labor in this manner.\n\nOften described as the \u201cprecariat,\u201d these workers may see government as the only solution to their insecure employment status. The typical Uber driver is not the one seen in ads, the middle-class driver picking up extra cash for a family vacation or to pay for a fancy date; most depend on their \u201cgigs\u201d for their livelihood, and without much success. Nearly half of gig workers in California subsist under the poverty line. In ultra-expensive places such as Silicon Valley, many conditional workers live in their cars.\n\nUnlike workers with steady pay and benefits, those in the precariat \u2014 many of them young, lacking good prospects and often socialistically minded \u2014 have little to protect. Whether they work for McDonald\u2019s or Uber, they lack health insurance, company backing for further education or any influence on corporate decision-making. A policy agenda of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d, cancelled student debts and forcing companies to put workers could have considerable appeal to such voters.\n\nWhich party wins the working class in 2020?\n\nAppealing to the precariat, however, also poses a challenge to the democratic establishment, many of whom, including several top Obama aides, work at firms such as Uber and Lyft . Some of these notional progressives consider what they call the \u201csharing\u201d economy as \u201cdemocratizing capitalism\u201d by returning control of the working day to the individual. Yet for most gig workers there\u2019s not very much democratic or satisfying.\n\nThe new working class activism also may move to drive the party further, even disastrously, to the left. Some labor activists such as Chicago\u2019s teacher union leaders recently traveled to Venezuela\u2019s disastrous leftist regime, and expressed their admiration and solidarity. This is not a good role model to sell to the electorate.\n\nSimilarly, the Green New Deal, may be seen as a direct shot at the jobs of aerospace, car and construction workers. The notion of providing a guaranteed income \u2014 one feature of the measure \u2014 even to those who choose not to work is unlikely to prove popular among those who do.\n\nBut even if the Democrats go off into a Marxist fantasyland, Trump could still lose a large portion of working class voters, notably women turned off by his boorish behavior. Latinos, heavily represented in blue collar professions, notably in the service fields, construction, logistics and manufacturing, have done better under President Trump but his nativist tendencies \u2014 however exaggerated by a hostile media \u2014 may prevent him from harvesting these gains. Latino voters may be most hurt by progressive policies that inflate the cost of housing and energy, but may have a hard time supporting someone who seems to consider their entire community a burden to the nation.\n\nAll these complex factors suggest that working class voters likely will still be up for grabs by the time we celebrate Labor Day a year from now. These ordinary Americans may be ignored or even disdained by the plutocratic classes in both parties, but their votes may well determine which party wins the White House next year.\n\n\n\nJoel Kotkin is the R.C.
