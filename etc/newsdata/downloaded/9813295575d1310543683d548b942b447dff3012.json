The Post has confirmed the authenticity of the email.\n\nThe decision is hotly anticipated as more than 30 companies made filings either for or against Enbridge in recent weeks. It will also settle a fracas that broke out in the oilpatch in August, when Enbridge launched an open season to call for the signing of long-term contracts on its Mainline pipeline network, which is a network of oil pipelines that move 2.85 million barrels of oil per day out of Western Canada to the U.S. Midwest and Central Canada.\n\nThe entirety of the system is currently available for spot-market shipments but Enbridge is calling for contracts on 90 per cent of the system \u2014 effectively inverting the amount of space available to the spot market at a time when all pipelines out of Canada are full and new pipeline projects have been delayed.\n\nShortly after the open season was announced, three companies \u2013 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc. and Shell Canada Ltd. \u2013 as well as industry group Explorers and Producers Association of Canada lodged complaints about the contracts with the CER.\n\nIn CNRL\u2019s case, the company attempted to highlight the magnitude of the financial commitment domestic oil producers are being asked to make.\n\n\u201cIf Canadian Natural were to commit all of its production to the Mainline, the financial commitment would range from $21 billion for eight-year commitments to $53 billion for 20-year commitments,\u201d the company wrote Sept. 13 in response to an Enbridge submission.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that CNRL, Canada\u2019s largest oil and gas company by volume, would attempt to ship all its oil on the Mainline because it has made other commitments, including to the Trans Mountain Expansion project.\n\nEach of those four complainants have asked the CER to delay Enbridge\u2019s contracting of the Mainline and called it an \u201cabuse of market power\u201d because companies are currently desperate for pipeline space.\n\n\u201cCompanies are making billions of dollars of commitments here and that\u2019s a serious concern for many,\u201d ARC Energy Research Institute senior director Jackie Forrest said.\n\nCompanies are making billions of dollars of commitments here and that\u2019s a serious concern for many Jackie Forrest, senior director, ARC Energy Research Institute\n\nShe also noted how tight the deadlines are between the time the CER makes its decision this week and when companies need to sign contracts to secure pipeline space. The open season is set to close on Oct. 2. \u201cTo have so little notice is a concern,\u201d she said.\n\nSince the initial four complaints were lodged in late August, 24 domestic oil companies have expressed their opposition to Enbridge\u2019s plans and filed letters supporting the complainants. The government of Saskatchewan is also siding with the complainants against Enbridge.\n\nThe issue has divided the local energy sector.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, Cenovus Energy Inc. and Imperial Oil Ltd. announced their support for Enbridge\u2019s open season process in addition to a number of U.S.-based refining companies including United Refining Co., Houston Refining LP and Marathon Petroleum Trading Canada LLC.\n\nEnbridge has argued throughout the process that an open season is a market-based process and the CER has never interfered in a market process. Those who wish to complain about the terms of the open season should do so when Enbridge applies to the CER to approve the contracts, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the open season is entirely consistent with the well-established practice of ensuring commercial support before seeking regulatory approval, a view that is shared by a range of customers,\u201d Enbridge said in an emailed statement.\n\nAnalysts say the pipeline giant would gain from a successful open season because the volumes on its Mainline would remain consistent even if competing pipelines such as the Trans Mountain expansion and TC Energy Corp.\u2019s Keystone XL are built.\n\n\u201cIt would be beneficial in terms of ensuring the volumes remain strong,\u201d DBRS managing director, energy Michael Rao said of Enbridge\u2019s motivation to contract the network.\n\nHowever, the company, which has $60 billion of long-term debt, would not likely see a hit to its credit rating if the contracts are not signed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that if they don\u2019t get (the contracts), it would have a negative impact,\u201d Rao said.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Friday's decision will affect future of spot market for domestic oil, but could have major implications for Enbridge", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/enbridge-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
