Almost half the league is shuffling quarterbacks in one form or another. The Los Angeles Rams had been the clear NFC favorite, and then they yielded 55 points to Tampa Bay. The Browns have already looked chic, overhyped and like a juggernaut. The AFC is one big muddle, with 13 of 16 teams sitting at 2-2 or worse.\n\nBut the season\u2019s first four weeks have established one rock-solid certainty: Mahomes is the overwhelming favorite to repeat as MVP. He dragged the Chiefs to a 34-30 victory over the Lions in Detroit, spearheading a 79-yard touchdown drive that ended with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Even after a sloppy game against a previously unbeaten team, the Chiefs are 4-0.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMahomes played on a different plane for the season\u2019s first three weeks. He shredded defenses for 1,195 yards and 10 touchdowns without throwing an interception, even after losing top wide receiver Tyreek Hill to an injury in Week 1. After throwing 50 touchdown passes in his first season as a starter, Mahomes showed that he was still evolving, meshing his extraterrestrial throwing arm with an improved understanding of Coach Andy Reid\u2019s offense.\n\nJerry Brewer: Patrick Mahomes was uniquely great last season. That doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t get even better.\n\nSunday in Detroit was different. Lions Coach Matt Patricia dropped defensive linemen into coverage, alternated rushing patterns and mixed up coverages. Mahomes completed seven of his first 14 passes for 90 yards. The Chiefs didn\u2019t score a touchdown on their first two trips to the red zone, and at one point in the second half they fumbled on three consecutive possessions.\n\nMahomes still found a way to be Mahomes. He ran for 54 yards, taking advantage of gaps when the Lions played man coverage and double-teamed outside receivers. On the Chiefs\u2019 final drive, the middle of the field opened on fourth and 8. Mahomes didn\u2019t hesitate, and his dash up the middle kept the Chiefs alive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Chiefs survived in part because cornerback Breshaud Breeland scooped a fumble at the goal line and returned it 100 yards for a defensive touchdown, essentially a 14-point swing. Mahomes still delivered with the most clutch regular season drive of his career.\n\n\u201cJust finding whatever way to win the football game,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you roll in this league. It\u2019s not always about the touchdowns and the yards \u2014 it\u2019s about finding a way to win. If that was running for the first down, if that was handing the ball off when I have my running backs work for me, I mean, I\u2019m going to do that. If you want to be great as a team, as a player, it\u2019s how you win the game. So for me, I\u2019m just going to go out there every single week and do whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nPatricia, the former New England Patriots defensive coordinator, could have given his old boss some clues about how to slow down Mahomes, the same way he shed light on stopping the Rams last year in a regular season meeting before the Patriots strangled the Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn every conversation regarding the Chiefs, the Patriots immediately become relevant. Until they played one another in the AFC championship game last year, the Chiefs and Patriots had a combined record of 25-9. In the playoff round prior, they won by a combined score of 72-41. At halftime of those divisional round games, they had built leads of 35-7 and 24-7.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nThe Patriots and Chiefs created a chasm between themselves and the AFC last year, and they have already done the same this season. The Ravens may be a worthy challenger, but they have lost two consecutive games in which they have surrendered more than 500 yards. Week 4 is going to end with only the Patriots, Chiefs and Buffalo Bills better than 2-2 in the AFC.\n\nThe Chiefs and Patriots have only further separated themselves in the AFC. Their coaches are way ahead of everyone else. Their quarterbacks are unfair in their own ways. The next four months will likely be about those two teams circling each other and determining where the rematch will be played. They play Dec. 28 in New England, and they will probably see each other in January, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Patriots are ever on the Chiefs\u2019 horizon, especially for Coach Andy Reid. He has done everything in the NFL except win the Super Bowl, and the reason has most often been the Patriots. The one time Reid made the Super Bowl, with the Philadelphia Eagles after the 2004 season, he lost to Belichick and the Patriots. In his six seasons in Kansas City, two of Reid\u2019s teams have won a playoff game. Both of them lost the following week to Belichick and the Patriots.\n\nBut he has never had a force like Mahomes. It\u2019s easy to forget that, at 24, Mahomes is still checking off boxes. He had, somewhat incredibly, never played in a dome before Sunday. The Lions entered unbeaten, and Mahomes has rarely beaten quality opponents \u2014 the Chiefs went 3-5 against playoff teams last season. He didn\u2019t have his best game Sunday, but that didn\u2019t prevent Mahomes from winning, or from showing what makes him the MVP.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n>>> The best player flying under the radar: Tampa Bay pass rusher Shaquil Barrett. In the Buccaneers\u2019 bonkers 55-40 victory over the Rams, Barrett recorded one sack, his league-leading ninth of the season. In the first four years of his career in Denver, Barrett recorded 14 sacks. Trapped behind Von Miller and Bradley Chubb with the Broncos, he signed a one-year deal with Tampa for $5 million. Entering Week 4, Pro Football Focus graded Barrett the sixth-best edge rusher in the NFL.\n\n>>> The Lions have a real chance in the NFC North. Their defense ranks among the NFL\u2019s best, especially if you discount the fourth quarter of their Week 1 tie in Arizona. But their case comes down to quarterback play. Matthew Stafford is playing some of the best football of his excellent career, and the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings both have significant issues. Chicago\u2019s Mitchell Trubisky left Sunday\u2019s 16-6 victory over the Vikings with a shoulder injury. Minnesota\u2019s Kirk Cousins remains a disaster against winning teams \u2014 he has looked borderline unplayable in losses to the Packers and, on Sunday, the Bears.\n\n>>> One play in the Sunday night game between the Dallas Cowboys and New Orleans Saints showed, again, why replay is the worst. Referees ruled that Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott had fumbled after he plowed forward for a first down on fourth and one. The officials made that call because it covered their backside \u2014 if they were wrong, they could always overturn it. Replay showed Elliott\u2019s elbow hitting the ground as the ball came out. He was probably down. But because the replay wasn\u2019t incontrovertible, the call of fumble stood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, replay persuaded the refs to make the wrong call on the field, and then it proved insufficient to correct that wrong call. Is that what anybody wants?\n\nRead more:\n\nNorman Chad: NFL replay exhaustion: Getting it right simply isn\u2019t everything\n\nAntonio Brown set to file grievances to pursue lost money from Raiders, Patriots\n\nThis NFL season has been filled with injuries and controversies.
