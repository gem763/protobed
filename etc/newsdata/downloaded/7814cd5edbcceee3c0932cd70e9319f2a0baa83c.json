He returned a few seconds later and kissed Rivest on her cheek without her permission before running off.\n\nRivest said the kiss was \"not appropriate\" but quickly got back to reporting. As she signed off, WAVE anchor John Boel asked her if she was OK, and Rivest replied that she \"might need some help\" after Boel mentioned a police officer who was near the shot.\n\nFollow Lucas Aulbach on Twitter @LucasAulbach.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Reporter Sara Rivest kissed on live WAVE 3 shot: Eric Goodman charged", "description": "Reporter Sara Rivest was doing a live shot outside the Bourbon & Beyond music festival in Kentucky when a man kissed and pretended to spank her.", "authors": ["Lucas Aulbach", "Louisville Courier Journal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I86LmLbEy3wXshAhNwCM5g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/11e6b1323ae944b7a18bbda5359e3f88", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
