CEO of CoinGecko, TM Lee, said:\n\n\u201cThis year, we have observed strong growth in the crypto derivatives market. [...] We are excited about the potential growth of crypto derivatives and look forward to further democratizing data access as we continue to commit to the maturation of the digital asset space.\u201d\n\nThe crypto derivatives markets have indeed seen rapid growth, reaching all-time-highs during the month of September. Derivatives giant BitMEX, for example, passed $9 billion in daily trading volume, as Bitcoin (BTC) took a moonshot of more than 40% in a single day.\n\nAlso, institutional BTC trading platform Bakkt experienced a massive jump, trading 1,183 Bitcoin futures contracts (around $11 million) on Oct. 25. Compared to just 331 contracts ($3.1 million) the day before, the increase in just 24 hours was close to 260%, dwarfing previous jumps, which themselves had resulted in all-time highs earlier in October.\n\nCoinGecko joined Coinfirm network\n\nIn August, CoinGecko announced that it had joined the network of blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering company Coinfirm in an attempt to improve its exchange Trust Score algorithm, as well as provide users with a means of reporting scams and hacks. CoinGecko apparently intends to make use of the AMLT Token Network alongside Coinfirm\u2019s Analytics and AML Platform in bolstering its ranking system.", "description": "Crypto market aggregator CoinGecko announces that it is launching its own cryptocurrency derivatives section", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy84YjVjMDU2NGExYmU4YzEzYjY2MjViYWQ3NWU1MzJkMy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
