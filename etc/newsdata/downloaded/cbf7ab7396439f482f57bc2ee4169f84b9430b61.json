In Washington, lawmakers are digesting reports that Trump will stonewall the impeachment inquiry until a full House vote. Jacob and his sister, meanwhile, are waiting for a table at Veselka, New York\u2019s iconic Ukrainian diner, which serves pierogi, borscht, and pancakes of both the refined-white-flour and potato varieties all day, every day. \u201cAre we celebrating? Are we eating in shame?,\u201d Jacob asks. He\u2019s not sure.\n\nJacob\u2019s friend Frank is staying abreast of the news: \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s not a lot. Trump literally used his office, called up the Ukrainian president, and said, \u2018Hey, can you do this for me? Investigate my political rival.\u2019 It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d An hour later, the hostess, Kayla, tells me about her years-long obsession with Ukraine, which has included learning Russian. \u201cI think it\u2019s really cool that people are paying attention to Ukraine again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a country struggling on its own since 2014. Their economy plummeted, and they were left hanging with all these empty promises from other countries.\u201d She says the restaurant has been slammed for her entire shift. \u201cIt\u2019s always insane here, especially in the wintertime, but today has been really crazy.\u201d\n\nSitting at the counter inside, I strike up a conversation with a purple-haired woman to my right wearing a cleaver-shaped necklace stamped FEMINIST.\n\n(It\u2019s a good litmus test on first dates, she says.) \u201cI\u2019m more interested in looking ahead toward the primaries,\u201d she tells me over a double order of fried pierogi. \u201cIf Trump gets impeached, we\u2019re still stuck with Pence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy, and I\u2019m just blown away by how Republicans are nonchalantly blowing [Trump\u2019s behavior] off,\u201d Michael, a 26-year-old drawn to Ukrainian cuisine by the sudden cold snap, says outside the restaurant. \u201cBut then I\u2019m also onboard with the conspiracy theory that the world ended in 2012 and we\u2019re all projected into an alternate universe.\u201d His mood darkens as he and his friend Christina continue talking about the chaos that is American democracy.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would say impeachment is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\nAt the end of the day, what is it going to prove \u2014 the fact that you can do it?,\u201d Morgan, another patron on the sidewalk, tells me. \u201cIf you like him, you like him, and if he\u2019s impeached, you\u2019re just gonna be like, \u2018The damn liberals!\u2019 \u201d I ask a group of NYU students if they think the Ukraine news subliminally led them here. \u201cAlcohol brought me here, basically,\u201d says Caleb, a film student. \u201cIt just feels like there\u2019s no precedent for this president.\u201d Bethany, who is studying journalism, adds, \u201cIt could happen, it could not happen \u2026 we\u2019re just going to eat some pierogi in the meantime.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
