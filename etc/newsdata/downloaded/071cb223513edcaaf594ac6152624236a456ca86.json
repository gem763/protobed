Andy Bales, chief executive of Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles, told HuffPost on Thursday. \u201cThis is a FEMA-like disaster that needs urgent attention, and although local authorities are doing more than they\u2019ve ever done, it\u2019s not at the urgent pace needed to rescue people from the streets.\u201d\n\nOfficials from the White House, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Domestic Policy Council toured the city\u2019s skid row and several shelters as part of a fact-finding mission to explore a federal response to California\u2019s homelessness.\n\nBales helped lead the group\u2019s tour and said he came away \u201cvery hopeful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey saw the conditions. They saw the human waste, the people living in tents,\u201d Bales said. The government officials \u201cassured they were only here to help people. I took them at their word.\u201d\n\nPatrick Fallon/Reuters Tents and tarps erected by homeless people are shown along sidewalks and streets in the skid row area of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nNearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s homeless residents live in California, with homelessness on the rise throughout the state. Los Angeles saw a 12% increase in homeless residents from 2018 to 2019, according to a recent count. The number of homeless people in San Francisco went up 17% and in Alameda County (which includes Oakland) up 43% since 2017.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) noted in July that the Trump administration has been \u201cdecreasing the social safety net to address the reasons people are on streets and sidewalks in the first place.\u201d The president\u2019s 2020 budget proposal released earlier this year called for sweeping cuts to affordable housing programs.\n\n\u201cFinding solutions to homelessness should not be partisan,\u201d said Sherilyn Adams, the executive director of Larkin Street Youth Services in San Francisco. \u201cHowever, as this country\u2019s affordability crisis has skyrocketed, President Trump has proposed slashing billions of dollars in affordable housing programs that support our most vulnerable residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that President Trump means business and commits significant federal dollars to augment local efforts to solve homelessness across California,\u201d Adams told HuffPost.\n\nAmong the options the Trump administration was considering was a plan to clear street encampments in Los Angeles and other cities and move homeless people into government-run facilities, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nThe White House did not confirm the Post\u2019s report and framed the visit as a fact-finding mission. But even the suggestion of such sweeps raised alarm among advocates.\n\nHeather Freinkel, the managing attorney at the Homeless Action Center in Oakland, said encampment evictions can \u201cdramatically undermine residents\u2019 efforts to secure housing, employment and medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring sweeps, residents\u2019 documents, cellphones, medications and survival supplies are often destroyed,\u201d Freinkel told HuffPost. \u201cResidents are reluctant to leave their tents to engage in services because they fear that everything they own will be taken. When this does happen, it is devastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, forcibly evicting encampment residents should never be part of any plan,\u201d she said.\n\nThe administration has not yet indicated how it intends to move forward, but advocates offered some suggestions.\n\nBales said he suggested to the visiting officials that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers be enlisted to build structures for homeless individuals.\n\n\u201cI will continue to remind people that you can\u2019t sweep the encampments away until you provide a healthy, safe place for people to go,\u201d he said.\n\nFreinkel suggested the government begin by further investing in and improving access to existing programs like food stamps, Supplemental Security Income and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\n\nWhatever Trump decides, Freinkel said, \u201cefforts to address homelessness should be led by homeless people and those with expertise working in the field. When someone doesn\u2019t have enough money to afford California\u2019s skyrocketing rents, they should not lose the right to autonomy over the conditions of their life.\u201d", "description": "White House officials toured skid row in Los Angeles this week on a fact-finding mission to explore options for addressing the growing crisis.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7acbfe3b00002b88d1d0bf.jpeg?cache=5p67butgwf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
