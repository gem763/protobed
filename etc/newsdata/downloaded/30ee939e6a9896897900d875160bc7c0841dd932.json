They trade on a P/E of over 14 versus a long-term average of a little under 12.5.\n\nThis is despite only creeping credit growth and a general consensus that lenders will find it hard to grow revenue in the coming years. That, in turn, will pressure payouts and likely cruel higher dividends, if not lead them lower. Indeed, bank earnings peaked all the way back in 2015, Macquarie says.\n\nEven worse, if you pull out banks, insurers and listed property stocks, the rump \u201cindustrial\u201d section of the ASX is on a P/E of nearly 23.\n\n\u201cWe believe the rise [in valuations this year] is driven by lower global bond yields, and demand for the high dividend yield on ASX industrials,\u201d Macquarie analysts note.\n\n\u201cBut 23 is a high valuation nonetheless, and it is hard to be bullish after the ASX is already up 18.5 per cent\u201d year-to-date.\n\nHard to be bullish, but not impossible. After all, the sharemarket started the year at a relatively low point following the steep falls in the final months of 2018. And given the wave of global monetary easing, it\u2019s not especially surprising that asset prices have been well supported.\n\nThe hope is that we are mostly through what MST Marquee strategist Hasan Tevfik calls a \u201cmid-cycle slowdown\u201d in the global and local economy. This appears the consensus among investors around the developed world: central banks will stave off recession and extend the American expansion for a further year or three. On that basis, equities are reasonable value given \u2013 again \u2013 where bond yields are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a gentle turning point in the local economy \u2013 which is the base case for the RBA and economists \u2013 needs to be met with something like a steadying in the global backdrop.\n\nThis is crucial: high equity valuations can be justified by low rates only as long as we don't have a severe downturn or recession. In other words, stocks at these levels are OK value as long as central banks can keep the cycle going.\n\nRight now, this is not a sure bet.\n\nFierce blow\n\nIn particular, a poor reading from a key US manufacturing survey on Tuesday night dealt a fierce blow to the idea that we are past the worst of the global slowdown.\n\nAmerica's Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity dropped 1.3 points to a reading of 47.8 in September, the lowest level since June 2009. The crucial line in the sand for these measures, generally known as purchasing managers' indices, or PMIs, is a reading of 50. A reading below that level indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity, and vice versa.\n\n\"Trade is wreaking havoc on sentiment,\" RBC Capital US economist Tom Porcelli says, referring to the worsening dispute between the world's two biggest economies.\n\n\"Thankfully, the [American] consumer has been able to brush this aside on the back of strong job and wage gains, but it is fair to wonder how long they can be relentlessly pelted with ugly before they step to the side,\" Porcelli says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, it reinforced the idea that the malaise was spreading to previously resilient parts of the world economy. If the first two RBA rate cuts this year were in response to a deterioration domestically, this week's move was in response to events overseas.\n\nEventually, the narrative goes, monetary policy will be truly exhausted and unable to kick the proverbial can any further down the road. Sometime around this point governments will ride to the rescue with an injection of economy-stimulating fiscal policies.\n\nIn Australia, financial sector economists are unanimous in the view that there is plenty of space in the budget and government balance sheet for more spending, and that it should be used to support demand.\n\nSo far Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has remained committed to achieving a surplus and ignored the RBA\u2019s increasingly pointed references to the need for fiscal support.\n\nHowever, it's easy to imagine that once the government has achieved its goal of balancing the budget and earned the boasting rights for the next decade or so, it will feel free to move to a more expansionary setting.\n\nIndeed, economists at Morgan Stanley expect a fiscal response next year. This will \u201callow the RBA to stay on hold in 2020 and not resort to QE [quantitative easing] measures\u201d.\n\nThey predict, as do a growing number of experts, that the RBA will cut again before the end of the year, which will bring the cash rate down to 0.5 per cent, but that it will not need to go further.\n\nHopefully some of that mooted extra government support will be directed towards productivity-enhancing projects that create the settings for a structural improvement in our economy.\n\nMonetary policy helps manage the economic cycle, but can\u2019t do anything to solve structural issues. As RBA boss Philip Lowe recently warned, without structural reforms rates will stay low for a \u201cvery, very long time\u201d.", "description": "Shares still look reasonable value if you believe monetary easing remains effective today and that fiscal stimulus will come to the rescue tomorrow.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e46c8b958bc31e3a524e291ae944417ecae5e0b", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
