The president's son said they have taken action not to solicit business from foreign governments.\n\n\u201cUnlike every other hotel company, while our father is President of the United States, we have imposed voluntary restrictions and have chosen not to market, nor solicit, foreign government business during his time in office,\u201d he continued, adding that the president is \u201cthe first\u201d in history to donate his entire presidential salary to the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cHe has made countless voluntary sacrifices, and while none of them are legally required, his commitment to turn away significant business during his time in office, is undoubtedly a selfless act and a major sacrifice, especially in a market dominated by foreign embassies, government patronage, and international delegations,\u201d the president's son said.\n\nHe added: \u201cDespite these sacrifices, the sizable donation of foreign income made by the Trump Organization to the United States Treasury every year, and the great lengths we go through to discourage foreign government business, Trump International Hotel Washington D.C. has become the #1 Hotel in our Nation\u2019s Capital.\u201d\n\nThe hotel, located at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, is in Washington's Old Post Office Building.\n\nAccording to Trump's most recent financial disclosure, the 263-room hotel took in $41 million in revenue last year, up less than half a million dollars from the previous year.\n\nIn his statement, Eric Trump addressed concerns about conflicts of interest by noting the company cuts a check to the U.S. Treasury each year for what it calculates as \"profit\" from foreign government business at its hotels and other properties. That amounted to $191,538 last year, up from $151,470 the previous year.\n\nThe Trump Organization said it has retained real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle to consider offers.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump Organization said Friday it is exploring the sale of the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C., amid ethics complaints and accusations from Democratic\u00a0critics that President Trump is improperly profiting from it\u00a0while serving in the White House.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
