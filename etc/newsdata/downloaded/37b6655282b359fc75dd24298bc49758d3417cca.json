He was fired Wednesday as a tennis coach at Lynbrook High in San Jose. (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nThe California judge who was recalled from office over his lenient sentence for Brock Turner, a college student convicted of felony sexual assault, was relieved of his role Wednesday as a girls\u2019 junior varsity tennis coach at a high school in San Jose.\n\nMichael Aaron Persky was removed from office as a judge on the Santa Clara County Superior Court in 2018 after a recall effort by voters dissatisfied with the light sentence for Turner, a swimmer at Stanford University. Persky\u2019s opponents alleged Turner\u2019s gender, race and class privilege spared him from a harsher sentence.\n\nPersky sentenced him to six months of incarceration, of which Turner only served three, plus three years of probation and lifetime registration as a sex offender.\n\nPersky was hired over the summer at Lynbrook High, a school of close to 1,800 students in San Jose, but lost the job on Wednesday after public outcry.\n\n\u201cWe believe this outcome is in the best interest of our students and school community,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Fremont Union High School District said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cThe District will begin the search for a new coach immediately with the goal of ensuring that the athletes on the JV tennis team are able to have a successful season. Both the Lynbrook and District staff will be supporting the team and their families throughout this transition.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman told The Post in another statement earlier Wednesday that Persky\u2019s connection to the Turner case was \u201cbrought to our attention\u201d last week.\n\n\u201cMr. Persky is in his first year as an athletic coach in our District,\u201d that statement continued. \u201cHe applied for the open coaching position over the summer and successfully completed all of the District\u2019s hiring requirements before starting as a coach, including a fingerprint background check. He was a qualified applicant for the position, having attended several tennis coaching clinics for youth and holds a high rating from the U.S. Tennis Association.\n\n\u201cIn response to concerns from some members of our community, we held a meeting with the parents of both the JV and varsity girls\u2019 tennis teams on Sept. 9 to provide parents with background on the situation. Our focus remains on ensuring that our students have the best possible educational experience \u2014 both academically and athletically.\u201d\n\nAn online petition was posted to Change.org asking Lynbrook Principal Maria Jackson to remove Persky from the coaching position and said his hiring \u201cdevalues everything the survivor has been through, the courage of the story told, and her incredible strength to stand up for what she believes in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we allow girls aged 13-18 to be under surveillance and authority of a man who has a repeated history of allowing severe rape and sexual assault cases to be brushed under the rug?\u201d the petition asks.\n\nThe news of Persky\u2019s hiring comes not even a week after Chanel Miller, the survivor of Turner\u2019s assault, revealed her identity in a memoir titled \u201cKnow My Name.\u201d\n\nMiller was a graduate student at the time of the assault and attended a fraternity party with her younger sister on Stanford\u2019s campus, she told Persky\u2019s courtroom in her victim impact statement. She was known during the proceedings only as \u201cEmily Doe.\u201d\n\nShe drank too fast, she said, misunderstanding her alcohol tolerance since her undergrad days, and blacked out, recalling only that she awoke on a gurney in a hospital hallway to the news she had been assaulted.\n\nTwo international students biking past found Turner on top of Miller around 1 a.m. and confronted him when they observed Miller was not conscious. Turner tried to run from the scene but was tackled by the two international students, who held him until police arrived.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me,\u201d Miller told him in court, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\n\nTurner was convicted on three felony counts of sexual assault and faced a maximum of 14 years in prison. Prosecutors asked for six years of incarceration. Probation officials suggested a \u201cmoderate\u201d jail term. Persky imposed a fraction of those recommendations, which spurred a recall effort.\n\nMiller called the sentence \u201ca soft timeout.\u201d\n\nPersky was the first California jurist to be removed from office midterm by voters in 86 years.\n\nHe wrote in a statement responding to the recall effort, \u201cAs a judge, my role is to consider both sides. California law requires every judge to consider rehabilitation and probation for first-time offenders. It\u2019s not always popular, but it\u2019s the law, and I took an oath to follow it without regard to public opinion or my opinions as a former prosecutor.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t sway Californians at the ballot box who ousted him by a 23 percent margin.\n\n\u201cAs this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone\u2019s first sexual assault or digital rape,\u201d Miller told Persky\u2019s courtroom. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly. We should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nA victory by a swimmer disqualified for a \u2018wedgie\u2019 is reinstated by Alaska officials\n\nNFL will consider placing Antonio Brown on paid leave and making him ineligible to play\n\nChristian Yelich\u2019s injury is probably fatal to the Brewers\u2019 postseason hopes\n\nSome thought Benjamin Watson dunked on Laura Ingraham.
