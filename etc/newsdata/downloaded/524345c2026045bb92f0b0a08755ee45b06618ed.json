Are more coming?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Lowell Cafe in West Hollywood, California, is the first restaurant in the U.S. where you can order and openly consume marijuana. Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY\n\nWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2013 As the first restaurant in the U.S. where you can openly smoke cannabis, Lowell Cafe had a few things to sort out.\n\nFirst off, they came up with the term \u201cFlower Host,\u201d a sort-of sommelier for cannabis. This employee, who\u2019s separate from the server, typically has budtending experience and can recommend different strains of indica/sativa from Lowell\u2019s vast menu of flowers, pre-roll packs, vapes and edibles.\n\nThen there\u2019s the $30 \u201ctokage fee,\u201d like a corkage fee if you BYO weed. Customers who choose to get high on their own supply can pay for a Flower Host to roll their joint at the table.\n\nHowever, there's still something that Lowell Cafe needs to resolve: How to turn over tables faster.\n\nThis vase with a fake flower and pre-rolled smokes are among the many cannabis offerings at Lowell Cafe. (Photo: Sandy Hooper)\n\n\u201cWe definitely have to figure out a process of gently getting people to leave,\u201d says executive chef Andrea Drummer, who sees lines out the door of her restaurant and reservations nearly fully booked a month out.\n\nBut it\u2019s challenging to interrupt guests\u2019 positive feedback loop.\n\n\u201cI have food, I have cannabis, I\u2019m gonna want to order more food,\u201d Drummer says. \u201cThey just want to hang out.\u201d\n\nWhat makes a cannabis cafe special?\n\nWere it not for the cafe's herbal scent and smoky atmosphere (made less so with fans, ventilators and air-purifying plants), at first glance Lowell Cafe is just like any other scene-y rooftop restaurant in Los Angeles. It has dozens of hanging plants, collages of vintage photographs, wooden accents, high ceilings and an altogether Instagramable rustic/chic vibe.\n\nSo-called Flower Hosts take cannabis orders and servers get non-infused food orders at Lowell Cafe. Checks for cannabis and food are separate. (Photo: Sandy Hooper)\n\nBut spend some time there and you notice differences. The clientele is so diverse that it becomes hard to imagine people of so many ages and races gathering together at any other place. The staff is so extraordinarily approachable you might mistake them for new best friends. The noise of conversation and music is relatively low considering the place is at capacity with a line out the door. Oh, and people are smoking out of ornate glassware.\n\nIn short: America\u2019s first restaurant to open with a cannabis consumption license is chill. And it also happens to serve a mix of trendy comfort food such as fried chicken sandwiches, banh mi and vegan nachos that are meant to complement the THC (Flower Hosts can recommend pairings) and satisfy even the worst cases of the munchies.\n\nRestricted by confusing marijuana laws\n\nIn order to legally sell food and cannabis, Lowell Cafe\u2019s had to get creative.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s the California rule that only dispensaries may sell cannabis products and paraphernalia, so Lowell Cafe is technically a dispensary at the state level while operating as a \u201ccannabis consumption lounge\u201d on the city level (cannabis is still illegal under federal law). In order to abide by the laws, Lowell Cafe technically keeps their farm-to-table kitchen and dining area separate from its cannabis consumption area, though guests seated at either location can order cannabis and/or food. Checks for food (which is considered distinct from infused edibles) and cannabis are separated. And since there are laws against alcohol and cannabis being consumed at the same location, the bar is dry.\n\nThere are other things Lowell staffers do to follow the rules, such as requiring customers to finish cannabis product on premises. They also request cash for cannabis purchases because federal prohibition makes some financial institutions wary of processing state-legal cannabis transactions.\n\nThe restaurant has short-term plans to open an outdoor section for non-smokers. And in the long-term, Drummer hopes to infuse cannabis right into the entrees.\n\n\u201cOnce the laws evolve and there is some sense of levity and normalcy brought to the experience for the masses,\u201d Drummer says. \u201cIt's definitely something that I would love to see happen, and hopefully it does sooner than later.\u201d\n\nMore weed-friendly restaurants are on the way\n\nLowell Farms, which opened this month, is the first of eight West Hollywood businesses to be granted licenses for on-site cannabis consumption. (Photo: Sandy Hooper)\n\nLowell Cafe was the first of eight businesses to be granted cannabis consumption licenses in West Hollywood, the only city in the Los Angeles area that allows for on-site consumption. That means seven more cannabis-friendly properties could open in the area soon.\n\nElsewhere in California, pot lounges are legal in San Francisco and on-site consumption permits are available or should be issued soon in Oakland, Alameda and Palm Springs, according to pro-cannabis lobbying group Marijuana Policy Project's Karen O'Keefe.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Californians who can expect more places to smoke marijuana.\n\nOther states that could allow for legal smoking in public include: Colorado, which will issue licenses for cannabis cafes starting in 2020; Illinois, which made marijuana legal starting Jan. 1; Michigan, which is beginning to accept marijuana business licenses in November; and Alaska, where on-site consumption is expected to begin in several cities in the coming months.\n\nWhy allow for more cannabis consumption?\n\nO'Keefe cites a 2018 Gallup poll as a way to advocate making weed more widely available. According to the study, two in three Americans now support legalizing marijuana. (Gallup hasn\u2019t released its 2019 cannabis poll yet.)\n\nMore chill vibes on the way? Cannabis cafe could be opening in more states. (Photo: Sandy Hooper)\n\n\u201cTwo thirds of Americans think that marijuana should be legal for adults. Allowing adults to gather somewhere socially and consume cannabis in a regulated setting is something that just makes sense to a lot of people,\u201d O'Keefe says, adding allowing for open consumption would help to destigmatize the use of a substance that, as advocates have long argued, \u201cis much safer than alcohol.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s that reason to open more cannabis cafes in the U.S. that\u2019s hard to quantify: They'd likely bring more chill vibes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/10/15/cannabis-cafe-lowell-more-weed-smoking-restaurants-coming-to-us/3936738002/", "description": "The first cannabis restaurant in the U.S., Lowell Cafe, has arrived.
