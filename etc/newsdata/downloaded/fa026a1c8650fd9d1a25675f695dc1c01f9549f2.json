However, the meeting was nixed due to the Taliban\u2019s role in a deadly bombing in Kabul last week that resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier.\n\nOn Monday's show, Noah joked that Taliban leaders actually didn\u2019t want to visit Camp David in the first place.\n\nCNN\u2019S JIM SCIUTTO UNDER FIRE FOR \u2018SIMPLY FALSE\u2019 ANTI-TRUMP REPORT CONDEMNED BY CIA, WHITE HOUSE\n\n\u201cThe Taliban didn\u2019t want to come to America, firstly because they don\u2019t trust the United States, which I understand. They\u2019re, like, \u2018We\u2019re not coming there,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSecondly, because they probably don\u2019t want to deal with the T.S.A. Can you imagine how stressful that sh-- is going to be for them?\u201d\n\nNoah continued: \u201cThe Taliban refused to come to America and Trump tweeted out, \u2018No, I\u2019m breaking up with you guys,\u2019 and, so, there\u2019s a possibility that the war in Afghanistan will continue now because Trump has put a photo opportunity above peace. Yeah, which, according to WebMD is a classic symptom of a p-ssy a\u2014b---h.\u201d\n\nTrump wants to start withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and eventually end U.S. involvement in the conflict that is closing in on 18 years - but has now said he is done negotiating.\n\n\u201cThey thought they had to kill people in order to put them in a little better negotiating position,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that with me.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump's announcement surprised many people because it means he was ready to host members of the Taliban at the presidential retreat in Maryland just days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nMore than 2,400 U.S. troops have been killed since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to go after the Taliban, who were harboring Al Qaeda leaders responsible for 9/11.\n\nTrump defended his intention to host the Taliban at Camp David: \u201cThere have been plenty of so-called bad people brought up to Camp David for meetings. The alternative was the White House and you wouldn\u2019t have been happy with that, either.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah said Monday that President Trump canceled a planned meeting with Taliban representatives at Camp David because he\u2019s a \u2018p-ssy a\u2014b---h.\u2019", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
