Stocks have been yielding more than 10-yr Treasuries; SP500 fwd P/E of 18 translates into earnings yield of 5.5% [but you don\u2019t get to pocket that].\n\nProspects of money-losing WeWork/WeCo IPO are poor \u2013 it may reduce its IPO valuation or may postpone it. It may be better to invest in 2 office REITs [SLG, VNO] that are active in weak NYC market.\n\nEuropean stocks [fwd P/E 14; heavy in financials, cyclicals] have lagged the US stocks [heavy in growth techs] for several years. European dividend yields are higher.\n\nValue perked up last week but there are not many value investors around anymore. A value play is in investment management firms BEN, PZN.\n\nPg 11, Streetwise: Athleisure \u2013 athletic wear in casual and/or work settings \u2013 may be more than a fad. It is benefitting LULU, NKE, VFC. There are new clothing and shoes with breathable materials. Consumers are going for brand names rather than generic styles.\n\nIs there a stock bubble in the US? Top 5 [MSFT, AAPL, AMAN, GOOGL, FB] trade at high but not ludicrous valuations. But sector earnings may be another matter. Almost 28% of the earnings of all US stocks are now from tech and e-commerce. That share may continue to grow some more but may be vulnerable to public and government backlash against disruptive tech, regulations, breakup threats. Compare that with the top of the housing bubble when 29% of all earnings were from financials, and the top of the dot.com bubble when 25% of all earnings were from tech.\n\nPg 14-15: ECB monetary policy announcement on Thursday.\n\nDrug maker Mallinckrodt [MNK] is now a penny stock. It has been hurt by its huge price hikes, questionable sales practices, opioid lawsuits.\n\nBuyers and media are not too excited by the upcoming AAPL release of iPhone 11 on Tuesday. It is being thought of a placeholder until the new 5G iPhone arrives next year.\n\nData this week: Consumer credit on Monday; small business optimism index, JOLTS report on Tuesday; PPI, wholesale trade on Wednesday; CPI, ECB monetary policy announcement on Thursday; retail sales, UM consumer sentiment, business inventories on Friday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: 3 undervalued stocks with some price momentum [T, DHI, MCK; pg 17];\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self standing\n\nPg 16: Accounting allows some flexibility and many companies may use that aggressively. These include treatments of capitalization of some costs [vs expensing them]; reserves [for warrantees, returns, bad debts]; adjustments to earnings [restructuring, gains/losses, etc that are supposed to be one-time but may keep reappearing]; depreciation [changing schedules]; pension accounting assumptions [about interest rates, wage increases, market returns]. Then there may be different methods used for regulatory or tax filings vs general reporting [for depreciation, pensions, etc].\n\nPg 18: Cover Story, \u201cHow to Fix the Global Retirement Crisis\u201d. Aging is a global issue and countries are addressing it in different ways. Globally, 9% of the population is 65+ [28% in Japan] and it will be 16% by 2050. In Japan, older people are working longer \u2013 not just for money but for social engagement. Australia encourages people to save more for retirement; it also has mandatory and fully employer-funded pension system [superannuation accounts] that provide basic means-tested retirement income. Sweden has universal long-term care [LTC]. China requires [2013- ] children to regularly visit their aging parents. Several countries have programs similar to the US Social Security.\n\nPg 23: Italy spends 16% of its GDP on pension benefits. Italian public debt is high at 130% of GDP. Population is aging rapidly. Retirees have been hurt by Italy\u2019s fiscal issue and by EU-Italy tensions. Pension benefits are changed every time the government changes [which is quite often].\n\nPg 24: Dividend-growth ETFs [VIG, NOBL, DGRO, etc] are outperforming current-dividend ETFs [DVY, HDV, SPHD, etc]. Better performing dividend-growth funds have higher % in techs.\n\nPg 25: The Fed uses jobs data among its various inputs, but downward revisions in jobs data means that the Fed may have been misled by fresh jobs data. This has been a gradual recovery with sluggish jobs growth. The Fed uses unemployment rate that has its flaws. Looking at 25-54 year old group [prime working age group], 82% had jobs in 2000 [all-time peak], 80% in 2007 [cycle peak], 75% in 2009 [cycle bottom], 76% in 2013, 80% now.\n\nPg 26: Mobile games have become big business in just 10 years: ATVI [ Candy Crush , etc], ZNGA [ Words With Friends , etc], GLUU [ Diner Dash , etc], Finland\u2019s Rovio [ Angry Birds , etc].\n\nPg 27: Comanager Bob Bergson of small-cap NSGRX selects stocks based on margins, debt, cash flow, etc. The fund is divided in 3 parts \u2013 micro-caps [30%], SC-value [35%], SC-growth [35%].\n\nPg 29: Walmart [WMT] changed its policy on gun and ammunition sales after a push from John Streur, CEO of Calvert an ESG specialist. In 2018, on his push, Kroger [KR] also changed its policy on gun sales. Streur owns a cattle ranch where guns are used for hunting, but he supports general regulation on guns. EV bought Calvert in 2016 and the ESG side at Calvert and the general side at EV cooperate well. ESG funds are having record inflows according to M* data.\n\nPg 32: Jens Nordvig, Exante Data . Name of his the firm [2016- ] means \u201cbefore the event\u201d and Jens has done that with Turkey, dollar, yuan, US-China trade war. US intervention for dollar is unlikely but it is prudent to prepare for it; other possibilities include tax on capital inflows that, if imposed, may hurt the reserve status of dollar, etc. US economic slowdown without any fiscal stimulus in the election year may be bad optics for the WH. Tariffs are creating pressures/disruptions on the economy. Tariffs are like tax on the US consumers \u2013 at about 1% of the GDP being collected now by the US Treasury, they will bite the consumers. Chinese will act slow and will use easier monetary policies that may weaken yuan [or stabilize depending on how the trade talks go]. What is interesting and different is that China can now make adjustments to yuan just by its daily fixings and releasing that news \u2013 they don\u2019t have to spend any of their foreign currency reserves for intervention [as they did in 2015-16]. And Chinese exports are shifting from the US to Europe and other parts of the world. Several central banks [Russia, Brazil, Switzerland, etc] have also moved some of their reserves into Chinese bonds. Euro will continue to weaken as the ECB eases monetary policy with \u201cimplicit approval\u201d from Lagarde [incoming] to Draghi [outgoing; normally would be lame duck]. Japanese yen will continue to strengthen as a safe haven play. The UK sterling has weakened too much with the political and Brexit chaos there and may rebound depending on the developments there. Bond yields will continue to fall. With negative yields in Europe, Europeans have no where to go for income but to the US and EMs. If one avoids EM minefields like Argentina, Turkey, then one can be fine with EM bonds [Indonesia, Philippines, Mexico, Brazil]. All this global easing and decline in bond yields will be good for gold; many central banks are adding gold to their reverses for diversification and they are not sensitive to the price of gold. Nobody cries when gold goes up like when oil and most commodities do.\n\nPg 34: Avi Tiomkin, Advisor to Hedge Funds. Global economy is slowing and deflationary trends are growing. Policy responses are needed with more government spending, issuance of more government bonds and aim for higher rates. The past monetary stimulus and lower rates have exhausted their usefulness \u2013 they increase savings; lower spending; harm banks, pension funds, insurance companies. On the other hand, corporations are binging on low rate debt for buybacks, M&A and these may hurt them in the next downturn.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nNone\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 7, Up & Down Wall Street: Stocks rose on the news of US-China talks in October.
