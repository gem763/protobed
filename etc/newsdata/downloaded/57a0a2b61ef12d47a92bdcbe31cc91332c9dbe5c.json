You said you had no appointments this week?\"\n\nAfter Danielle explained that she was fully booked, but could try to fit her in next week, the woman argued that she'd spotted her in Tesco and Danielle 'could [have] done [her] nails' because she had 'time to go [to] Tesco'.\n\nAs Danielle's anger rose, she replied \"yes that's right. I work Mon - Sat. I do need to eat and so do my three children, which [may I] say are five and under.\n\n\"It's 9pm I've worked all day and not seen my children due to work, so I apologise I was out doing a food shop and not doing your nails.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nStill arguing her case, the woman then claimed \"I just wouldn't expect to see someone shopping when they said they had ZERO APPOINTMENTS! I found someone else anyway who works actual late night and will work around her clients!\"\n\nThis caused Danielle to lose her cool and reply: \"Fan dabby dozy then baby cakes, now swerve your arse rough out of my DMs and go suck a big fat hairy toe you bone idle idiot!!'\n\nDanielle, from Manchester, later said: \"She was fuming. It's just pathetic.\n\n\"I was angry at first, but now it makes me laugh. I can't even go shopping now.\n\n\"I'd rather not do her nails - she can go somewhere else. Losing someone like this isn't the end of the world. She'd only been here a couple of times before.\n\n\"I've not heard back from her since then. She blocked me on Instagram now.\"\n\nAfter cutting her day short for the rare appointment, she then went home to see her two older sons, Jamie, five, and Jack, 20 months, when she received the pushy message around 9pm.\n\nThe enraged customer argued she should 'work around her clients' instead of buying groceries.\n\nThe hard-working Danielle says she has received abuse before, after refusing to book a client's pedicure when nine months pregnant because she couldn't bend down far enough.\n\nDanielle said: \"Earlier this year, when I was still pregnant with Teddy, someone told me they'd 'sit on my side' and called me a 'fat b***h' because I wouldn't do their toes while I was nine months pregnant.\n\n\"I always get messages like this all the time. There's no need to be nasty.\"\n\nDanielle is now pleading with beauty salon customers to remember that beauticians and nail technicians 'have lives as well'.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\nDanielle said: \"My friends and family are fuming because everyone knows I try really hard to fit everyone in.\n\n\"My advice to people is please have patience. People who work in beauty have lives as well.\n\n\"It's hard work trying to fit around three children as well, but people need to be patient with their messages.\"", "description": "The client was annoyed beauty therapist Danielle Edwards told her she couldn't fit her in - because she was looking after her son", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media", "Birmingham Mail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559240.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
