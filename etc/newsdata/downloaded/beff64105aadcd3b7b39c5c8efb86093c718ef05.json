Lomu passed away shortly after the Rugby World Cup in 2015, aged 40, from a heart attack.\n\n\u201cWhen I was little, he was the big star in New Zealand, and I loved Jonah, I had posters of him up on my wall,\u201d Japan captain Michael Leitch, who was born in New Zealand, told CNN earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI used to get haircuts like him. He was awesome. We\u2019ve had no other player like him come through, I don\u2019t think. So, you know, Jonah, he\u2019s done so much for rugby in general.\u201d\n\nIn researching the mini series, the documentary makers discovered a familiar strand throughout Lomu\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cEveryone had a Jonah Lomu story,\u201d scriptwriter Pip Hall reveals to CNN. \u201cHe was that kind of guy, that really connected with people.\u201d\n\nStardom\n\nLomu first shot into the international sporting consciousness in 1995, at the Rugby World Cup in South Africa.\n\nA devastating, powerful runner and a lethal finisher, the All Blacks wing became synonymous with the World Cup, despite never actually winning the tournament.\n\nHis team lost to the host in that \u201995 final, but the sight of Lomu steamrolling would-be tacklers launched him into a level of stardom not yet seen in the then-amateur sport of rugby union.\n\nWhat we could not know then was what would later be revealed by the man himself in his autobiography, \u201cJonah My Story,\u201d in which he detailed the disruption in his young life.\n\nAfter time spent living with an aunt and uncle in Tonga, he grew up mainly in a tough suburb of south Auckland with his mother and often violent, heavy-drinking father. Lomu opened up about his flirtations with gangs, and mother Hepi\u2019s decision to send him to Auckland\u2019s Wesley College in the hope of finding a better path for her son.\n\n\u201cRugby is what is it now because of him -- his talent was recognised by everyone\u201d Former France fly-half Fred Michalak\n\nLomu went on to become the face of a game, the ambassador for a global sport. This inevitably became taxing, and as we would discover in the later years of Lomu\u2019s short life, finances would also be an issue.\n\nIn the aftermath of Lomu\u2019s sudden passing in 2015, the New Zealand Rugby Players Association (NZRPA) set up the Jonah Lomu Legacy Trust to care for his two children.\n\nAs NZRPA chief executive Rob Nichol said at the time: \u201cIt appears that because of Jonah\u2019s well-known generosity, he had taken on obligations, financial and otherwise, to support others at the expense of himself, (wife) Nadene and the children.\n\n\u201cIt is also apparent that his 20-year illness and long dialysis sessions, multiple times a week, affected him far more than people realised, including his ability to work and earn the type of money people probably assumed he was capable of earning.\u201d\n\nAlthough Lomu also played for the Auckland Blues, the Hurricanes and the Chiefs in Super Rugby, as well as in Europe with Cardiff Blues and Marseille, it was the star\u2019s heroics in black that set him apart.\n\nLomu played in one more Rugby World Cup \u2013 in 1999 \u2013 and over those two tournaments he scored 15 tries, a record haul that he still shares with former Springbok Bryan Habana.\n\nDescribing the process of writing about the big man, Hall adds: \u201cI loved it. I felt very privileged to be meeting his nearest and dearest and them sharing intimate stories with me and the research team \u2013 some of those have made the film and some haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSo I found that challenging, with the enormity of the project. Writing about someone who is so well known, that everyone connects into.\u201d\n\nIncredible attributes\n\nAfter Lomu\u2019s scintillating showing in the 1995 World Cup semifinal against England, scoring four tries and flattening full-back Mike Catt, there was no hiding from the wing\u2019s ability.\n\nUnsurprisingly the Springboks set to face Lomu in the final knew they would need specific plans to try and nullify his unique ability.\n\n\u201cHe was huge, he was quick and he was skilful. In a sport of physicality and confrontation \u2013 a massive advantage \u2013 the All Blacks made brilliant use of his presence,\u201d explains former Bok flyhalf Joel Stransky.\n\n\u201cTo play against him was more stressful than you can imagine. Not just because one would need to tackle Jonah, which was not an inviting thought, but he drew defenders to him, which left other great players around him in space. Jonah\u2019s presence changed defensive structures and strategies forever.\u201d\n\nBacking up his former teammate, ex-Saracens director of rugby and defensive specialist Brendan Venter adds: \u201cI actually have a very distinct memory of him running over me, literally. I went low and he just bounced me.\n\n\u201cWhat made Jonah Lomu different was that he was big and he was fast, but he actually had wonderful evasive skills. That\u2019s why he was so hard to play against.\n\n\u201cWhen you sat down to tackle him, he would run around you. That was exceptional. That\u2019s what made him so feared and why he scored so many tries, because he had this ability to evade an opponent. It wasn\u2019t just a brute force thing. He did change the game.\u201d\n\nAfter 1995, there was a sense that Lomu had awoken passions for the sport, globally.\n\n\u201cHe was probably the first player with this type of physicality, speed and power,\u201d former France playmaker Fred Michalak tells CNN. \u201cRugby is what it is now because of him \u2013 his talent was recognised by everyone.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lomu was beloved at home, but what set him apart was that fans from Hong Kong to Huddersfield, Stellenbosch to Stirling all fell in love.\n\nCurrent England defence coach John Mitchell was capped alongside Lomu and also coached him when he was the All Blacks boss.\n\n\u201cJonah was, by a long way, the first truly iconic superstar of the game\u201d Former Springbok flyhalf Joel Stransky\n\nIn an exclusive column for Rugby World magazine after the wing\u2019s passing, Mitchell wrote: \u201cI was fortunate to have played with and against Jonah and then, as coach, I selected him for New Zealand\u2019s 2001 end-of-year tour and he was brilliant.\n\n\u201cAgainst Ireland, he made several of the strong in-to-out runs that he became so famous for. He broke the line often against Scotland and scored in a tough match against Argentina. I remember how fans would walk past someone like Richie McCaw and make a beeline for Jonah.\u201d\n\nA Polynesian star\n\nWriter Hall explains that during their research, one of the things that kept coming up was Lomu\u2019s willingness to make time for fans, signing countless autographs, posing for photos and chatting with strangers.\n\nAccording to good friend Eric Rush, who delivered a eulogy at a public service for Lomu, the wing was so humble and so willing to give himself over to others.\n\nHe had, Rush says, a typically respectful Polynesian approach.\n\nThe son of Tongan immigrants, Lomu was not just the first global sporting star, but according to some, an inspiration to those with Pacific Island heritage.\n\nWhen he spoke to CNN recently, England No. 8 Billy Vunipola said of Lomu: \u201cI\u2019ve been in taxis before with people from the Middle East who I don\u2019t think know anything about rugby.\n\n\u201cThey tell me they don\u2019t know anything about rugby, but they know about Jonah Lomu. That is testament to him and his name. He was truly the first global superstar rugby ever had, or probably ever will have.\n\n\u201cTo have that legacy is an amazing thing. I\u2019m proud he\u2019s a Tongan guy, I\u2019m proud I can say, \u2018Yeah, his genes are Tongan, I\u2019m Tongan too.\u2019\u201d\n\nVunipola isn\u2019t the only one.\n\n\u201cHe was the main reason why I would turn the TV on to watch rugby,\u201d said Tonga\u2019s record point-scorer at the Rugby World Cup, Kurt Morath.\n\n\u201cThe fact he was a Tongan and came from such humble beginnings also made it even more special. Tongans and all Pacific Island nations are very proud of where they come from and Jonah definitely helped put Tonga on the map.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople tell me they don\u2019t know anything about rugby, but they know about Jonah Lomu\u201d England number eight Billy Vunipola\n\nLomu\u2019s legacy\n\nHas there been a name as celebrated as the All Blacks great since?\n\n\u201cThe main reason we haven\u2019t had a star as big as him is because so few people at international level could be so destructive,\u201d Venter explains. \u201cTo put it into perspective, at the highest level everyone is good, but for someone at that level to be exceptional, you have to be exceptional.\n\n\u201cYou keep coming through the ranks, you become a provincial player, you become an international, but very few can be unstoppable at international level. He was unstoppable.\u201d\n\nIn his eulogy, Rush said as much in 2015.\n\n\u201cJonah reached heights on the football field that had never been seen before, and you know it\u2019s hard to imagine anybody reaching those heights ever again. I\u2019m sure somebody\u2019s going to come along one day, and it\u2019s going to be a great sight to see, because the benchmark has been set pretty high.\n\n\u201cHe was an inspiration to a whole generation of kids growing up in this country (New Zealand), and across the world. And not just in rugby either. I think there\u2019s still another generation of Julian Saveas and Joseph Parkers and Manu Vatuvai, and Valerie and Stephen Adams.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation of kids still to be inspired by this guy. He was feared the world over, probably more so overseas than here in New Zealand \u2026 and the best part of this fella is that he did it all without the slightest hint of arrogance or ego.\n\n\u201cWhen the Dallas Cowboys came knocking, he showed me that contract. It was a lot of money, and he turned it down.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why did you turn it down?\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only money. It\u2019s not everything.\u2019 I said, \u2018Money\u2019s not everything, but it\u2019s right up there with oxygen, bro, you do need it, you know? And that\u2019s a lot of oxygen, brother. That\u2019s a lot of oxygen.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll he said to me was, \u2018I just want to play rugby with my mates, and I want to play in that black jersey for as long as I can.\u2019 And that\u2019s the reason he stayed with (rugby).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be remembered as a colossus on the field, no doubt about that. But I\u2018m going to remember him as a good mate. And most importantly, as a loving dad.\u201d\n\nAs former foe Stranksy says in conclusion: \u201cJonah off the field was almost the complete opposite (of his terrifying on-field persona). Quiet and humble, reserved but gentlemanly, and when we did get to know the man later in life, a kind and charismatic character!\u201d", "description": "Jonah Lomu was a titanic force on the rugby field, the like of which hasn\u2019t been seen before or since.", "authors": ["Alan Dymock", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/interactive/2019/09/sport/rugby-world-cup-jonah-lomu-spt-intl/media/images/card.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-17"}
