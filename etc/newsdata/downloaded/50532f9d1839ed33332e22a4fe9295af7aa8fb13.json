And I refuse to even acknowledge the politics or the polling or the fear of the NRA that has purchased the complicity and silence of members of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came as elsewhere on Sunday morning, Buttigieg agreed with Sen. Chris Coons\u2019 (D-DE) assertion that conservatives are going to use O\u2019Rourke\u2019s demand to take away AR-15s \u201cwill be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, right now we have an amazing moment on our hands. We have agreement among the American people not just for universal backgrounds checks but we have a majority in favor of red flag laws, high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons,\u201c he further noted on CNN's State of the Union. \u201cThis is a golden moment to finally do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen even this president and even Mitch McConnell at least are pretending to be open to reforms, we know we have a moment on our hand,\u201d the South Bend mayor added. \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke, however, was not going to let Buttigieg\u2019s comments go by unanswered. In a tweet following the mayor\u2019s CNN appearance, O\u2019Rourke pushed back against his fellow presidential hopeful.\n\n\u201cLeaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are \u2018at least pretending to be open to reforms\u2019? That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let\u2019s have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke tweeted on Sunday\n\nInterestingly, Buttigieg has recently claimed that Democrats need to stop worrying over how Republicans are going to frame their positions and policies because even if they \u201cembrace a conservative agenda\u201d the GOP is \u201cgoing to say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let's just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it,\u201d Buttigieg insisted during July\u2019s Democratic debate.", "description": "\u201cThat calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place.
