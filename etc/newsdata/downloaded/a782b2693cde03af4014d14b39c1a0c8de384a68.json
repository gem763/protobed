THREAD \u2014 Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) October 7, 2019\n\nIt should be noted, however, that today\u2019s ruling was handed down by the Outer House of the Court of Session, which also ruled that the judges had no right to intervene on the question of prorogation.\n\nThat decision was overturned when it was appealed to Lord Carloway and his colleagues in the Inner House of the Court of Session, who ultimately received the backing of Lady Hale and the justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom when they were asked to settle the matter.\n\nMaugham said that he \u201cexpect[s] the Inner House of the Court of Session tomorrow to hear our appeal\u201d against this latest decision on the Benn Act.\n\nEU Celebrates Supreme Court Ruling, Say No Deal Now Less Likely https://t.co/qgj2fyaAUx \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 28, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "A Scottish judge dismissed a request for court orders outlining\u00a0\"the imposition of penalties\" if Boris does not seek a Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jolyon-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
