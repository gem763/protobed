The UN also said the raids broke international law because drugs workers are not considered a legitimate military target.\n\nAmerican forces in Afghanistan immediately disputed the reports findings, saying they disagreed with the UN's methods, analysis and \u201cnarrow definition\u201d of legitimate targets.\n\nA spokesman said the labs had been under lengthy surveillance before they were struck and \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d had been taken to avoid killing civilians. Col Sonny Leggett said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the UN's methods and findings.\n\nTaliban insurgents have long been accused of obtaining huge sums from the country's extensive opium trade, as militants tax production and levy protection money. Methamphetamine production has recently been added to the country's drugs business, with UN officials earlier this year warning seizures were growing exponentially.\n\nThe May 5 raids in Farah and Nimroz province were carried out after \u201ccomprehensive intelligence confirmed that all personnel inside of the laboratories were Taliban combatants\u201d, the US told investigators.\n\nInvestigators verified 30 civilians killed and nine injured, including 14 children, but said they were investigating \u201creliable and credible information\u201d another 30 civilians were also killed, the UN said.\n\nThe UN in its report contended the drug facilities were owned and operated by criminal groups, so \"did not meet the definition of legitimate military objectives under international law.\"\n\nThe factories and workers inside \u201cmay not be lawfully made the target of attack based on their possible economic or financial contribution to the war effort of a party to a conflict,\u201d it concluded.\n\nThe US, however, insisted the labs were run and owned by the Taliban, who used revenue to \"fund ongoing indiscriminate violence against innocent Afghans\".", "description": "An American blitz on dozens of Taliban drug factories in Western Afghanistan killed at least 30 civilians and may have left dozens more dead, a United Nations report has found.
