Captured on surveillance video, the scene unfolds like a cross between Desperate Housewives and a low-budget heist movie: a blond woman in black yoga pants and a pink top pulls up to a strip-mall medical spa in a Mercedes SUV , cuts a hole in the spa\u2019s glass door with a cordless saw, slips inside, and jogs away with two bulging shoulder bags allegedly containing $7,000 worth of anti-ageing products, most of it Botox.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a big, burly guy throwing a brick through the front window,\u201d says Alonzo Perez, the owner of BotoxRN, the burgled spa. \u201cBut this was someone 5ft 1in and 100lb.\u201d That was on 23 August. Six days later, a suspect who appeared to be the same woman sawed her way into another BotoxRN spa just up the I-69 in Houston.\n\nFor Perez, it was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: lots of broken glass and another $7,000 inventory loss. \u201cThere were iPads and laptops in the office but they weren\u2019t touched,\u201d he says. \u201cThis woman had a very specific objective.\u201d Perez adds that variations of this crime have become increasingly popular in the area. \u201cYesterday two Houston medical spas called me and said something like this had happened to them in broad daylight: people asked to use the restroom, wandered in back, found the Botox, and stole it.\u201d\n\nThe Houston Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery clinic was also targeted in August: after receiving about $2,000 worth of Botox and filler injections, a patient breezed past the front desk without paying. The name and contact information she provided might have been fake, but her medical photos (before and after shots are standard procedure in Botox clinics) were authentic. \u201cThis lady gets the Darwin award,\u201d says Dr Clayton Molivar, the plastic surgeon who administered the treatments and later posted the photos to social media, helping to identify the woman. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see her go to jail, but maybe she should wear an orange suit every Saturday and pick up garbage.\u201d\n\nThese capers aren\u2019t unique to Houston. Media outlets across the country have covered true crime stories featuring droll headlines about \u201cBotox bandits\u201d in Los Angeles and \u201cface-filler fraudsters\u201d in Washington. This larceny isn\u2019t gender specific, either. In January, two men pulled a hit-and-run job at a Los Angeles Botox spa after racking up $4,000 in services. Nor is the crimewave limited to the US. In Britain in February, four men raided a warehouse in Witham, Essex, and made off with a large cache of Azzalure, a botulinum toxin drug similar to Botox. It was, in crook lingo, a big score; police estimated the shipment\u2019s value at six figures.\n\nWhy do people steal Botox? Because it\u2019s expensive. The drug\u2019s manufacturer, Allergan, sells 100 units \u2013 a vial that fits in the palm of a child\u2019s hand \u2013 for $601. And, as every Kardashian knows, 100 Botox units don\u2019t go far. After zapping forehead wrinkles (20 units), crow\u2019s feet (40 units), \u201cbunny lines\u201d around the nose (10 units), and those \u201cangry 11s\u201d between the brows (30 units), there\u2019s nothing left for jawline sculpting (that\u2019s another 15 to 50 units \u2013 on each side of the face). A single Botox treatment ranges from $300 to $1,200, depending on how much serum is required and who injects it.\n\nAccording to the American Society For Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Botox is by far the most requested aesthetic procedure, with more than 1.8m of them performed last year, totalling over $1bn in sales.\n\nAccording to Dr Jose Rodriguez-Feliz, a plastic surgeon in Coral Gables, Florida, when thieves make a grab for hundreds of vials at a time from warehouses, they are usually sold at a steep discount to people offering injections without medical licenses: \u201cThere\u2019s a huge black market for Botox and fillers in south Florida because they are in high demand and very pricey. Everyone in Miami knows a place where an unlicensed dentist is treating patients in his garage with Botox injections.\u201d\n\nThis year in Shasta county, California, Susan Ann Tancreto was charged with eight felony counts, including unlicensed practice of medicine, mayhem, transporting a controlled substance, and battery with serious bodily injury. As a nurse at a day spa, Tancreto allegedly injected her victims with with Botox and fillers that left some of them, according to the DA\u2019s office, with \u201csignificant facial deformities\u201d. She has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe beauty industry is still failing black women | Funmi Fetto Read more\n\nDr Louis Malcmacher, the president of the American Academy of Facial Aesthetics, agrees there\u2019s a thriving underground network of shady Botox providers around the country, but he fears the problem is even worse than experts claim it is. \u201cI think a lot of this spa theft is people who are self-injecting,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are nurses and doctors on YouTube who routinely inject themselves. So consumers get the idea that this is very easy: I could do this on myself. All I have to do is watch the videos.\u201d\n\nAlthough they may feature disclaimers that they aren\u2019t to be used as tutorials, YouTube videos recorded by medical professionals seeking to expand their brands and generate likes show just how simple these non-surgical procedures are.\n\nA 2018 study published in the journal Plastic Surgery, titled Saving Face: An Online Study of the Injecting Use of DIY Botox and Dermal Filler Kits, concluded that untrained DIY injectors were undeterred by health risks, motivated in part by affordability, and that online forums and instruction videos had boosted their confidence.\n\nDana Berkowitz, the author of Botox Nation: Changing the Face of America, makes no distinction between the opioid junkie and the Botox bandit: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by these crimes because Botox is really a sickness.\u201d Her tone is sober and measured, like she\u2019s issuing a surgeon general warning to the public. \u201cOnce people start seeing the lines reappear, they panic.\u201d Having used Botox herself, Berkowitz knows the power of this drug. \u201cPatients have described Botox to me as an addiction,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also a gateway drug to other cosmetic procedures like dermal fillers.\u201d\n\nHas she seen the Sugar Land surveillance video, the one Inside Edition tagged \u201cSoccer Mom Gone Wild?\u201d: Botox Bandit Strikes Again?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answers earnestly, as if the attractive woman holding the grinding saw is her sister, and she won\u2019t say anything that will betray her trust.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t condone these crimes, but I do understand the motive,\u201d Berkowitz says. \u201cThis woman is being told we have to do everything in our power to battle the onset of ageing, and most people can\u2019t afford to do it. This is part of a larger social problem.\u201d", "description": "A spate of US Botox clinics have reported break-ins \u2013 and the theft of cosmetic products worth thousands.
