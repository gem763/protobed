Old white man Bernie Sanders went below the belt this week when he dropped the \u201cC\u201d word on Native American Elizabeth Warren. The Vermont socialist called younger squaw a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d\n\nThere was a time, believe it or not, when this would not be controversial. But that day is done. The Democratic Party has moved so far to the left they make the Chinese government seem open to new ideas. You\u2019d never know it if you learned about politics from the legacy media.\n\nDemocrats love to say things like, \u201cRonald Reagan wouldn\u2019t be conservative enough for the modern Republican Party.\u201d They say this in an attempt to make the point that the Republican Party has \u201cmoved so far to the right,\u201d but they don\u2019t really give any examples. President Reagan supported tax cuts, the modern Republican Party supports tax cuts. President Reagan was pro-life, the GOP is pro-life. President Reagan worked to strengthen the military, so do Republicans today.\n\nMaybe there are a few things on the fringe where the current incarnation of the party is more conservative today than it was in the 1980s, but not much springs to mind. The ideals of individual liberty and personal responsibility don\u2019t change over time, though the matching of deeds with the words and the effort to implement them has.\n\nStill, the idea that the Republican Party has shifted so far to the right as to be unrecognizable and unwelcoming to its hero, were he alive today, is simply a lie. As is the case in all things, it is the Democratic Party that is guilty of what it accuses others of.\n\nTo the left, the Republican Party looks like it has shifted to the right because the relative distance between the two parties has grown so dramatically, not because the Republicans have moved, but because they\u2019ve gone over the edge.\n\nDemocrats still sing the praises of John F. Kennedy, evoking all the good sentiments the decades-long public relations campaign have created about the murdered president. But JFK not only couldn\u2019t win the Democratic nomination in 2020, he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nPutting aside his obvious personal flaws that, in the era of #MeToo, would have him run out of politics, President Kennedy was relentlessly pro-American and anti-communist. He cut taxes to spur the economy. He was *gasp* a capitalist.\n\nPointing out the socialistic tendencies of Democrats used to be met with angry denials. Just a few years ago the label was an albatross they\u2019d deny to their dying breath, now it\u2019s a badge of honor.\n\nUnder President Bill Clinton, not all that long ago, the Democratic Leadership Council held sway over the party. The DLC was a fiscally conservative group of moderate Democrats who\u2019d break with the liberal wing of the party and work with Republicans. It went out of business in 2011. With it went any semblance of moderation on the left.\n\nYou name it, the Democratic Party is promising it, and for \u201cfree.\u201d Succeed and the party will label you the problem. Risk everything and create a business, Democrats have a plan to punish you.\n\nThe difference between places like Cuba and Venezuela and the platform of the new Democratic Party is Democrats haven\u2019t yet had the ability to implement the policies.\n\nNo one is poor because someone else is rich. But to hear the Democratic field tell it, the rich are hoarding wealth at the expense of everyone else. Think what you will of someone like Bill Gates, but his wealth was created by him, from nothing. Microsoft created Windows and people bought it. That made the company worth a fortune. If it hadn\u2019t been created, the billions the company is worth wouldn\u2019t be in people\u2019s pockets, it simply wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nDemocrats know this, or should; they simply don\u2019t care. And they\u2019re counting on the jealousy they\u2019ve cultivated in society to prevent their voters from ever coming to that realization. Given the embrace of the \u201csocialist\u201d label by so many, particularly young Democratic voters, it\u2019s working well.\n\nWhen calling someone a capitalist is an insult, it\u2019s a symptom of a bigger problem. This ain\u2019t your parents' Democratic Party, comrade.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "It was the worst thing one Democrat could call another, .10/17/2019 1:11:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/128eedf7-43ab-4f95-a52a-a98034269d0f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
