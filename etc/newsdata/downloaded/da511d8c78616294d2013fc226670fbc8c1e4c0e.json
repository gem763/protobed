Don't do it,' New South Wales Transport Minister Andrew Constance told reporters in August, after several cars were driving dangerously.\n\nOne Ashfield resident told News.com.au that the drivers who tried to get out of paying the $4.27 toll at the last minute were putting their lives at risk.\n\n'Someone's going to die up there one day,' they said.\n\nAccident Research Centre research fellow Nimmi Candappa said drivers making dangerous turns even months after the opening was a concern.\n\n'If it's happening regularly, it's a worry. I've looked at physical crashes and potential crashes and just because one hasn't eventuated yet doesn't mean it won't one day,' she said.\n\nOne resident believed motorists were driving so erratically on the new M4 that they could lose their lives\n\n'The fact that drivers are doing this is an indication they are not able to anticipate what is expected of them \u2026 and they're doing all sorts of strange things.'\n\nMs Candappa said that another lane or fewer turns off the motorway could help make road conditions easier for drivers.\n\nSome major areas of concern were Parramatta and Ashfield as many cars were seen driving erratically, swerving into lanes at the last minute and merging into oncoming traffic.\n\nAccording to the publication, on average one car made a dangerous move nearly every minute on Wattle Street in Ashfield, during different time periods in early October.\n\nOther cars were caught pulling out onto the roads in front of oncoming trucks.\n\nThe M4 tunnels are expected to save drivers 45 minutes of travel time along the road in peak hour and bypass 22 sets of traffic lights.\n\n'This is a major step towards giving back more time to people, so they spend less time in traffic and more time with family and friends, as well as doing the things they love,' NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters during the opening in July.\n\nThe next stage of WestConnex - an extension of the M5 to St Peters - is expected to open next year.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Transport for comment.", "description": "Sydney's M4 opened in July but even three months down the track, motorists are dangerously swerving across multiple lanes of traffic amid confusion of new road changes.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19533120-0-image-a-20_1570704872202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
