Other lawmakers said they did not know the complaint\u2019s details.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s position is clear \u2014 the acting D.N.I. can either provide the complaint as required under the law,\u201d Mr. Schiff said, \u201cor he will be required to come before the committee to tell the public why he is not following the clear letter of the law, including whether the White House or the attorney general are directing him to do so.\u201d\n\nThe complaint involves conduct by someone \u201coutside the intelligence community\u201d and does not involve intelligence activity under the supervision of Mr. Maguire, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Mr. Schiff that was obtained by The New York Times. That stance signals a disagreement between the inspector general and the director of national intelligence over who would best investigate the complaint.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Dni-Whistleblower-Complaint.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
