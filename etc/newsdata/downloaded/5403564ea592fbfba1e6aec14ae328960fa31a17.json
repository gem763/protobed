The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.34% climbed 3.5 basis points to 2.163%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nThe softer tone in the bond-market tracked the rebound in equities after CNBC reported that top negotiators were set to meet in Oct. 10-11 in Washington, with the Chinese delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.
