Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) November 3 Minneapolis rally, scheduled with an appearance from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), is moving to a different venue due to high demand, local media outlets reported.\n\nSanders is slated to hold a rally alongside the far-left Minnesota lawmaker on Sunday. It was originally taking place at the Northrop Auditorium, but organizers opted to move the venue due to high ticket demand. It has now been moved to the Williams Arena, which can hold a crowd of over 14,000. The Northrop Auditorium maxes out at 2,700.\n\nThe increased enthusiasm for Sanders has been reflected in recent polls. A Morning Consult poll released this week showed Sanders tying Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for second place nationally with 20 percent support each, while a UNHSurveyCenter/CNN poll showed the socialist senator regaining his frontrunner status in New Hampshire:\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Primary:\n\nSanders 21%\n\nWarren 18%\n\nBiden 15%\n\nButtigieg 10%\n\nYang 5%\n\nKlobuchar 5%\n\nGabbard 5%\n\nSteyer 3%\n\nHarris 3%\n\nBooker 2%\n\nO'Rourke 2%\n\nSestak 1%\n\nBennet 0%\n\nDelaney 0%\n\nCastro 0%@UNHSurveyCenter/@CNN 10/21-27https://t.co/giBbSiQZBI pic.twitter.com/gf2id1r2aV \u2014 Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) October 29, 2019\n\nSanders\u2019 bounce back could be attributed, in part, to the high profile endorsements he has rolled out in recent weeks. Three key members of the \u201cSquad\u201d \u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Omar \u2013 issued glowing endorsements. Both Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib have appeared alongside Sanders at rallies in their cities, and Omar is expected to do the same this weekend.\n\nIn a video announcing her endorsement, Omar described Sanders as \u201cthe only candidate who has built a movement and continues to build a movement that transcends gender, ethnicity, and religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we know in order to take on Trump, we\u2019re going to need a unifier\u2013 someone who understands what the fight looks like and someone who is ready to defeat him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was one of the people inspired by the movement that the Senator has built. There was an America that I dreamed about,\u201d she continued, adding that the America people dream about is \u201cnot reality yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not just the fight for our lives. This is the fight for our democracy. This is the fight for a better future. One we can all be proud of,\u201d she added:", "description": "Sanders' November 3\u00a0Minneapolis rally, with an appearance from Ilhan Omar, had to be moved to a different venue due to high demand.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177308078-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
