Labor Day on Sept. 2 marked the end of the season.\n\nGasoline prices at the pump are little changed since the Saturday attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities cut an estimated 5.7 million barrels a day from the kingdom\u2019s oil production, equal to more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily supply.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the average per-gallon price for regular gasoline stood at $2.560, compared with yesterday\u2019s average of $2.559, according to gas-price tracker GasBuddy.\n\nRead: Global oil surges after Saudi \u2018supply shock\u2019\n\nThe \u201ctiming is fortunate,\u201d said Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit. \u201cIf this happened four months ago, we could be talking about a much more significant retail [gasoline] price spike.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is the time of year when the market has switched away from the summer gasoline blends, which are required to meet tougher environmental standards, toward winter blends, which are cheaper and easier to make, he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia was producing around 9.6 million to 9.7 million barrels of oil a day before the attack, so this is \u201ca serious hit, but this will be measured in days, weeks or months,\u201d said Cinquegrana.\n\nHe also pointed out that the amount of oil the U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia has reached its lowest level in at least a decade.\n\nIn May of this year, the U.S. imported 462,000 barrels a day of oil and petroleum products from Saudi Arabia, the lowest monthly figure since March 1987, according to the Energy Information Administration, based on data going back to January 1977.\n\nStill, \u201cwe are seeing [gasoline] prices react across the supply chain and around the country\u201d in futures, spot and wholesale prices, Cinquegrana said. The front-month October reformulated gasoline contract RBV19, -0.98% rallied by 12.8%, or 19.9 cents, to settle at $1.7524 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday.\n\nAt the pump, however, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a drastic move,\u201d he said, adding that prices may potentially move higher, in the 10-cents-a-gallon vicinity, over the next couple of days.\n\nGasBuddy Retail gas prices have been trending lower in recent weeks.\n\nOil prices, meanwhile will be \u201celevated for weeks, if not months,\u201d said DeHaan. \u201cA risk premium will likely stick around ... as this remains fresh for quite awhile \u2014 at least as long as it takes [Saudi Arabia] to get back to 100% normal, but, even after [that], the shock that such an event happened in Saudi Arabia, a stable and reliable oil producer, will likely continue to haunt the market.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, October West Texas Intermediate crude CLV19, -1.51%, the U.S. benchmark, rose nearly 15%, up $8.05, to $62.90 a barrel.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s what happened to the global economy the last eight times oil prices have doubled\n\nRetail gas prices may climb by \u201cpennies or so per day, starting midweek, lasting probably one to two weeks or longer,\u201d with prices eventually going up by 10 cents to 25 cents per gallon, if Saudi Arabia can\u2019t quickly restore production, said DeHaan.\n\nDrivers will \u201cprobably notice,\u201d but \u201cI'd classify this as minor still, compared to such events like Hurricane Harvey, Katrina or refinery outages like in 2015 when BP\u2019s Whiting, Ind., refinery went down,\u201d he said.\n\nThe switch to cheaper winter gasoline blends will help limit the price increases, said DeHaan. \u201cFor many motorists, there is no reason to run out to fill up. You aren\u2019t going to wake up tomorrow (or later) to a massive spike like what we've seen in previous dramatic events.\u201d\n\nFurther, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any locations in the U.S. surpass their previous 2019 high.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump tweeted that he had authorized the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed.\n\nIf the U.S. does release oil from the reserve, it will be a \u201cweek or more before refiners get that crude, and not all refiners have access,\u201d DeHaan said. The \u201cWest Coast is basically cut off from easy access.\u201d\n\nRefiners and oil companies would likely \u201cbid on the oil ... then pay the U.S. government,\u201d he said, adding that this has happened several times before following major weather events, such as hurricanes that disrupted oil production in the Gulf of Mexico.", "description": "Global crude production has taken a serious hit following the weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities, leading to a spike in oil prices but for gasoline, this...", "authors": ["Myra P.
