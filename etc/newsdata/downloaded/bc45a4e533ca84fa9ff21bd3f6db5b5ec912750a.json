The plan would have nearly doubled the size of the state\u2019s budget. For both political and economic reasons, the cost was deemed too high.\n\nThere were other complications: Public outreach was weak. And in 2013, the state started an online insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act that was plagued by technical failures, which the state struggled to fix. As the Cornell Policy Review noted in a 2017 post-mortem, the mix of higher-than-expected costs and administrative problems \u201cfostered an atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust in the state government, turning a politically steep climb into a politically insurmountable one.\u201d\n\nAnd so, at the end of 2014, Mr. Shumlin admitted defeat. \u201cI have learned that the limitations of state-based financing, the limitations of federal law, the limitations of our tax capacity and the sensitivity of our economy\u201d make single-payer \u201cunwise and untenable at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk of economic shock is too high.\u201d\n\nThe Vermont plan was done in by high taxes, distrust of government and lack of political support. Any effort by a Sanders administration to enact a single-payer system at a national level would probably be doomed by similar problems.\n\nLike Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders is a devout single-payer supporter who has campaigned aggressively on the idea. And like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders has so far declined to lay out a plan for fully financing his Medicare for All system.\n\nBut while some polls show majority public support for single-payer, that support declines substantially when faced with trade-offs like the elimination of most private coverage or higher taxes \u2014 two components of Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan.\n\nSimilarly, Medicare for All supporters argue that single-payer would reduce the nation\u2019s overall health spending. But savings are heavily predicated on the assumption that the new government-run system could pay Medicare rates, which are typically lower than those of private insurance, to providers across the board.", "description": "A deep-blue state\u2019s failure to enact a single-payer system shows why a national version is unlikely to succeed.", "authors": ["Peter Suderman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/09Suderman1/09Suderman1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
