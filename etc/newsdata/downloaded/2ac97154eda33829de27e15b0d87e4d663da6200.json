I need to show what is possible.\n\n\u201cI look at the stuff that\u2019s happening around London with the knife crime. It\u2019s just because kids are bored, sitting around. They want that adrenalin rush. They need to fall in love with some kind of sport, some kind of activity.\u201d\n\nSinckler is clear a combination of rugby and \u201ca good family\u201d saved him from a world of bother. Others he knows are less fortunate. He wants to inspire them.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWhere I\u2019m from there\u2019s a big onus on me to set a good example and show what being a man is,\u201d he said after a performance notable for his refusal to react when Aussie hooker Tolu Latu tried to get a rise out him by patting him on the head.\n\n\u201cBeing a man isn\u2019t losing your rag, your emotions, showing your opposition how you really feel. A sign of toughness isn\u2019t what you say or how you react with handbags.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your next action. It\u2019s about being calm, disciplined, putting the team first, doing your job and not allowing your ego to take control.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou have to play on the edge and make sure you\u2019re right there. But I\u2019ve got a real big responsibility not only to the team, but the people watching back home. I want to leave a good example for them.\u201d\n\nSinckler has worked his socks off to get to this point. He now admits that he lost his rag in this year\u2019s Six Nations clash against Wales.\n\n\u201cI let the team down, I let my country down,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had won that game we would have been Grand Slam champions.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe traces his \u201cfrustrations\u201d back to being \u201cborn in a single parent home and always looking for that male father figure\u201d.\n\n\u201cSubconsciously, I put people in that position, put my trust in certain people who betrayed me really. It was just about me taking control of my life and teaching me how to be an actual man.\n\n\u201cA man is in control of his emotions, a man looks after his family, he does the right things. He doesn\u2019t let anything that frustrates him show, he just gets on with it.\u201d\n\nWhich is what Sinckler did against Australia. And with proud mum Donna in the stands it made for a grand occasion.", "description": "\u201cA lot of people, when I was growing up, said I couldn\u2019t do a lot of things, that I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything.
