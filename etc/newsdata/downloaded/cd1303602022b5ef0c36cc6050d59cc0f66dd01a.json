When I arrived, I didn\u2019t know a single player. We found 34 players in the squad, my first 34 players, but now I know nearly all the players.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult. Because it\u2019s different in all the ways.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived here, Daniel didn\u2019t know me too much. He needed time to understand my philosophy, my ideas, how I need to work and why I didn\u2019t reply when he sent text messages to me!\n\n\u201cHe needed time to understand me. But now, Daniel knows how I am.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances are completely different and the way I communicate with him is the same as last season.\n\n\u201cYou cannot expect I communicate differently with Hugo (Lloris) now as last season or the season before.\n\n\u201cBut when I arrived here, we needed to create a channel to communicate with each other. Many things like this.\u201d\n\nSpurs will be looking to kick-start their season against the Saints, the side Pochettino left to join the north London club five years ago.\n\nThe Argentinian knows there will be no room for sentiment, even if he remembers his time on the south coast fondly.\n\n\u201cIt will be a very tough game,\u201d he added. \u201cSouthampton are a very good team, I feel special things for Southampton, my former club, my first club in England, they gave me the opportunity to be in England, learn English, be in this amazing country, be part of this best league in the world I can only say amazing things about Southampton.\n\n\u201cThey have very good players, a great manager and they are doing a fantastic job and it\u2019s going to be tough.\n\n\u201cThe opponent has a massive motivation to come and play Tottenham, who were the finalists of the Champions League. Of course we are a target for our opponents, to play in our amazing stadium, the best stadium in Europe.\n\nPA", "description": "Tottenham\u00a0boss Mauricio Pochettino insists his current rebuild job is nothing compared with the one he inherited in his first season at the club.
