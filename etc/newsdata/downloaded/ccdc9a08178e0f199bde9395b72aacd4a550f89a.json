Investors are cautious on the stock with new streaming launches from Disney, Apple and HBO on the horizon. Mitchelson said a huge beat on third quarter earnings could be the only way for the stock to reverse course.\n\nCredit Suisse said the first seven weeks of the third quarter show a broad-based rebound in global Netflix trends.\n\nAlongside that rebound, the firm's tracking also shows a pickup in original content this quarter, particularly with Hollywood dramas and international series. Mitchelson points out how far ahead Netflix is from its soon-to-launch competition.\n\n\"We have tracked 48 titles in development at Disney+, 43 at Apple's TV+ and 23 at HBO Max vs. Netflix with 71 English-language dramas, 62 non-English series, 32 comedies and 108 films in development,\" said Mitchelson.\n\nCredit Suisse has an outperform rating on the stock and a $440 price target.\n\nShares of Netflix sank 2.2% on Tuesday, weighed down by the announced of Apple TV+'s pricing model.\n\n\u2014 With reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom.", "description": "Despite positive numbers from app downloads and a stellar slate of original content coming out of Netflix, investors are still fleeing the stock, Credit Suisse said.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105561990-1541682651446gettyimages-1020621862.jpeg?v=1568116181", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
