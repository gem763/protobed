They should all still be here to lead fulfilling lives but they are not.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018There were no winners in this case.\n\n\u2018We fully support all the positive steps to celebrate Yousef\u2019s life and anything positive in the future that can come from this tragedy is something we would welcome and contribute to in whatever way possible.\u2019\n\nA pre-inquest hearing into the death of Yousef Makki is scheduled for October 18 at Manchester Coroner\u2019s Court.\n\nMolnar will be released from custody next March.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
