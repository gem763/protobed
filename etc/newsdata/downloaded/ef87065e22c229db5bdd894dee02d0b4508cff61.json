No, we need to be clear-eyed,\" Macron told reporters on board his plane en route to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA).\n\nMacron is expected to hold separate meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York. That has led to speculation that the U.S. and Iranian leaders could also meet each other at the gathering. But Macron lowered expectations that a meeting would happen at the U.N. summit.\n\nDressed down in jeans and a navy sweatshirt emblazoned with the slogan \"La French Tech,\" Macron said that a major obstacle to his mediation efforts, besides acts of violence in the region, is the fact that the U.S. and Iran are set up very differently in terms of political machinery.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is able, if he is convinced, to change things very quickly and he is not administration-driven, he decides alone and quickly and he has a very transactional logic,\u201d said Macron. \u201cPresident Rouhani is someone who needs to line up a whole system before negotiating, it\u2019s almost the opposite.\u201d\n\n\"Iranians are flexible on parameters ... but inflexible on the rendezvous, a rendezvous has to be the culmination of a process that leads to something\" \u2014 Emmanuel Macron, French president\n\nThat has complicated the diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions between the two sides.\n\n\"Iranians are flexible on parameters ... but inflexible on the rendezvous, a rendezvous has to be the culmination of a process that leads to something, and the American system has a short-term objective, which is a rendezvous,\" said Macron.\n\nThe latest challenge to Macron's initiative came in the September 14 attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and Khurais oil field that adversely affected up to half of the supplies from the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack but the United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran, which has denied it played a role.\n\nHowever, Macron presented the latest escalation in the Gulf as a possible opportunity for his role as the self-appointed champion of what he called \"agile multilateralism.\" He has been advocating to expand negotiations with Iran to go beyond its nuclear program.\n\nMacron stopped short of blaming Tehran for the attack, preferring instead to wait for the report of investigators he sent to Saudi Arabia this week.\n\nThat circumspect approach is in stark contrast to Trump, who has already blamed Iran for the attacks and approved the deployment of U.S. troops and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and to the U.K.'s Boris Johnson, who said there is a \"very high degree of probability\" Tehran was responsible, and that London would \"consider\" a military response.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to rebuild in the Iranian context [is] recreating a negotiating framework that is that of a strong multilateralism [with] red lines that are credible and defined,\u201d said Macron, though he said he is opposed to retaliatory strikes in the current context.\n\nOne of the obstacles Macron may run into is opposition from Russia, which maintains good relations with Iran.\n\nMacron plans to plead for a \u201cstrong multilateralism\u201d in his speech at the UNGA on Tuesday, and cited the strikes on Syria that the U.S., U.K. and France carried out in 2018 in retaliation for a reported chemical weapon attack by the Assad regime as an example of successful multilateral crisis management.\n\nHowever, Tehran has faced no consequences so far from France, the U.K., Germany, Russia and China for actions that have raised tension in the region following the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nThe remaining signatories to the JCPOA have refrained from seizing the dispute resolution mechanism of the deal designed to hold Iran accountable for such actions.\n\nIran has also increasingly threatened security in the Gulf and but not faced overt military action from the U.S., even after it downed an American drone, seized oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz and detained Westerners and dual citizens.\n\nMacron expects to receive the report of the French investigators into the Saudi attack this week.\n\n\"It\u2019s in light of this that we will be able to take action,\" he said.\n\nThe French leader will also hold a European coordination meeting with Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe report won't be ready before his planned meeting with Rouhani on Monday, according to Macron.\n\nThe French leader will also hold a European coordination meeting with Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday afternoon in New York to discuss the Iranian crisis.\n\nIran sent mixed messages on Sunday.\n\nAfter denying any involvement in the attacks in Saudi Arabia, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif threatened a generalized war in the event of a military retaliation on Iran for the attacks.\n\nThen he later said that Rouhani is willing to meet with Trump in New York this week \u201cprovided that President Trump is ready to do what\u2019s necessary\u201d \u2014 exchanging sanctions relief for \u201cpermanent monitoring of Iranian nuclear facilities.\u201d", "description": "\u2018We need to be clear-eyed,\u2019 French president tells reporters en route to New York.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Christian Vasquez"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-849126898-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
