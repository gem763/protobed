And it\u2019s not like fans hadn\u2019t seen it all before. It\u2019s the seventh time Cincinnati has opened 0-5 since 1990, the most in the league over that span.\n\nThe Bengals haven\u2019t won a playoff game since that 1990 season, tied with Washington for the fifth-longest streak in league history. They\u2019re on the verge of moving up that list one more rung.\n\n\u201cWe understand the position we\u2019re in,\u201d quarterback Andy Dalton said.\n\nWhat made this loss sting was the way the Bengals came alive at the end only to give it away. Dalton ended the Bengals\u2019 streak of seven quarters without a touchdown by throwing two and tying the game 23-23 with 2 minutes left. But rookie Kyler Murray led the Cardinals (1-3-1) in position for Zane Gonzalez\u2019s 31-yard field goal on the final play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of losing,\u201d said receiver Tyler Boyd, who caught a 42-yard touchdown pass to tie it. \u201cSick of not finishing the game we want to.\u201d\n\nAfter three straight losing seasons, the Bengals fired Marvin Lewis and hired Zac Taylor. They drew only 50,666 fans for their home opener, a 41-17 loss to San Francisco. Coming off a 27-3 loss in Pittsburgh on Monday night, the Bengals sold only 46,012 tickets for Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cThe ones that came out, we love the support and we have to put some wins in that win column,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI get it. This is every fan base I have been around. They want to see wins. They want to see production. They are frustrated. Check our locker room - we are frustrated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in three games that the Bengals allowed a late drive to determine the game. Frank Gore had a 1-yard touchdown run with 1:50 left to give Buffalo a 21-17 win two weeks ago. On Sunday, Murray completed a 24-yard pass and ran 24 yards to get the Cardinals in position for their first win under new coach Kliff Kingsbury.\n\n\u201cI think this and the Buffalo one hurt the most,\u201d safety Jessie Bates said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all on the defense.\n\nDalton was sacked a career-high eight times in the loss at Pittsburgh. The Bengals decided to run the ball and throw quick passes against the Cardinals to avoid sacks, and Dalton was dropped only once.\n\nOn Cincinnati\u2019s first drive, Joe Mixon carried eight times for 60 yards, but Cincinnati had to settle for a field goal. Arizona adjusted to the run-based focus, and the Bengals managed only 43 yards rushing the rest of the way. Dalton threw for only 22 yards in the first half and Cincinnati managed 90 yards overall.\n\nYet Dalton threw TD passes of 2 and 42 yards on consecutive possessions as Cincinnati tied it with 2 minutes left after going virtually all game without much out of the passing game.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely a head-scratcher,\u201d receiver Auden Tate said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paul Brown Stadium was more than half-empty when the Bengals pulled off a stunning comeback to tie the game and give themselves a chance for that long-awaited first win.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/cardinals_bengals_football_46644_c0-109-2598-1623_s1770x1032.jpg?4edd468731fb8351626bdd1ea17445d0afdcd2c3", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
