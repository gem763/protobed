Blocko CEO Phil Zamani said:\n\n\u201cWe launched Aergo in response to the growing need for data sharing between industries and companies in areas such as identity verification, document management and the Internet of Things - the same areas in which the Middle East in particular is seeking practical solutions.\u201d\n\nBlocko previously completed 38 full-scale enterprise blockchain solutions in South Korea for companies like Samsung, Hyundai Motors and Cisco and hopes to continue building through the SEED partnership. SEED Group CEO Hisham Al Gurg said:\n\n\u201cThe UAE and the wider Middle East region are constantly seeking advanced blockchain solutions for government and digital services.
