But in the prairie province of Saskatchewan support for the Tories is steadfast, centered around the fate of the oil and gas industry.\n\nThough Saskatchewan isn\u2019t the country\u2019s top oil-producing province \u2014 it accounts for roughly 12 percent of Canadian oil output, compared to neighboring Alberta\u2019s nearly 80 percent \u2014 the industry is crucial to the region\u2019s economy.\n\nAnd many voters here feel the last four years of Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government, with the stricter environmental policies it has rolled out, has hurt them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the oil and gas back up, because Trudeau\u2019s trying to shut it all down,\u201d said 71-year-old Sarah Wall. \u201cHe\u2019s tearing our country apart; West and East are fighting against each other.\u201d\n\nWall, a retired cleaner, lives in the electoral district of Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, in the provincial capital of Regina.\n\nHer neighbors, Peter and Daisy Popkie, were also quick to name oil as a top reason they support Scheer and the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like he\u2019s more geared to the oil industry out west here,\u201d said Peter Popkie.\n\nTheir son is studying geology as he prepares for a career in the petroleum industry, a future the Popkies said they are \u201choping will look better\u201d under a new government.\n\n\u201cWe want him to have a job when he\u2019s done,\u201d said Daisy Popkie. \u201cLiving out west, this is a big push we need: jobs for our people.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Heated climate debate \u2013\n\nAndrew Spagrud, who says he \u201cdidn\u2019t really get involved in politics\u201d in his student days, is now 33 and the CEO of Villanova Energy. When it comes to the elections, he says the choice is \u201cobvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a four-year cycle of getting beat up \u2014 like the industry\u2019s just in a state of disrepair,\u201d said Spagrud. \u201cRegulatory issues are just causing our industry to really suffer versus our peer countries.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s economy is relatively strong and the jobless rate is near a historic low, but its oil patch has been hit by a global oil price slump and a flight of foreign investment.\n\nIn April, Trudeau\u2019s government rolled out a starting carbon tax of Can$20 ($15 US) per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, affecting four provinces that had not fallen in line with the prime minister\u2019s emissions reduction strategy.\n\nThat tax is scheduled to increase incrementally to Can$50 over the coming years to discourage the use of large amounts of fossil fuels.\n\nSix other provinces were initially exempt because each had come up with a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to help Canada meet its Paris Agreement target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n\u2013 Security for one official \u2013\n\nThe ideological divide over the tax is playing out in courtrooms and legislatures across the country \u2014 with Saskatchewan taking the lead in fighting it to the Supreme Court \u2014 and it figures, unsurprisingly, in election party platforms.\n\nScheer has said that as prime minister he would repeal the carbon tax and other environmental protections.\n\nIn the leadup to the election, oil industry proponents have waged angry protests. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna \u2014 disparaged by critics as \u201cClimate Barbie\u201d and an enemy of the people \u2014 was assigned a security detail.\n\nAnd former foreign minister Maxime Bernier, who split from the Tories to form his own party, went so far as to call the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg \u201cclearly mentally unstable,\u201d before walking back his comments.\n\nIn contrast, Trudeau last month marched with Thunberg at a massive rally in Montreal, and on Friday she led a protest in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was met by a counter-demonstration featuring big rigs honking their horns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us to have conversations with people on the other side of the spectrum, because things are so personal, because it\u2019s impacting our way of life, it\u2019s impacting our finances really, our economies out here, and obviously that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Spagrud.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to bed at night, I think about providing for my family, what things are going to look like in one year, five years, 15 years, and right now all of that, it looks kind of scary.\u201d\n\nJim Farney, who heads the political science department at the University of Regina, noted that the Conservatives \u201chave put a great deal of emphasis this election on opposing the carbon tax, and while they\u2019re not a greenhouse-gas-denying, climate-change-denying party, they\u2019re also not in a hurry to do much about it.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a big part of their appeal.\u201d", "description": "Regina (Canada) (AFP) \u2013 On the eve of Canada\u2019s federal elections, Conservatives and Liberals are neck-and-neck in the polls.
