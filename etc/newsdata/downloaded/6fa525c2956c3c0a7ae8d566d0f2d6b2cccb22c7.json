Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.\n\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.\n\n\"The whole district is covered in sorrow,\" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. \"This is a catastrophe for our community.\"\n\nOn Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.\n\n\"We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,\" Nam said.\n\nNam said families had told him they knew relatives were travelling to Britain at the time the container truck was travelling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.\n\nThe British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.\n\nPolice have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.\n\nApart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.\n\n\n\n\n\n'BEAUTIFUL DAY'\n\nIn Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.\n\n\"She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,\" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.\n\n\"We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village travelling in that group\".\n\nIn comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.\n\n\"Not good,\" Nhung replied. \"Almost spring,\" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.\n\nOther photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.\n\n\"Such a beautiful day,\" Nhung posted.\n\nAnother person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job.", "description": "Several townships in rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas of the country.
