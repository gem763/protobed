Photo: Kanye West/YouTube\n\nWell, Kanye West released one thing on time last night, actually even a bit early \u2014 his short film Jesus Is King, out today, probably played at an IMAX theater near you on Thursday night. Heck, an audience in L.A. even got to see it on Wednesday! When Kanye previewed the Nick Knight-directed project at his Jesus Is King events in Detroit, Chicago, and New York, details were slim: We knew that it was set at James Turrell\u2019s Roden Crater installation in Arizona, and that it would depict some aspects of Kanye\u2019s ongoing Sunday Services and the upcoming album. Past that, it was anybody\u2019s guess! We may finally have Jesus Is King the album now too, but if you\u2019re still curious about the accompanying film or debating buying a ticket, here\u2019s your rundown of what to expect from it.\n\nIt\u2019s not the album\n\nNot even close. Think of Jesus Is King as a supplement, like a bonus feature from the album. It does include three album tracks: \u201cSelah,\u201d \u201cEverything We Need,\u201d and \u201cUse This Gospel.\u201d I also thought I heard a snippet of \u201cJesus Is Lord\u201d in Kanye\u2019s credits performance of \u201cEvery Knee Shall Bow,\u201d but that\u2019s not in the list of songs from the credits. All that\u2019s to say, the film\u2019s missing some of the internet\u2019s favorite tracks so far, such as \u201cWater\u201d (in which Kanye inaccurately claims the human body is \u201c90 percent water\u201d) and \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d (the song about Chick-fil-A).\n\nThere\u2019s not a plot\n\nUnlike Kanye\u2019s past long-form music videos like Runaway and the never-mass-released Cruel Summer, not much, well, happens in Jesus Is King. It\u2019s mainly Kanye and various members of his Sunday Service choir performing music in the Roden Crater shot from various angles, interspersed with a few shots of some mountains (in Arizona? Wyoming?), what I think was a deer, and a flower. There\u2019s no dialogue or narration for that matter, either \u2014 some originally thought the movie might be a documentary about the new album or Sunday Service, but it doesn\u2019t teach us much that we didn\u2019t already know.\n\nKanye has truly caught the spirit\n\nWhen Kanye started his Jesus Is King preview events, members of the Chicago audience reported an announcement that he\u2019s now only making gospel music. That certainly fits with the movie, which is far from secular: It opens with a Bible verse, Mark 1:15, which is supposedly Kanye\u2019s favorite. \u201cAnd saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent and believe the gospel,\u201d it reads, acting as a message about the current state of affairs in Kanye\u2019s own kingdom. Other Bible verses that make an appearance include 1 Chronicles 16:25, Ephesians 2:8-9, John 8:12, Philippians 4:23, and that classic John 3:16 (\u201cFor God so loved the world \u2026\u201d).\n\nKanye also announced that he is no longer making secular music. Only Gospel from here on out. \u2014 Andrew Barber (@fakeshoredrive) September 29, 2019\n\nThat carries over to the other music in the film, too. Much of the film\u2019s track list (not the album\u2019s ever-changing one) draws from gospel songs and hymns, so expect a lot hallelujahs. It hits classics like \u201cPerfect Praise\u201d (\u201coh Lord, how excellent is thy name!\u201d), \u201cWhen I Think of His Goodness,\u201d and \u201cEvery Knee Shall Bow,\u201d often accompanied by an organ and clapping. Early on, it also features \u201cO Fortuna\u201d from Carl Orff\u2019s mid-1930s cantata, Carmina Burana, itself based on a Latin poem.\n\nLike Sunday Service, it rearranges old songs\n\nOf course, there\u2019s an interpolation of the refrain from \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d up until this point Kanye\u2019s gospel opus. Aside from that, there are two songs from Kanye\u2019s fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, \u201cSay You Will\u201d and \u201cStreet Lights.\u201d He performs the latter during one of the most affecting moments of the film, first a capella when he\u2019s sweeping the empty crater room, eventually accompanied by three others on piano, organ, and vocals.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many familiar faces\n\nIn many of the group scenes, it might take a second to locate Kanye. At the beginning, he walks into the crater alongside the rest of the choir, with little fanfare. He was only the star of about two of the scenes: his sparse performance of \u201cStreet Lights\u201d (mentioned above) and another I\u2019ll talk about in a second. It largely fits with the other Sunday Service clips we\u2019ve seen, which tend to be far from straight-up Kanye concerts. That said, don\u2019t expect to see Kanye collaborators who became Sunday Service regulars like Kid Cudi, Chance the Rapper, or Ty Dolla $ign, either. If anyone gets top billing for Jesus Is King, it\u2019s choir director Jason White, whose dynamic conducting tends to be the focal point of many scenes.\n\nPsalm West gets his spotlight\n\nKanye\u2019s youngest child with Kim Kardashian West, Psalm, may not even be 6 months old, but he can already log a film credit on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The last scene of the film features a close-up of Kanye (you can\u2019t see his face), shirtless and holding baby Psalm. He\u2019s singing one of his new songs, \u201cUse This Gospel,\u201d a capella to his son, with lines like, \u201cUse this gospel as a weapon.\u201d (That\u2019s the song that features the Clipse reunion and Kenny G\u2019s sax solo, but obviously, don\u2019t expect any of that from Kanye\u2019s solo performance.)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more of that circle lens\n\nIf you watched the livestream of Kanye\u2019s Sunday Service at Coachella, it was hard not to notice that it was all playing out through a circular filter. Whether you thought it was artistic, frustrating, or just confusing, it\u2019s once again the case with Jesus Is King \u2014 although this time, the circle zooms in and out to varying degrees, and at one point it\u2019s even an oval. I\u2019m not going to try to interpret what it means, but it\u2019s likely part of why the film is being shown specifically in IMAX theaters, to get the full effect. And speaking of \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s only about half an hour\n\nSo if you\u2019re expecting a full movie from your expensive IMAX ticket, you might want to reconsider before dropping upwards of $25. My audience murmured in puzzlement when the credits hit, then sat through all of them, hoping for something more. All told, the person I sat next to, a Kanye fan who\u2019d gone to his New York Jesus Is King preview last month, said the new music (all three songs, mind you) sounded way better than it had in that environment, so that may be worth it enough for you. Now that we have the album though, that may be enough \u2014 but if you\u2019re looking for another introduction to the new Kanye, you\u2019ll get it in Jesus Is King the movie.", "description": "Kanye West\u2019s \u2018Jesus Is King\u2019 film premiered on time Thursday night, even with the new album in limbo.
