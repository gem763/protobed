a 'land grab'.'\n\nMr Gueterbock, 50, - who is son of Labour peer, The Lord Berkeley - and his wife are now suing in an attempt to get Mr MacPhail to move the outer wall of the house back from theirs by about a foot and partially fill in his basement.\n\nThey want an injunction requiring him to do the work and are asking for a legal declaration that they own half of the old passageway and have a right of way over all of it.\n\nDenying the claim that they trespassed on the Gueterbocks' land, Mr MacPhail points out that the passageway between the two houses forms part of the title to his property.\n\nWhen the bombsite was compulsorily purchased by the council in 1949, it included the entirety of the passageway, he insists.\n\nIn his defence to his neighbours' claim, his barrister Sebastian Kokelaar says the Gueterbocks originally objected to the planning application for the MacPhail house.\n\nMr MacPhail, now a professional motivational speaker, pictured, denies encroaching on his neighbours' land and is fighting a case he says could result in him having to take apart his stunning new home\n\nThey had concerns over the boundary line, a basement lighting grate in the alley floor, and their access for bikes and pushchairs down the side of the house.\n\nBut after negotiations, they had withdrawn their objection, which he says meant they effectively agreed that the gap between the houses was part of what is now the MacPhail property.\n\nThe boundary between them runs along the side of the Gueterbocks' house, he says.\n\n'They stood by and allowed the development to proceed, knowing that the company and the MacPhails believed - mistakenly, on the Gueterbocks' case - that the plans submitted to the council in support of the planning application correctly showed the location of the boundary,' he says.\n\n'If, which is denied, the Gueterbocks are the legal owners of the western half of the passageway, it would be unconscionable for them now to insist on their rights of ownership.'\n\nIn court, the MacPhails' solicitor, Thomas West, said any court order requiring the basement or outer wall of the house to be moved would effectively mean 'partial demolition of a completed building'.\n\nThe case appeared in court for a brief preliminary hearing in which parts of the case against Mrs MacPhail were dismissed because, since her November 2016 divorce, she no longer owns the house.\n\nThe Gueterbocks are seeking an injunction requiring the partial filling in of the basement and repositioning of the house wall against Mr MacPhail alone.\n\nHowever, they continue to sue both Mr and Mrs MacPhail for damages for trespass from the date that the work started until the date she ceased to own it.\n\nNone of the neighbours were present for the hearing and the case itself will be heard by a judge at a later date.\n\nMr Gueterbock is son of Labour peer, Anthony Gueterbock, 18th Baron Berkeley, who sits in the House of Lords as The Lord Berkeley.\n\nMr MacPhail was a successful commodities broker but is now a professional motivational speaker and conference host, appearing at events all over the world.", "description": "Tom Gueterbock and his wife, Helen, say their neighbours staged a 'land grab' when they built a luxurious new home on what was once a Luftwaffe bomb site next-door, in Wandsworth.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19733516-0-image-a-54_1571132489088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
