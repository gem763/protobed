He has warned that the United States is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to punish Iran, if necessary, after the attack on Saudi oil facilities over the weekend.\n\nBut Trump has also eagerly courted a sit-down negotiation with the leader of Iran, called off a military strike earlier this year because it could have killed too many Iranians and has flirted with a plan to offer Tehran a $15 billion lifeline to help it deal with the crushing U.S. sanctions.\n\nOn Monday in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters \u201cwe don\u2019t want war with anybody\u201d and then less than an hour later said he thinks a U.S. military strike on an Iranian oil facility would be a proportional response.\n\nThe head-spinning contradictions hold a certain logic in Trump\u2019s view, but also throw the imprecision and disarray of Trumpian foreign policy decision-making into high relief. On Iran, Trump is caught between a political imperative to confront Iran, pleasing hawkish Republican supporters and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, and his own political instincts against foreign intervention and toward cutting a deal.\n\nBut uncertainty over where Trump stands has complicated every other foreign policy challenge the United States faces in the Middle East, unnerved ally Israel and helped push out the administration\u2019s leading Iran hawk, former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the way you do diplomacy\u201d and heightens the risk of \u201cmiscalculation\u201d on both the Iranian and U.S. sides, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said Monday during an interview with MSNBC. Cardin is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nTrump\u2019s dual approach on Iran is premised on the idea that by walking out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran and replacing the pact\u2019s concessions with new sanctions, Trump can both please the hawks and force Iran to the bargaining table for a deal that would carry the Trump brand.\n\nTrump would be the first U.S. president to meet an Iranian president since the 1970s, an idea that appeals to him, said advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the president\u2019s views. He has made an offer that has no precedent since the Islamic republic was born out of a bitterly anti-American revolution in 1979, saying repeatedly that he would sit down with \u201cno conditions.\u201d\n\nPolitical allies have also advised Trump that a military attack could escalate and hurt him with key supporters who like his \u201cAmerica First\u201d pledge to limit U.S. obligations overseas, one senior administration official and one outside adviser said Monday.\n\nAlthough Trump campaigned in 2016 on closing down what he called endless wars, he has not brought troops home from Afghanistan or Iraq, and would not want to head into reelection next year saddled with a new conflict in the Middle East, these advisers said. To do so would hand Democrats a compelling argument that Trump bumbled his way into a war, according to one of the advisers.\n\nTrump\u2019s split-screen impulses on Iran have one constant, current and former officials said. He wants to best the legacy of former president Barack Obama.\n\nUnder that umbrella, the locked-and-loaded comment on Sunday comes from a desire to confront a tough adversary with greater toughness, something he says Obama failed to do. And the invitation to Iran to negotiate comes from Trump\u2019s thinking that he can drive a harder bargain than his predecessor.\n\nTrump particularly wants to show up traditional foreign policy hands and U.S. allies who point to the 2015 nuclear deal as a signature Obama achievement, people who have discussed Iran policy with him said.\n\nTrump himself pointed out how his deal would be different from Obama\u2019s last week when he said Iran wants a deal.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon, and they never will have a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re thinking about enrichment, they can forget about it, because it\u2019s going to be very, it\u2019s going to be very dangerous for them to enrich.\u201d\n\nThat was a reference to the 2015 deal\u2019s allowance for low-level uranium enrichment. Opponents of the deal say any enrichment gives Iran an eventual path to a nuclear weapon, and Trump says he would close that loophole.\n\nTrump shares a disdain for that agreement with Bolton, Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as foreign policy hawks he consults such as Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). He does not, however, share their broad skepticism about negotiating with Iran.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure last week came after Trump had mused about the possibility of ending some of the U.S. sanctions on Tehran as an inducement to talks, an idea the Iran hawk could not stomach, a person close to Bolton said Saturday.\n\nTrump said Monday he has no meeting scheduled with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani when both leaders are in New York next week for the annual U.N. General Assembly, but he repeated a claim that \u201cthey want to meet\u201d eventually.\n\nIran has publicly ruled out a meeting until sanctions are lifted, and the already improbable New York sit-down next week now appears even more remote.\n\nOn Wednesday, three days before the oil attack in Saudi Arabia, Trump had sounded more confident.\n\n\u201cI do believe they\u2019d like to make a deal\u201d because of the \u201ctremendous financial difficulty\u201d brought on by U.S. sanctions, he said. \u201cIf they do, that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s great too.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump said the news media had misrepresented his \u201cno conditions\u201d offer. The U.S. sanctions themselves are \u201ca condition\u201d and will not be lifted, Trump asserted.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure removes the loudest voice in favor of the administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy with Iran but will not end the internal disconnect over talks.\n\nOther advisers, including Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, have avoided offering broad endorsements of new talks but do not contradict their boss.\n\n\u201cI would say Secretary Pompeo and myself and the president are completely aligned on our maximum pressure campaign. I think you know we\u2019ve done more sanctions on Iran than anybody, and it\u2019s absolutely working,\u201d Mnuchin said Sept. 10, hours after Trump said he had fired Bolton. \u201cNow, the president has made clear he is happy to take a meeting with no preconditions, but we are maintaining the maximum pressure campaign.\u201d\n\nPompeo was then asked whether he could foresee a meeting between Trump and Rouhani at the U.N. gathering, and whether Pompeo supports that path.\n\n\u201cThe president has made very clear he is prepared to meet with no preconditions,\u201d Pompeo said.", "description": "Trump is caught between a political imperative to confront Iran, pleasing hawkish Republican supporters and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, and his own political instincts against foreign intervention and toward cutting a deal.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wdFrqJQcW1vPamo5BTGqqc6cANI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7WDLXBWY2QI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
