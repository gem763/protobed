Turkish forces overran 18 villages overnight, most of them near Tal Abyad, raising the number they have taken so far to 23.\n\nAid agencies have warned of a looming humanitarian crisis for up to 1.6million people as Kurdish families jammed roads heading south to the fringes of the 20-mile border zone that Erdogan has said he will occupy.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters evacuate an injured fellow combatant as they return on a pickup truck from Tel Abyad\n\nTurkish citizens show their support as military vehicles drive to support other units involved in Operation Peace Spring\n\nTurkish soldiers stand near military trucks in the village of Yabisa, near the Turkish-Syrian border\n\nA Turkish police armored vehicle patrols the town of Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, at the border with Syria\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters stand on a vehicle in the village of Yabisa, near the Turkish-Syrian border\n\nOn Friday evening, Turkish President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan dismissed mounting international criticism of the operation and said Turkey 'will not stop it, no matter what anyone says'.

Columns of exhausted residents filed into the nearby town of Tal Tamr where aid workers handed out food, blankets and water.\n\nTanks and heavy artillery continued to pour across Turkey\u2019s border with Syria at Sanliurfa to bolster the assault on Kurdish-held border towns. A dense cloud of black smoke billowed from Ras al-Ain following an intense ground and air assault yesterday.\n\nTurkish forces and Syrian rebels were pushing deeper into Kurdish-occupied northern Syria. Turkish forces also captured 18 villages in the area as part of an operation codenamed Peace Spring. Five IS prisoners broke out of prison in Qamishli during a riot prompted by a Turkish air strike.\n\nAccording to the latest figures, 74 Kurdish YPG fighters have died in clashes.

On this front, they were able to cut the roads linking together Suluk, Tel Abyad, Ras al-Ain with the villages in the area,' he said.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its efforts to persuade Ankara to halt the incursion against US-backed Kurdish forces, saying Ankara was causing 'great harm' to ties and could face sanctions.\n\nTurkey opened its offensive after US President Donald Trump spoke by phone on Sunday with Erdogan and withdrew US troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump's decision drew swift bipartisan criticism that he was endangering regional stability and risking the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who brought down the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces were the main US ally in the fight against IS and lost 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against the extremists.\n\nTurkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters have made gains recently capturing several northern villages in fighting and bombardment that left dozens of people killed or wounded.\n\nProtesters started a demonstration at the Turkish Embassy in Warsaw with over 1,000 Poles, along with Kurds living in Poland, against the attack by Turkish military on Kurdish troops in Syria\n\nWarsaw protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against the Turkish invasion into Syria.

Indeed the necessary coordination is being carried out by our headquarters and the Americans,' Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Saturday.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, with the Kurdish YPG as its main fighting element, now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State's 'caliphate' in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its efforts to persuade Ankara to halt the incursion against US-backed Kurdish forces\n\nThe US said Ankara was causing 'great harm' to ties and could face sanctions in the future\n\nA US military vehicle patrols a road near the town of Tal Baydar in the countryside of Syria's northeastern Hasakeh province on Saturday\n\nThe Kurdish militia said the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge as some of its followers were escaping from prisons.\n\nIn its first big attack since the assault began on Tuesday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, even as the city came under Turkish shelling.\n\nFive Islamic State fighters fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Mark Esper has told his Turkish counterpart they should de-escalate the situation before it becomes 'irreparable', while European Council President Donald Tusk warned it could lead to a 'humanitarian catastrophe'.\n\nA motorist passes by in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, at the border with Syria\n\nSmoke billows from Tel Abyad in Syria on Saturday in a photograph taken from the Turkish side of the border\n\nErdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, responded to the criticism on Saturday, saying 'Turkey's fight is against terrorists, not Kurds or civilians'.\n\n'Blackmail and threats will never deter Turkey from its just cause,' Kalin wrote on Twitter. 'God willing victory will be ours.'\n\nUS lawmakers introduced more legislation on Friday seeking stiff sanctions on Turkey over the offensive, underscoring unhappiness from both Democrats and President Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress over his Syria policy.\n\nRas al-Ayn is one of the biggest towns along the border and it is in the middle of the area that Turkey plans to set up its safe zone.\n\nThe ethnically and religiously mixed town with a population of Arabs, Kurds, Armenians and Syriac Christians had been under the control of Kurdish fighters since 2013.\n\nIS members tried to enter Ras al-Ayn following their rise in Syria and Iraq in 2014 but failed.", "description": "Boris Johnson voiced his 'grave concern' about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's military assault on Kurdish-held northern Syria in a telephone call to the leader.", "authors": ["Isabella Nikolic", "Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/01/19640608-0-image-a-14_1570925553952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
