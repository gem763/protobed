(AP) - With the season on the line, Alyssa Thomas and the Connecticut Sun turned up their defense to stop the Washington Mystics and force a decisive Game 5 of the WNBA Finals.\n\nThomas had 17 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds and the Sun held the Mystics without a point over the final 2:10 to beat Washington 90-86 on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt was just about being together out there, being on the same page, knowing the game plan and protecting home court,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re all locked in and on the same page, we just move in unison.\u201d\n\nThe title will be decided Thursday night in Washington with a first-time champion crowned. Thomas fell just short of the first triple-double in Finals history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having the time of our life right now,\u201d Sun coach Curt Miller said. \u201cYou dream as a little kid being in a deciding final game, a Game 7 or 5 to win a world championship. If you grew up a basketball fan, these are the moments you dreamed of.\u201d\n\nJonquel Jones had 18 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Sun, who had five players score in double figures.\n\nConnecticut blew a 16-point halftime lead as Washington used a huge third quarter to tie the game at 68. The Mystics kept it going to start the fourth, opening up a five-point lead. With their season on the line, the Sun responded.\n\nJasmine Thomas hit a 3-pointer to put the Sun ahead 84-81. The lead was short-lived as Emma Meesseman answered with a 3 from the wing to tie the game again.\n\nShekinna Stricklen, the league\u2019s 3-point champion at the All-Star Game, then shook off a defender before making another 3 to give the Sun an 87-84 advantage with 2:22 left. Natasha Cloud made a layup a few seconds later to get the Mystics within one. But Washington didn\u2019t score again.\n\nAerial Powers, who led Washington with 15 points, missed an open 3-pointer in the corner with 27.5 seconds left that would have put the Mystics ahead.\n\n\u201cBoth teams were making big shots. We\u2019d make a 3, they\u2019d answer with a 3,\u201d Miller said. \u201cUltimately we made a few more plays down the stretch. We got to the line down the stretch. Alyssa Thomas was best foul shooter in the game.\u201d\n\nConnecticut got the rebound and Jasmine Thomas sank two free throws with 18.4 seconds left to make it a three-point game.\n\nAfter a timeout, Cloud drove to the basket but missed the shot and Alyssa Thomas corralled the rebound and hit the first of two free throws to seal the win.\n\n\u201cI think we also had a few open shots we didn\u2019t hit,\u201d Powers said. \u201cThe ball movement wasn\u2019t there, we didn\u2019t hit shots. We need to be better come Thursday.\u201d\n\nElena Delle Donne, who left Game 2 with back spasms that an MRI later showed resulted from a herniated disk, was able to play more Tuesday night than in Game 3, when she was limited to 26 minutes. The league MVP had 11 points and five rebounds while playing 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cI was a little looser today, so felt better. Hopefully continue to progress and feel better Thursday,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cThey were playing more aggressive defensively. They weren\u2019t letting us sit outside and shoot 3s.\u201d\n\nHaving a chance to win the title at home on Thursday gave the Mystics some confidence.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we worked for this whole season,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cCan\u2019t rely on being home to get it done. The way we came out and started the game dug us into a huge hole. They are a great team, and you give that type of lead to them, makes thing difficult.\u201d\n\nFIRST QUARTER PREDICTOR\n\nGame 4 held to form for this series, with the team that led after the first quarter coming away with the victory. The Sun outscored Washington by 15 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Mystics won the opening period of Game 1 by 13 points. Connecticut was ahead by 12 in the second game and Washington by 15 in Game 3. Each time, the team that was trailing in the period had 17 points.\n\nFOUL SHOOTING DISPARITY\n\nConnecticut took 26 free throws to only 13 by Washington, with Delle Donne and Meesseman only combining for three attempts. Mystics coach Mike Thibault wasn\u2019t sure why that was the case, especially when the Sun only committed one foul in the final quarter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling how to understand how Connecticut played with one foul in the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cFree throw attempts was 26-13. If we could have gone to the line a couple times, we could have slowed the momentum down a little bit.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGame 5 is Thursday night in Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-Sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With the season on the line, Alyssa Thomas and the Connecticut Sun turned up their defense to stop the Washington Mystics and force a decisive Game 5 of the WNBA Finals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/mystics_sun_basketball_10453_c0-155-2191-1432_s1770x1032.jpg?64d267e0d5db703b5c7b6560d0606c116bb5296a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
