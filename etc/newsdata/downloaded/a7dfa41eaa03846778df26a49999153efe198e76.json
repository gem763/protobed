Jackson, chief executive of Chicago Public Schools, wrote in a letter that the district is working to correct the problems. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)\n\nThe U.S. Education Department said Thursday that it had found \u201ctragic and inexcusable\u201d conduct by Chicago Public Schools in handling sexual harassment and violence complaints, detailing systemic failures to protect children.\n\nThe department\u2019s four-year investigation followed complaints from two students \u2014 one who alleged assault by a teacher, another by a large group of students \u2014 and was expanded to find widespread failure by the school system to address the allegations.\n\nThe district \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s largest \u2014 failed to provide services or remedies to those filing complaints, did not tell them the outcomes of investigations and did not take effective action to provide a safe environment, the Education Department said.\n\nKenneth Marcus, the Education Department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights, said the investigation was the largest of its kind and called the findings \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chicago Public Schools have inexcusably failed, for quite some time, to provide their students with the basic protections required by law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot permit this to occur in Chicago or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the Chicago Tribune found more than 500 police reports of sexual assault or abuse of a child inside a Chicago public school over the prior decade. Soon after, the agency appears to have expanded its investigation.\n\nThat investigation included reviews of 2,800 complaints of student-on-student harassment and 280 adult-on-student allegations over four years.\n\nThe original probe was sparked by two cases.\n\nIn the first, a student said a teacher frequently commented on her body and appearance, bought her food and gifts, texted, and emailed her from a private account he used to send photos of himself. He also professed his love. Eventually, he took her out, bought her alcohol, kissed and fondled her and forced oral sex, even as she cried and begged him to stop, the Education Department said.\n\nIn the second complaint, a student said she was surrounded by 13 boys on her way home from class, some of whom she recognized from school, forced into a vacant building and repeatedly raped.\n\nIn both cases, and many others, the civil rights office concluded, the Chicago schools mishandled the complaints.\n\nUnder the settlement announced Thursday, the Chicago school system agreed to give those who believe their complaints were mishandled the chance for a second, independent review. It also promised to review the actions of district employees who failed to properly respond to allegations. And it promised changes in its procedures for handling Title IX investigations.\n\nIn a letter to \u201cfriends and supporters\u201d on Thursday, the chief executive of the Chicago schools, Janice K. Jackson, said the district is already working to correct the problems. She said the events described in the federal report occurred before the district began to implement new protections for students.\n\n\u201cThese were tragic incidents in which some students did not receive the comprehensive support they deserved. As a district, we have been working to ensure no student ever goes through that again,\u201d she wrote.\n\nUnder Title IX, school districts can lose federal funding if they discriminate on the basis of sex in their programs or activities. Under that law, districts are obligated to respond promptly and equitably to allegations of sexual harassment, including sexual assault and violence.\n\nWithholding federal funding would be an option if the district fails to comply with the order, Marcus said.", "description": "System officials pledge reforms in a settlement with the federal government.", "authors": ["Laura Meckler", "Reporter Covering National Education Policy", "Trends", "The Education Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zDIFx8GmNP4cNTEWC_rwxaDp7t8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WWBNEHWVUII6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
