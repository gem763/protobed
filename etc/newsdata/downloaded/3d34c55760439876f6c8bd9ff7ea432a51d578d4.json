With former All Blacks head coach Mitchell his current assistant, Jones needs no second opinion on what the Kiwis will be up to this week, and he believes that even if they were able to watch England\u2019s full training session, they will have learned very little from it.\n\n\u201cThe game is pretty small, you know all the coaches,\u201d said Mitchell, who coached the All Blacks from 2001 until their third-place finish at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. \u201cI played with Ian Foster for 10 years, and I used to coach Scott McLeod [New Zealand assistant coaches], so I know all these guys really well. If that is what they want to do and that is the way they want to prepare, good luck to them. The game is highly unstructured, so I don't see any advantage in it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The facilities have been excellent, but it is an area where people live and there are the odd red lights around. There was one up in the corner which was a bit suspicious.\u201d\n\nIn his press conference, Jones had claimed that he had not used spying tactics at all since 2001, and even turned to Mitchell to claim he had spied on his own Wallabies team during that era, when Mitchell served under Sir Clive Woodward with England.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We are definitely not a group who wants to increase the anxiety. There is enough pressure at this level, let alone chasing around some blokes that might be in a building with a camera.\u201d\n\nMitchell did go on the offensive in discussing how much pressure is on the All Blacks though. Jones was keen to stress that England have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d this weekend, despite their World Cup hopes being on the line just as much as New Zealand\u2019s, and Mitchell believes the right way to get at the All Blacks comes not in using words to get under their skin but by knocking them off their game plan and making them dance to the beat that England give them.\n\n\"Definitely, it's about putting more pressure on them,\u201d he said. \"It's about getting our game going and applying that pressure. Like every rugby team, them in particular, they love to be at the right end of the field.\n\n\"If you deny them the right end of the field you have every opportunity of applying and initiating what we have, what we're good at.\n\n\"So I guess that's the challenge in front of us. One that tactically we're excited about and also physically excited about. They are going to have to handle pressure like we are on the weekend. I guess it is a case of who can sustain that pressure. We are going to have to go the distance, because they will fight right to the end \u2013 that is their nature and we are well aware of that. They deserve credit for that. But at the end of the day if you want to be the best in the world you have to go the distance.\u201d\n\nJones also took a swipe at the New Zealand media for giving Steve Hansen and his side an easy ride \u2013 something that Mitchell was not exactly afforded during his time in charge. The 55-year-old former All Black had a fractured relationship with the media in his hometown, something that played a large factor in costing him his job following the 22-10 defeat to Jones\u2019s Wallabies side in the 2003 semi-finals, so it was no surprise to hear him echo his boss\u2019s thoughts that the current crop of press were \u201cfans with keyboards\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think Steve has been in that post a long time and he has been extremely successful and he is seeking to repeat, and has made some changes in the last year,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cI think probably the New Zealand media have become very comfortable with Steve\u2019s personality and the way he communicates. He is not too different to Eddie in the sense that he actually has a bit of fun in his media as well.\n\n\u201cHe probably deserves an easy ride. He has been the most successful Test coach in the last two World Cups and is obviously under pressure to do a third one.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones ignited a \u2018spygate\u2019 row at the Rugby World Cup yesterday as England\u00a0accused the\u00a0All Blacks of watching their semi-final opponents New Zealand\u00a0of spying on training, with their own in-house Kiwi John Mitchell brushing off the All Blacks\u2019 attempts to get under their skin by claiming the world champions are the ones under all the pressure.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/15/john-mitchell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
