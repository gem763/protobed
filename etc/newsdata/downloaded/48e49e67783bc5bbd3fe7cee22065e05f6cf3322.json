But so far, they are still testing out ways to undercut her appeal.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s steady rise has prompted primary opponents such as Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg to search for ways to blunt her momentum at a time when the leading contender, Joe Biden, has weathered a series of stumbles and direct attacks.\n\nWhile candidates have tangled publicly with the former vice president over everything from his age to his agenda, they are being more cautious with Ms. Warren, often criticizing her indirectly or homing in on her policy proposals rather than her record.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of great people running, but some of these ideas are better left in the college faculty lounge than right here at this port,\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a stop Thursday at a Detroit port.\n\nShe said later that she wasn\u2019t singling out the former Harvard Law professor.\n\nMs. Harris, meanwhile, expressed her frustration about Ms. Warren\u2019s fundraising practices during a private New York fundraiser on Tuesday, people familiar with the event said. Ms. Harris, who hasn\u2019t been so critical of the Massachusetts senator in public, said it was hypocritical for Ms. Warren to claim she wasn\u2019t taking money from large donors when her campaign was using millions transferred from her Senate account and raised before she swore off traditional fundraising.\n\nPowered by large-scale rallies, Ms. Warren has attracted liberals and college-educated women as she seeks to challenge Mr. Biden in the primaries. But a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed a boost in enthusiasm for Ms. Warren and detailed support for her among a range of age groups and backgrounds.\n\nThat is giving her opponents an incentive to confront her on health care and fundraising with an eye on cracking into her support in Iowa, where she has organized heavily ahead of next February\u2019s leadoff caucuses.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t immediately have a comment.\n\nThe large field of Democratic contenders is gathering in Des Moines this weekend for the Polk County Democrats\u2019 steak fry fundraiser, an annual event expected to draw more than 10,000 activists.\n\nMany Democratic campaigns have taken to heart the lessons of 2016, in which several Republican campaigns declined to challenge Donald Trump forcefully until he had built a significant advantage in the primary and then went on to win the party\u2019s nomination and the presidency. Democrats have already tried to pick off Mr. Biden\u2019s support.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed a boost in enthusiasm for Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

But both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are looming large over his race.\n\nNeil Bluhm, a billionaire real estate and casino magnate, introduced the former vice president at a Chicago fundraiser on Thursday, telling the audience that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u201cdon\u2019t represent the Democratic Party\u201d that he supports and that Mr. Biden \u201chas the best chance of defeating Trump.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Warren may be gaining momentum, Mr. Sanders is still largely focused on Mr. Biden, with whom he has more clearly defined policy and strategy differences.\n\nAides to Mr. Sanders have long said they believe that Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders share a similar section of working-class voters and that one could benefit if the other stumbles.\n\nWhen asked about Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach to Ms. Warren, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said Mr. Sanders would highlight that he \u201cis the only leading candidate who is running a 100% grass-roots campaign and committed to funding a grass-roots funded general election campaign.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that Mr. Sanders said during the most recent Democratic debate that he was the only candidate to vote against all of the military budgets in the Trump administration.\n\nMs. Warren has voted for one of the three, but Mr. Sanders didn\u2019t mention her.\n\n\u2014Emily Glazer, John McCormick and Gabriel T.
