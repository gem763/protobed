REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nBoth MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS and Japan's Nikkei .N225 were little changed in early trade while U.S. stock futures ESc1 lost 0.15%.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX shed 0.20% the previous day after data showed U.S. retail sales contracted in September for the first time in seven months, in a potential sign that manufacturing-led weakness could be spreading to the broader economy.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the trade war has claimed yet another victim, in addition to diminished business confidence and reduced investment spending, as consumers are starting to chicken out,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.\n\nGiven U.S. consumption has been one of few remaining bright spots in the global economy, the data fanned worries about a global recession.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month.\n\nBut he also said there were no plans for another high-level meeting on the trade deal outlined last week.\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. suspended a hike in tariffs, it hasn\u2019t gone as far as scrapping the tariffs altogether, so it is hard to expect a quick pick-up in the economy,\u201d said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nLosses in equities were offset by a solid start to the earnings season, though that is partly because investors have already marked down their expectations substantially, with earnings for S&P 500 companies expected to show a decline of 3% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nBank of America (BAC.N) shares rose 2.0% following its quarterly results. Netflix (NFLX.O) rose 9.9% in after-hours trade after its earnings beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nIn the currency market, soft U.S. retail sales took the shine out of the dollar.\n\nThe dollar index =USD fell 0.30% on Wednesday and last stood at 97.964, having touched its lowest since Aug. 27.\n\nAgainst the yen the dollar slipped to 108.73 yen JPY=, after peaking at 108.90 on Tuesday.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.1075 EUR=, up 0.04% so far in Asia,near a one-month high of $1.1085 hit in U.S. trade on Wednesday.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2823 GBP=D4, having risen to as high as $1.2877 on Wednesday, its loftiest level since mid-May.\n\nIt has risen more than 5% in the past five sessions on the prospect that the United Kingdom and the European Union can strike a fresh deal to avoid a no-deal exit in the summit on Thursday and Friday.\n\nInvestors have welcomed optimistic comments from key officials during last few days. British culture minister Nicky Morgan said late on Wednesday there is a good chance of a deal.\n\nStill, many doubts remained, not the least of which is if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson can ensure his government and factious parliament approve the plan.\n\nIn one sign of investor caution, in currency option markets, risk reversal spreads in sterling GBP1MRR=FN turned in favor of pound puts after briefly favouring pound calls earlier this week, meaning demand to protect the currency\u2019s downside is stronger than that for the upside.\n\nThe Turkish lira steadied off seven-week lows as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sanctions for Turkey\u2019s military incursion into Syria were perceived to be lighter than expected.\n\nLira bears also suffered a flashback of their suffocating March squeeze as the authorities moved to keep a lid on volatility by restricting the supply of lira to overseas counterparts.\n\nThe lira stood at 5.8825 per dollar TRYTOM=D3\n\nOil prices eased after U.S. data showed a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude stocks.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 0.82% to $58.93 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 lost 1.01% to $52.82 per barrel.", "description": "Global stocks barely moved on Thursday as soft U.S. retail sales data raised concerns about the health of the world's largest economy and risk of global recession, while sterling was volatile as negotiations on a Brexit deal continued.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441684397&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G02Q", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
