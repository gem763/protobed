Crosthwaite who was previously chief strategy and growth officer at Altria Group Inc. Altria paid $12.8 billion to acquire the Juul stake in December.\n\nAs part of a broad review of practices, Juul said it\u2019s suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the U.S., and will refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on its draft guidance. The announcement comes after a crackdown on e-cigarettes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration following a recent outbreak of severe lung disease that appears to be related to vaping. More than 530 Americans have been diagnosed with the illness and at least eight people have died. Juul is the subject of a criminal probe in California.\n\nSee also: As Trump officials plan to \u2018clear flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\u2019 Juul signals some support for the move\n\n\u201cI have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,\u201d Crosthwaite said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said that while she was dismayed at the breakdown in the Philip Morris and Altria merger talks, she was not surprised, given the length of time they were taking and the constant negative headlines from the FDA throughout.\n\nRead now: Vape sales are falling on fears about the outbreak of vaping-related lung illness\n\n\u201cWe expect the stocks to trade up sharply (especially PM) since clearly the market wasn\u2019t in favor of this combination, with PM trading up more than MO as concerns about JUUL have weighed on MO and will likely continue to weigh on MO\u2019s multiple,\u201d Herzog wrote in an early note to clients. \u201cHowever, we continue to think those concerns are overblown and continue to recommend the stock.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Herzog expects talks to resume in the future once the environment improves. Philip Morris remains her top stock pick, she wrote.\n\nPhilip Morris and Atlria had announced merger talks in late August that would have reunited them after more than a decade apart.\n\nThe IQOS product is a heated tobacco product that is the only one to have premarket approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cIQOS is not an e-vapor product,\u201d the companies said in a statement. \u201cPMI submitted a comprehensive body of scientific evidence in support of this premarket authorization and of the parallel applications for IQOS as a \u201cModified Risk Tobacco Product,\u201d which the FDA continues to review.\u201d\n\nRelated: Juul\u2019s billionaire co-founder plays defense as House Democrats question company\u2019s moves on youth vaping\n\nMeanwhile, Altria tightened its full-year guidance and said it now expects adjusted per-share earnings to range from $4.19 to $4.27, versus a prior range of $4.15 to $4.27. The company is still expecting 2019 domestic cigarette industry volumes to fall 5% to 6%.\n\nPhilip Morris shares have gained 17.2% in 2019, while Altria has lost 17.5%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.16% has gained 18.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.28% has gained 14.9% so far this year.\n\nSee now: Teens can spend $1,000 a year on vaping \u2014 and the crackdown on Juul is making it more expensive", "description": "Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc. surprised the market early Wednesday with the news that they are ending their merger talks and will...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Tomi Kilgore", "Corporate News Editor", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS005_IQOS_0_ZG_20190925080905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
