Couple hours later, someone is banging on his back door, and it\u2019s a fenced yard. And then someone jumps out of the bushes. You can\u2019t really say anything against Mr Dennis for doing what he did.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnybody who is religious out there, you need to pray for this family. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more 15-year-old boy killed trying to protect his sister during burglary", "description": "A father shot dead his son-in-law after he jumped out of bushes for a birthday surprise, police have said.Richard Dennis fired off a round at Christopher Bergan, 37, apparently fearing he was under attack at his own home.", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wnj87dMaNfH3_4CsiMCs5A--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/0fea05184de450e881ea56312e38ad4b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
