In the village of just 2,600 residents, other candidates to lead the unelected council, made up of volunteers, had not been forthcoming.\n\nNews of the decision quickly flung the village near Frankfurt into the national spotlight, drawing widespread condemnation from regional and national branches of the parties whose local representatives had supported the candidate.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel\u2019s successor as head of the Christian Democrats, said her party would investigate how members had backed Jagsch and called for a reversal.\n\n\u201cWe learned about this decision one day after the election with horror and absolute incomprehension,\u201d the district-level office of the Christian Democrats said in a statement. \u201cWe are decisively disassociating ourselves from this decision,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWe do not cooperate with Nazis! Never!\u201d tweeted Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the Social Democrats.\n\nJagsch, who also is deputy chairman of the NPD in Hesse, has vowed to fight efforts to oust him.\n\nThe NPD has survived efforts to ban it. The last effort, in 2017, was thrown out by Germany\u2019s highest court, which said the party was too small to pose a threat to democracy.\n\nIn recent years, the neo-Nazi party has been eclipsed by the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has more widespread appeal with the fringe right.\n\nLucia Puttrich, the regional head of the Christian Democrats, who has been spearheading efforts to reverse the decision, said eight of the nine local council members, everyone except Jagsch, had agreed to reverse the decision as of Tuesday, a move that requires a two-thirds majority.\n\nBut some have defended their decision.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to help the people and address their issues, that\u2019s all,\u201d Norbert Szilakso, a Christian Democrat council member, told broadcaster Deutsche Welle. \u201cParty membership doesn\u2019t play a role for us.\u201d\n\nSzilakso told local news outlet Hessenschau that Jagsch was \u201ccollegial and calm\u201d and that what he does in private or his party affiliation was not a concern. His computer skills were what mattered.\n\n\u201cThey voted for him because they know him personally, but they weren\u2019t aware that it\u2019s a political \u2018no go,\u2019 \u201d Puttich said, adding that there had been \u201cuproar\u201d among local residents. \u201cHe\u2019s a wolf in sheep\u2019s skin. He seems friendly, but they didn\u2019t understand the political significance.\u201d\n\nFar right surges in eastern Germany elections, exit polls show, but falls short of wins\n\nThe Germany of 1892 was liberating for W.E.B. Du Bois. Many minorities don\u2019t feel that today.\n\nHow anxiety about the present has changed visits to former Nazi concentration camps\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The decision of the local council to vote in a member of the National Democratic Party as chief has sparked outrage.", "authors": ["Loveday Morris", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "Luisa Beck", "Reporter Covering Europe The Washington Post'S Berlin Bureau"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QOFS6SWT2YI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
