Charlie Baker and Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel.\n\nWilkins wrote that \"while the plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success, the balance of harms weigh in defendants' favor in some respects, and an immediate injunction against the entire Order would contravene the public interest.\"\n\nWilkins also ruled that, when it comes to nicotine-vaping products specifically, the order \"is preliminarily enjoined\" from implementation and enforcement after October 28. In the meantime, the state will have to make changes to the order regarding the sale of nicotine-containing vaping products.\n\n\"The court therefore allows the defendants an opportunity to cure the defects,\" Wilkins ruled regarding the sale of nicotine-containing products. \"Nothing in this Memorandum and Order shall affect the validity of the defendants' Order as applied to products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and any other cannabinoid or to black market products.\"", "description": "A Massachusetts judge ruled Monday that the state's four-month ban on the sale of all e-cigarettes and vaping products can remain in effect \u2014 but only for about a week.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191010141057-vaping-high-school-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
