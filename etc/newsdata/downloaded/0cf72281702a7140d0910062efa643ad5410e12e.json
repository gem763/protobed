Patients who fork over their $50,000 don\u2019t feel better about themselves because they want to feel better about themselves; they do because their DNA has been rebuilt like a \u201957 Chevy Bel Air with fresh polish and a new engine block. Miles 2.0 is shiny and rejuvenated, as unsullied as a newborn child but with the privileges of adulthood, which is a fantasy all middle-aged people have, especially when they\u2019re burnt out at work, listless in their marriage, and absent the joie de vivre they enjoyed when they were younger and the world was still new and surprising.\n\nThe bad news? It\u2019s all downhill from here.\n\nThe first episode of \u201cMade in a Strip Mall\u201d was told entirely from old Miles\u2019s perspective, so it\u2019s a smart move to circle back to Miles 2.0 and how his day went before he discovered his doppelg\u00e4nger. As it happens, he feels amazing after his hard reboot, breezing right through the post-op paperwork and instructions, which veer toward the Gremlins-esque. (Don\u2019t look the first time you use the toilet.) When he gets in his car, he discovers he doesn\u2019t even need his glasses anymore \u2014 it\u2019s like his entire body has received Lasik. He then becomes a character out of a Terrence Malick movie, dashing into a cornfield just to appreciate the beauty and tactility of nature and the sun glinting through the stalks. The old Miles was not a frolicker.\n\nMiles\u2019s bliss carries over into the office and at home later in the day. He cannot fathom returning to a job that\u2019s so meaningless to him, so his solution is to impose meaning on it. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting here in this hermetically sealed coffin of a conference room,\u201d he says, \u201cspending our precious minutes here on this planet to sell some cellular infrastructure company when we could be out living and breathing and fucking and dreaming. So why? Why do we give a shit?\u201d Those sound like the words of a man about to quit (or be fired), but his mind is set on accentuating the positive aspects of a (relatively) ma-and-pa telecom business, which is the personal connection that it facilitates. It\u2019s almost a shame that his pitch lands, but this part of \u201cMade in a Strip Mall\u201d is about emphasizing his happiness, and his confidence and passion carries the day. Sometimes people are grateful for the opportunity to feel good about themselves, and certainly the occupants of this \u201chermetically sealed coffin\u201d would qualify.\n\nBack at home, Miles 2.0 weirds out his wife, Kate, with homemade casserole of farm-to-table apples and squash and a soliloquy about how amazing she is. He even smells her later on. Their marriage has been fraught over the issue of his delayed appointments at the fertility clinic, which she has taken as an indication of his indifference about starting a family. But on this point, Miles 2.0 is sincerely reformed and reinvigorated, and his newfound excitement about Kate carries over into a newfound excitement about having children together. It would be interesting to see a version of Living With Yourself in which Miles 2.0 comes out of this successful operation and never has to confront his original self. How long would it be until life beat him down again?\n\nBut halfway through the episode, when the doppelg\u00e4ngers confront each other, it\u2019s clear that Miles 2.0 is on an accelerated plan. When he and Miles drive back to the spa to get some answers on what happened to them, Miles 2.0 learns that he\u2019s the clone, which cancels any claim he has on the only life he knows. Now that blissful feeling is a curse: For a few hours, he was able to appreciate his job, his wife, and the world around him as he hadn\u2019t in years, and now he\u2019s entitled to none of it. Miles 2.0 now feels disappointment as vividly as he felt joy, like a Technicolor melancholy that sweeps over him, and now his future is seeming lonely and uncertain.\n\nThe conversation between Miles and Miles 2.0 over what the latter should do is full of insight into the fantasies entertained by those who feel hamstrung by commitment. Men and women like Miles, who are fully locked in by the expectations and routines of a life shared with someone else, like to think about what freedom would look like. What if they didn\u2019t have to go to work? What if they didn\u2019t have to continue the drudgery of domestic life? What if they had the resources and freedom to travel the world and do whatever they wanted? For Miles 2.0, there\u2019s a beachside cabana in Fiji that Miles himself will probably never visit. It\u2019s grass-is-greener scenarios like this that keep people from appreciating the lives they actually have, and the premise for \u201cMade in a Strip Mall\u201d allows it to make the point clear. When actually faced with the possibility of doing the thing Miles has fantasized about, Miles 2.0 is crushed by it. The beaches of Fiji are a poor consolation prize for a man who realizes he already has the life he wants.\n\nSo the episode ends with Miles 2.0 outside the house, coveting the life that old Miles has reclaimed. And he\u2019s probably feeling like that entitled sad sack doesn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nDouble Yous\n\n\u2022 The farmer who has now seen both versions of Miles \u2014 the one who picked from his field and the one who turned up later that night in a diaper \u2014 would seem to factor into how this plays out. Then again, both Miles are behaving so strangely that he has no reason to doubt they\u2019re the same guy.\n\n\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s so nice not to feel so full of shit for once.\u201d \u2014Miles 2.0, after kind of sounding full of shit.\n\n\u2022 The two Mileses exchange origin stories: \u201cI was made in a strip mall.\u201d \u201cSo what? I was born in New Jersey!\u201d\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
