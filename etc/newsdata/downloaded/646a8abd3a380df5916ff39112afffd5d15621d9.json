Her topic isn\u2019t all that unusual. She\u2019s discussing the fact that the audience at the World Series Game in Washington this week booed the President when he showed up. You would expect most of the MSM to cover that story heavily because it paints Donald Trump in an unfavorable light.\n\nWhat\u2019s unusual about Weiner\u2019s column is that she openly admits that she watched the video of the booing multiple times, relishing it more and more as she went along. Again, this shouldn\u2019t be in any way unexpected from a liberal columnist, but it\u2019s rather shocking to see one of them admit it in print. After the confession, Weiner launches into what appears at first glance to be some sort of contrition.\n\nIt felt like medicine, like balm for a weary soul. It wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d watched the footage sped up, slowed down and from six angles and heard myself crooning, \u201cLet me taste your tears!\u201d that I started feeling a little sick, as if I\u2019d gorged on Halloween candy. I realized that I was gloating. It was not a pleasant realization\u2026 The booing is fine. It\u2019s my own reaction to the booing that troubles me \u2014 the joy I took from Mr. Trump\u2019s pain and the example it sets for my kids.\n\nIf that small excerpt was all you saw of the column you might think that Weiner had reached a moment of self-realization and was on the path to redemption. Don\u2019t be fooled, however. That may be what she\u2019d like you to take away from this essay, but it\u2019s far from the truth. I had to scrub 90% of the article to find those three brief paragraphs. The rest of the lengthy piece is actually a massive justification for why the President should be treated like trash and how Democrats and liberals are so much better.\n\nHere\u2019s just one of many examples.\n\nWe \u2014 Democrats, liberals, progressives, the resistance, whatever you call the other side \u2014 are supposed to be better than that. We\u2019re supposed to be the party of the downtrodden and the less fortunate. While Republicans support the fat-cat billionaires, we stand up for the workers. While they put kids in cages, we work to reunite them with their families. When they build walls, we say, All are welcome here. For them, the cruelty is the point. For us, kindness matters. When they go low, we go high.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more where that came from. I\u2019m not sure if this is a case of actual delusion or willful ignorance, but it\u2019s an excellent example of how many of our liberal, intellectual betters see themselves. (Or at least claim to see themselves in public.) It\u2019s not a question of differences in policy or your approach to good governance. Conservatives are simply bad people. They are evil and relish the pain they inflict on puppies. And it\u2019s only right and proper that we treat them like garbage and relish their abuse.\n\nBut Ms. Weiner is worried about her own reaction, you see. That\u2019s the entire point of the column if we\u2019re to take her at her word. Treating the garbage Republicans like garbage is fine. They deserve it. But we can\u2019t allow ourselves to enjoy abusing them, you see, or we\u2019ll be just as bad as they are.\n\nThis is the attitude we\u2019re dealing with in modern political debates and what shapes the reporting coming out of all the major liberal outlets. And Ms. Weiner has inadvertently provided a valuable nugget to add to the growing body of evidence of just how warped these people\u2019s minds are.", "description": "It feels so good to be bad", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/washingtonpost.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
