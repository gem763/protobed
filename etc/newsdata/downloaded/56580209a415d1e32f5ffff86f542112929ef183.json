The deputies broke up the fight and told students who were watching to stand back, a sheriff\u2019s watch commander told KTLA.\n\nTwo students were pepper-sprayed, but no other injuries were reported, the commander said.\n\nIn an email sent to parents, Paramount Unified School District Superintendent Ruth Perez said the fight was over a nude photo of a student being circulated over social media.\n\nShe said about 20 to 30 students were involved in the fight and that food was thrown before deputies arrived and pepper-sprayed \"some students.\"\n\nBut parents said they suspected the tensions were racially motivated.\n\nAnother large fight at the campus earlier in the year was blamed on racial remarks.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department responded to the scene, but no one was transported to the hospital. Those affected were treated by the school nurse, the superintendent said in the email.\n\nSchool officials said the campus was not on lockdown, but several parents and a student called KTLA indicating that it was.\n\nA worker at the school told KTLA that her son goes to the school and was that he was pepper-sprayed. She said many students were hit by the chemical agent. It remains unclear exactly how many students were affected by the pepper spray.\n\nShe said she was told students would be dismissed from the school beginning at 2:45 p.m.\n\nNo further details about the incident have been released.\n\nAt least two sheriff's patrol vehicles and several deputies remained at the school at 3:20 p.m., as students appeared to be leaving the campus, aerial video from Sky5 showed.\n\nThe superintendent said in the email to parents that the students involved face \"disciplinary consequences.\"\n\n\"Our district does not tolerate this type of misbehavior and is committed to keeping our students safe,\" the email read.\n\nEditor's note: A source's name has been removed from this story.
