The timeline of human evolution can be traced back millions of years. Experts estimate that the family tree goes as such: 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 7 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge A recreation of a Neanderthal man is pictured 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early 'proto-human' shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - Ape like early humans, the Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's but other more human like features 3.9-2.9 million years ago - Australoipithecus afarensis lived in Africa. 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation 2.3 million years ago - Homo habilis first thought to have appeared in Africa 1.85 million years ago - First 'modern' hand emerges 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia 300,000 to 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa 50,000 to 40,000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe\n\nScientists think the muscles could date back to before humans' evolutionary ancestors turned from reptiles into mammals. Illustrated: Pelycosaurs, which were classed as 'mammal-like reptiles' and believed to be predecessors to modern-day mammals\n\nThe muscles are described as atavistic, meaning they were found in ancient evolutionary ancestors.\n\nOther examples of atavistic body parts are found throughout nature \u2013 ostriches and other flightless birds still have wings; dolphins, porpoises and whales begin to develop legs in the womb but then abandon them.\n\nEven in humans, the tailbone or coccyx is a remnant of when we used to grow tails.\n\nIt has in the past been difficult to find these atavistic developments or to picture them clearly, the scientists said, but modern scanning technology makes it possible to do so in 3D in unprecedented detail.\n\nDr Diogo added: 'It used to be that we had more understanding of the early development of fishes, frogs, chicken and mice than in our own species.\n\n'But these new techniques allow us to see human development in much greater detail.\n\n'What is fascinating is that we observed various muscles that have never been described in human prenatal development, and that some of these atavistic muscles were seen even in 11.5-weeks old fetuses, which is strikingly late for developmental atavisms.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Development.", "description": "Researchers from Howard University in Washington DC said around 30 of the muscles could be seen in seven-week-old foetuses but at least 10 of these disappeared by the 13th week of pregnancy.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/09/19145494-0-image-a-14_1569919662773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
