Contact amie.gordon@mailonline.co.uk or ring 020 361 53279\n\nThe couple, who booked their holiday through Iglu Cruises, planned a three-day holiday in China before the ship set sail, going to the Great Wall and the Forbidden City and paid extra for excursions including exploring the tunnels of Vietnam.\n\nMrs Hayes said when she and her husband arrived at Beijing Airport border officials took their photos and looked at their passports then asked them to step aside.\n\nForeign Office issues updated advice on holidaymakers visiting China The Foreign Office last week updated its advice to travellers visiting China, warning that the British Embassy in Beijing had 'received reports of a recent increase in cases where entry to China under the visa waiver on arrival scheme has been refused'. It said such refusals 'may be linked to previous travel history'. It also warned that entry to China under a visa waiver is not guaranteed and Chinese border officials have the right to refuse entry without warning or explanation. The Foreign Office said: 'You should contact the Chinese Embassy or the China Visa Application Service Centre before your proposed trip for further information. 'If you\u2019re unsure about your eligibility for a visa waiver, you\u2019re advised to apply for a visa before travelling.'

We sat for a few hours with no advice or anything.\n\n'We called an immigration officer over. His response was that they didn't have a reason [for refusing us entry to the country] - they don't have to give us one.\n\n'We were sat in an airport for 18 hours. There were quite a few people from Liverpool and we said we will all stay in the airport.\n\n'You're allowed to stay in the airport for 24 hours but we were told that after that we were going to be arrested.\n\n'Panic set in then - everyone started trying to get flights. We tried to go to the next stop where the ship was going to be in Japan.'\n\nHowever, shelling out for more flights to Japan to meet the ship at the next stop would have cost the couple hundreds of pounds - plus the cost of further transfers and accommodation.\n\nThey fear they will have lost all the money spent on their trip, which was due to start in Beijing and end in Singapore on October 19 before flying back to Manchester.\n\nMrs Hayes added: '[Airport staff] were so arrogant. They were smirking - we were treated like criminals.\n\n'One guy said his son was getting married in Beijing this week and they weren't letting him in.\n\n'The security had us up against the wall saying \"don't move\", passing our passports around and laughing at us. It was an awful experience.\n\n'When you're in a strange country it's really scary. They just didn't like us.'\n\nThe pair were forced to transfer their flight home from Singapore to an immediate flight back to the UK from Beijing with Etihad Airlines.\n\nMr Hayes hit out at Iglu, who he claims have told the couple they will receive no refund for their ordeal.\n\nThe couple were held in Beijing Airport (pictured) for 18 hours before being forced to return home and miss their trip. The Foreign Office has now warned that Chinese border officials have the right to refuse entry without warning or explanation\n\nHe said: 'We've had no support from them. We will get no money back as far as they're concerned because it's a government decision.'\n\nThe couple claim they were offered a \u00a3250 goodwill gesture by Iglu and were encouraged to attempt to re-enter customs to see if they would be allowed into the country.\n\nHowever, by the time they spoke to Iglu, any attempt to re-enter customs would have made them miss their return flight that was transferred over.\n\nA spokesperson said: 'Iglu Cruise is aware some customers experienced travel issues over the weekend whilst travelling in China. Exact details are still emerging but Iglu Cruise is working with partners and the authorities to ascertain a clear understanding of the circumstances.\n\n'Iglu Cruise continues to liaise with the affected parties. Iglu Cruise is making arrangements for a goodwill gesture of \u00a3250pp to be provided to their customers affected by the incident.'", "description": "Kate, 67, and Ray Hayes, 72, from Skelmersdale in West Lancashire, had planned the trip of a lifetime around Asia but were held 'like criminals' in Beijing Airport before being forced to fly home.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495220-0-image-a-18_1570631081810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
