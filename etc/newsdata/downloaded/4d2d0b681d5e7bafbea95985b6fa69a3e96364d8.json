In a sense, it's pretty similar to how other countries use sports for social purposes.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The North's stadiums are better known for propaganda than for international football\n\nKick-off between the two men's national teams will be in the early evening, but if you want to follow the match, you'll have a hard time.\n\nApart from the fact it isn't being broadcast live, even international tourists currently in North Korea won't be allowed to watch the game.\n\nHow unusual is a N Korea - S Korea match?\n\nIt's rare but it happens: Both countries are members of Fifa and that means they occasionally play each other in international competitions.\n\nThis time, it's a qualifier for the 2022 Qatar World Cup that has brought them together.\n\nBut what's even rarer is that Tuesday's match takes place in North Korea.\n\nIn most past cases, games were held either in the South, or in a third country.\n\nThe two sides are technically still at war - the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, but a peace treaty was never signed.\n\nThe only time a South Korean men's squad played in Pyongyang was a friendly in 1990.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea's women's team (in red) only lost once to the South\n\nThe women's teams have also only played once in the North, for a 2017 qualifier for the Asian Cup the following year.\n\nAll other women's matches were held either in the South or a third country.\n\nWhich side are the favourites?\n\nFor the men's sides, the odds are clearly with the South.\n\nThe team has won or drawn at almost every fixture since the first matches in the late 1970s, with the 1990 friendly in Pyongyang being the only time the North won the day.\n\nGiven the South is ranked 37 in the world compared with the North at 113, you might expect South Korea to win this one as well.\n\nYet both teams are level at the top of their qualifying group, having each won their previous two games.\n\nEach side have one clear star player: for the South that is Tottenham's Son Heung-min while North Korea have recent Juventus signing Han Kwang-ong as their key player.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption North Korea beat Lebanon 2-0 in the previous 2022 qualifier\n\nNorth Korea has the home advantage though - there will be not a single South Korean fan in the stadium.\n\nIt's not even clear whether there will be any normal spectators at all. Talking to the reporters on the way to Pyongyang, South Korean players appeared to expect an empty stadium.\n\n\"It's much better to play in a packed stadium rather than an empty one, but I think we'll be able to play a good match if we use it as motivation,\" defender Kim Min-jae told AFP ahead of the match.\n\nFor the women's team, the stats are almost an exact inversion of the men's.\n\nThe South has won only once. All other matches were either a draw or won by the North.\n\nWhat's the state of North-South relations?\n\nThe match comes as relations between Seoul and Pyongyang hit something of a low.\n\nThe North is upset that South Korea continues to carry out low-level military exercises with the US, and earlier this summer rejected all further talks with Seoul.\n\nThe North's denuclearisation talks with the US have just again hit a roadblock, and relations with the South tend to ebb and flow alongside such talks.\n\nPyongyang also recently tested a new missile, in a significant advance on earlier tests, increasing tension with Washington.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on\n\nBut the ups and downs of North-South relations are not usually reflected in the sporting rivalry.\n\n\"The people I've talked to about this in both Koreas generally seem quite supportive of athletes from the other side,\" says Mr Abrahamian.\n\n\"They're pleased to see Koreans doing well on the world stage, whatever country they're from.\"\n\nSports diplomacy to the rescue?\n\nSport has often been a key to unlocking fresh diplomacy on the peninsula.\n\nThe 2018 thaw came about when North Korea's Kim Jong-il floated the idea his country could take part in the Winter Olympics in the South.\n\nMonths later, the two teams marched under a common flag, participated together and even fielded a joint women's ice hockey team.\n\nThe same feat was repeated at the Asian Games when a unified Korea boating team won a historic gold medal.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The gold medallists sang a national folk song to celebrate their victory\n\nWith the mood in Pyongyang notoriously unpredictable, it is hard to say whether Tuesday's soccer game might again pave the way for fresh diplomacy.\n\nIn September, North and South agreed they will seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn the lead-up to the World Cup qualifier, relations remained very tense.\n\nThe South had hoped to be able to send fans to the match \u2013 but was denied. And Seoul offered to organise the broadcasting of the match - an offer also turned down.\n\nThis time, it doesn't look as if Pyongyang is looking for the match to be a tool to bridge the strained political relationship,\" Mr Abrahamian explains.\n\n\"Pyongyang has been giving Seoul the cold shoulder for most of this year and that probably won't change unless the US and North Korea find a breakthrough.\"", "description": "North and South Korea are set to play a World Cup qualifier just as relations are at a new low.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15E70/production/_109221798_00d911c5-3694-42ae-b895-f1741c102a8d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
