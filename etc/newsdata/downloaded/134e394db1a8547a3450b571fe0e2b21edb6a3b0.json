Full of joy. She was so happy. I look at this and just can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. We have to remember her like this, like she was, however painful...'\n\nMoving: Former Line of Duty star Jason Watkins has paid tribute to late daughter Maude on what would have been her seventh birthday\n\nEarlier that day Watkins, 53, lit a candle in his daughter's memory at the London home he shares with wife Clara Francis and their two children, Bessie and Gilbert.\n\n'A beautiful blue dawn this morning as I head off to work,' he wrote. 'I\u2019ve lit a candle for Maude. Our wonderful daughter who\u2019s birthday it is today - who we treasure and who can never truly leave us. Always with us..'\n\nMaude, the actor\u2019s second child with wife Clara Francis, was just two-and a half when a persistent cough and consequent respiratory problems prompted two consecutive visits to a hospital A&E, where she was initially diagnosed with croup.\n\nNever forgotten: The actor shared a photo of Maude, who tragically died of sepsis in 2011, aged two, with Twitter followers on Monday morning\n\nFor you: Earlier that day Watkins, 53, lit a candle in his daughter's memory at the London home he shares with wife Clara Francis and their two children, Bessie and Gilbert\n\nBut within two weeks of developing her first symptoms she was dead, passing away on New Year\u2019s Day 2011 after falling victim to sepsis, an insidious illness in which the immune system reacts violently to infection, attacks its own tissue and eventually leads to organ failure.\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline in 2018 of his initial attempt to return to work following the sudden, heartbreaking loss, he recalled: \u2018I tried to work immediately and that was never going to happen, but I did try for a week.\n\n\u2018I had to do lots of things regarding the circumstances of her death so I needed to be at home.'\n\nFamily: Maude was the actor\u2019s second child with wife Clara Francis\n\nHe added: \u2018I think (sitcom) Trollied was the first thing that enabled me to go away and work and earn some money, because there was no money coming in.\n\n'It was a distraction in some ways but for Clara, she\u2019s a jewellery designer so it was harder for her. I was sort of carried along by the people I was working with and it really did help, while there were other challenges for her.\u2019\n\nThe devastated couple eventually found an outlet for their grief through support group SLOW, a Lottery funded north London based organisation set up by bereaved parents for bereaved parents, with whom they still maintain a strong bond some six-years on from the death of their daughter.\n\n\u2018My wife works very closely with them,\u2019 he added. \u2018It\u2019s a place where parents can sit down and talk about what\u2019s happened to them with people who have had it happen to them also.\n\n\u2018Some people are maybe 10 or 15 years down the line and others have just lost their child so it\u2019s a fantastic support group. That helped us specifically. Also family and friends.\n\n'You have to sort of reach out and find them. They are there to help and you have to ask. Sometimes that\u2019s a very daunting prospect to help someone when they\u2019re feeling so desperate.\u2019", "description": "The actor shared a photo of Maude, who tragically died of sepsis in 2011, aged two, with Twitter followers on Monday morning.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404364-0-image-a-77_1570464576425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
