But if you can withstand the volatility, they have proven to be excellent long-term investments.\n\nThe group has been greatly affected by the trade conflict between the U.S. and China, as computer chips are the U.S.\u2019s third-largest export, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Next year, however, promises to be a return to growth.\n\nThe iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX, +1.63%, which tracks the shares of 30 semiconductor manufacturers and equipment makers, has returned 33% this year through Oct. 8, almost double the return of the benchmark S&P 500 Index\u2019s SPX, +0.91% 17.2% gain. (All returns in this article assume dividends are reinvested.)\n\nNow look at the 12-month chart:\n\nFactSet\n\nYou can see how the fourth quarter of 2018 punished stocks, which rebounded at the beginning of 2019. The semiconductors have outperformed the broader market by a mile, and analysts are expecting a tepid 2019 to give way to a resumption of \u201cnormal\u201d sales growth, at least for most of the semiconductor group, in 2020.\n\nBefore getting to those numbers, check out these longer-term charts that emphasize how well investors who can tolerate the elevated volatility for the semiconductor group have been rewarded.\n\nThree years:\n\nFactSet\n\nFive years:\n\nFactSet\n\n10 years:\n\nFactSet\n\nThe 10-year chart shows plenty of periods of misery for semiconductor stock investors, but patience has won out. And there\u2019s no reason to believe these companies won\u2019t continue to grow as more devices become connected throughout the world. You can pick one of many industries as examples \u2014 auto manufacturing is one, with more microprocessors needed as the industry is forced to evolve.\n\nDigging into SOXX\n\nAs you would gather from its name, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX, +1.63% tracks the performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +1.74% of 30 stocks of semiconductor manufacturers and equipment makers. All the stocks are listed in the U.S., though there are four non-U.S.-based companies. In its analysis of SOXX, FactSet says the ETF \u201cprovides great sector exposure,\u201d while also being easy to trade, making for \u201ca standout in its segment.\u201d\n\nSOXX is weighted by market capitalization, yet weightings are limited to about 8% of the portfolio, causing a \u201ctilt toward smaller companies,\u201d according to FactSet.\n\nHere\u2019s the entire list of companies held by SOXX, sorted by percentage of the portfolio as of the close on Oct. 8, with total returns for various periods:\n\nHere\u2019s the SOXX list again, with analysts\u2019 adjusted sales growth figures for calendar years 2017 and 2018, and projected sales growth figures for 2019 and 2020, based on consensus estimates. The list is sorted by estimated 2020 sales growth:\n\nThe 2021 figures may be subject to a great deal of change, as fewer analysts have published estimates for that year than they for 2020.\n\nLooking at the 2020 estimates, 12 of the 30 are expected to achieve double-digit sales growth. Only three are expected to do so this year. The 2020 sales-growth estimates aren\u2019t as lofty as the actual revenue increases of 2018. However, there\u2019s always the possibility that a trade deal will be reached with China. That would prompt another reset for the group.\n\nFor now, following a painful year of expected sales reductions for two-thirds of the group, all but Micron Technology MU, +0.56% and Cree CREE, +2.76% are expected to resume growth in 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of ratings and price targets for the 30 components of SOXX, sorted by how much analysts expect the shares to rise over the next 12 months, based on consensus price targets:\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Bank earnings preview: The good times are coming to an end\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "Consider 2019 a \u2018reset\u2019 year, with better performance to come.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS997_NVDA_2_ZG_20191009153544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
