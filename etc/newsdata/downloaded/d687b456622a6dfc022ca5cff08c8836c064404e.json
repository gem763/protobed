REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nGerman tech firm TeamViewer pulled off Europe\u2019s biggest initial public offering of 2019 on the Frankfurt stock exchange on Wednesday.\n\nTeamViewer priced its IPO at \u20ac26.25 euros per share, giving the online connectivity app a market valuation of \u20ac5.25bn. However, shares dipped to around the \u20ac25 mark in early trading.\n\nTeamViewer is a connectivity tool for online meetings, desktop sharing, video conferences, and IT support. It competes with the likes of Zoom, Okta, and the hugely popular Slack, which made its stock exchange debut in June with a $23bn valuation.\n\nThe startup was founded by Tilo Rossmanith in 2005 in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, southern Germany. The company says TeamViewer app has been installed on two billion devices to date, and that since moving to a subscription model in 2018 it has secured over 360,000 subscribers.\n\nTeamViewer\u2019s debut stole the crown from Italian tech payment-services company Nexi, which, at \u20ac2.01bn, was Europe\u2019s largest IPO of the year when it listed in April.\n\nREAD MORE: Google wins landmark 'right to be forgotten' case against France\n\nBritish private equity firm Permira bought TeamViewer in 2014 for \u20ac870m and will keep 58% of the company, raising \u20ac2.21bn with the other 42%.\n\nJ\u00f6rg Rockenh\u00e4user, head of Permira for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland said in a statement: \u201cWe are convinced that TeamViewer is very well positioned as leading global connectivity platform and the the Permira Funds will continue to back the company as a major shareholder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe strong interest of investors in our IPO is a great endorsement of our work.\u201d said CEO Oliver Steil in a statement. \u201cWe are excited to further strengthen our position as the leading global connectivity platform.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Volkswagen begins pilot production of battery cells for its electric-car push", "description": "TeamViewer hit a valuation at over \u20ac5 bn.", "authors": ["Jill Petzinger", "Germany Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6QOEyuuSOA56xrIULqEgUg--~B/aD0zMTU1O3c9NDY0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8ed66450-df7a-11e9-abf3-b2861f4bcded", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
