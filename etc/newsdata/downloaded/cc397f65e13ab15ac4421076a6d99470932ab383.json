It\u2019s just a lot of moving around through the night and just trying to find a little bit of sleep when I can.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDelle Donne still managed 13 points and six rebounds in 26 minutes despite getting bumped and jostled repeatedly as Sun players attempted to throw her off her game.\n\nKristi Toliver knows how to win titles, and the Mystics are just one step away\n\nThe pain, Delle Donne revealed, has been so acute \u2014 it\u2019s on her mind every second she\u2019s on the court, she said \u2014 that she turns to meditation to block out the discomfort and persevere.\n\n\u201cThis series deserves her to be in it,\u201d Sun Coach Curt Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m excited, frankly, that she\u2019s in it. It doesn\u2019t make it easy to guard, doesn\u2019t make it any easier, but this league, this series deserves the best players on the floor, so I give her credit for giving what she\u2019s got, but that\u2019s what this league is about.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring Game 3, Delle Donne played in relatively short intervals, coming out either to rest while standing behind the bench or keeping her back loose pedaling on a nearby stationary bicycle.\n\nAD\n\nWith rest being a priority not just for Delle Donne but other players nursing ailments, including Ariel Atkins\u2019s back spasms, the Mystics eschewed a full practice Monday, with Coach Mike Thibault presiding over a light shooting session at Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\nThe streamlined workload has served Delle Donne well, especially down the stretch Sunday, when she drove to the basket and banked in a shot that blunted a Sun rally, effectively allowing the Mystics enough breathing room to run the clock and shoot free throws with Connecticut forced to foul.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat was the one where I was like, \u2018I might be done after this,\u2019\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cBut if we can score here, it\u2019s a big enough moment to end the game. It feels like I have a pole up my back. Just very straight up and can\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI guess I have experience playing injured in these freakin\u2019 Finals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDelle Donne was referring in part to last season, when she suffered a bone bruise in her left knee during Game 2 of the WNBA semifinals on the road against the Atlanta Dream.\n\nShe played with the discomfort in the Finals, in which the Seattle Storm swept Washington.\n\nDelle Donne also battled back pain in the 2014 WNBA Finals, when she was with the Chicago Sky. She had played in just 16 regular season games that year but was on the court for all nine of the Sky\u2019s playoff games, including a three-game sweep at the hands of the Phoenix Mercury.\n\nAD\n\nThe pain of a herniated disk, according to Delle Donne, is far worse than any she has endured in her career, yet the allure of winning a championship compels her to do whatever possible to contribute, even if it means acting as decoy, allowing teammates to get open looks.\n\nAD\n\nShe\u2019s also limited defensively, although at 6 feet 5, she remains disruptive at times when guarding Sun all-star Alyssa Thomas. Thibault switched Delle Donne onto Thomas, a 6-2 forward, after she had guarded 6-6 center Jonquel Jones in Game 1.\n\nThomas scored 13 points, her fewest of these Finals, in Game 3 but added nine assists and eight rebounds, playing with a torn labrum in each shoulder she\u2019s been dealing with for months.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s the Finals. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d Thomas said of Delle Donne. \u201cThere\u2019s not much basketball left to be played, and she\u2019s a huge part of her team, so I expected her to be out there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy playing through injury, but she\u2019s a competitor, and yeah, it\u2019s just what you do for your team.\u201d\n\nRead more Mystics coverage from Post Sports:\n\nNo one has more WNBA victories than Mike Thibault.
