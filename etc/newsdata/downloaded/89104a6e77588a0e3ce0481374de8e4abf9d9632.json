Heck, a sitting Cubs manager?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTechnically, his contract expired. They'd call it a mutual decision because it is more dignified that way. So, on Sunday, in the final hours of the worst Cubs season of Maddon\u2019s five, president Theo Epstein broke the news \u2014 Maddon wouldn\u2019t be re-upped, the Cubs would be looking for a fresh dugout leader, and life on the North Side wouldn\u2019t be quite the same. There was a time that\u2019d be a good thing. Like, for a century.\n\nIn some ways, living with yesterday\u2019s championship proved more trying than living with last century\u2019s ghost, if not for the sanguine Maddon than for nearly everyone else. That a championship could be won, and indeed was won, made it real, made it possible, made it expected, and so in the end the guy who averaged 94 regular-season wins is viewed as somehow deficient. Epstein is just guessing, of course, but this is his guess to make, as was Dale Sveum, Rick Renteria and, once, Joe Maddon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe three seasons post-curse ended with something other than euphoria in the fall air and vomit under the bar stools \u2014 well, certainly without euphoria in the fall air \u2014 and if it\u2019s time to redirect the franchise then, sure, OK, start with the manager pulling the $6 million salary who wins only once every five years. The Cubs aren\u2019t a great team, but they were good enough as of a couple weeks ago, so putting together another contender in the National League Central shouldn\u2019t take long. Epstein\u2019s pretty adept at these transitions, so it is fair to assume there\u2019ll be capable players on the field and probably a competent man on the top step come next spring.\n\nTheo Epstein, on the meeting Saturday night with Joe Maddon. pic.twitter.com/eBIembfcw6 \u2014 Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 29, 2019\n\nHe won\u2019t be Maddon, which is fine. Fine for the Cubs. Fine, you can be sure, for Maddon. Because, you see, this part \u2014 the last 14 years \u2014 didn\u2019t have to happen for Maddon, who 14 years ago was a 51-year-old mostly anonymous baseball coach with a welcoming smile and a hair-trigger wit and a funky way of looking at the world. He charmed a franchise called the Tampa Bay Devil Rays into hiring him, which most agreed was deserving and overdue and probably one of those jobs that turns a reasonable dude into the guy who schedules a day to drive a nail through his foot.\n\nInstead, he became this guy (and the Rays became those guys), the guy he always was, and people \u2014 players, coaches, general managers, fans, even writers \u2014 came to see it is possible to work your butt off and still be a reasonable human being. You can be the boss without being condescending. You can lose and find hope. You can win and recognize that\u2019s about an inch from losing. You can look at the logo on your chest, look at the standings, and see not a corporation but a collection of strong and fragile people, most of them unsure, most of them simply hoping to do the right thing today. Granted, some of them don\u2019t hit or pitch very well. For that, he\u2019d eventually get fired.\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - SEPTEMBER 21: Manager Joe Maddon #70 of the Chicago Cubs stands in the dugout during the game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field on September 21, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.

He\u2019ll get over it. Thanks for having me, he\u2019d probably say.\n\nJust Saturday, bearing up under rumors he was serving his final weekend in Chicago and hours from a meeting with Epstein and others, Maddon could not \u2014 would not \u2014 allow an ounce of apprehension. He told reporters about the stuff that happens in the 21 hours around the game \u2014 a friend\u2019s wife has cancer, his own uncle recently died, his grandchildren are growing up \u2014 and said, man, it\u2019s baseball, just baseball, god bless it.\n\n\u201cWhy would you permit a game to drive you down like that?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI feel very good about the future, very strongly about the future, whether it\u2019s on or off the baseball field.\u201d\n\nAnd, man, has he had a good time. He lightened and focused and bettered the cultures of three organizations \u2014 the Angels weren\u2019t quite the same without him \u2014 because, and not in spite of, his curiosity and appreciation for whatever was happening on the other side of those outfield fences. His love for the game. His respect for those good enough to play it. Those organizations also won more baseball games because of him, partly.\n\nHe tried not to suck. Maybe third place in the NL Central sucks. Maybe one championship in five years sucks. Probably some folks think so. Apparently the Cubs at the very least think they can do better, and maybe they can. We\u2019ll let you know in another five years. Well, they\u2019ll let you know.\n\nNow Maddon will be off doing something else, drinking his wine, driving his cars, having his laughs, hanging with his boys and, if he wants, leading his new team. There\u2019ll be plenty of opportunity. He is among the best in the game at what he does, which, today, isn\u2019t good enough for the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThat\u2019s OK. Joe Maddon will go have himself a time.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "As Cubs seek change in the wake of finally winning it all, Joe Maddon will keep living his life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HTQ9dlh1MoWgGCcX7300bA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTIuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Iu4SbdZnIC.PCFpr.z_nvQ--~B/aD0xODU3O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c2c6f7a0-e2dd-11e9-9fac-0f72ce99a485", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
