Wednesday's statement from the Federal Open Market Committee left out the clause out.\n\nThe language used in FOMC statements is highly scrutinized by investors, with some analysts even quantifying the sentiment of certain phrases to predict future policy decisions. Many economists view the \"act as appropriate\" phrase to signal the central bank is considering future cuts.\n\nThe intentional omission forecasts a pause to rate cuts. Powell said Wednesday that rates are at an appropriate level, and noted that the committee's members \"are not thinking about raising rates right now.\"\n\nThe central bank may wait for more data on trade tensions and global economic slowdown to judge whether additional rate cuts are needed. Recent cuts were employed to insulate the US economy from trade uncertainty and risk of economic contraction.\n\nThe vote for Wednesday's rate cut lends some credence to the phrase's significance. While St. Louis Fed President James Bullard voted for a 50-basis-point cut in September, he was less dovish in the Wednesday meeting and voted in line with the majority for a 25-point cut.\n\nBoth Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George voted against Wednesday's cut. They also opposed the cut in September.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nThe auto industry is shrinking as the world reaches 'peak car' \u2014 and it's dragging down the entire global economy\n\nMolson Coors tumbles after cutting jobs and missing quarterly forecasts\n\nSilicon Valley is increasingly convinced that the traditional IPO process leaves too much money on the table.
