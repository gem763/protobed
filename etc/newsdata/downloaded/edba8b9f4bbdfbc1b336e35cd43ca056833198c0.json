The Nationals unrest comes as Dr Gillespie believed the draft code would \"dud\" dairy farmers. According to the Nationals MP, Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie went back on verbal assurances about what would be included in the document after seeking Dr Gillespie's advice. Dr Gillespie said he and industry workers were \"bitterly disappointed\". Dr Gillespie has not ruled out a move against Ms McKenzie as Deputy Nationals leader if his concerns are not addressed.
