But the topic he's asked and DM'd about most? How to fuel before a workout.\n\nThe advice he gives to his clients like Aniston: Don't think of fueling in terms of what to eat just before your workout, think about treating your body right all the time. That means, getting plenty of sleep (think: six to seven hours or more); eating nutrient-rich foods, including a mix of healthy carbs, protein, leafy greens, and bright colorful veggies; and hydrating, hydrating, hydrating.\n\n\"The common misconception about hydration is that you should wait until you\u2019re thirsty, and then drink until you\u2019re full,\" he tells Women's Health. \"But if you pound water right before your workout, you\u2019ll just feel heavy and full and sluggish the entire time.\" Instead, plan ahead... like, way ahead. As in, \"you should be drinking water consistently throughout the days leading up to your workout,\" he advises.\n\nAs far as food goes, Azubuike encourages Jen to go for healthy fats. \"I love avocados, coconut oil, salmon, fish oil\u2014anything that\u2019s a good form of fat is great,\" he says. For carbs and protein, he notes that everyone needs a different intake in their daily diet to fuel an active lifestyle. \"For me, I stick to 1.7 grams of carbs and 2 grams of protein per my kilo weight to support muscle-building.\"\n\n\n\nCurious how other celebs eat? Here's Madelaine Petsch's daily diet:\n\nAbout an hour prior to activity (like a run, for example), \"I'll go for a scoop of peanut butter, half a banana, and some bread,\" he says. \"I know that\u2019s going to help me get me through that run. When my body needs to tap into a fuel source, that's going to get me there.\"\n\n\n\nBut Azubuike points out that fueling your body for fitness is very individual\u2014and what might work for him or Jennifer may not be helpful for you.\n\n\"It takes trial and error to see what works best,\" he recommends. One of Azubuike's favorite ways to become more aware is by keeping a fitness journal. \"Write down how certain foods you ate make you feel during a workout,\" he says. \"And also journal what days you mentally weren\u2019t checked in as well, and why, in case that made an impact. Maybe it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t sleep well, it was rainy outside, etc.\"\n\nBut hey, when it comes to pre-workout fuel to test, that peanut butter and banana combo sounds like a pretty delicious place to start.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Hey, if it works for her\u2026", "authors": ["Kristine Thomason"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D.uogfaHS87tGEdO0B6KrA--~B/aD0xMzEyO3c9MjYxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/ecbc4f717e71b5a914956dd4ca022eb9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
