Utilities and health care sectors saw the biggest decline in buyback activities in the second quarter, the bank noted.\n\nShare repurchases have long been a pillar of support for the broad market. By reducing the number of outstanding shares in the market, companies are able to boost stock prices and earnings per share figures. A slowdown in buybacks could be an ominous sign for the market which has already been threatened by an escalating trade war and slowing growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 endured a volatile third quarter, returning 1.7% amid tit-for-tat tariffs and impeachment fears. The fourth quarter was off to a tough start with the S&P 500 losing 1.2% on Tuesday, hit by a slump in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
