Some even appeared hesitant to share their business cards with journalists.\n\nThe Saudi organisers also sought to avoid media scrutiny, banning journalists with cameras from entering the main conference hall and from a gala dinner organised for delegates.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions threat over Saudi\u2019s human rights record is currently over, but reputational costs are ongoing,\u201d Ryan Bohl, of the US geopolitical think tank Stratfor, told AFP.\n\n\u201cMost companies have made the judgement whether they will be affected or endure those costs. Those that don\u2019t want those risks are staying away.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Massive potential\u2019 \u2013\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s murder plunged Saudi Arabia into a public relations crisis, forcing companies with ties to the kingdom to find a balance between maintaining their reputations and their business considerations.\n\nMany of those attending this year are Wall Street financiers chasing a potential windfall from the upcoming stock market listing of state-owned oil giant Aramco, the world\u2019s most profitable company.\n\n\u201cThere is massive potential,\u201d an executive from a Singapore-based manufacturer of engineering equipment told AFP.\n\n\u201cThis is Saudi Arabia and Aramco \u2014 there is nothing bigger.\u201d\n\nBut this year\u2019s FII has few names from the world\u2019s largest technology companies or from Hollywood, key areas of Saudi investment.\n\nGlobal media companies, which in previous years sponsored the event and even moderated panels, are also absent.\n\nBut not everyone was squeamish \u2014 especially those scouting for deals.\n\n\u201cReputational risk? No,\u201d said Christian Giannini, of European tech investor 01 Ventures.\n\nOn the sidelines of FII, his company received a licence from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to establish a tech investment fund worth millions of dollars, Giannini told AFP.\n\nKPMG, another consultancy with business ties to Saudi Arabia, is being represented at FII by around 25 executives, up from five last year, a company official told AFP.\n\nThe forum is billed as an economic coming-out party for the petro-state, seeking to diversify away from oil \u2014 and authorities are eager to project the kingdom\u2019s economic ambitions.\n\nDelegates were greeted with gizmos such as face recognition software used to welcome them by name as they walked into the palatial hotel.\n\nA bevvy of talking robots and self-driving sweepers to clean the conference area were also on display.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to help Saudis to build their future rather than sit back and do nothing and complain,\u201d said Rudolph Waels, founder of consultancy Armalia Partners, who has attended all three FIIs.\n\n\u201cI have no hesitation to be here.\u201d", "description": "Wall Street titans smiled and schmoozed at a Saudi investment conference widely shunned last year over a critic's murder.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/saudi-davos-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
