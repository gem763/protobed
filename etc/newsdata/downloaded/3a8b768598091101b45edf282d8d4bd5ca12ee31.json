Canada has refrained from such charges.\n\nThe United States in 2017 reduced its embassy staff to a minimum and Canada followed more recently, citing the incidents and the danger posed to staff from what has become known as the \u201cHavana syndrome\u201d.\n\nVarious scientific studies have yet to identify the cause of the diplomats\u2019 cognitive ailments, ranging from dizziness and blurred vision to memory loss and difficulty concentrating.\n\nThe Canadian study by a team of researchers affiliated with the Brain Repair Centre at Dalhousie University and the Nova Scotia Health Authority studied Canadian victims and even the brain of a pet dog after its demise in Canada.\n\nThe study was the first to include diplomats for whom there was baseline medical testing from before their postings in Havana, so as to better compare with the tests from afterwards. Canada started implementing the practice after diplomats first started complaining of sickness.\n\nThe researchers said they had detected different levels of brain damage in an area that causes symptoms reported by the diplomats and which is susceptible to neurotoxins. They then concluded that cholinesterase, a key enzyme required for the proper functioning of the nervous system, was being blocked there.\n\nBrain scans of US embassy staff to Cuba may show abnormalities Read more\n\nSome pesticides work by inhibiting cholinesterase, the report said, and during the 2016-2018 period when diplomats became ill normal fumigation in Cuba was stepped up due to the Zika epidemic in the Caribbean.\n\nThe report said the diplomats\u2019 illnesses coincided with increased fumigation in and around residences where they lived. One of the authors of the study, the professor Alon Friedman, clarified in an email to Reuters that both Canadian and Cuban authorities were fumigating.\n\n\u201cWe report the clinical, imaging and biochemical evidence consistent with the hypothesis of over-exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors as the cause of brain injury,\u201d the study concluded, while cautioning that other causes could not be ruled out and more study was needed.\n\nFriedman said it was not clear whether the broader Cuban population was affected by the fumigation and if not, why, but his team was planning a further study on this together with Cuban scientists.", "description": "Trump administration had charged that cognitive ailments of Canadian and US diplomats were caused by use of a secret weapon", "authors": ["Reuters In Havana"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae55a6b9c70d7fad34ed382f1125a8c02533c8ce/0_98_5001_3001/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5863cd31e719362fc8d74fbcfb15547b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
