They all claim to offer competitive prices for local and international flights, and an easy way to compare prices across a variety of airlines.\n\nIn our experience, though, these travel price-comparison sites are best used as a starting point. They\u2019re an efficient way to establish which airline has the cheapest flights for your dates. And on the odd occasion, some may have arranged exclusive deals directly with the airline - usually marketed as limited time specials around birthdays and slower times of the year.\n\nBut in the case of domestic flights checked by Business Insider South Africa, you can save between 5% and 30% by booking directly on the airline\u2019s own site instead.\n\nIn order to test how much local OTAs save customers in everyday local trael, Business Insider South Africa used the example of a local return flight between O.R. Tambo and Cape Town International, departing 1 November 2019 and returning 8 November 2019.\n\nThese are the cheapest tickets for these dates, when booked directly on the airline website:\n\nKulula: R1,555.22\n\nFlySafair: R1,998\n\nMango: R2,065\n\nSouth African Airways: R2,607.72\n\nAnd this is what each of South Africa's biggest flight-comparison websites had to offer.\n\nTravelStart: 0.4% to 15% more\n\nTravelStart was founded in Sweden in the late 1990s, and has since moved its headquarters to South Africa. It has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to aggressive social media campaigns and seasonal flight promotions.\n\nAlthough its promotions at certain times of the year sometimes offer cheaper rates than direct bookings with the airlines, the same is not always true for day-to-day local fares.\n\nTravelStart charges a booking fee on all air tickets. Although it claims to \u201ckeep everything translucent\u201d with regards to fees, it does not disclose it as a separate line item on their invoices. Instead, it incorporate this fee under the broader \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d, which includes mandatory airline taxes.\n\nIt does, however, incorporate this fee into totals from the beginning of the search process, unlike some OTAs that add it on during the payment phase.\n\nAccording to TravelStart, its flat-rate fees are a benefit to customers, while \"most agencies will charge customers a percentage of your overall flight tickets to cover your booking fee\".\n\nHere's what TravelStart offered us.\n\nKulula: R1,778, or 15% more.\n\nFlySafair: R2,098, or 5% more.\n\nMango: R2,178, or 5% more.\n\nSouth African Airways: R2,618, or 0.4% more.\n\nTravelCheck: 6% cheaper to 32% more.\n\nTravelCheck is a relatively new online travel agency, founded in South Africa. It advertises its primary benefit as simplifying the travel planning and booking process.\n\nDuring its launch phase it offered flat rate discounts on certain flights, and in one case it actually charges less than booking directly with the airline. But like other OTAs, it charges a booking fee for all flights checked by Business Insider South Africa.\n\nTravelCheck does not disclose the booking fee amount during the initial search phases, nor incorporates it into the totals displayed. Instead, it is added on as a flat rate R75 booking fee during checkout.\n\nIt also charges a cancellation or change fee of R200 per ticket, on top of fees charged by the airline. Then there is also a service fee of R25.50 for reserving seating or adding luggage - on top of the fees charged by the airline.\n\nTravelCheck costs\n\nKulula: R1,747, or 12% more.\n\nFlySafair: R1,886, or 6% cheaper.\n\nMango: R2,199, or or 6% more.\n\nSouth African Airways: R3,451, or 32% more.\n\nCheapflights: 0% to 9% more.\n\nCheapflights, founded in 1996, is affiliated to travel comparison giant Kayak. It operates portals in more than a dozen countries, including South Africa.\n\nAccording to its website, Cheapflights is not a travel agent, but simply an intermediary between travellers and airlines. Unlike other OTAs, this means it acts only as an interface, and takes no responsibility for your booking.\n\nThis means you probably won\u2019t pay additional agent fees for things like changes, cancellations, and luggage \u2013 but you will need to handle any disputes directly with the airline in question.\n\nCheapflights does not charge a booking fee on all flights. Instead, it often display the same prices as if booking directly with the airline.\n\nAlthough two flights were the exact price as booking direct with the airline, two were between 4.5% and 9% more expensive.\n\nCheapflights costs\n\nKulula: R1,555.22, or the exact same price as booking direct.\n\nFlySafair: R2,180, or 9% more.\n\nMango: R2,065, or the exact same price as booking direct.\n\nSouth African Airways: R2,726, or 5% more.\n\nFlightSite: 2% to 14% more.\n\nFlightSite is a South African travel portal that claims to offer customers \"the the fastest way to get the cheapest flight\u201d. It has close ties with the traditional travel agency industry in the form of Club Travel, which it says allows it access to bulk buying power.\n\nFlightSite charges additional fees for booking flights through their website. It does not disclose the exact breakdown of these booking fees, and instead says it charges \"reasonable administration fees as well as retaining any service fees levied by us at the time of the booking\".\n\nAccording to Business Insider South Africa\u2019s tests, these additional fees ranged between 2% and 14% when compared to booking directly with the airline.\n\nFlightSite also charges a flat rate fee of R250 for changes or cancellations, on top of the airline fees.\n\nFlightSite costs\n\nKulula: R1,776.22, or 14% more.\n\nFlySafair: Not listed on the site.\n\nMango: R2,125, or 3% more.\n\nSouth African Airways: R2,667.72, or 2% more.", "description": "In one case we found a ticket a little cheaper than booking direct with the airline \u2013\u00a0but that was the exception.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9322/9dcf5ae097d44cdba0ac62a23f730dcc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
