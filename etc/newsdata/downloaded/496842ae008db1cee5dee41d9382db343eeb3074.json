There are some patent expirations due on key products in the coming years, so they have to strengthen their product portfolio,\u201d Sydbank\u2019s senior analyst Soren Lontoft told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThey have been missing late-stage products, and that is what they get with this acquisition,\u201d Lontoft added.\n\nShares in Lundbeck dipped 1.18% when they opened on Monday.\n\nIf the transaction, valued at up to $1.95 billion, is closed on Nov 1, 2019, the company expects transaction costs of about 200 million Danish crowns ($30 million) and integration and retention costs of 400-500 million.\n\nIn the same scenario, Lundbeck said it would pay two months of Alder\u2019s operating costs, seen at around 325-400 million Danish crowns.\n\nLundbeck expects to submit the eptinezumab antibody for regulatory approval in the European Union during 2020, and later in other regions China and Japan.\n\n\u201cWith patent protection going into the 2030\u2019s, eptinezumab will be a significant and sustainable growth driver for Lundbeck,\u201d Dunsire said.\n\nLundbeck will buy the outstanding shares of Alder for an upfront payment of $18 per share and a further $2 to shareholders upon approval of eptinezumab by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nThe deal will not change its dividend policy, it added.", "description": "Denmark's Lundbeck will buy U.S. drug developer Alder BioPharmaceuticals in a deal valued at almost $2 billion.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
