The team launched an inquiry into racism at their Northamptonshire headquarters in July and concluded that the four men had breached their equality policy. They were dismissed on 2 August and their final appeal was held last week.\n\nThe Sun newspaper reported on Saturday that the abuse at the Brackley site included a member of staff allegedly being referred to as a \u201cMuslim terrorist fuck\u201d. During Ramadan the sacked workers, believed to be from the IT department, were reported as putting up a poll on which they signed and dated guesses of when their co-worker would break his fast.\n\nSochi will test Ferrari revival but Charles Leclerc offers hopeful signs | Giles Richards Read more\n\nA source told the paper: \u201cThis was a really horrible case of racist bullying. They had been picking on one Muslim guy for years. It all came to light when they pinned up the poll. The guys who were sacked had all signed and dated it. It\u2019s outrageous, especially with Lewis being so outspoken about racism.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who is in action at the Russian Grand Prix this weekend and is still the only black driver in Formula One, has long been a vocal opponent of racism and called for greater diversity in the sport.\n\nAfter racist taunts aimed at England footballers in Montenegro in March, the world champion unequivocally condemned it before the Bahrain Grand Prix. \u201cIt is crazy to think that at this time in the world, racism is still such a prominent thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really there, all around the world, and a real issue, which is sad to see. It doesn\u2019t seem like it is going to migrate much over the next few years.\u201d\n\nHis team confirmed in a statement that the sackings had taken place. \u201cMercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd confirms that four individuals were dismissed from the company on 2 August 2019,\u201d it read. \u201cThese dismissals followed an internal investigation that confirmed breaches of our diversity and equality policy. We condemn this behaviour in the strongest terms and acted immediately upon the complaint. We value the diversity of our employees and it is a source of strength for our team. Our working environment is based on appreciation and mutual respect.\u201d\n\nThree other members of staff are reported as being disciplined for breaching the team\u2019s diversity and equality policy.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes team have sacked four of their staff members and disciplined three more for racist bullying at their Northamptonshire headquarters", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97deefd010266a19027fe1cb95fa86e3861495a/126_0_3738_2244/master/3738.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ce6742949d57cec54917e280374c0fe", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
