The list is kept secret for 50 years.\n\nLast year\u2019s winners were Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi Kurdish activist Nadia Murad for \u201ctheir efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.\u201d\n\nAlthough the list can\u2019t be confirmed for another five decades, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern were also predicted frontrunners for the prize.\n\nWatch the very moment the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize is announced.\n\n\n\nPresented by Berit Reiss-Andersen, Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.#NobelPrize #NobelPeacePrize pic.twitter.com/EIATBAMVp7\n\n\n\n\u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 11, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump was also nominated for the 2019 prize by U.S. Republican congressional members for his efforts at securing denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nPast winners who came under criticism include former U.S. President Barack Obama, who won in 2009 after less than a year in office for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" Critics interpreted his win as a political repudiation of George W. Bush's presidency.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; Associated Press.
