Love mum.\u201d\n\nA small search party rallied together to look for the 18-year-old who was found in a west London park using the Find my Phone app which traced the GPS signals from her mobile phone.\n\nIn her statement, Tasha said: \u201cI returned home at around 5pm. Abi was not home.\n\n\u201cI was unsure how long to leave her. I did not want to pressure her. I even text my friend asking how long to leave it.\n\n\u201cI went outside to look for her as I was concerned I had not heard from her. The Find my Phone app, it initially showed her close to the school.\n\n\u201cI zoomed in on the map and it showed Abi being in the grounds of Chiswick House.\u201d\n\nThe inquest was told the teen had left a suicide note.\n\nAbi\u2019s mother said: \u201cThere is a problem with adolescent mental health, the progression to adult services and their care in hospitals.\u201d\n\nCoroner Sean Cummings said he is may contact the government regarding potential improvements for mental health services for young people after Abi\u2019s family raised concerns.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am going to consider whether it would be useful for me to report to the secretary of state in terms of provisions of mental health for young people.\u201d\n\nCoroner Cummings said Abi\u2019s file was one of the most distressing he has seen and confirmed her death as suicide.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I read the file, it was one of the more distressing files I have read.\n\n\u201cThis has been the inquest of Abigail Frankie Oliver who died on January 27, 2018 at West Middlesex University Hospital.\n\n\u201cMy conclusion is that Abi died as a result of suicide.\u201d\n\nWith reference to the suicide note left by Abi before she died, the coroner added: \u201cIn much the same was as you have told me she was loved, she loved her family too.\"\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
