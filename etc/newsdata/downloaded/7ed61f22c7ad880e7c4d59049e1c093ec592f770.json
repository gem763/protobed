That represents their worst start to a season since 2013-14 under Manuel Pellegrini, although the current manager said it is best not to look at the table due to the chasm.\n\n\u201cIt was a bad day, sometimes it happens,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe started quite well and after we conceded two situations in our buildup where it\u2019s impossible to defend, we got a little bit nervous. We controlled them better in the second half but at the end with us attacking and people up front, we lost balls in positions [where] it is so difficult and they were clinical. Before that we hit the post but the way we played was not good. It was not a good day.\u201d\n\nPressed as to why City were nervous, Guardiola added: \u201cIt sometimes happens. We spoke about this: \u2018Come on guys, a lot of games [still] to play, we did it [last season] and we\u2019re going to do it again.\u2019 We lost to a good team that were really well-organised, good physicality, strong in the air and so fast on the counterattack. We knew it.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHe added of the gap to Liverpool: \u201cIt is a lot of points. They didn\u2019t drop points [due to] many circumstances. I had a feeling we were not quite bad. Today was the day we create less than the other matches, even in the [3-2] loss at Norwich we create a lot.\n\nNewcastle v Manchester United: Premier League \u2013 live! Read more\n\n\u201cWe face many teams defending with deep systems and more or less we found a way to do it but today we had a problem. It is better not to think that one team is eight points ahead.\u201d\n\nGuardiola remains trustful of his players. \u201cI know these guys. Still they are incredibly involved [committed] and can do it. What happened, happened. Most of the teams who won [the Premier League] in the past, the year after, don\u2019t win [unlike City last season]. Today was the day \u2026 not our level. The previous games were good. But the distance is big. I know that. Liverpool is not dropping points. But we are in October, still a lot of games and competition.\n\nNuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, the Wolves manager, said: \u201cI am very proud, it was a very good performance.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola admitted his Manchester City players were \u2018nervous\u2019 as they were beaten by Wolves at the Etihad Stadium thanks to two goals from former Barcelona player Adama Traor\u00e9", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e8073bc25eb996a66baf2090c466b129a1cd008/0_29_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15000adadb790052bbe884fe9fc52573", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
