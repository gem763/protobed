We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and I know he\u2019ll always be there for me.\n\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy. But I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing.
