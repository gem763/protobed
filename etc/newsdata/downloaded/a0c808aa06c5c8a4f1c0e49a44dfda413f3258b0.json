I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m a little bit sleep-deprived,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nothing could fill my sails more than being able to spend this evening with you.\u201d\n\nEchoing his debate performance, Buttigieg asked supporters to dream of a day when President Donald Trump was no longer president.\n\n\u201cReally picture what that day\u2019s going to be like; I\u2019m asking everyone to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice thought right? We\u2019re definitely ready to put this chaos and corruption behind us.\u201d", "description": "Mayor Pete Buttigieg has not won the Democrat nomination for president yet, but he is already thinking about his presidential cabinet.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Pete-Buttigieg-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
