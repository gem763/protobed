The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond also rose 2 basis points to 2.077% and the 2-year yield hovered around 1.558% after posting its largest one-day jump since February 2015 in the prior session. Yields rise as prices fall.\n\nInvestor focus centered on August nonfarm payroll and unemployment data that will be released at 08:30 a.m. ET, where investors will look for signs about the health of the U.S. economy. Wall Street is eager for an update on the strength of the labor market as measured by employment gains, the unemployment rate and the robustness of wage growth.\n\nEconomists polled by Dow Jones project 150,000 jobs were added in August following a gain of 164,000 and an unemployment rate at 3.7% in July. Jobs gains as measure by 12-month net change have slowed in recent months but remained at a healthy clip in July with a year-over-year change of 2.2 million.\n\nAverage hourly earnings \u2014 a statistic often used by economists as a leading inflation indicator \u2014 are expected to have climbed 0.3% between July and August.\n\nThe employment statistics will likely add to the fierce debate on Wall Street over whether the U.S. is headed for economic slowdown. Investors fled risk assets in favor of safe havens during August as a combination of soured trade relations with China and an inverted yield curve suggested to some that GDP growth could be nearing contraction.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve puts the chance of a recession at 39% in the next 12 months, the highest level since the Great Recession that ended in mid-2009. The 10-year Treasury note yield fell more than 50 basis points last month amid the flight to safer assets including government debt and precious metals. A basis point is one hundredth of one percent.\n\nMore recent trade headlines, however, have reversed a fraction of the August bid for Treasurys.\n\nThe U.S. and China agreed to hold high-level talks in early October, according to a translation of a report from the Chinese Commerce Ministry released earlier this week. The news raised hopes that the world's two largest economies could soon make substantial progress in calming their multiyear trade war.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday that Liu He, the country's top trade negotiator, spoke by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. They agreed to meet in early October for another round of negotiations, according to the Chinese Commerce Ministry. China insiders have also hinted that the upcoming trade talks could lead to a \"breakthrough.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.", "description": "U.S. government debt yields ticked higher on Friday as investors looked ahead to the Labor Department's jobs report for the month of August.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102141293-113215716r.jpg?v=1554403954", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
