It is hard to think of anything more reckless and irresponsible: Boris Johnson\u2019s play-acting over a Brexit deal is being put ahead of people\u2019s right to know what food might be available for them, their families and their communities.\u201d\n\nKate Dalmeny, who heads Sustain, a food and farming campaign which has worked with charities and others over the possible impact of no deal, said: \u201cWe are increasingly worried that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for millions of people on low incomes, who would struggle with predicted food price rises of up to 10%, with no means to stockpile food.\u201d\n\nWhy Brexit has driven thousands back to their allotments Read more\n\nA Defra spokeswoman said: \u201cWe already have a highly resilient food supply chain, and a food industry that is well versed in dealing with scenarios that can impact food supply. Half of the food we eat is produced right here in the UK and consumers will continue to have access to a wide range of high-quality food.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting regularly with the industry to make sure they are fully prepared for leaving the EU on 31 October,\u201d she added.", "description": "FOI request from Green MP Caroline Lucas denied on grounds it would threaten EU negotiations", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f1d92b6d6a5f1875ce5eda199f49345cd08aa3/0_230_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ce87403288790d012a7d64628fab63f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
