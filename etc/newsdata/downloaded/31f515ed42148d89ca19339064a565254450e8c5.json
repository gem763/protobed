President Trump and his top Department of Homeland Security official Kevin McAleenan, who oversees FEMA, have said the government is preparing for the worst case scenario.\n\n\"It seems to be one of the biggest hurricanes that we've ever seen. And that's a problem,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House south lawn on Sunday afternoon.", "description": "\"We've got to stop looking at FEMA as 911,\" Brock Long said on \"Face the Nation,\" adding that he believes everyday Americans need to be better trained for disasters", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/01/db265e37-fb36-4316-9abf-4e63780583e3/thumbnail/1200x630/6129ab2a2af86ea5217dc3ed8eaf8325/1567350290801.png"}
