While the young Biden did have business interest overseas while he father was in office, there is no evidence of misconduct. Trump\u2019s adult children have faced congressional scrutiny for their foreign business dealings while their father is serving as president, and Trump still maintains ownership stakes in his family\u2019s businesses.\n\nThe rally in Minneapolis, the first since Democrats began proceedings two weeks ago to remove him from office, served as a proving ground for the president as he tries to use the impeachment inquiry to energize supporters for his 2020 campaign by casting himself \u2014 and his supporters \u2014 as victims of Washington Democrats.\n\nThe performance revealed a defense strategy largely detached from the allegations Trump faces. Trump spent little time defending his attempt to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. Instead, he cast the impeachment fight in simpler basic terms \u2014 a battle between him and the \u201cswamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nTrump was by his own admission fired up and off script as he spoke for more than 90 minutes. Few of his political opponents were spared from insults. He said Biden \u201cwas only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d He called Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar \u201ca disgrace\u201d and an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist.\u201d He said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was \u201creally stupid.\u201d\n\nOmar responded on Twitter, \u201cHis hate is no match for our movement.\u201d\n\nTrump turned his cuts to the nation\u2019s refugee resettlement programs into an applause line and defended his decision to \u201cbring our soldiers back home\u201d from Syria, as he faces criticism for abandoning the U.S.\u2019s Kurdish allies to an attack by Turkey.\n\nBefore Trump took the stage, his son Eric warmed up the crowd with an attack on the Bidens.\n\nThe younger Trump asked the crowd for an assessment of how Hunter Biden is feeling and suggested that the familiar Trump rally chant of \u201cLock her up\u201d \u2014 directed at Hillary Clinton \u2014 become \u201cLock him up\u201d instead. The crowd then chanted, \u201cLock him up, lock him up.\u201d\n\nTrump fell about 45,000 votes short of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton in Minnesota in 2016. He has had staff in the state since June building a network to turn out supporters next November, and the well-funded Trump campaign says it will spend tens of millions of dollars to try to win the state.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win this state,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\n\nProtesters converged on Target Center, Minneapolis\u2019 basketball arena, hours before Trump\u2019s appearance, eventually packing the streets surrounding it. Many blew brightly colored whistles handed out by fellow protesters, adding to the din of frequent chants like, \u201cLock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!\u201d \u2014 referring to Trump himself. Some clutched helium-filled balloons depicting Trump as a baby, similar to the famed Baby Trump balloon that flew above a nearby building.\n\nLora Torgerson of suburban Inver Grove Heights clutched a sign that read \u201cLiar Liar Diaper on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a registered GOP member, and I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of our party,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d\n\nInside the arena, Lori Glass, a longtime Republican from White Bear Lake, a Twin Cities suburb, dismissed the talking of impeachment with one word: \u201cRidiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done so much for the country,\u201d she said, citing the economy as Trump\u2019s top accomplishment. Democrats are pressing for impeachment because \u201cthey don\u2019t have a good candidate,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump planned a rally in Louisiana against Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Aides said Trump is not endorsing one of the GOP candidates in the race before Saturday\u2019s election to maximize the chances that Edwards falls below the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nNext week Trump is set to hold a rally in Dallas, a GOP stronghold in a state that has grown more competitive for Democrats in recent cycles.\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.
