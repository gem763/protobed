That will be especially true in a no-deal scenario, which would massively increase uncertainty and strengthen the recessionary forces already clearly visible in European and British economies.\n\nThis trajectory may yet be averted in the short term: Either by a law passed in the U.K. parliament to prevent Johnson's government pursuing no deal, or by the hiatus provided by a general election.\n\nBut the positions that have led to this impasse are likely to remain fixed. Both Johnson \u2014 by insisting that the so-called Brexit backstop be axed from the Withdrawal Agreement \u2014 and the EU \u2014 by insisting it will not change a single word in the agreement it negotiated with Theresa May \u2014 are increasing the likelihood of a messy exit.\n\nNo deal is not only a bad outcome for the U.K., it will also have deeply negative effects for the EU.\n\nThis game of chicken will benefit no one in the long run.\n\nWe have a limited window of opportunity to avert a disaster and shouldn\u2019t assume the U.K. government will come up with a credible solution in the little time it has left. The EU and European governments should take the initiative.\n\nBoth sides are keen to blame the other for the current impasse, but the truth is that both are responsible. The ball is as much in our court as it is in theirs.\n\nTo be sure, London didn\u2019t make things easy. After the shock result of the 2016 Brexit vote, the British government got stuck in an institutional paralysis and was unable to come up with a coherent Brexit strategy that could achieve a majority in parliament. Despite Theresa May\u2019s endless, often quite humiliating, pilgrimages to Brussels, the British political elite lost itself, and its country\u2019s destiny, in aimless infighting and unproductive short-term tactical games. Few people, if anyone, seemed to grasp the seriousness of what was at stake.\n\nBut it would be too easy to blame London for the tragedy unfolding now.\n\nCountless times during my tenure as Belgium\u2019s finance minister between 2014 and 2018, I heard officials talk of wanting to \u201cpunish the Brits.\u201d Other countries toying with the idea of leaving the EU should be dissuaded from following in the U.K.\u2019s footsteps, the thinking went.\n\nSome government spokespeople were more explicit about this than others. Some of them even gave the impression they found a kind of cynical pleasure in this form of punishment. Getting rid of the contrarian British and giving them a firm kick in the butt, they felt, would be killing two birds with one stone.\n\nWhile European officials also certainly made honest efforts to come to a good compromise with their British counterparts, this desire to make an example of the Brits was palpable in the positions taken by EU negotiators. And now this behavior is coming back at us like a boomerang.\n\nThe EU could never have made up for the U.K. government\u2019s unpreparedness and its frivolous approach to these negotiations. But it could have been more open to creative solutions to solve disagreements on key points such as the backstop.\n\nNo deal is not only a bad outcome for the U.K., it will also have deeply negative effects for the EU, and especially for countries with strong trade and investment ties to the U.K. such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.\n\nBut what is most tragic about this turn of events is that it will ultimately be the citizens of the U.K. and the EU who pay the price of our collective political failure to come up with a reasonable deal.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the potential consequences, it\u2019s now in everyone\u2019s interest to find a constructive way forward \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t hurt the EU to go the extra mile and show some leniency at this crucial time.\n\nSometimes politics demands being tough as nails. Other times, it\u2019s far more constructive to take a more moderate stance and seek out a compromise.\n\nAnd when it comes to Brexit, the EU should be ready to take the latter route.\n\nThe world is uncertain enough already. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit will save Europe from a great deal of pain in the long term.\n\nJohan Van Overtveldt is a member of the European Parliament and chairman of the Parliament\u2019s Budget Committee.
