An out-and-out battle to decide the country's future is now set to break out this week -- while on the continent, European leaders have their own decision to make about whether or not to extend the drama further.\n\nBrexit isn't over yet. In fact, it may just have been blown wide open.\n\nA knife-edge vote\n\nFirst on Johnson's agenda this week will be putting his Brexit deal back up for a vote in Parliament -- but even that could be complicated.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, indicated on Saturday that Johnson planned for a vote on his deal on Monday.\n\nBut the Speaker, John Bercow, said he needs to decide whether or not to allow it first. Earlier in the year, Bercow ruled that the same bill cannot be presented to Parliament twice in the same form unless the circumstances are significantly different.\n\nIf Johnson does get the bill past the Speaker, the vote would not be make-or-break -- Letwin's amendments mean that subsequent votes on the withdrawal agreement must also be signed off for Brexit to take place.\n\nBut the results would give a clear indication as to whether Johnson has the numbers to pass a deal. If he does, Brexit legislation laid down from Tuesday would be expected to pass too.\n\nAmber Rudd, who quit Johnson's Cabinet last month after losing faith that he wanted to secure a deal, predicted on Sunday that the Prime Minister has a \"fragile but sincere coalition\" behind his bill.\n\n\"I do think it will get through,\" she told Sky News.\n\nIts success or failure may lie in how many Labour MPs rebel against the party whip to support the deal, and whether Johnson can convince the lawmakers he previously purged from his benches to embrace the pact.\n\nFifty shades of Brexit\n\nThe wider problem Johnson's team faces is the can of worms opened by Letwin's wrecking ball amendment.\n\nFar from the straight vote on his deal that Johnson had intended, every part of his plan can now be amended in Parliament with whatever shades of Brexit that MPs wish to attach to it.\n\nThat means that, all of a sudden, a so-called Soft Brexit customs union arrangement is back on the table -- potentially enticing a handful of moderates to switch their support from Johnson's plan.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which supposedly props up Johnson's minority government but whose MPs were left livid by the proposed installation of a customs border in the Irish Sea, have already enacted revenge by pushing the Letwin amendment over the line. They could now heap further misery on the PM by backing a softer alternative plan.\n\nAlso likely to emerge is another longshot push for a second referendum, which Labour would be expected to back. That follows a march on Saturday that saw hundreds of thousands demand another say.\n\nSo Parliament-watchers are now essentially faced with the prospect of both a \"meaningful vote\" and a series of indicative votes on Brexit alternatives being considered in tandem, a scene not too dissimilar from the hodgepodge of suggestions put forward in Parliament after it rejected Theresa May's deal three times. In case you've forgotten, all of those suggestions failed too\n\nPhotos: In photos: Thousands march for second Brexit referendum Crowds gather during a People's Vote campaign march in London, England, on Saturday, October 19.

The case may seem a moot point now, given that Johnson sent that request on Saturday night, but some have questioned whether he stuck to the spirit of the law by undermining his own request.\n\nWith confusion in Parliament, intrigue in the courts and protests on the streets, Brexit seems a long way from a conclusion.", "description": "Boris Johnson was so close.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191019102725-boris-johnson-1019-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
