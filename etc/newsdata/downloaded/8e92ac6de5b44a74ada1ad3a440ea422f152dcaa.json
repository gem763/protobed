It closed the entire network at 9pm.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, the People\u2019s Liberation Army barracks in Kowloon East issued a warning in Cantonese in the early evening after demonstrators shone laser lights as they walked past the buildings en route to another location. A yellow flag went up at the top of the building, warning the demonstrators as several men in uniform were seen filming the protesters and a floodlight shone on them. Nothing more came of the tense moment, however, as both sides soon cleared from the scene.\n\nIn Sham Shui Po, a taxi driver in his 60s rammed into a crowd of protesters and injured a woman. Angry masked groups then pulled the driver out of the car and beat him, before he was later rescued by firefighters. Beaten unconscious, his face and head were covered in blood while the windows of the taxi were smashed.\n\nAfter teen is shot by police on National Day, anti-government protesters take to the streets\n\nLocal actress Celine Ma, with blood on her face and chest, also said she was beaten by protesters because she was filming them attacking a Bank of China branch nearby.\n\nThe Hospital Authority said that, as of 11pm, 11 people were admitted to hospitals, with three in a serious condition and five stable. The condition of two was unknown, while one was discharged.\n\nAnti-government protesters destroy a taxi and beat up the driver in Sham Shui Po after he drove into a crowd of protesters.

Cheng\n\nThe heightened violence on Sunday \u2013 which led to tear gas being fired in four districts \u2013 continued late into the night in Mong Kok as a source familiar with the government\u2019s thinking told the SCMP that the new anti-mask law was not targeted at the hard-core front-liners.\n\n\u201cWe know well hard-core violent protesters don\u2019t care about facing an extra one-year\u2019s imprisonment under the anti-mask law, as they could be jailed for up to 10 years if they are convicted of rioting,\u201d the source said.\n\nLikening the strategy to that of peeling the layers of an onion, he said: \u201cThose in the outer layers may however fear going to jail or criminal convictions. They might think twice if they are still taking part in violent actions.\u201d\n\nYoung Post readers share their biggest fears for Hong Kong\n\nPolice arrested 13 people between midnight on Friday and Saturday for defying the mask ban. Most were also charged with participating in an unlawful assembly.\n\nSocial media users reported that, on Sunday, among those arrested and unmasked was a 10-year-old girl, but police did not confirm the action by press time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, despite a thundery downpour, tens of thousands of masked protesters gathered for two concurrent marches in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, openly courting arrest as they defied the ban on face coverings. The crowds were smaller from protests in recent weekends, as protesters blamed the crippled MTR network as an impediment.\n\nFace off: should students take part in social movements?\n\nAmong those who turned up was a 61-year-old local surnamed Chan, saying the past summer marked his first time joining protests and that the mask ban had made the situation even more urgent.\n\n\u201cWith the mask ban, the government is testing the waters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf no one reacts to this then they can use the emergency ordinance to do anything, including interfering with the coming district elections. If the government can do anything, then Hong Kong is finished.\u201d\n\nAt least five MTR stations were targeted by protesters. Projectiles were thrown onto the tracks of Kowloon Tong station, two exits of Mong Kok station were set on fire, while protesters also broke open fire hoses and hurled a petrol bomb into Cheung Sha Wan station through an exit.\n\nAnti-government protesters set fire to barricades in Mong Kok on Sunday.

After 1pm, trains going between Hong Kong station and the airport would not stop at Kowloon, Tsing Yi or AsiaWorld Expo, it said.\n\nIn a statement on social media, the police force expressed its strongest condemnation against the protesters whom it called \u201crioters\u201d for taking the law into their own hands, citing cases of three people \u2013 including the taxi driver \u2013 who were beaten up by them. \u201cThe atrocities committed by the rioters are far beyond the bottom line of any civilised society,\u201d it said.\n\nRiot police arrive to clear the area as anti-government protesters rally in Wan Chai on Sunday.

He was later sent to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai. An RTHK spokesman strongly condemned the violent acts as he called on all sides to stop their actions.\n\nOn Sunday night, the government strongly condemned masked \u201crioters\u201d for their \u201clawless violent acts\u201d in blocking roads, vandalising public facilities, MTR stations, banks and stores, hurling petrol bombs at police and attacking other citizens.\n\nCarrie Lam passes new law banning face masks, but protesters continue to defy ban\n\n\u201cRioters have attacked other citizens multiple times over the past days, whereas some have allegedly used a lethal weapon today which resulted in severe injury. A journalist also suffered burns after being hit by a petrol bomb from rioters,\u201d a spokesman said, as he called on the public not to defy the anti-mask law.\n\nChina\u2019s state media, meanwhile, continued their strong support for the anti-mask law, with a commentary in People\u2019s Daily saying \u201cwhile the anti-mask law won\u2019t help to catch all the thugs soon, it will deliver a heavy blow to the protesters\u201d.", "description": "People's Liberation Army barracks issue warning in Cantonese for the first time, as mainland Chinese-linked businesses are vandalised and fires started outside closed MTR stations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/6ea443fa-e83f-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires074008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
