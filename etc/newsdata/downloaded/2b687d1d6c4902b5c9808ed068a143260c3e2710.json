(With one exception, episodes take as titles the headlines under which the pieces were published.) It\u2019s the story of a young book critic (Cristin Milioti) with a preposterously nice apartment who finds herself pregnant by a man who\u2019s not looking to settle down. Her stoic Albanian doorman (Laurentiu Possa) becomes the man in her life, helping with the nursery furniture or stepping in for emergency childcare. It made me cry a little, because who doesn\u2019t fantasize about being a book critic who can somehow afford a beautiful apartment and also finds a capable man to handle the FreshDirect delivery?\n\nCaitlin McGee and Dev Patel enact the powerful fantasy of a post-coital Sunday morning with The New York Times. Christopher Saunders/Amazon Studios\n\nEach installment clocks in around 30 minutes, so the overall effect is very distilled\u2014the stuff of a rom-com, minus the comedy and the b-plots involving zany best friends. This is a lot for an actor to manage, but few television shows get actors like Catherine Keener, Anne Hathaway (more on her in a second), and Jane Alexander (who deserved better from her episode, \u201cThe Race Grows Sweeter Near Its Final Lap\u201d).\n\nKeener plays a journalist named Julie, who is interviewing a tech CEO (Dev Patel) about his new dating app. After their on-the-record chat, the two relax and swap stories of lost love. His tale (he loved her; she cheated) is standard-issue stuff; hers is a saga of what might have been. Patel is a charmer, but I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to Keener, a performer more than equal to the task of showing us the disappointment of a bad marriage and the exhilaration of rediscovered love in only half an hour. We get a lot of story at an incredible clip; this is like a Reader\u2019s Digest Condensed version of a film.\n\nTrue believers (maybe I mean critics) love the binge-able show. Maybe television\u2019s sloganeers are somehow to blame. Is any TV really \u201cmust see,\u201d and don\u2019t we all have enough we must do, and isn\u2019t there a different kind of pleasure in being entertained for 30 minutes then never worrying about that world or its people again? Maybe that\u2019s the appeal of the anthology format. If you\u2019re such a viewer, I\u2019d watch Keener\u2019s episode, and I\u2019d also watch \u201cAt the Hospital, an Interlude of Clarity\u201d just because it\u2019s so (I cannot believe I\u2019m saying this) cute.\n\nJohn Gallagher Jr. is an affable everyman; Sofia Boutella is his date. (In this episode\u2019s original column, the author, Brian Gittis, writes that his date was \u201cso beautiful I was almost afraid of her,\u201d and that\u2019s Boutella in a nutshell.) They\u2019re about to hook up then they end up in the emergency room. Sure, it\u2019s a little hackneyed; it\u2019s worth remembering, I think, that calling something a trope suggests its overuse but doesn\u2019t question its efficacy.
