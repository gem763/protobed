The unemployment rate among Americans without a high-school diploma has fallen steeply over the past three years, and the rate for black women fell in August to the lowest level on record. Both groups had trailed behind others for much of the expansion, which began in mid-2009.\n\nThe New York Fed survey suggested, however, that not all American workers are finding success in the job market. There was a slight year-over-year increase in April through July in the number of Americans moving from jobs into unemployment, notably among lower-income households. The authors of the New York Fed's report said it was too early to declare this a trend.\n\nThe rise in job switches among lower-income Americans helps explain a broader increase in workers quitting jobs. The rate at which workers quit their jobs ticked up to 2.4% in July from 2.3% in June, according to Labor Department data released earlier this month. The July rate is elevated compared with the earlier years of the economic expansion, when workers stayed put.\n\nA crucial factor driving job switching is the prospect for higher wages, as job hoppers tend to see bigger pay bumps than those who stay in their current roles.\n\n\"Folks appear to be switching jobs more frequently, and they're getting not only a wage boost, but a stronger wage boost than in the relative past,\" Mr. Bunker said.\n\nThe New York Fed report revealed another impetus for lower-income households to seek new pastures: they were less satisfied with their current job promotion opportunities this year compared with last.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 18:35 ET (22:35 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
