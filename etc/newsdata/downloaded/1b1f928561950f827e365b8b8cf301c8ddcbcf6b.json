The president's years-long campaign to bully the Fed into zeroing-out interest rates, and blaming it for any economic setback, has plunged the independent bank into a risky political battle.\n\nEconomists say the Fed is almost certain to slash borrowing costs as monthly job gains fall and Europe braces for a potential recession.\n\nFed watchers also cite the looming threat of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese and European goods, along with widespread geopolitical unrest, as major risks to the U.S. economy.\n\nBut with interest rates already close to record lows, skeptics of the Fed's loose-money approach question whether another cut will protect the U.S. from a more severe downturn and instead leave the bank defenseless against a true recession.\n\nReactions:\n\n\"The weakness has already commenced,\" said Daniel Alpert, managing partner at investment firm Westwood Capital. \"We're already seeing it in the data. So what are you going to do, wait until everybody's flat on their backs?\"\n\n\"They're already very close if not below the real inflation-adjusted zero lower bound,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, referring to the level at which interest rates are effectively equal to zero.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW:\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee continues its Tuesday markup, 10 a.m.\n\nThe FOMC announces its October interest rate decision at 2 p.m., followed by a press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee holds a hearing on the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, 2:30 p.m.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nHouse Democrat presses Mnuchin on 'alleged rampant corruption' at Treasury: Rep. Bill Pascrell William (Bill) James PascrellDemocrat asks FEC to investigate Trump campaign declining to pay police bills House committee advances measure taxing nicotine in vaping products Senate rejects Dem measure to overturn IRS rules on SALT deduction cap MORE (D-N.J.), on Tuesday pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns US, China 'close' on some parts of trade deal The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Presented by Better Medicare Alliance \u2014 Impeachment angst growing in GOP MORE on \"alleged rampant corruption\" at the department, after The New York Times reported that Mnuchin instructed the department to take an action that benefited former \"junk bond king\" Michael Milken.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a letter addressed to Mnuchin, Pascrell, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, chided the secretary, warning him that the government does not exist for the benefit of its higher-ups.\n\n\"It should go without saying that the United States government is not a piggy bank to be looted for the sole benefit of the President and his friends. Yet this is not only what is occurring in your department, but it is happening at your direct supervision.\"\n\nThe Hill's Naomi Jagoda tells us why here.\n\nThe background: The New York Times reported Saturday that the Treasury granted an opportunity zone designation to an area in Nevada last year \u2014 after having previously determined that the area was ineligible \u2014 at the instruction of Mnuchin.\n\nThe area includes land co-owned by Milken, and the decision to grant the area opportunity zone status came after Mnuchin spent time with Milken, the Times reported.\n\nTreasury fires back: In a statement over the weekend, Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley called the Times story \"highly inaccurate and deeply misleading.\" She said that Mnuchin had no knowledge of Milken's investments in the Nevada county and that Treasury considered adding the tract as an opportunity zone at the request of public officials in the state.\n\nBoeing chief faces anger at hearing: Boeing President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg testified before Congress for the first time Tuesday since two deadly crashes of his company's 737 Max jets, apologizing to the victims' families and facing tough questions from lawmakers.\n\n\"I wanted to let you know, on behalf of myself and all of the men and women of Boeing, how deeply sorry I am,\" Muilenburg told the Senate Commerce Committee, in a hearing that came one year to the day after one of the 737s, Lion Air Flight 610, crashed, killing 189.\n\nIn a dramatic moment, family members of crash victims were recognized by the committee and held up photos of those they lost.\n\nMuilenburg in his opening statement sought to assure senators that Boeing has made necessary improvements since the crashes.\n\n\"We have learned and are still learning from these accidents, Mr. Chairman. We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong. We own that, and we are fixing them. We have developed improvements to the 737 Max to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,\" he said.\n\nBut the criticism from lawmakers was withering. Senators expressed anger that Boeing reportedly approved the design of the 737 Max despite concerns from their own pilots and did not act more quickly to address the problems after the Lion Air crash in October 2018. Five months later, another 737 Max, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, crashed, killing 157.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) grilled Muilenburg, saying that since the crashes his \"anger has only grown.\" He told the CEO that the victims of the crashes died \"as a result of a pattern of deliberate concealment.\"\n\nBlumenthal blasted Boeing for initially blaming the crashes on \"pilot error,\" saying \"those pilots never had a chance, those loved ones never had a chance.\"\n\nThe Hill's Zack Budryk has more from the dramatic hearing.\n\nDemocrats renew push for contractor back pay from government shutdown: Democratic senators are pushing their colleagues to support an amendment that would provide back pay for low-wage government contractors who went without pay during the record 35-day shutdown earlier this year.\n\nWhen Congress passed a spending bill to reopen the government in January, lawmakers provided back pay for federal employees who had been furloughed and those who had been required to work without pay.\n\nBut many workers employed by contractors for security, cleaning or food service jobs were not compensated for the month of lost wages.\n\n\"They were ready and willing to work every single day of the 35-day shutdown, but they couldn't,\" said Sen.
