The EU\u2019s chief negotiator has set Boris Johnson a midnight ultimatum: make a further concession or go to the Commons empty-handed.\n\nAre we close to a deal?\n\nThe prime minister has made a series of major U-turns in recent weeks. That gives EU officials some hope that he will continue in this vein and a deal could be in the making. If Downing Street thinks it is a step too far, and reverts to the bellicose language of Johnson\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, then all bets are off.\n\nWhat does the EU want?\n\nBarnier has said the UK needs to table legal text, and it needs to be based on the February 2018 Northern-Ireland-only backstop. That proposal \u2013 rejected by Theresa May as a constitutional outrage that no British prime minister could accept \u2013 would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods and the EU\u2019s customs territory. The arrangement would cease to be in force if a future trade deal offered an alternative solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. Barnier is open to tweaking it.\n\nA consent mechanism under which Stormont has a say over alignment with the EU is being negotiated. It has also been suggested that Northern Ireland could de jure remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory. But Barnier is insistent that, in practice, the EU\u2019s full customs code needs to be applied to goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, without exemptions.\n\nWill Boris Johnson agree?\n\nThe Democratic Unionist party has blown up similar deals before. Its leader, Arlene Foster, was in Downing Street on Monday evening. She is yet to comment on the negotiations beyond insisting that she wants a \u201cbalanced and sensible deal\u201d. But any arrangement that creates checks and controls and potentially a tariff border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is likely to be problematic. The UK could establish a rebate system to ensure that Northern Ireland businesses are not financially disadvantaged. But the principle of a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea is a difficult one for unionists.\n\nWhat happens if the prime minister does not yield further?\n\nThere are two possibilities: deadlock if Johnson decides to walk out on the summit and attacks Brussels for intransigence, or further negotiations to talk around the problem next week. The latter would open up the possibility of a second EU summit, perhaps on 29 October, for a deal to be signed off by leaders.\n\nWhat is most likely?\n\nFor all the noise from Downing Street, Johnson has been a pliant negotiator with Brussels. If the last three years of Brexit have taught us anything it is that fudge, delay and prevarication are always the most likely course, and that talks will continue past this week.", "description": "Boris Johnson has until the end of Tuesday to make the concession needed for a deal", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Suzanne Moore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/758025ea847bcf3104e0940023ebcaeca02c8fc1/0_261_5281_3169/master/5281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=815dfd357e0bb828312de71fa6cf4e8f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
