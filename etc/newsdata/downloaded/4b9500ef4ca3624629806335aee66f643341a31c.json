So journalists in Westminster asked the prime minister\u2019s spokespeople, and some of their answers were surprising.\n\n\u201cThe government will not proceed with the bill,\u201d they said. The withdrawal agreement bill would be \u201cpulled\u201d, and the government would refuse to put any other business through parliament. Instead, the prime minister would \u201ccampaign every day and at every opportunity for a general election\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThey did not use the word \u201cstrike\u201d, but the impression they gave was that the business of government would cease until MPs accepted that an election was the only way to end parliament\u2019s delay and obstruction of Brexit. This seemed to be confirmed a short time later, when the Treasury announced that the budget, pencilled in for 6 November, had been postponed.\n\nThe idea of a government going on strike didn\u2019t make much sense, which is why journalists reported it so prominently. It also seemed to clash with the prime minister\u2019s message of trying to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nHe had won a vote in the Commons on the principle of the Brexit bill, and the opposition had offered to discuss a \u201creasonable\u201d timetable, but now it was Johnson who seemed to be standing in the way of getting the legislation through.\n\nNor was the threat to abandon the bill believable. Johnson had already threatened to \u201cpull\u201d it once, if the Commons voted against his short timetable for it, but he had then merely \u201cpaused\u201d it.\n\nSo it was no surprise when the message from the prime minister\u2019s spokespeople was reversed on Friday. The government would not be going on strike after all; the prime minister \u201chas a domestic agenda\u201d, they said: \u201cWe want to deliver for the British public.\u201d\n\nIt was like a badly organised trade union calling off a strike when it realised most of its members had already crossed the picket line.\n\nChalk up another mark against the Dominic Cummings wing of Johnson\u2019s No 10 operation. Another empty threat causing confusion, not least in Downing Street itself, with the prime minister\u2019s position changing by the hour. It seemed typical of Cummings, the former director of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, who had been responsible for suggesting the prime minister would find a way round the Benn Act, the law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. (He might still, of course, if Emmanuel Macron, the French president, refuses to allow an extension to the Brexit timetable, but Cummings also insisted for a long time that Johnson wouldn\u2019t send the letter asking for an extension or that he had other ways of dodging the law.)\n\nNevertheless there is method in Cummings\u2019s recklessness. For most people who don\u2019t pay much attention to politics \u2013 and even for the many who do pay attention who have been confused in the last few days \u2013 recent headlines have got some simple messages across. Johnson really, really, really wanted to get Brexit done by 31 October; parliament delayed it. Johnson wants an election; the other parties do not.\n\nThose are two solid gains for the prime minister\u2019s standing in public opinion.", "description": "When Boris Johnson announced on Thursday that he would ask MPs on Monday to vote for an early election, there were several things he did not say in his letter to Jeremy Corbyn or in his short TV interview.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/08/boris-johnson-point.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
