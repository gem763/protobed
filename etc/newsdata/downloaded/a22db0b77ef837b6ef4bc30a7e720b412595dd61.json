It\u2019s still $329 to start, and it\u2019s still one of the best deals in technology. It can do as much or more than any other tablet anywhere near its cost. In other words, it\u2019s still an iPad.\n\nI joked to my co-workers that all I really needed to do for this review was just rewrite that phrase: \u201cIt\u2019s an iPad.\u201d It\u2019s been a running joke since 2017\u2019s iPad review, in which I explained that there are only three things you needed to know. Those three things are also true of the new model:\n\nIt is an iPad. It costs $329 for the base model. You should get it if your old iPad is dying. You should not get it if your old iPad is fine.\n\nThis new iPad is good. It runs all of the same apps as the iPads that cost two and three times as much (or more). And in most cases, you might not even notice a difference in how well it runs those apps. It doesn\u2019t have any issues with iPadOS 13, at least not any that are different from the overall bugginess of the OS that afflicts all iPads as of this writing. (13.1.2, for the record, still has issues.)\n\nOur review of Apple iPad (2019) Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff It\u2019s an iPad\n\nSmart Keyboard connector\n\nGood battery life\n\niPad app ecosystem still great Bad Stuff Older processor\n\n32GB not enough storage on entry model\n\nKeyboard and Pencil accessories are expensive Buy for $329.00 from Apple Buy for $329.00 from Walmart\n\nIf you aren\u2019t tempted by a slightly nicer screen (the iPad Air) or power, performance, and Face ID (the iPad Pro), then the regular iPad is the one to get. I do think that the $329 model\u2019s 32GB of storage is almost punishingly low, but if you\u2019re diligent about streaming movies and music, you could probably get by.\n\nThe iPad still uses Lightning to charge, and it still supports the first-gen Apple Pencil, which still costs $99. It still has just two speakers and Touch ID instead of Face ID, plus cameras that are fine by 2017 standards but not great by 2019 standards.\n\nAll of these details are things that are unlikely to bother people who buy this tablet. I have been using a top-tier iPad Pro 11 for almost a year, and switching to this new iPad didn\u2019t significantly worsen my life. It still plays all of the games in Apple Arcade, and it still has a battery that lasts all day. Mostly, I noticed that webpages seemed to load slower.\n\nWhat I\u2019m about to tell you shouldn\u2019t bother you in the slightest if you\u2019re in the market for a nice, relatively inexpensive tablet, but here we go: this is a slightly weird iPad, and it makes me wonder what the heck is going on with Apple\u2019s product strategy. I\u2019m not really sure why Apple bothered updating this iPad, to be honest. The new screen size is 10.2 inches, which isn\u2019t so much bigger than the old 9.7-inch size that it\u2019ll make a material difference.\n\nThe new keyboard connector is nice, but Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard still costs a somewhat ridiculous $159, and there aren\u2019t really any viable cheaper options that take advantage of it anyway. (If you\u2019re keeping score, that price is 48 percent of the base iPad\u2019s cost. A fully kitted-out base iPad with an Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard tallies up to $587.) I suspect education buyers \u2014 a key market for this iPad \u2014 are not going to be swayed away from Chromebooks just because of the new connector.\n\nAgree to Continue: Apple iPad (2019) Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. Much like the iPhone, to use an iPad, you have to agree to: The Apple terms of service agreement, which you can have sent to you by email\n\nApple\u2019s warranty agreement, which you can have sent to you by email These agreements are not negotiable, and you cannot use the phone at all if you don\u2019t agree to them. The iPad also prompts you to set up Apple Cash and Apple Pay at setup, which further means you have to agree to: The Apple Cash agreement, which specifies that services are actually provided by Green Dot Bank and Apple Payments, Inc, and further consists of the following agreements:\n\nThe Apple Cash terms and conditions\n\nThe electronic communications agreement\n\nThe Green Dot bank privacy policy\n\nDirect payments terms and conditions\n\nDirect payments privacy notice\n\nApple Payments, Inc, license If you add a credit card to Apple Pay, you have to agree to: The terms from your credit card provider, which do not have an option to be emailed Final tally: two mandatory agreements, six optional agreements for Apple Cash, one optional agreement for Apple Pay\n\nThis year\u2019s iPad apparently has 3GB of RAM now, but it has the same A10 processor as last year\u2019s model. That processor is still fast enough for what you\u2019ll do with this device, but it doesn\u2019t clock impressive benchmarks or performance like more modern chips. It\u2019s the same chip that was in 2017\u2019s iPad, but Apple does such a good job with processors that, even now, it won\u2019t feel slow.\n\nMostly, this iPad is strange to me because I don\u2019t know how most people will decide between it and the iPad Air that came out this past March. The iPad Air has a 10.5-inch screen, but that size difference doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 not really. The Air\u2019s screen is nicer: it\u2019s laminated and supports True Tone plus a wider color gamut. But if you\u2019re in the business of spending money for a nicer screen, I have to imagine you\u2019d save up a little more for an iPad Pro. The same applies to the processor: the iPad Air has a better one, but it\u2019s not as good as what you can get on an iPad Pro.\n\nThis is the best tablet under $500 \u2014but I can\u2019t help thinking that it Apple would have made it better if there were any meaningful tablet competition in this price range.\n\nEven though the processor is getting a little long in the tooth and Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard is too pricey, it remains impressive that you can get a computer this good for this price. It\u2019s not a device that I would recommend upgrading to if you have a tablet you\u2019re even moderately happy with, but it is a device I am sure you\u2019ll be happy with if you buy it.", "description": "The entry-level iPad has been updated with a slightly larger screen and a smart connector that lets you attach Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard.
