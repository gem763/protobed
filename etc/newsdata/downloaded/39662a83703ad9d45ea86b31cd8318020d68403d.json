His second kick went wide left of the uprights, though an Arizona State player jumped over the Michigan State line in an attempt to block that kick.\n\nFrom the PAC-12:\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the five-yard penalty was assessed that moved the ball to the 29-yard line, Michigan State again attempted a field goal with 0:06 remaining that was no good as time expired. However, there should have been a foul called for leaping. An Arizona State defensive player took a running start and leapt over the kicking team\u2019s line in an attempt to block the kick. In the process, he leapt into the frame of the body of an opponent. The penalty would have been 15 yards from the previous spot and an automatic first down. In this case, it would have been administered as half the distance to the goal and Michigan State would have been provided one untimed down.\n\nThat penalty was not called on the field, however, and can\u2019t be reviewed. So, Arizona State was given the 10-7 win in East Lansing.\n\nThe PAC-12\u2019s statement is part of the league\u2019s effort to be more transparent with its officiating this season, something it promised to do this summer after a Yahoo Sports report detailed an officiating incident in the USC-Washington State game. The PAC-12 introduced a \u201ccommunications protocol,\u201d in which it would offer an official comment \u201caround significant calls or errors that either impact player safety or the result of the game.\u201d\n\nNow, the officiating error isn\u2019t a good look for the PAC-12 by any means. But Michigan State\u2019s performance on Saturday wasn\u2019t much better. The Spartans trailed 3-0 at halftime and didn\u2019t score until midway through the fourth quarter. The team had 10 total penalties for 91 yards, and Coglin missed a pair of field goal attempts earlier in the night.\n\nStill, the league made it clear that Coglin deserved one final attempt at a field goal, which would have sent the game into overtime.\n\nBut after Michigan State\u2019s offensive struggles, an extra period may not really have mattered.\n\nThe Pac-12 admitted an officiating error Sunday in Michigan State's loss to Arizona State, one that should have left them with another field goal attempt.
