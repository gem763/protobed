One such example is software-defined networking (SDN), which offers the next step in network traffic control. This is where software and policies are used to define consistent network behaviour and responses -- rather than relying on a conglomeration of individual hardware devices, each with their own configuration.\n\nAs network traffic continues to increase -- caused by the growth of the sheer number of apps we all depend on, together with the universal use of bandwidth-intensive applications such as video and real-time collaboration -- the demand for bandwidth continues to increase at a high rate. For cheaper capacity, enterprises have added internet broadband links to their existing MPLS networks. According to IDC, 40-60 percent of enterprise data traffic is migrating from private WANs to the internet.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://d3ab9omd0xmpv4.cloudfront.net/attachments/media/10121/processed/LoopingWAN_Compressed_2.share.gif?1511246032111"}
