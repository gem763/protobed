The Sydney Roosters claimed their second straight premiership, defeating the Canberra Raiders 14-8 in a controversial NRL Grand Final. Mr Beattie told Sky News \u201cIt was always going to be a close competition and the fans certainly got their money\u2019s worth with almost 83,000 of them there\u201d. The match was full of contentious refereeing decisions, including a controversial six-again call. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget the fact that the Roosters have done a magnificent job winning back-to-back,\u201d he said.
