Nor had they faced such a disciplined, well-organised defense.\n\nAnd where the South Africans had been careless early on \u2013 they could have gone in at halftime three or four tries to the good \u2013 they tightened everything up in the second period to devastating effect.\n\nMan of the match Faf de Klerk, who had helmed the South Africans artfully throughout, added a second try on 66 minutes and Mapimpi added his second four minutes later.\n\nPollard converted one try and slotted three penalties in the second period, all unanswered.\n\nJapan could never hope to maintain the frenetic pace with which they had harried South Africa early on and departed the tournament beaten but with a whole new army of fans for their exciting, free-flowing rugby.\n\nSouth Africa must now regroup for their Yokohama semifinal against Wales\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "There was never any shortage of courage, but not even the bravest of blossoms could punch through Springbok brawn on Sunday as South Africa reached the rugby World Cup semifinals by beating Japan 26-3 and ending their dream run at their home tournament.
