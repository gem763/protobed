The final memcon would go to the Security Council records office for posterity.\n\nThe memcon can be edited at any point along the production and review process until it is approved and sent to the Security Council records office. During the Obama administration, edits to memcon packages produced by the Security Council policy staffs were not substantive. The editorial review process was not used to remove unflattering or incorrect things about the president, but troubling reports like the whistle-blower complaint suggest that practice may have changed in the Trump administration. The memcon released to the public last week might not be the only, or the most complete, White House record of the presidential conversation in question at the heart of the current controversy.\n\nNotably, to fulfill the requirements of the Presidential Records Act, the Security Council\u2019s document management systems for processing \u201cpackages\u201d would most likely have captured any electronic edits to the memcon.\n\nWhy do we go to all of this trouble? For two critical purposes. First, it reminds national security officials what was discussed and what the president and the other leader did (and did not) commit to. This enables officials to hold foreign governments accountable for their leader\u2019s private commitments and prevents other governments from wrongfully claiming that the president made a commitment he or she did not. Second, a faithful memcon is a valuable historical record to enlighten future generations about foreign relations.\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s allegation that the draft memcon was \u201clocked down\u201d at the direction of \u201cWhite House lawyers\u201d using a separate electronic system dedicated to processing the most sensitive national security materials also strikes me as highly unusual. Although presidential memcons are among the most sensitive and closely held documents in the White House (their contents are very desirable foreign intelligence targets), in the Obama administration it was standard practice for memcons \u2014 even extremely sensitive ones \u2014 to be produced and handled on the Security Council\u2019s primary electronic system, which can handle material up to and including \u201ctop secret\u201d classification.", "description": "What the whistle-blower describes is highly unusual and cause for concern.", "authors": ["Alex Pascal"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/opinion/30Pascal1/30Pascal1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
