Francis was the fourth player at the tournament to be cited as part of World Rugby\u2019s efforts to come down hard on high tackles and following the governing body\u2019s criticism of the standard of refereeing.\n\nLawes has a reputation for hitting hard \u2013 in the 2015 Six Nations he came in for criticism for one bone-crunching shot on France\u2019s Jules Plisson while his tackle on Charlie Hodgson in the 2014 Premiership final has gone down in folklore. The Northampton second-row has been sanctioned once for a high tackle, however, and even though referees effectively on high alert after World Rugby\u2019s decision to go public last week, Lawes is adamant England do not need to change their ways.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really too worried about it,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows what regulations are in place and generally we don\u2019t really tackle like that. We\u2019re low tacklers; chop tacklers. Nobody aims to tackle illegally but you can make mistakes. As long as we\u2019re being safe and trying to tackle properly then it\u2019s all good. My natural tackle technique is to chop. If I\u2019m second-man then I\u2019ll aim for the ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only had one high tackle in my whole career so I\u2019m doing all right. I\u2019ve never felt worried going into a game. Everyone\u2019s trying to do the best for each other, play well and play safe. You\u2019ve just got to go out there and do your job. There\u2019s always going to be big hits and you\u2019ll always be able to make big hits legally.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to hit somebody high to make a big shot. Plenty of players have shown that throughout rugby. They\u2019ve got every right to make the game safer and most players aren\u2019t intentionally trying to hurt each other.\u201d\n\nEngland travel to Tokyo on Sunday after the squad were given two days off following their second bonus-point win, against the USA on Thursday. Lawes came off the bench in that seven-try victory, having started against Tonga, and contributed to a dominant performance by England\u2019s forwards. They scored two tries from driving mauls \u2013 leading to some accusations of being boring \u2013 but Lawes says England are relishing \u201cstaying true to their roots\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s English rugby isn\u2019t it, and he [Eddie Jones] absolutely loves it,\u201d Lawes said. \u201cHe\u2019s made it clear to us that he wants us to be the best pack in the world and have the most dominant set-piece and that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving to do.\n\n\u201cHe knows what we\u2019re good at. It helps us play to our strengths which is great. We develop and we add things as we go along.\n\n\u201cMartin Johnson, Jason Leonard, Phil Vickery \u2013 they were big units, big scrummaging forwards. We are a bit more athletic now than back in the day but we still hold true to our roots.\u201d\n\nEngland face Argentina next Saturday in what is set to be their sternest test so far. The Pumas overcame Tonga 28-12 in Osaka on Saturday, with their hooker Juli\u00e1n Montoya scoring a hat-trick. \u201cIt\u2019s a great challenge for us,\u201d said Lawes. \u201cTwo big, strong set-piece based packs going up against each other. We very much welcome it and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a great spectacle.\u201d\n\nFrancis\u2019s potential ban aside, Jones is set to have a full squad to select from with Jack Nowell and Mako Vunipola in contention after their respective ankle and hamstring injuries. Lawes is competing with George Kruis, Maro Itoje and Joe Launchbury for one of two second-row spots and is not reading anything into the fact he started England\u2019s opening match of the campaign.\n\n\u201cAll of us as second rows come here wanting to be first choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s down to Eddie, whatever he thinks is best and what kind of form we\u2019re on. It might depend on who we play and when we play them. Eddie makes the decisions and he will do what is best for the team.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, France, England\u2019s final pool opponents, have lost the prop Demba Bamba for the rest of the tournament because of a thigh muscle injury he sustained during training.\n\nHow England\u2019s second-rows compare in Japan\n\nCourtney Lawes\n\nMatches 2\n\nRuns 8\n\nCarries 7\n\nMetres made 22\n\nTackles 10\n\nTackle success 83%\n\nJoe Launchbury\n\nMatches 1\n\nRuns 5\n\nCarries 4\n\nMetres made 5\n\nTackles 2\n\nTackle success 0%\n\nGeorge Kruis\n\nMatches 2\n\nRuns 9\n\nCarries 7\n\nMetres made 30\n\nTackles 8\n\nTackle success 73%\n\nMaro Itoje\n\nMatches 1\n\nRuns 8\n\nCarries 6\n\nMetres made 10\n\nTackles 15\n\nTackle success 88%", "description": "The England lock is not concerned about his side\u2019s tackling technique as they prepare to face Argentina", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/215195af118580bb9f36d0d4865ebd9b78fa4360/10_59_1261_756/master/1261.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=346c599ba28db102b0414f4533f997f3", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
