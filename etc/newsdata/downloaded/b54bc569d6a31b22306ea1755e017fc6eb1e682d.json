No doubt that during the formal meets between the two major economies of the world, only partial deal remained the final outcome, which may enhance the current uncertainty for even longer duration in near future; as China has started to look towards India as one of the major destinations to keep its own economy after locking its final deal on Sino-U.S. front.\n\nOn analysis of the movements of and , in different time frames, I find that strong opening on Friday amid growing hopes for expected top-level trade talks between the United States and China to result in a partial trade deal and delay planned U.S. tariff increases. No doubt that the investors look ready to take all risk over the positive outcome, which has resulted in a gap-up opening of S&P 500 on Friday, but every possibilities still looks still full of skepticism due to the following reasons:-\n\n1. Sudden tilt in President Donald Trump\u2019s final view even over the terms and conditions of the partial deal due to any counter condition by the Chinese delegation.\n\n2. Despite a strong opening still seems to be under stiff resistance at the level of 2989.\n\n3. Despite after a steep fall, have been still maintaining above the strong support at $1465; which confirms a strong reversal.\n\n4. look ready to show exhaustive move if they are not able to maintain above 2889.\n\n5. Finally, every move in U.S. equity markets still hope-based; which enhances the quantum of probabilities.\n\nS&P 500\n\nS&P 500 - Daily Chart\n\nS&P 500 - 4 Hr. Chart\n\nS&P 500 - 1 Hr. Chart\n\nOn domestic front, I find that despite the plethora of promises at Mallapuram formal meeting between the India\u2019s Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi and the Chinese President Mr. Xi Jinping; Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Saturday he had a free and frank discussion with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and would pursue proposals the two leaders discussed to improve bilateral ties. Secondly, the matter of great concern is bilateral trade between China and India reached $95.54 billion in 2018, with the trade deficit at $53 billion in China's favor, the biggest India has with any country.\n\nOn the other hand, down from 7.5%, warning that the \"severe\" slowdown could further weaken the country's stuttering financial sector. In its last forecast in April, the bank had said that India's economic outlook was strong and expected growth of 7.5% during the current fiscal year that began in April. But Asia's third-largest economy is currently growing at its slowest pace in six years, expanding by just 5% in the April-June quarter, hit by flagging consumer demand and a slackening in government spending.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the quantum of volatility may grow in Indian equity markets, but the overall trend will remain bearish due to growing slowdown worries in different sectors of the Indian economy. I find that the and may find stiff resistance on every upward move, but the opening level and afterward moves will define the real impact of these partial trade deals within the first two trading sessions of this week. Secondly, the steady still look evident to show the growing weakness in global equity markets.
