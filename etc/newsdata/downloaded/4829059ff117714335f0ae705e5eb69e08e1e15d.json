And so begins another contentious debate.\n\nThroughout our nation\u2019s history, Americans have had a love-hate relationship with the national debt. Alexander Hamilton insisted that debt was the price of liberty. Without it, the young country would be unable to protect itself from foreign threats.\n\nYet, throughout much of U.S. history, many Americans regarded debt itself as a threat, to individual freedoms. The ability to raise debt was linked directly to power, and debt issued to finance the nation\u2019s defense was viewed as particularly dangerous\u2014a way to enrich \u201cmonied interests\u201d and increase the power of government at the expense of everyone else.\n\nTo impede this potential for abuse, the Constitution vested the power to take on debt and regulate currency with the people\u2014through Congress. As a Congressman during the 1790s, James Madison argued that debt and spending were equally important issues and should be debated separately, rather than rolled together in a single bill. Moreover, he felt that to not manage debt would have be an abdication of Congress\u2019s role representing the people.\n\nDuring our nation\u2019s first 130 years, Congress authorized debt as needed to meet the challenges of the day. Government debt financed revenue shortfalls derived from wars, economic recessions or even infrastructure investments.\n\nThe big difference from modern times is that, back then, once the challenge precipitating the debt was resolved, Congress turned its attention to debt eradication.\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson believed that repaying debt was a symbol that the nation could sustain independence. After the Civil War, Congress turned to paying off the national debt, which eventually fell from 32 percent of GDP in 1869 to 5 percent in 1916.\n\nBut America\u2019s aversion to government debt changed throughout the 20th Century. At the forefront of this change were three major developments: the enactment of the first permanent income tax; the creation of the Federal Reserve and the onset of World War I.\n\nThe income tax created a new source of internal revenue to finance new debt. Previously, tariffs had been the main avenue for paying down debt. At the same time, countries like the U.S. who were on the international gold standard had to pay off debts to maintain the standard.\n\nThe Federal Reserve system created domestic demand for debt by standing ready to purchase Treasury debt.\n\nAnd World War I created a significant demand for money. President Wilson vowed to protect future generations from being saddled by burdensome war debt by limiting federal borrowing to no more than half of the war\u2019s cost. In the end, however, public debt financed almost 60 percent of the war effort, while money creation financed an additional 20 percent of the costs.\n\nIt was at this time that Congress began to turn over debt management to the executive branch. The First Liberty Loan Act of 1917 gave Treasury the authority to raise money by replacing specified debt authorizations with new limits on bonds and certificates of indebtedness (also called \u201cwar savings certificates\u201d).\n\nFour additional bills enacted between 1917 and 1919 imposed an aggregate limit on bonds and authorized Treasury to continue issuing certificates of indebtedness as long as their outstanding balance didn\u2019t exceed a specified amount.\n\nIn 1935, Congress combined the limit on new issues of Treasury notes into a single revolving ceiling. Three years later, it established a new overall limit on bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness and other forms of government debt. A second limit was placed on bonds to restrict the government\u2019s ability to incur long-run liabilities, but that was replaced a year later with an overall limit on public debt.\n\nSince then, the debt limit has become the flashpoint for many political battles. By 1953, the Senate used the debt limit authorization as leverage to get President Eisenhower and the House to accept more than 500 amendments to tax and appropriations bills.\n\nOver the last 10 years, however, several things have changed. Importantly, the debt limit isn\u2019t a limit at all. Since 2013, Congress has \u201csuspended\u201d the debt limit\u2014effectively giving Treasury unlimited borrowing authority for a period of time. It is the abdication of responsibility that Madison so rightly feared. Meanwhile, some in Congress have considered eliminating the debt limit altogether.\n\nSuspending the debt limit has been a mistake. Congress should reform the limit to impose additional controls on long-term debt.\n\nIt is unlikely, and wouldn\u2019t be smart, to go back to a pre-1917 system where Congress micromanages debt. But Congress must not continue on its current trajectory of ceding its authority to raise debt. To do so would threaten to upend the balance of power, both within our government and between the people and their government.", "description": "Last Friday Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steven Mnuchin\u00a0asked Congress to\u00a0increase the debt limit.
