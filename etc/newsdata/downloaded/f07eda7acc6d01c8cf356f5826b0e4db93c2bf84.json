Of the trends, in 81 of 288 Assembly seats available, BJP was leading in 26, Shiv Sena in 22, while opposition Congress was ahead in seven seats and NCP in 17.\n\n\n\nIn Haryana, the ruling BJP was hovering around the majority mark of 46 in the 90-member Assembly. The latest trends also showed that the Congress was ahead in 29 constituencies, the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) in 8 and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in 3.\n\n\n\nElections were held to the legislative assemblies of Maharashtra (288 seats) and Haryana (90 seats) in a single phase on October 21. The BJP is in power presently in both states - on its own in Haryana, and with minor partner Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\nIn Maharashtra, the most crucial battleground is the Konkan division along the west coast which constitutes 76 seats. This includes Mumbai's 36 seats. Among the interesting contests this time are: Bal Thackeray's grandson Aaditya Thackeray from Worli, CM Fadnavis from Nagpur South West, former CM Ashok Chavan from Bhokar, Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit from Baramati and grand-nephew Rohit from Karjat Jamkhed.\n\n\n\nIn the opposite camp, the Congress is in a bit of churn with leaders sidelined or eased out. Milind Deora had to quit, Sanjay Nirupam was sidelined, and former CM Ashok Chavan is fighting to stay relevant.\n\n\n\nIn Haryana too, the ruling BJP is comfortably placed because of infighting in the Congress and a succession battle in Devi Lal's INLD.\n\n\n\nIn this state the BJP was barely in the picture till about 10 years ago. Among the interesting contests here are: CM Manohar Lal Khattar in Karnal and Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Garhi Sampla Kiloi.\n\n\n\nKhattar's rival, former CM Bhupinder Hooda, who has had a rough time of late in the Congress, will be keen to prove a point. The saffron party has brought together the non-Jat castes under its fold, upsetting the Jat-focussed politics of Congress and INLD. Among the national issues being debated, the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir seems to be working for the BJP.\n\n\n\nKeep watching this page for the latest election updates.\n\n", "description": "Assembly Elections 2019: Get Vidhan Sabha Elections 2019, Assembly election date, News & updates.
