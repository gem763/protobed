REUTERS/Stringer\n\nTurkey has been poised to advance into northeast Syria since the U.S. troops began vacating the area in an abrupt policy shift by U.S. President Donald Trump widely criticised in Washington as a betrayal of America\u2019s allies, the Kurds.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkish officials told Reuters that the military had struck the Syrian-Iraqi border to prevent Kurdish forces using the route to reinforce the region, though details of the strikes were hazy.\n\nPresident Erdogan\u2019s aide Fahrettin Altun said that fighters from the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria could either defect or Ankara would have to \u201cstop them from disrupting\u201d Turkey\u2019s struggle against the Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly,\u201d Altun said in a tweet extracted from a column written by him which was published in the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cTurkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,\u201d the column said.Turkey has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in order to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil, but the scheme has alarmed some Western allies as much as the risks posed by the military operation itself.\n\nFor Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria as terrorists because of their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey, an influx of non-Kurdish Syrians would help it secure a buffer against its main security threat.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from the area will leave Kurdish-led forces long allied to Washington vulnerable to attack by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK).\n\nErdogan will visit the United States on Nov. 13 at Trump\u2019s invitation, a White House spokesman said. On Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw after a phone call he had with Trump, adding that talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would continue.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\u201d U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington\u2019s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, said it was not told in advance by Washington or Turkey about any agreements to pull U.S. troops.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nSHIFTING ALLEGIANCES\n\nKurdish-led forces have denounced the U.S. policy shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nSignalling a further potential shift in the region\u2019s power balance, the Kurdish-led forces said they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. withdrawal.\n\nTrump denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it acted \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria.\n\nNear the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad, a Reuters witness saw howitzers placed behind earth embankments on Turkey\u2019s side of the border, pointed towards Syria.\n\nSome 60 km (40 miles) to the west, multiple launch rocket systems mounted on two trucks were deployed behind earth embankments near Suruc, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani. Artillery was also stationed in the area, and soldiers wandered around a nearby military camp.\n\nMustafa Bali of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the Turkish military buildup, together with information about further mobilisation of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that \u201can attack is imminent\u201d.", "description": "Turkish forces, together with the rebel Free Syrian Army, will cross the Syrian border \"shortly\", President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s communications director said early on Wednesday, as a surprise withdrawal of U.S. troops made way for the Turkish incursion.", "authors": ["Ece Toksabay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438696192&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98040", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
