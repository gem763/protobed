Converting all of them at an average cost would have a price tag of more than $200 billion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nStill, PG&E said that it converts \"many miles\" of lines from overhead to underground each year. But the company is not usually on the hook for the cost. Property owners can band together to pay for a conversion, and developers can pay for the installation and other related costs for underground power lines as well.\n\nIf a city or county decides to install underground power lines, customer electric rates fund the projects after construction is complete.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWhen asked what PG&E could have done to avoid needing to shut off power, spokesman Paul Doherty told FOX Business, \"Our ongoing and expanded efforts include further enhancing vegetation management around power lines, conducting accelerated safety inspections of electric infrastructure in high fire-threat areas, and hardening our electric system.\"", "description": "Underground power lines can costs millions of dollars per mile.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/california-fire-AP-003.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
