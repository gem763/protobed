Ireland were bowled out for 38 in their second innings in just 15.4 overs - the second lowest total in Test match history Action Images via Reuters\n\nRosalind Bragg, director of Maternity Action, said: \u201cThe NHS still sometimes charges for miscarriages and stillbirths. It is an appalling practice. We are very concerned about women receiving bills for miscarriages shortly afterwards. This affects their engagement with bereavement services.\n\n\u201cIt is also not uncommon for women to be fined twice due to changing hospitals. Many of the women who are charged are very vulnerable and don\u2019t have secure housing \u2013 as a result, they receive care from more than one hospital and receive more than one bill. The problematic practice of charging means women receive bills months and years after they have given birth. We regularly find women getting bills several years after they received the care.\u201d\n\nMaternity Action, which provides legal support to women, says women who encounter these issues can contact hospital staff to explain they have been wrongly charged but are often too vulnerable to navigate a complex bureaucratic system. The organisation notes women often receive bills which are unclear and do not specify the treatment for which they have been charged.\n\nMs Bragg said they routinely come across women who have been wrongly charged when they are in fact entitled to free antenatal care \u2013 adding these women are often family members of EU nationals.\n\n\u201cYou have hospital staff whose experience is in low-level admin roles being expected to do immigration law,\u201d the campaigner said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Women are isolating themselves from services. It is not uncommon for women to arrive at hospitals after they have attempted to give birth at home and had problems. It is very dangerous. We don\u2019t have the numbers of women who are pregnant and destitute however there are significant numbers of women in this situation.\u201d\n\nThe campaigner said she suspected there may be people working as informal midwives helping pregnant migrants but noted it was difficult to track them down due to it being a criminal offence to provide clandestine unofficial birth care.\n\nMaternity Action is calling for the immediate suspension of the NHS charging policy pending a full and independent review of its impact \u2013 as well as arguing debt from maternity care should not affect future immigration applications.\n\nClaire van Nispen tot Pannerden, women\u2019s and children\u2019s health lead at Doctors of the World UK, said it was \u201cvery unfair\u201d and \u201ctraumatising\u201d for women who have endured miscarriages to be incorrectly charged for giving birth.\n\n\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t always check the quality of pregnancy, it just sends out bills,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have had a miscarriage, it is very distressing to receive a bill.\u201d\n\nThe doctor, who works at a weekly clinic for migrant women in east London, added: \u201cSome of the women know about the hostile environment and are afraid of accessing healthcare services out of fear of being reported to the Home Office or deported. A lot of these women have no support from others. Many women are sent a bill during their pregnancy. It tends to be more than \u00a37,000 and it tends to be a big shock. They feel afraid and they worry. They have a huge dilemma. They often have no income at all.\u201d\n\nShe said she advises women to focus on their pregnancy and not think about the bill until after they have given birth but many struggled to take this advice and anxiety about payment hung over their pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe charging makes the experience of pregnancy more stressful,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cA significant number of the pregnant women we see disappear and go uncontactable. We also come across women who have had bad experiences in frontline antenatal care. Everyone is entitled to have an interpreter and sometimes it is not organised.\u201d\n\nJennie Corbett, UK policy & advocacy officer for Doctors of the World UK, noted many women who are affected by the charging system do not have a legal right to work in the UK.\n\nShe said: \u201cA lot of our patients are fearful of their rights of approaching the NHS as an arm of the state. After having an appointment they will have a letter about charges they can\u2019t pay. If you do not pay these debts within two months, this will be passed on to Home Office and it will affect your immigration status.\n\n\u201cThe rule is if a patient is in debt of over \u00a3500 after two months to the NHS they are reported to the Home Office as this debt could influence immigration application \u2013 and in the reporting of that debt there is also an exchange of the patients information which identifies name and address \u2013 which can be used for immigration enforcement.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS will never refuse maternity care, regardless of whether someone can pay.\n\n\u201cWe recently invested \u00a31m to expand a team of NHS experts to help hospitals understand cost-recovery rules and exemptions consistently, making clear that urgent treatment \u2013 including all maternity services - should never be withheld.\n\n\u201cEvery taxpayer supports the health service and so it is only right that overseas visitors contribute towards their treatment costs but exemptions are in place to protect vulnerable people who receive care free of charge.\u201d", "description": "Migrant women who have miscarriages are being wrongly charged\u00a0\u00a37,000 for antenatal care despite never going into labour, doctors and campaigners have warned.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/25/12/pregnant-woman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
