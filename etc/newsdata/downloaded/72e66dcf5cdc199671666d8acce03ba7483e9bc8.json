So that will be another challenge for us.\n\n\u201cJack Conan, unfortunately Jack Conan has a fracture in his foot. And he will return home to Ireland tomorrow.\n\n\u201cRob Kearney has got a decent shiner, but he\u2019s feeling okay now.\n\n\u201cHe failed his HIA (head injury assessment) as far a I know. If he doesn\u2019t pass HIA two and three he will be a confirmed concussion and he would miss the Russia match.\u201d\n\nJapan shocked the world for the second time in four years, adding this superlative victory over the globe\u2019s number-two ranked side to their 34-32 win over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWing Kenki Fukuoka sealed Japan\u2019s famous win, racing into the left corner and flooring a stunned Ireland side.\n\nJack Carty had a hand in tries for Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney as Ireland edged into a 12-3 lead, but that control evaporated.\n\nJapan wound up dominating both the loose and tight exchanges, even taking control in the scrum\n\nIreland boss Schmidt in midweek branded referee Angus Gardner\u2019s performance \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d the last time the Australian had officiated his side, in the 25-7 loss to Wales in March that sealed the 2019 Grand Slam for Warren Gatland\u2019s men.\n\nAnd in the wake of this loss, Schmidt was again left to lament a referee with whom Ireland cannot seem to get to grips.\n\nAsked about the officiating in Shizuoka, Schmidt said: \u201cWe\u2019ll go back and have a look at it. I certainly understand the frustrations of some of our players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too dissimilar from the last time we had this referee. We\u2019ll make our comments to the referee body rather than make any public comment.\n\nPA", "description": "Joe Schmidt has challenged Ireland\u00a0to reassert their class by hitting back immediately after suffering one of the all-time World Cup shock defeats by Japan.
