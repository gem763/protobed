Nearly 1 in 4 such voters approve of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, per a CBS News poll. And almost half of GOP voters either want to \u201cwait and see the facts\u201d or already think Trump has done something wrong.\n\nMost surprisingly, support impeachment has risen 8% among Republicans since May, according to a new poll from CNN.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sarah Isgur", "Cnn.Com Opinions Trump-Whistleblower-Access-Hollywood-Opinion-Isgur Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
