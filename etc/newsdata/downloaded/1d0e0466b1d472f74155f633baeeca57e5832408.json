The composite samples will be on board the space station for half a year, enduring tests that subject them to temperatures ranging from -40 to over 200 degrees Celsius, as well as extreme amounts of ultraviolet radiation and gamma rays. When the samples return to Earth, Lamborghini and the Houston Methodist Research Institute will study how the materials have changed over their stay in space.\n\nThe samples are scheduled to launch into space on November 2.", "description": "Lamborghini is\u00a0collaborating with the International Space Station to study the effects of\u00a0extreme stress on five different composite materials.
