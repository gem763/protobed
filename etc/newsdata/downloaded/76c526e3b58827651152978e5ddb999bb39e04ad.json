Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Tuesday refused to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans in order to pay for Medicare for All \u2014 which she called the \u201cgold standard\u201d \u2014 telling the audience that \u201ccosts\u201d will go down for middle-class Americans.\n\nModerators at the fourth Democrat debate asked the Massachusetts senator if she would raise taxes on the middle class to fund Medicare for All \u2014 which she called the \u201cgold standard\u201d \u2014 and she once again refused to answer the question directly.\n\nInstead, Warren went to her go-to talking point, arguing that overcall costs will go up for the \u201cwealthy and big corporations\u201d and go down for middle-class families.\n\nWarren boasted of the families she has talked to around the country \u2014 individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and cancer \u2014 and said they had great health insurance \u201cright at the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then they found out when they really needed it when the costs went up, the insurance company pulled the rug right from underneath them and they were left with nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe moderator reminded Warren that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who also supports Medicare for All, admitted that taxes will go up for middle-class Americans in order to pay for the program.\n\nWarren would not explicitly say if she would raise taxes and said once again, \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for the middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d she added.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg (D) called out Warren\u2019s ambiguous answer.\n\n\u201cWell, you heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said.", "description": "Sen.
