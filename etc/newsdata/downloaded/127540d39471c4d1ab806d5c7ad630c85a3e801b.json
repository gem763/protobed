It\u2019s the long-awaited Surface phone that has been rumored for years, and in a further surprise, it\u2019s running Google\u2019s Android operating system. It\u2019s designed to be the smaller sibling to the Surface Neo, a dual-screen device that was also unveiled yesterday running Windows 10X.\n\nThe Surface Duo has two 5.6-inch displays that fold out into an 8.3-inch overall screen, and it\u2019s just 4.8mm thin. You can fold it fully over like many 2-in-1 laptops, thanks to a 360-degree hinge. Microsoft says it\u2019s committed to dual-screen devices because they allow people to get more done on the go.\n\nI got a chance to take a closer look at the Surface Duo this week, and my first impression was simple: it\u2019s so much smaller in person than it appears in photos. I wasn\u2019t allowed to play around with the software on this device, but I was able to slip it into my jeans pocket, and it\u2019s definitely the first pocketable Surface device. It looks and feels like a miniature tablet that\u2019s also a phone.\n\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t consider this a phone, though. \u201cI feel like \u2018phone\u2019 is such a limiting word,\u201d says Microsoft chief product officer Panos Panay. \u201cAnd then you say, \u2018well, smartphone.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know what that means. And then \u2018phablet.\u2019 I\u2019m not sure what that is. I think if you\u2019re going to create a new category, you\u2019re going to try to change things, push things forward. The minute you put it in a box, I think you\u2019re lost. So I\u2019ve been pretty resistant to that. Not because it doesn\u2019t act like a great phone.\u201d\n\nPhone or tablet debate aside, the hardware isn\u2019t really the star of the show. It\u2019s extremely surprising to see Microsoft launch both Android- and Windows-powered devices that are dual-screen and share the same design. Microsoft is using Android on the Surface Duo, which might sound surprising, but it\u2019s realistically the company\u2019s only choice if it wants to build a pocket-sized device that can replace your phone.\n\nPanay admits that\u2019s precisely why the Surface Duo runs Android. \u201cWell, because those are the apps you want,\u201d says Panay. \u201cBecause there\u2019s hundreds of thousands of apps, and you want them. And [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] and I talked about it, and it\u2019s about meeting our customers where they are, where they\u2019re going to be. I don\u2019t think the mobile application platform\u2019s going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. Like, literally, you need the apps.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong. Microsoft tried and failed to capture developer and consumer attention with Windows Phone, and it just couldn\u2019t get the market share needed to compete with the dominance of iOS and Android. So it\u2019s embracing Android fully with its own Surface hardware, just like it has been gradually embracing Android as the mobile equivalent of Windows in recent years.\n\nThe decision will trigger a number of questions around the future of Windows, Microsoft\u2019s efforts with Android, and much more. Microsoft has partnered with Google for dual-screen devices, and the company appears to want to create some type of API layer on top of Android. That will require deep integration, and it means Microsoft is contributing code to Android as well. That could mean Microsoft\u2019s future, like its work on Chromium, is built on Google\u2019s code, but Panay doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,\u201d says Panay in response to the possibility of Android being the future for Microsoft. \u201cYou want to give customers what they want in the form factor that they\u2019re using. We\u2019ve learned this \u2014 let\u2019s put the right operating system on the wrong product or the other way around. But what\u2019s the right operating system for the form factor? And in this case, on mobile devices, Android\u2019s the obvious choice, But anything [bigger than] that, Windows is everything.\u201d\n\nPanay says Microsoft has been working on the Surface Duo hardware for three years, so this isn\u2019t an immediate reaction to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold, Huawei\u2019s Mate X, or anything else. The company has opted for two separate glass displays instead of folding plastic, and it\u2019s clear Microsoft thinks this is the way forward until foldable display technology is really ready. Panay says the hardware won\u2019t change between now and when the device launches, although there\u2019s a Snapdragon 855 processor inside right now that could be upgraded to Qualcomm\u2019s latest next year. There\u2019s also no camera on the outside of the device, and the idea is that you use the one included above the display to shoot pictures by flipping the display over.\n\nSo what exactly does Android on the Surface Duo give you that a regular smartphone isn\u2019t capable of? Microsoft showed off some examples of dragging and dropping content between apps and displays on the Duo, and Panay hints that the company could use Project xCloud to have a game running on one side and a controller on the other. But it\u2019s really early for the software side of things, and Microsoft hasn\u2019t figured out every scenario just yet.\n\nBut that\u2019s why the company announced the Surface Duo and Surface Neo a year before they\u2019ll ship. Microsoft needs developers to support its dual-screen ambitions, and it wants to get the Surface Duo and Neo devices out there so that apps can be created for when they arrive in late 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we did the right thing or wrong thing, but we do want to inspire developers,\u201d says Panay. But what he will say is that \u201cThe hardware won\u2019t change at all,\u201d between now and when the device ships next year.\n\nThe real question is: what happens when devices the size of this Surface Duo are capable of supporting screen sizes as big as the Surface Neo and beyond? A smartphone that converts into a tablet, a laptop, and even a full PC with a dock has long been the sci-fi dream of the future, and it\u2019s entirely possible we\u2019ll get a device that attempts this in the next decade. What if a Surface Duo running Android is so successful that Microsoft wants to make a slightly larger one that runs up against the Surface Neo running Windows 10X?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that,\u201d says Panay. \u201cAnything bigger in between Neo and Duo, I think, is stuck.\u201d Microsoft has spent years looking at different screen sizes, with considerable amounts of research backing its decisions. \u201cEventually we got to, \u2018What are people going to do? What\u2019s the right size? And what\u2019s the biggest we can make it but still make it as small as it can be?\u2019 And I know that sounds like a kind of oxymoron, but that was the push. We found the design point of where I think the largest product can be in the mobile space. That\u2019s what I believe. And so I could be wrong, but I also look at my road map, and we\u2019re not looking at anything bigger than this. We found the design point of where I think the largest product can be in the mobile space.\u201d\n\nSo that leaves the question of when it will ship, and what the pricing will be. Pressed on ship dates, Panay says \u201cwe\u2019ve got probably a couple more months [before developers are] going to have their hands on it and be running,\u201d but he won\u2019t talk about pricing at all except to say people will be \u201csuper happy,\u201d clarifying that \u201cwhen I say happy, I think the value of the product you get for how much you\u2019re paying, it\u2019s there, and that\u2019s what matters to customers.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft announced a lot of new hardware this week, and it\u2019s starting to feel like the company has a Surface device for nearly everyone. There\u2019s now a Surface Duo phone that does slightly more than a regular smartphone, with an extra display thrown in, and a Surface Neo or Surface Pro if you want to go from a tablet-like device to a laptop. There are giant displays like the Surface Hub 2, or unique all-in-one PCs like the Surface Studio. Microsoft is even covering the bases of accessories with its Surface Headphones and Surface Earbuds.\n\nSurface started out as a futuristic table before Microsoft launched its tablet and laptop hybrid, and it\u2019s now so much more. It\u2019s Microsoft trying to be innovative, chasing what it thinks will be the next major hardware form factor shift and trying to have a software and developer ecosystem in place when it goes mainstream.\n\nMicrosoft will now need to convince app developers and consumers that these dual-screen devices are truly the new device category we\u2019ve all been waiting for. However things end up, Surface is no longer just a tablet that\u2019s also a laptop. It\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s idea of the future.\n\nUpdate: Added quotes from Panos Panay on pricing and ship date, and noting that the hardware won\u2019t change.", "description": "Microsoft is embracing Android for its new Surface phone.
