(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nOn a recent tour of the remnants of the Barry Farm public housing complex in Southeast Washington, historians rattled off reasons the city should landmark the property, including that hundreds of freed slaves settled there after the Civil War.\n\nWill Harvey, 39, a former Barry Farm resident, recognized his own personal landmarks as he followed along.\n\nHere was where a friend was shot in the back, he said, pointing to a spot a few yards from where he once lived, a now vacant, dilapidated duplex behind a chain-link construction fence on Stevens Road SE. Another buddy was killed down the street, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was like Iraq around here,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cYou get PTSD.\u201d\n\nAs the nation\u2019s capital, Washington is a city of iconic American landmarks that draws tourists from far and wide. The city also has a slew of local markers of more debatable stature, places such as Barry Farm Dwellings, which a coalition of former residents and community organizers are lobbying the city to designate a landmark.\n\nWith a District review board scheduled to vote on the nomination Sept. 26, the administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) is opposing the designation, in part because it could impede a plan to build 1,100 mixed-income housing units and retail on the Ward 8 site. Officials hope the project would help invigorate a historically poor and blighted area.\n\n\n\nResidents at the Barry Farm public housing complex have moved out and about half the buildings have been razed as the city moves to redevelop it into mixed-income housing and retail. A group opposed to the redevelopment is seeking historic protection for the roughly 30 remaining structures on the site in Southeast Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThe District Housing Authority has already relocated nearly 200 families that lived at Barry Farm Dwellings to make way for the redevelopment and demolished more than 30 of the complex\u2019s two-story buildings.\n\nThe developer was forced to hold off on razing 32 remaining buildings after the nomination to landmark Barry Farm was submitted in April. Opponents of the historic designation say the proponents are using the nomination process to create another hurdle for the development \u2014 a contention the advocates deny.\n\nAt a time when developers are transforming neighborhoods across the city, those who favor landmarking of Barry Farm argue it is essential to enshrine symbols of black culture in the District, including remnants of a public housing complex once regarded as among the city\u2019s more violent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing so much of our history,\u201d said Parisa Norouzi, executive director of Empower DC, a grass-roots organization lobbying to landmark Barry Farm. \u201cOur humble history is as important as our grand history.\u201d\n\nGreta Fuller, a founding member of the Historic Anacostia Preservation Society, describes herself as a supporter of the redevelopment project, but she said the remaining buildings should be saved \u201cto tell the story\u201d of Barry Farm, from its 19th-century origins through its more notorious recent past, a story that she regards as intrinsic to the broader history of Washington.\n\nFuller said she is not dissuaded by the fact that, as District officials have asserted, none of the original houses occupied by freed slaves remain on the property. Nor is she bothered that the surviving public housing units \u2014 built during World War II \u2014 no longer look the same and are now largely uninhabitable.\n\nMore than a plaque is needed to commemorate Barry Farm\u2019s past, she said.\n\n\u201cIf you wipe it out, if you bring it all down, how many people are really going to get the feeling and understand?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere\u2019s something about walking through a structure and feeling that structure. How many people walk by plaques without reading them?\u201d\n\nReferring to the violence that often defined Barry Farm in more recent years, she said the complex\u2019s troubled history should be included in any commemoration. \u201cSometimes we need to tell the story of the uncomfortableness to show how we have grown and where we are today,\u201d she said.\n\nRobinette Woodland, a local Advisory Neighborhood Commission member whose aunt lived at Barry Farm, said she agrees that the developer should honor the site\u2019s 19th-century history.\n\nWoodland, 45, a telephone technician whose brother is Will Harvey, dismissed the notion of preserving buildings that are a reminder \u201cof all the murders that took place over there, the drive-bys and the drug dealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to be torn down,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would we want to keep that? Let\u2019s let it go. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\nRedeveloping Barry Farm\n\nOn a Wednesday night earlier this month, Ronette Slamin, a senior project manager overseeing the Barry Farm redevelopment, told a Ward 8 audience that the developer planned to incorporate art exhibits, oral histories and path markers, among other things, to celebrate the property\u2019s history.\n\nBut preserving the buildings that are the focus of the landmark nomination is virtually impossible because of disrepair, she said. In a Power Point presentation, she showed photos of surviving units with mold and gaping holes in walls.\n\n\u201cThe history is in the stories, not in the buildings in their current conditions,\u201d said Slamin, of Preservation of Affordable Housing, a development company working with A&R Development on the project.\n\nHer remarks prompted Ronald Thompson, 21, who described himself as a grass-roots organizer, to stand and accuse the developer of disrespecting the community by dismissing the buildings \u2014 no matter their condition.\n\n\u201cA space where people live is where people build their stories,\u201d Thompson said, later adding: \u201cHistory is in those stories. But history is also in those buildings. You wouldn\u2019t say that to a white person in Dupont Circle.\u201d\n\nBarry Farm has been a potent symbol of African American life in Washington since 1867 when the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau bought 375 acres of Julia and David Barry\u2019s tobacco farm to sell parcels to blacks migrating from plantations. The profits helped fund African American institutions such as Howard University.\n\nWithin a few years, hundreds of black families \u2014 Frederick Douglass\u2019s three sons, among them \u2014 were living at Barry Farm, creating what the District\u2019s Historic Preservation Office recently described as a \u201cthriving, self-contained African American community.\u201d\n\nFacing a shortage of affordable housing in the early 1940s, the federal government built more than 400 units of public housing at Barry Farm, the largest subsidized development at the time.\n\nUntil the developer began demolishing Barry Farm last year, the buildings remained, though their exteriors were refaced and porches removed during a massive 1980s renovation that District officials cite to argue against a landmark designation.\n\nWhile \u201cdirectly associated with the development of public housing for African Americans during World War II \u2014 a significant event in the urban planning architecture and social history of the District \u2014 the buildings do not retain sufficient integrity to convey the values and qualities for which the property is judged significant,\u201d the Historic Preservation Office wrote to the review panel in June.\n\nNevertheless, Derek Hyra, an American University public administration and policy professor, said Barry Farm \u2014 even its vestiges \u2014 has grown in significance over time as the city\u2019s black population has declined and lost political power in the District.\n\nThe debate over Barry Farm, as well as other historically black neighborhoods, has \u201cbecome a battle ground to preserve the legacy of African Americans in this city,\u201d said Hyra, who has studied gentrification of the U Street corridor and Shaw. \u201cHow do you upgrade the area while keeping the historical legacy? If you do that, it minimizes the cultural displacement. I\u2019m not sure the city is thinking about that.\u201d\n\nIn addition to housing the poor, Barry Farm over the years became known for hosting the Goodman Basketball League during summers, which has drawn large crowds and visits from NBA stars such as Kevin Durant.\n\nThe complex also earned a reputation for blight and violence. On Christmas Eve morning in 2013, as a television news crew filmed, someone fired a pellet gun at a man dressed as Santa Claus, striking him in the back during an annual toy giveaway.\n\nBy then, the District had included Barry Farm in its New Communities initiative, a plan to break up concentrated poverty by redeveloping public housing projects as mixed-income communities with retail and other amenities.\n\nThe plan to redevelop Barry Farm suffered a setback last year when the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated a zoning commission approval of the project, contending that the panel had not given adequate consideration to the potential displacement of residents.\n\nAs the development team reworked its plan, a group of former tenants, aided by Empower DC, filed the nomination to landmark the remaining Barry Farm buildings.\n\nUnder the current proposal, about 1,100 units of mixed-income housing would be built, including 380 units of public housing to replace the 444 units that would be demolished. Anthony Waddell, a vice president for development at Preservation of Affordable Housing, declined requests to talk about the project.\n\nDesignating the remaining 32 buildings a landmark would limit what could be built and \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce the project\u2019s affordable housing units, said Angie Rogers, a senior Bowser adviser overseeing the project. It would also diminish the number of family-sized apartments, she said.\n\nThe timing of the landmark nomination \u2014 six years after the Housing Authority picked the development team \u2014 has fueled suggestions that proponents are using the process to seek leverage for demands that include additional public housing units.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another form of trying to stop progress,\u201d said Rhonda Edwards-Hines, president of the Barry Farm Resident Council and a supporter of the redevelopment project. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do this earlier? Now that they see it\u2019s coming to pass, that the buildings are going to come up, now they\u2019re trying to stop it.\u201d\n\nDetrice Belt, a former Barry Farm resident and a leader of the campaign to landmark the remaining buildings, denied that the nomination was a delay tactic and said she only learned in recent months that seeking historic status was an option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting the facts in and learning to do everything,\u201d she said on a recent Saturday as Empower DC organizers and the historians led the tour of Barry Farm.\n\nAlong the way, the tour guides pointed out that Barry Farm\u2019s former residents included prominent tenant and school desegregation activists, as well as musician Herb Feemster, of Peaches and Herb, whose hits included \u201cReunited\u201d and \u201cShake Your Groove Thing.\u201d In 1967, they said, Black Panther Stokely Carmichael convened a meeting of community organizers at Barry Farm.\n\nAs he listened, Preston Grays, 31, who attended the tour to show his support for preserving Barry Farm, said the complex \u201csymbolizes the culture of Southeast. If they erase this, it will change the look and feel of Southeast.\u201d\n\nWill Harvey said he was more concerned about whether former Barry Farm families would return to the property than saving buildings, the sight of which he said still \u201ccauses me some kind of euphoria \u2014 and makes me think about a lot of stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to think about it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s there.\u201d", "description": "Bowser administration opposes historic designation for Barry Farm Dwellings on property that once hosted freed slaves.", "authors": ["Paul Schwartzman", "Reporter Specializing In Political Profiles", "Narratives About Life", "Death", "Everything In Between", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lsnOtEQy9rxi8E-aXZeWhLayJco=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KOFBCXGNXII6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
