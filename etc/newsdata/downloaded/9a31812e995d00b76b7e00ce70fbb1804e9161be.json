What does she have in store for her Turbine Hall commission? We meet the artist in her Brooklyn studio\n\nBefore I set out to meet Kara Walker at her studio in Brooklyn, she texts me a warning. \u201cI may be a little hungover, I guess.\u201d Her honesty, even on a small matter like this, is affecting. It makes you want to be candid too. \u201cI\u2019m jetlagged,\u201d I text back. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll even out.\u201d\n\nNext month, Walker will become the fifth artist to take on the Hyundai commission at Tate Modern \u2013 creating a large, site-specific work in the vast Turbine Hall that\u2019s bound to get people chattering about black art, continuing the success of such grand London exhibitions as Soul of a Nation, about the black power era in the US, and Get Up, Stand Up Now, which celebrated black British culture over the past 50 years.\n\nWalker\u2019s work immediately calls into question what black art could and should be, and whether it should even be categorised in such a way. Her work is about power, pain and pleasure, often told through the framework of black characters caught in subservient, perverse relationships and existences in the antebellum, or pre-civil war, American south. Born in 1969 in Stockton, California, Walker plunged into notoriety in the 1990s after studying at Rhode Island School of Design. Viewed as a whipsmart upstart, she made controversial cut-paper silhouettes of black figures that arguably played into racist caricatures \u2013 and won her the MacArthur Foundation\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d award in 1997.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sphinx \u2026 A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby, an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant. Photograph: Kara Walker\n\nBut her craft, almost always monochrome, extends to etching, sketching and even sugarwork. She is now perhaps best known for A Subtlety, the completely unsubtle, giant, curvaceous sugar sphinx she constructed in 2014 at a disused sugar factory in Brooklyn, which drew such visitors as Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. The most consistent aspect of her work is its ability to latch on to you and unsettle you. The pouted lips of a black woman may be slightly engorged, the head of a baby rolling its eyes back might be slipping out of a vagina, a slave may be poised to chop off an arm. They\u2019re like the unwanted, distressing thoughts that burrow into your head at night-time.\n\nWhen Walker greets me at the door of her huge, industrial studio, she is warm and accommodating. I\u2019m immediately confronted by one of her biggest works, the towering Katastw\u00f3f Karavan. A beast of a thing, created as part of the Prospect.4 triennial in New Orleans, it once sat on the banks of the Mississippi and depicts a particularly ominous scene of dancing, marching figures draped in vegetation. Next to the Karavan, Walker is petite, wearing a slick of iridescent blue eyeliner. Her trousers match her eyes \u2013 blue and tight. Her afro, speckled with silver, is tied into small, tight crops of curls.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Katastw\u00f3f Karavan \u2026 her steam calliope organ with marching figures. Photograph: Kara Walker\n\nWe sit in the small outside garden, our interview soundtracked by the faint rustling of papery-leaved trees and the unsettling whine of New York\u2019s emergency services. She speaks with deep pauses, and her voice sometimes fades into the air, letting you fill in the gaps of thoughts that aren\u2019t always fully formed. Her laugh is unexpectedly huge and enticing.\n\n\u201cThe Turbine Hall is like a grand prize,\u201d says Walker. \u201cYou\u2019ve been offered this gargantuan space and it\u2019s all yours. It\u2019s irresistible.\u201d Walker learned she would be taking over this 85ft tall hall last year. The first black woman to do so, she will be walking in the footsteps of such artists as Ai Weiwei, who filled the hall with porcelain sunflower seeds in 2008, and Carsten Holler, whose spiralling slides scared critics in 2006.\n\nFor all her enthusiasm, Walker is wary of art galleries because she is \u201cinnately resistant\u201d to the idea that she\u2019s making art \u2013 although she admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what else it is.\u201d Although she\u2019s not allowed to reveal a huge amount about what her commission will look like, she does say: \u201cI\u2019m always kind of following some similar threads, even when I don\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\nAs Walker seems to be slowly realising, black British people do have their own extreme legacy of slavery\n\nBolanle Tajudeen \u2013 a curator and the founder of Black Blossoms, which showcases black women artists \u2013 will be holding Art in the Age of Black Girl Magic workshops at Tate, which will involve going to see Walker\u2019s commission. \u201cI can tell you one thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has water. There\u2019s something subversive about having water included in your work as a black artist, because you\u2019re obviously dealing with issues around the transatlantic slave trade.\u201d But the water can speak to today\u2019s crises as well. \u201cYou\u2019re also dealing with issues of black migrants trying to cross borders.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed, Walker suggests her new work will \u201cweave the intersections of the common themes\u201d between black Americans and black Britons. Referencing the Windrush scandal, Walker admits that, until recently, her understanding of the experiences of black people in the UK was limited.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, it always seemed a fairly advanced place to be,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be black and British and get a good education and have a good vocabulary and not have this legacy of systemic violence and educational and economic oppression. But I\u2019m speaking of a fantasy version, because [in the US] things are so extreme.\u201d However, as Walker seems to be slowly realising, black British people do have their own extreme legacy of slavery \u2013 played out in generational trauma, police brutality and overt everyday racism.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Silhouette scene \u2026 from the video entitled ... Calling to me from the angry surface of some grey and threatening sea, 2007. Photograph: Kara Walker\n\nBritain\u2019s colonial connections to the slave trade are reflected in the very name of the building housing Walker\u2019s work. Henry Tate, part owner of the sugar company Tate & Lyle, funded and provided paintings for the first Tate gallery at the end of the 19th century. In August, Tate released a statement about this on its website: \u201cWhile it is important to emphasise that Henry Tate was not a slave-owner or slave-trader, it is [\u2026] not possible to separate the Tate galleries from the history of colonial slavery from which in part they derive their existence.\u201d\n\nWith a throaty laugh, Walker tells me she is aware of this history, telling me a story about a former Tate director visiting her sugar sphinx. Indicating the work, Walker said: \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a piece for your Turbine Hall!\u201d She adopts a snooty British accent to mimic his response: \u201cWe only commission original projects.\u201d\n\nA Subtlety didn\u2019t just lead to this new commission, though \u2013 it changed Walker\u2019s life in ways she is still grappling with. She calls the sphinx, despite its size, her \u201cbaby\u201d, something she wanted to look after. \u201cWhen it was up, because it was such an unusual thing for me to have done, I wanted to be there with it. I wanted to be able to carry it around, drive it down the street, or not deal with its really uncomfortable reality.\u201d Everyone wanted a bit of it: a selfie and a chance to offload their thoughts about it in her direction. \u201cThere was one guy who was a security guard and he had two books he wanted to write based on it.\u201d\n\nSome 130,000 people walked through the doors of the old sugar factory to gape at the sphinx, with her bosom and exposed genitals \u2013 and Walker has started getting noticed in the street. She has presented Solange Knowles with an award, created the Toni Morrison memorial cover for the New Yorker and \u2013 alongside the Tate \u2013 has another big exhibition coming up in London, curated by US writer and critic Hilton Als.\n\n\u201cI feel I have way more notoriety,\u201d she says, looking up at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s died down a little bit but we were going out to galleries the other day and I was like, \u2018Oh no, I don\u2019t feel like a normal person.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what I feel. I don\u2019t quite know what version of myself I\u2019m supposed to bring.\u201d She\u2019s still figuring out how to be herself and own her achievements without \u201cbeing an asshole\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Versions of myself \u2026 Kara Walker at work earlier this year. Photograph: Ari Marcopoulos\n\nIn the late 1990s, artist Betye Saar called Walker\u2019s work \u201crevolting and negative and a form of betrayal to the slaves\u201d. Saar started a letter-writing campaign and Walker\u2019s work was even removed from some spaces. In this day and age, she might have been what is known as \u201ccancelled\u201d. Walker, who turns 50 in November, says: \u201cWhen I had that controversy in my late 20s, it was slower moving. There were some emails, faxes.\u201d Today, she says, things are so different. \u201cThe whole social media thing is so vitriolic and heated and feels so violent. I mean cancelling somebody, it\u2019s like murder. Cancelling should be cancelled.\u201d\n\nAs for the subject of slavery and caricatures, Walker says: \u201cI think what\u2019s interesting \u2013 and maybe a little bit of the trap that I set for myself \u2013 is I didn\u2019t want to be making work about slavery and I wasn\u2019t. Then I said, \u2018The only thing people want to hear from me is about slavery because, apparently, the only thing I am is black.\u2019 So I said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna take everything I do about power and desire \u2013 and use the tropes of the slave narrative or the slave romance, like the antebellum romance, as the way to talk about these themes because this is something that clearly won\u2019t go away. It will just keep being an unaddressed bugaboo in American culture.\u201d\n\nIt may have been the hangover, but there is an air of melancholy to some of Walker\u2019s answers to my questions. When I ask what the last thing was to make her really happy, she says: \u201cMade me really happy? I keep being really sad.\u201d But then she laughs and tells me about being off the beaten track in Greece earlier this summer, and finding herself at a children\u2019s play park in a tiny village, where she came across a ride made out of four plastic swans.\n\n\u201cThat ride and everything about that little theme park was so sincere and so rinky-dink and just on the edge of depression,\u201d she says, smiling again. \u201cI revere that edge.\u201d Then she seems to remember my question and spells out her philosophy: \u201cToe the line, get on the swan ride, look at the blinky lights and be happy.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kara Walker\u2019s Hyundai Commission is at Tate Modern, London, 2 October to 5 April.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Her racially-charged work has caused controversy in the US.
