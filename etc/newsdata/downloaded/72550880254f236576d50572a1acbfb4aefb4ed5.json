But Matt Whitaker, Trump\u2019s former acting attorney general, made a case for his ex-boss\u2019 innocence during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWhat evidence of a crime do you have? ... Abuse of power is not a crime,\u201d Whitaker told host Laura Ingraham.\n\n#NEW: Former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on House impeachment inquiry into Pres. Trump:\n\n\n\n\u201cAbuse of power is not a crime...the Constitution is pretty clear that this has to be some pretty egregious behavior.\u201dpic.twitter.com/WHs9Z4ksHd \u2014 Jennifer Franco (@jennfranconews) October 23, 2019\n\nWhitaker added the U.S. Constitution is \u201cvery clear that this has to be some pretty egregious behavior.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) disseminated a \u201cfact sheet\u201d on Monday detailing some of the evidence Democrats have seen showing how Trump \u2015 in Pelosi\u2019s words \u2015 \u201cbetrayed his oath of office\u201d and \u201cbetrayed the integrity of our elections for his own personal political gain\u201d in his dealings with the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe evidence cited in the document included a rough transcript of a July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president in which Trump asked Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by digging up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe transcript \u201cpaints a damning picture of Trump abusing his office by pressing a foreign government to interfere in our 2020 elections,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cAbuse of power\u201d is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of behaviors and actions, not all of them necessarily illegal. But according to legal scholars, Trump can still be impeached even if his conduct is not ultimately considered criminal.\n\nUnder the Constitution, a president can be impeached for treason and bribery, or \u201cother high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2015 a definition that is, on its own, hard to define.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to convey the idea that the person has badly flouted the terms of office. Even if he didn\u2019t commit a criminal offense, did he do something that constitutes an abuse of power?\u201d Corey Brettschneider, a political science professor at Brown University, told AP of the phrase.\n\nExperts have also pointed out that Trump could be found guilty of a crime including bribery and extortion if it\u2019s determined that he did have a quid pro quo with Ukraine \u2015 something the president has vehemently denied.\n\nSpeaking to Ingraham about the impeachment probe, Whitaker suggested President Trump was \u201cbeing punished\u201d for upsetting \u201cthe apple cart\u201d of the \u201cworld establishment.\u201d\n\nIngraham agreed with this assessment.\n\n\u201cThis is a revenge of the global elites,\u201d she said.", "description": "Speaking to Fox News, Whitaker said the president was \u201cbeing punished\u201d for upsetting \"the apple cart\u201d of the \u201cworld establishment.\u201d", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dafd9d4210000ab21ad39f5.png?cache=gbxqeeycpa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
