Tears welled up in the 25-year-old\u2019s eyes thinking back to that moment.\n\n\u201cHe just was saying I had a good year and that I had an impact on the team getting here,\u201d an emotional Hudson said. \u201cJust a little bit of nice words, I guess, to say as I was coming off.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals put up seven runs in the first inning to beat the Cardinals 7-4 in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series on Tuesday and sweep them out of the playoffs in unceremonious fashion. St. Louis was outscored 20-6 and never led at any point.\n\n\u201cWe proved - and this doesn\u2019t require advanced sabermetrics - you have to get a lead to win a game,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to do that.\u201d\n\nHours after the manager said his team \u201chas always believed in itself\u201d and will continue to do that, it was like the Cardinals forgot how to play baseball. Hudson didn\u2019t have his best stuff but was done in by a succession of baffling errors and defensive blunders from the Cardinals - the majors\u2019 best fielding team during the regular season.\n\n\u201cBaseball, man,\u201d second baseman Kolten Wong said. \u201cWhen this team is rolling like they\u2019re doing, you\u2019re trying to stop the damage, keep it close, and things like that happen.\u201d\n\nThe usually dependable Wong dropped a routine throw from third baseman Tommy Edman. Then, Wong, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and right fielder Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez converged before watching an easy flyball fall between them.\n\nMartinez said, \u201cIt just dropped.\u201d And it hurt.\n\n\u201cBoth were big plays because it allowed the inning to continue and allowed that crooked number to grow,\u201d Shildt said.\n\nAll of those plays happened in the first inning. Given their total offensive ineptitude, the Cardinals were down and out less than 20 minutes after the first pitch of the night.\n\nOf course, that continued, too. Washington starter Patrick Corbin became the first pitcher in to strike out 10 in the first four innings of a playoff game. The Cardinals pushed across three runs on two hits in the fifth and threatened in the eighth with the bases loaded but couldn\u2019t come all the way back.\n\nAdam Wainwright, who relieved Hudson, felt like this would be a repeat of Game 5 of the NLDS in 2012 when the Cardinals erased an early 6-0 deficit, then rallied in the ninth at Washington to win and move on. That didn\u2019t materialize.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve been really disappointed had we lost that game 7-0,\u201d Wainwright said. \u201cWe fought back in and had a chance to win the game.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals struck out 14 times, all swinging, totaling 48 for the series.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive time out, the Cardinals looked nothing like the team that put up 10 runs in the first inning of Game 5 of the NL Division Series at Atlanta to advance to face Washington. Leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler went 0 for 11 with six strikeouts before being benched, and Nos. 3 and 4 hitters Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna at one point combined to strike out in 10 consecutive at-bats.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one thing you can point to,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cI didn\u2019t play well enough to help us win. One hit in four games, that\u2019s not going to cut it when you\u2019re hitting third. It just came back to bite us.\u201d\n\nWhen the losses piled up, the explanation kept changing.\n\nAfter crediting Nationals starters for their wizardry through the first two games, the Cardinals lamented not having a lead after they went down quietly in Game 3. St. Louis didn\u2019t hold a lead for a single pitch of the NLCS and was swept for just the third time in franchise history.\n\n\u201cWe just give our best out there,\u201d Martinez said, \u201cand we couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Shildt took the ball from Dakota Hudson and patted him on the back of the neck.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/aptopix_nlcs_cardinals_nationals_baseball_28191_c0-119-2839-1775_s1200x700.jpg?00d2b65ca39a479e49cc8f99e595f163c88ecc1a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
